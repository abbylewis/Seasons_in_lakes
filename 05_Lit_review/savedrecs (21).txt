Both lakes are sparsely vegetated and I. bolanderi maintained aboveground oven dry weight of 30-50 m-2 through most of the 1981 summer growing season. Plants at the higher elevation Ellery Lake were half as large as plants at Siesta Lake and had substantially more biomass in corms. Titratable acidity levels in Isoetes leaves showed a diurnal fluctuation < 50 .mu.eq g-1 fresh weight [FW] early in the season at the highest elevation site but this increased to .apprx. 300 .mu.eq g-1 FW by mid-summer; starch and chlorophyll levels likewise increased in the leaves over this time. Throughout the season the magnitude of the diurnal acid change was comparable in Isoetes from both lakes but the dynamics of daytime deacidification were not. Averaged over the season, total daytime deacidification at Ellery Lake was 65% complete by noon whereas at Siesta Lake it was only 22% complete by noon. This may be related to the fact that Siesta Lake was more acidic and thus more C was in the form of free CO2. In both lakes water chemistry showed no consistent diurnal fluctuation at pH or free CO2 though total inorganic C levels were at the extreme low end for aquatic habitats. The studies reported here suggest that under extremely low inorganic C levels there may be selection for nighttime CO2 assimilation. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that emergent I. bolanderi plants, resulting from fluctuating water levels, initiated leaves with stomata (unlike adjacent submerged plants) and, although these leaves had substantially higher chlorophyll levels, they showed an order of magnitude less acid fluctuation than submerged leaves.																			0029-8549	1432-1939					1983	58	1					63	69		10.1007/BF00384543	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00384543								28310648					WOS:A1983QM48400009

The results are supported with DOC, POC, phytoplankton, temperature, salinity and oxygen data. During both March and July massive, diatom blooms were recorded with maximum values at 5 m depth. Total lipids were found at high concentrations that were similar for the samplings in two months. Total particulate lipids dominated the pool, and showed large variations from 46.37 to 369.88 mu g/l, with the highest concentration observed in the bottom anoxic layer in March. The variations for dissolved lipids were smaller and ranged from 44.82 to 124.35 mu g/l. Opposite to lipids, DOC values increased 1.5 times between the two samplings, from the value of average 0.95 mg C/l in March to the average value of 1.44 mg/l in July. Conformingly with diatom blooms, POC was found in July at high concentrations (0.28-1.50 mg C/l), contributing to total organic carbon up to 46%. The distribution of organic carbon and lipids showed the tendency of accumulation toward deeper layers. The characterization of individual lipid classes revealed the dominance of phospholipids, indicating that the lipids in the lake mainly originated from the photosynthetically active phytoplankton community, which is sustained by high production of oxygen (oxygen saturation up to 200%). Low contribution of neutral lipids in the particulate fraction points to high availability of nutrients for present phytoplankton community. Lipid breakdown indices were found at significantly higher concentrations in March compared to July. Sea surface microlayer, the hydrophobic boundary, appeared to be generally lipid depleted in comparison to the sub-surface water. Qualitative analysis of sulfolipids revealed the potential of the lake for the occurrence of chemical interaction of sulfur with present organic matter. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Development of a tundra-specific snow water equivalent retrieval algorithm for satellite passive microwave data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Airborne and satellite brightness temperature (T-B) measurements were combined with intensive field observations of sub-Arctic tundra snow cover to develop the framework for a new tundra-specific passive microwave snow water equivalent (SWE) retrieval algorithm. The dense snowpack and high sub-grid lake fraction across the tundra mean that conventional brightness temperature difference approaches (such as the commonly used 37 GHz-19 GHz) are not appropriate across the sub-Arctic. Airborne radiometer measurements (with footprint dimensions of approximately 70x120 m) acquired across sub-Arctic Canada during three field campaigns during the 2008 winter season were utilized to illustrate a slope reversal in the 37 GHz T-B versus SWE relationship. Scattering by the tundra snowpack drives a negative relationship until a threshold SWE value is reached near 130 mm at which point emission from the snowpack creates a positive but noisier relationship between 37 GHz T-B and SWE. The change from snowpack scattering to emission was also evident in the temporal evolution of 37 GHz T-B observed from satellite measurements. AMSR-E brightness temperatures (2002/03-2006/07) consistently exhibited decreases through the winter before reaching a minimum in February or March, followed by an increase for weeks or months before melt. The cumulative absolute change (Sigma vertical bar Delta 37V vertical bar) in vertically polarized 37 GHz T-B was computed at both monthly and pentad intervals from a January 1 start date and compared to ground measured SWE from intensive and regional snow survey campaigns, and climate station observations. A greater (lower) cumulative change in vertical bar Delta 37V vertical bar was significantly related to greater (lower) ground measured SWE (r(2) = 0.77 with monthly averages: r(2) = 0.67 with pentad averages). Sigma vertical bar Delta 37V vertical bar was only weakly correlated with lake fraction: monthly r(2) values calculated for January through April 2003-2007 were largely less than 0.2. These results indicate that this is a computationally straightforward and viable algorithmic framework for producing tundra-specific SWE datasets from the complete satellite passive microwave record (1979 to present).

Field and laboratory characterization of rotenone attenuation in eight lakes of the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska	CHEMOSPHERE												Rotenone is a pesticide commonly used to eradicate Northern Pike (Esox lucius), an invasive species, in Southcentral Alaska. The present work incorporates a field investigation of rotenone attenuation in eight lakes of the Kenai Peninsula, following a CFT Legumine (R) treatment in October 2018 and a laboratory simulation to determine persistence under light/dark and sterile/nonsterile conditions representative of Southcentral Alaskan winters. In the field, rotenone degraded within <60 days of application in all lakes, while rotenolone, the primary product of rotenone degradation, persisted for up to <280 days post-treatment at two locations. Prolonged rotenolone attenuation was most likely caused by short days and ice cover between October and April. This hypothesis was supported by a laboratory simulation which revealed photolysis as the dominant process driving the overall degradation of rotenone and that microbial degradation will significantly contribute in the absence of sunlight under simulated "winter" conditions of 4 degrees C. Degradation model fit comparisons (pseudo-first order, multi-parameter linear, and gamma) indicate the most accurate prediction occurred when modeling all eight lakes grouped together in a single dataset, combined and treated with pseudo-first order model kinetics, based on Akaike information criteria (AIC) scores.

The conventional pulse-limited radar altimeters have a relatively large ground footprint, which limits their capability to retrieve surface elevation information over small and medium-sized water bodies. A new generation of satellite radar altimeter system, a dual-frequency SAR radar altimeter (SRAL) onboard the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite, has produced densely sampled elevation measurements with a smaller footprint for the Earth's surfaces since June 2016, owing to the Delay-Doppler processing technique. Four standard SRAL SAR altimetry waveform retracking algorithms (known as retrackers) have been designed to retrieve elevation measurements for different types of surfaces: Ice-Sheet retracker for polar ice sheets, SAMOSA-3 retracker for open ocean and coastal zones, OCOG retracker for sea-ice margins, and Sea-Ice retracker for sea ice. In this research, we evaluated the performances of the Sentinel-3 SRAL SAR altimetry retrackers over lakes, particularly over seasonally ice-covered lakes in one hydrological cycle. For 15 lakes and reservoirs with different sizes and at varying latitudes in the northern hemisphere, we compared the lake water levels estimated by each of standard SRAL SAR retrackers against in-situ water level measurements for different seasons (a full hydrologic cycle) during 2016-2017. Our evaluation shows that Sea-Ice retracker was unable to provide continuous estimates of lake water levels, as a result of the high rate of missing data. Although the precision and relative accuracy of lake water level estimates from these three standard SRAL SAR retrackers are similar, the SAMOSA-3 retracker has the least bias in comparison with ground-based gauge measurements. When the lakes in the mid- and high-latitude regions were covered by ice in the winter season, these three standard SAR retrackers generated erroneous lake water level measurements, significantly lower than the true lake water levels recorded by in-situ gauge stations. The measurement errors of these three standard retrackers increase with the growth of the lake ice thickness. To address the negative effect of the seasonal ice cover, we developed a new bimodal correction algorithm. We demonstrate that our bimodal correction algorithm can retrieve the ice thickness and reliably estimate water levels for the ice-covered lakes in winter, hence enabling the generation of temporally consistent lake water level measurements throughout all seasons for lake hydrological analysis.

These differences are due to different large circulation systems, comprising Asian summer monsoons and mid-latitude Westerlies. However, the paleoclimate pattern at the transition zone between the two systems existing since the Late Glacial remains unclear. We present a 13,000-year high-resolution record of climate change and monsoon effects in the source region of the Yangtze River at the modern limit of the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) influence, which lies in the interaction zone with the Westerlies. Multi-proxy records-such as grain size (GS), total inorganic carbon (TIC) and element geochemistry-suggest four stages of paleoclimate change since the Late Glacial: 1) relatively cold in the Late Glacial, 2) warm-wet conditions in the early Holocene, 3) cool-dry conditions in the mid- and late Holocene and 4) a warming and wetting trend over the last 2000 years. Correspondingly, the lake experienced a shallow-water phase in the Late Glacial and a deep-lake phase during the Holocene. The cold Younger Dryas (YD) event occurred from 12.7 to 11.0 cal. kyr BP in the core, with extremely low total organic carbon (TOC) and coarse GS. In contrast, the Holocene Megathermal occurred between 10.0 and 9.1 cal. kyr BP, as recorded by the TOC maxima, which had a finer grain size. In this study, the TIC (plus the XRF-Ca and Ca/Si ratio) reflected the combined effects of biochemical processes (e.g., algal photosynthesis) and hydrological changes (e.g., precipitation, evaporation and runoff). Comparisons between regional records and reconstructed paleoclimate indexes suggested that the studied area's effective moisture pattern mostly followed fluctuations in the ISM-dominated region. The monsoonal circulation drove the paleoclimate variations on the central QTP since the Late Glacial, mainly controlled by enhanced summer insolation until the mid-Holocene. Further, the effective moisture variation was influenced by the August insolation (increased evaporation), on which the Westerlies effect (related to intensely cold air) and the meltwater runoff were later superimposed. Recently, the hydroclimatic conditions have acquired a temperate-humid status in the study area, which likely approaches that in the early Holocene's late phase. Therefore, the paleoclimate pattern of the source region of the Yangtze River exhibits a transitional nature (phase) between two circulation regions during the Holocene.					; Wang, Junbo/IVH-8446-2023; Chen, Hao/KBD-3217-2024; Zhu, Liping/AAC-4284-2022	Chen, Hao/0000-0002-3144-7660; Zhu, Liping/0000-0002-4234-8748													0031-0182	1872-616X				JUL 1	2021	573								110433	10.1016/j.palaeo.2021.110433	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2021.110433		MAY 2021											WOS:000656517500003
J	Dombrowski, I; Hensengerth, O				Dombrowski, Ines; Hensengerth, Oliver			Governing the Water-Energy-Food Nexus Related to Hydropower on Shared Rivers-The Role of Regional Organizations	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												An evolving literature on the Water-Energy-Food (WEF) nexus argues that there is a need to better understand the conditions under which nexus coordination may occur. A case in point are hydropower investments on shared rivers which might impact the provision of energy, water and food security across borders. In international basins, governing the WEF nexus impacts of hydropower relies on voluntary negotiations between the respective countries involved. It has been argued that such negotiations may be facilitated by regional organizations, such as international river basin organizations (IRBOs), but this claim has hardly been investigated systematically. Drawing on regime theory in international relations and the literature on benefit sharing, this paper asks what role regional organizations may play in governing hydropower-related WEF nexus impacts. It compares three cases of hydropower planning on shared rivers. The Rusumo Falls and the Ruzizi III hydropower projects (HPPs) are joint investments in Africa's Great Lakes region facilitated by an IRBO and a regional energy organization, respectively. On the Mekong, Laos is constructing the Xayaburi dam despite reservations by the Mekong River Commission and downstream riparians. The paper finds IRBOs and regional energy organizations may play a role in facilitating cross-border nexus governance by supporting benefit-sharing arrangements and by fostering the application of environmental and social safeguards and international law principles. However, it also shows that the influence of regional organizations varies, and how successfully they support nexus governance also depends on whether the HPP is planned unilaterally or jointly; the availability and consensus on data on nexus impacts; and the presence or absence of donors and private sector capital and investors.

This is useful as a reference to tackle how biodiversity is affected by temperature in natural conditions. Here, we addressed the thermal change during this period in a southern Baltic coastal lake (Konarzewo Lake, Poland), as inferred by chironomid remains. We evaluated changes in chironomid communities and used Hill numbers to explore how commonness and rarity underlie biodiversity changes attributable to warming. We found evidence of warming at Konarzewo Lake during the Younger Dryas-Holocene transition, with inferred temperatures in the Younger Dryas period supporting the NW-SE gradient in Younger Dryas summer temperatures across Europe. Chironomid communities drastically changed during the thermal transition. However, Hill numbers showed no response to temperature when rare morphotypes were emphasized (order q = 0) or a weak response when they were balanced with common morphotypes (order q = 1). Hill number of order q = 2, emphasizing the most common morphotypes, consistently increased with temperature across different sample sizes or coverages. This illustrates how common morphotypes, rather than the rare ones, may boost biodiversity facing warming.

The P deficiency index (PDI), which is defined as the rate of light-saturated photosynthesis (P(opt)) divided by the maximum phosphate uptake velocity (V(max)), was a superior indicator of P deficiency, despite the fact that dramatic shifts in nutrient status did not occur during the study period. Indicators containing physiological rates (orthophosphate turnover time, TT; Chl-specific total alkaline phosphatase activity, TAPA(B); and Chl-specific maximal phosphate uptake velocity, V(B)max) were also sensitive enough to show changes in the P status of algae. In contrast, indicators based on the chemical composition of the particulate matter (PN: PP, Chl-specific surplus P content, SP(B)) failed to show short-term variations in algal nutritional status. Correlations were found between PDI and TAPA(B), PDI and TT, as well as PDI and turnover time of surplus P (T(SP)). PDI ranges previously suggested to indicate different degrees of algal P deficiency were found to describe P deficiency adequately in Lake Erken.																			0024-3590					JUN	1992	37	4					890	900		10.4319/lo.1992.37.4.0890	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1992.37.4.0890													WOS:A1992JR68300017

Philip; Basso, Bruno			Phosphorus availability and leaching losses in annual and perennial cropping systems in an upper US Midwest landscape	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Excessive phosphorus (P) applications to croplands can contribute to eutrophication of surface waters through surface runoff and subsurface (leaching) losses. We analyzed leaching losses of total dissolved P (TDP) from no-till corn, hybrid poplar (Populus nigra X P. maximowiczii), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), miscanthus (Miscanthus giganteus), native grasses, and restored prairie, all planted in 2008 on former cropland in Michigan, USA. All crops except corn (13 kg P ha(-1) year(-1)) were grown without P fertilization. Biomass was harvested at the end of each growing season except for poplar. Soil water at 1.2 m depth was sampled weekly to biweekly for TDP determination during March-November 2009-2016 using tension lysimeters. Soil test P (0-25 cm depth) was measured every autumn. Soil water TDP concentrations were usually below levels where eutrophication of surface waters is frequently observed (> 0.02 mg L-1) but often higher than in deep groundwater or nearby streams and lakes. Rates of P leaching, estimated from measured concentrations and modeled drainage, did not differ statistically among cropping systems across years; 7-year cropping system means ranged from 0.035 to 0.072 kg P ha(-1) year(-1) with large interannual variation. Leached P was positively related to STP, which decreased over the 7 years in all systems. These results indicate that both P-fertilized and unfertilized cropping systems may leach legacy P from past cropland management.					hussain, mir/F-1278-2013; Hamilton, Stephen/N-2979-2014; Robertson, G./H-3885-2011; Basso, Bruno/AAF-1271-2019	Weed, David/0000-0002-4545-4992													2045-2322					OCT 13	2021	11	1							20367	10.1038/s41598-021-99877-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-99877-7								34645938					WOS:000707032500092
J	Shen, YP; Wang, GY; Wang, GX; Pu, JC; Wang, X				Shen, YongPing; Wang, GuoYa; Wang, GenXu; Pu, JianChen; Wang, Xin			Impacts of climate change on glacial water resources and hydrological cycles in the Yangtze River source region, the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China: A Progress Report	SCIENCES IN COLD AND ARID REGIONS												The Yangtze River Source Region has an area of 137,704 km(2). Its mean annual runoff of 12.52 billion m(3), which was recorded by the Chumda Hydrological Station in 1961-2000, accounts for only 0.13 percent of the Yangtze River's total annual streamflow. The extensive rivers, lakes, wetlands, glaciers, snow fields, and permafrost of the Yangtze River Source Region, as well as the region's vast alpine grasslands, play a critical role in storing and regulating the flow of water not only in the upper Yangtze River watershed of Qinghai, Sichuan, the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) (Tibet) and Yunnan, but also throughout the entire lower Yangtze River basin. Climate change has been the dominant factor in recent fluctuation in the volume of the Yangtze River Source Region's glacier resources. The Chumda Hydrological Station on the lower Tongtian River has registered a mean annual glacial meltwater of 1.13 billion m(3) for the period 1961-2000, makes up 9 percent of the total annual runoff. Glacial meltwater makes up a significant percentage of streamflow in the Yangtze River Source Region, the major rivers of the upper Yangtze River Source Region: the Togto, Dam Chu, Garchu, and Bi Chu (Bu Chu) rivers all originate at large glaciers along the Tanggula Range. Glaciers in the Yangtze River Source Region are typical continental-type glaciers with most glacial meltwater flow occurring June-August; the close correlation between June-August river flows and temperature illustrates the important role of glacial meltwater in feeding rivers. Glaciers in the source region have undergone a long period of rapid ablation beginning in 1993. Examination of flow and temperature data for the 1961-2000 period shows that the annual melting period for glacial ice, snow, and frozen ground in the Yangtze River Source Region now begins earlier because of increasing spring temperatures, resulting in the reduction of summer flood season peak runoffs; meanwhile, increased rates of glacier ablation have resulted in more uneven annual distribution of runoff in the source region. The annual glacial meltwater runoff in the Yangtze River Source Region is projected to increase by 28.5 percent by 2050 over its 1970 value with the projected temperature increase of 2 C-circle and a precipitation increase of 29 mm. As a critical source of surface water for agriculture on the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and beyond, the mass retreat of glaciers in the Yangtze River Source Region will have enormous negative impacts on farming and livestock-raising activities in upper Yangtze River watershed, as well as on the viability of present ecosystems and even socioeconomic development in the upper Yangtze River Basin.

In contrast, significantly less study has occurred in calcareous terrane that has high-buffering-capacity and that has traditionally been thought to be "insensitive" to the effects of acid rain. To address this fundamental inequity we have conducted a comprehensive study of near-surface (<1 in), historic age (<200 yr) sediments in the Finger Lakes of central New York State, a high buffering capacity area that has received significant quantities of acid rain. In particular, we have focused on authigenic calcite contained in historic bottom sediment as well as water-column geochemistry between 1972 and 1999. Results indicate that the open-water precipitation of calcite ("whitings") returned to 7 of the 11 Finger Lakes during historic time following an similar to4500 C-14 yr hiatus. Only those lakes with calcite in the near-surface sediment have calcareous soils and/or limestone outcrops in their drainage basins and summer surface waters that are supersaturated with respect to calcite. Water-column data indicate that the saturation state of summer surface waters has increased in at least seven Finger Lakes between 1972 and 1999 and that calcium loading to lakes lacking calcite has also increased over the same time interval. We hypothesize that acid rain has increased carbonate weathering in the Finger Lakes region, leading to an increase in supersaturation of summer surface waters with respect to calcite. The precipitation of calcite in summer is triggered by evaporation, temperature increase, and/or photosynthetic removal of carbon dioxide. This new "chemical weathering" hypothesis contrasts with, but is not mutually exclusive of, the traditional "cultural-eutrophication" model that suggests that increased nutrient loading, biological productivity, and CO, removal are the primary causal mechanisms for historic calcite precipitation. Stable carbon isotope and water-column geochemical data from the Finger Lakes indicate decreasing levels of primary production since at least the 1960s, and there are statistically significant correlations between CO2, SO2, and NOx emissions and calcite content of bottom sediments. Historic calcite precipitation in the Finger Lakes began as early as the 1820s, suggesting that naturally acidic rain failing on freshly deforested and tilled landscapes increased chemical weathering and brought these lakes to supersaturation. There was also a rapid increase in calcite precipitation beginning in ca. 1940 (coincident with increased industrialization and acidic rainfall associated with World War II) that continued into the 1990s. During the mid- to late 1990s, calcite precipitation decreased in the Finger Lakes following the introduction of zebra mussels. Unlike regions with low acid-neutralizing-capacity where acid rain results in the "acidification" of lakes, acidic deposition across well-buffered terrane may result in the "alkalization" of lakes.

Landscape, Soil, Lithology, Climate and Permafrost Control on Dissolved Carbon, Major and Trace Elements in the Ob River, Western Siberia	WATER												In order to foresee possible changes in the elementary composition of Arctic river waters, complex studies with extensive spatial coverage, including gradients in climate and landscape parameters, are needed. Here, we used the unique position of the Ob River, draining through the vast partially frozen peatlands of the western Siberia Lowland and encompassing a sizable gradient of climate, permafrost, vegetation, soils and Quaternary deposits, to assess a snap-shot (8-23 July 2016) concentration of all major and trace elements in the main stem (~3000 km transect from the Tom River confluence in the south to Salekhard in the north) and its 11 tributaries. During the studied period, corresponding to the end of the spring flood-summer baseflow, there was a systematic decrease, from the south to the north, of Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC), Specific Conductivity, Ca and some labile trace elements (Mo, W and U). In contrast, Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC), Fe, P, divalent metals (Mn, Ni, Cu, Co and Pb) and low mobile trace elements (Y, Nb, REEs, Ti, Zr, Hf and Th) sizably increased their concentration northward. The observed latitudinal pattern in element concentrations can be explained by progressive disconnection of groundwaters from the main river and its tributaries due to a northward increase in the permafrost coverage. A northward increase in bog versus forest coverage and an increase in DOC and Fe export enhanced the mobilization of insoluble, low mobile elements which were present in organo-ferric colloids (1 kDa-0.45 mu m), as confirmed by an in-situ dialysis size fractionation procedure. The chemical composition of the sampled mainstream and tributaries demonstrated significant (p < 0.01) control of latitude of the sampling point; permafrost coverage; proportion of bogs, lakes and floodplain coverage and lacustrine and fluvio-glacial Quaternary deposits of the watershed. This impact was mostly pronounced on DOC, Fe, P, divalent metals (Mn, Co, Ni, Cu and Pb), Rb and low mobile lithogenic trace elements (Al, Ti, Cr, Y, Zr, Nb, REEs, Hf and Th). The pH and concentrations of soluble, highly mobile elements (DIC, SO4, Ca, Sr, Ba, Mo, Sb, W and U) positively correlated with the proportion of forest, loesses, eluvial, eolian, and fluvial Quaternary deposits on the watershed. Consistent with these correlations, a Principal Component Analysis demonstrated two main factors explaining the variability of major and trace element concentration in the Ob River main stem and tributaries. The DOC, Fe, divalent metals and trivalent and tetravalent trace elements were presumably controlled by a northward increase in permafrost, floodplain, bogs, lakes and lacustrine deposits on the watersheds. The DIC and labile alkaline-earth metals, oxyanions (Mo, Sb and W) and U were impacted by southward-dominating forest coverage, loesses and eluvial and fertile soils. Assuming that climate warming in the WSL will lead to a northward shift of the forest and permafrost boundaries, a "substituting space for time " approach predicts a future increase in the concentration of DIC and labile major and trace elements and a decrease of the transport of DOC and low soluble trace metals in the form of colloids in the main stem of the Ob River. Overall, seasonally-resolved transect studies of large riverine systems of western Siberia are needed to assess the hydrochemical response of this environmentally-important territory to on-going climate change.

J	Boegman, L; Sleep, S				Boegman, Leon; Sleep, Sylvia			Feasibility of Bubble Plume Destratification of Central Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING												The central basin of Lake Erie has chronic hypoxia that is exacerbated by strong seasonal temperature stratification near the lake bed. A computational study was conducted to determine the feasibility of mechanically mixing the water column by using a bubble plume system to reduce stratification, thus facilitating vertical transport of oxygen. The most efficient design delivered an air flow rate of 0.4-0.5 m(3) s(-1) through 40-50 non-interacting plumes, which only mix the watercolumn during the late summer hypoxic events. The optimal efficiency was computed using a new metric, which neglects changes in stratification resulting from meteorologically induced mixing, relative to those from artificial mixing.

J	Novotny, EV; Stefan, HG				Novotny, Eric Vladimir; Stefan, Heinz Gunter			Projections of Chloride Concentrations in Urban Lakes Receiving Road De-icing Salt	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The chloride concentrations of urban lakes where road de-icing salt (NaCl) is used have increased to levels that can change natural lake-mixing behavior and influence aquatic life. A zero-dimensional model was formulated to project the long-term accumulation of chloride in urban lakes receiving runoff from roads on which road salt is applied. Four model parameters and an initial concentration were obtained by calibrating the model with 5 years (2004-2008) of monthly salinity data from seven lakes in the Minneapolis/St. Paul Twin Cities Metropolitan Area of Minnesota, USA. Three of the seven lakes appear headed towards year-round volume averaged chloride concentrations above the 230-mg/L chronic standard for impairment to aquatic habitat. The two lakes with the lowest projected equilibrium concentrations of chloride have already reached equilibrium. One lake is projected to take an additional 40 years to reach equilibrium under current climate conditions and current road salt application rates. If road salt application rates are reduced in future winters, it is projected that the lakes will respond with noticeably lower chloride concentrations within 5 to 10 years. If road salt applications are discontinued altogether, chloride concentrations are projected to drop to natural levels within 10 to 30 years in all seven lakes. A reduction of application rates by 50% would result in annual volumetric average chloride concentrations below the chronic standard.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				SEP	2010	211	1-4					261	271		10.1007/s11270-009-0297-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-009-0297-0													WOS:000282159200023
J	Parajulee, A; Wania, F				Parajulee, Abha; Wania, Frank			Evaluating officially reported polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emissions in the Athabasca oil sands region with a multimedia fate model	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Emissions of organic substances with potential toxicity to humans and the environment are a major concern surrounding the rapid industrial development in the Athabasca oil sands region (AOSR). Although concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in some environmental samples have been reported, a comprehensive picture of organic contaminant sources, pathways, and sinks within the AOSR has yet to be elucidated. We sought to use a dynamic multimedia environmental fate model to reconcile the emissions and residue levels reported for three representative PAHs in the AOSR. Data describing emissions to air compiled from two official sources result in simulated concentrations in air, soil, water, and foliage that tend to fall close to or below the minimum measured concentrations of phenanthrene, pyrene, and benzo(a) pyrene in the environment. Accounting for evaporative emissions (e. g., from tailings pond disposal) provides a more realistic representation of PAH distribution in the AOSR. Such indirect emissions to air were found to be a greater contributor of PAHs to the AOSR atmosphere relative to reported direct emissions to air. The indirect pathway transporting uncontrolled releases of PAHs to aquatic systems via the atmosphere may be as significant a contributor of PAHs to aquatic systems as other supply pathways. Emission density estimates for the three PAHs that account for tailings pond disposal are much closer to estimated global averages than estimates based on the available emissions datasets, which fall close to the global minima. Our results highlight the need for improved accounting of PAH emissions from oil sands operations, especially in light of continued expansion of these operations.

The J2000 was examined to investigate the influence on model performance, as well as on data, parameters and sensitivities. The model was calibrated with time series of discharge at the basin outlet for the summers of 2006 and 2007 and validated for the summer of 2008 by examining multiple objective functions. The model coefficients of determination were 0.62 and 0.91 for the calibration periods in 2006 and 2007, respectively, and 0.56 for the validation period in 2008. Simulated discharge was generally less than the observed values for the calibration and validation periods. The sensitivity to alteration in meteorological parameter has revealed that a change in air temperature would cause a dramatic increase of discharge in the Qugaqie catchment. Hypothetical climate scenario experiments showed that the increase of air temperature by 1A degrees C resulted in 14% increase in runoff, whereas 20% increase in precipitation caused 9% increase in runoff but 12% reduction in glacier melt.

CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE												Boreal plant communities are strongly nutrient limited, and the animals of the boreal forest may therefore experience bottom-up nutrient limitation. We conducted a 5-year experimental study of the impact of aerial nitrogen fertilization on birds of the boreal forest near Kluane Lake, southwestern Yukon, to test for such bottom-up effects. Specifically, we tested if avian abundance and species richness increased after fertilization. Variable circular-plot point counts were made to estimate bird numbers and species richness each summer from 1988 to 1992. Fertilization had no effect on abundance for the first two summers, but total abundances of the seven commonest passerine bird species increased by an average of 46% over the final 3 years. Fertilization had no effect on bird species richness. Population densities and species richness were both low at Kluane compared with patterns seen in temperate forest. Yellow-rumped warblers (Dendroica coronata), dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyernalis), and Swainson's thrushes (Catharus ustulatus) dominated the passerine community at Kluane. There was only moderate spatial and temporal variation in songbird numbers on control plots over the 5-year study period.																			0008-4301					DEC	1995	73	12					2231	2237		10.1139/z95-264	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z95-264													WOS:A1995TU23900008

Shoal Bass are vulnerable to extinction as a result of population fragmentation and introduction of nonnative Micropterus species. We assessed the genetic integrity of four isolated populations of Shoal Bass in the upper Chattahoochee River basin (above Lake Lanier, in Big Creek, below Morgan Falls Dam, and at Cochran Shoals) and sought to determine rates of hybridization with nonnative, illegally stocked Smallmouth Bass M. dolomieu and Alabama Bass M. henshalli. Collected specimens were evaluated using 10 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers and Bayesian population assignment software. Shoal Bass below Morgan Falls Dam exhibited high levels of hybridization with Smallmouth Bass and possibly Alabama Bass, coupled with a high incidence of the nonnative parental forms. Rates of hybridization among specimens from Cochran Shoals were similarly high, although fewer nonnative parental forms were observed. Among the 30 tested, three specimens morphologically identified as Shoal Bass in Big Creek were either pure Smallmouth Bass or hybrids of Shoal Bass and Smallmouth Bass. The only Shoal Bass population not significantly impacted by congeneric hybridization was found upstream of Lake Lanier. Conservation actions aimed at reducing or eliminating nonnative black bass species and their hybrids could maintain the genetic integrity of Shoal Bass populations in the upper Chattahoochee River basin and lessen their risk of extirpation.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-40-0				2015	82						491	501																WOS:000352823400038

To accurately identify the boundary of the surface watershed and groundwater basin is the basis for properly understanding hydrologic cycle and conducting the water balance analysis at watershed scale in complicated geologic structure area, especially when the boundary are inconsistent. In this study, the Dalinuoer Lake located in the middle of the Inner Mongolian Plateau which has complicated geologic structure was selected as the representative case. Based on the multidisciplinary comprehensive analysis of topography, tectonics, hydrogeology, groundwater dynamics and stable isotopes, the results suggest the following: (1) The surface watershed ridge and groundwater basin divide of Dalinuoer Lake are inconsistent. The surface watershed was divided into two separate groundwater systems almost having no groundwater exchange by the SW-NE Haoluku Anticlinorium Fault which has obvious water-blocking effect. The surface drainage area of Dalinuoer Lake is 6139 km(2). The northern regional A is the Dalinuoer Lake groundwater system with an area of 4838 km(2), and the southern regional B is the Xilamulun Riverhead groundwater system with an area of 1301 km(2). (2) The groundwater in the southern of regional A and the spring-feeding river are the important recharge sources for the Dalinuoer Lake, and it has greater recharge effects than the northern Gonggeer River system. (3) It is speculated that the trend of Haoluku Anticlinorium Fault is the boundary of the westerlies and the East Asian summer Monsoon (EASM) climate systems, which further pinpoints the predecessor's understanding of this boundary line. At present, the Dalinuoer Lake watershed is proved to have gone through a prominent warming-drying trend periods, which leads to the precipitation reduction, temperature rise, human activities water usage increasement. So the hydrological cycle and lake eco-environment at watershed scale will still bound to be change, which may pose the potential deterioration risk on the suitability of fish habitat. The results can provide basic support for better understanding water balance evolution and lake area shrinkage cause as well as the ecological protection and restoration implementation of Dalinuoer Lake watershed.

In this study, we examined the effect of the Japanese smelt (Hypomesus nipponensis) invasion on the fish assemblage in Lake Erhai, a subtropical plateau lake in southwestern China. Through cluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), we found a significant fish assemblage shift: the population of sharpbelly (Hemiculter leucisculus) fell by 67% in catch per unit effort (CPUE) from 2.262 to 0.741; topmouth gudgeon (Pseudorasbora parva) fell by 52% from 0.61 to 0.29; and icefish (Neosalanx taihuensis) plummeted by 88% from 0.736 to 0.088. Meanwhile, the numbers for crucian carp (Carassius auratus) improved by almost 185% from 1.82 to 3.36. A Pearson correlation analysis showed that these four species significantly correlated with the invasion of the Japanese smelt: sharpbelly (-0.71), topmouth gudgeon (-0.71), icefish (-0.62), and crucian carp (0.81). This study documented the expansion of invasive fish and their effects on native species over time, thus providing a case study of invasive fish as well as a theoretical basis for further research into interspecies interactions.					; yin, chengjie/C-4162-2018	Yin, Chengjie/0000-0002-0762-898X; yin, chengjie/0000-0002-2318-8486														2073-4441				JUL	2021	13	13							1800	10.3390/w13131800	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13131800													WOS:000671170000001

The growth of diatoms (Diatoma elongatum, Fragilaria crotonensis) and of Cyanophytes (Oscillatoria bourrellyi, Anabaena sp.) was inhibited in the presence of the cell extract. Chlorophytes (Pediastrum duplex, Dictyosphaerium pulchellum, Staurastrum sp.) were not susceptible to it. This activity is attributed to the presence of allelopathic substances in the cell extract of O. rubescens.

J	Kjellman, SE; Thomas, EK; Schomacker, A				Kjellman, Sofia E.; Thomas, Elizabeth K.; Schomacker, Anders			Arctic and sub-Arctic lake water δ2 H and δ18 O along a coastal-inland transect: Implications for interpreting water isotope proxy records	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												High-latitude lakes are sensitive to climate change and store information about large-scale circulation changes and catchment-integrated processes. Lakes are mainly recharged by meteoric water, meaning that some lake sediment proxies may indirectly archive the stable isotopic composition of hydrogen (delta H-2) and oxygen (delta O-18) of past precipitation. Yet, despite similar precipitation input, lakes within a region may exhibit a wide range of isotopic values due to the varying influence of inflow seasonality and evaporation. Moreover, the relative sensitivity of each lake to these controls may vary through time, something that is difficult to account for. Here, we evaluate the impact of variable inflow delta H-2 and evaporation on the lake water isotopic composition across northern Fennoscandia (Norway, Finland, and Sweden). We measured lake water delta H-2 and delta O-18 of 135 lakes spanning from the north Norwegian coast along a 460 km transect to the Bothnian Bay, sampled from 2018 to 2020. Our data show that both coastal and inland lakes are sensitive to distillation during moisture transport, and that lakes farther from the Atlantic Ocean are additionally impacted by evaporation. We estimated the isotopic composition of lake water inflow values for evapo-concentrated transect lakes (delta H-2(I)) using a Bayesian method. Resampled transect lakes had more depleted delta H-2(I) in 2020 than in 2019, indicating either that precipitation was H-2-depleted or that more winter precipitation contributed inflow to the lakes in 2020 compared to in 2019. We suggest that the more & nbsp;H-2-depleted values in 2020 were a response to a snow-rich winter, associated with extremely positive Arctic Oscillation (AO+) conditions and increased moisture supply from the North Atlantic. We find evidence that lake water isotopic variability in this region reflects a combination of seasonal precipitation changes associated with atmospheric circulation changes, and catchment-integrated evaporation.

Genomic and physiological characterization and description of Marinobacter gelidimuriae sp nov., a psychrophilic, moderate halophile from Blood Falls, an antarctic subglacial brine	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Antarctic subice environments are diverse, underexplored microbial habitats. Here, we describe the ecophysiology and annotated genome of a Marinobacter strain isolated from a cold, saline, iron-rich subglacial outflow of the Taylor Glacier, Antarctica. This strain (BF04_CF4) grows fastest at neutral pH (range 6-10), is psychrophilic (range: 0 degrees C-20 degrees C), moderately halophilic (range: 0.8%-15% NaCl) and hosts genes encoding potential low temperature and high salt adaptations. The predicted proteome suggests it utilizes fewer charged amino acids than a mesophilic Marinobacter strain. BF04_CF4 has increased concentrations of membrane unsaturated fatty acids including palmitoleic (33%) and oleic (27.5%) acids that may help maintain cell membrane fluidity at low temperatures. The genome encodes proteins for compatible solute biosynthesis and transport, which are known to be important for growth in saline environments. Physiological verification of predicted metabolic functions demonstrate BF04_CF4 is capable of denitrification and may facilitate iron oxidation. Our data indicate that strain BF04_CF4 represents a new Marinobacter species, Marinobacter gelidimuriae sp. nov., that appears well suited for the subglacial environment it was isolated from. Marinobacter species have been isolated from other cold, saline environments in the McMurdo Dry Valleys and permanently cold environments globally suggesting that this lineage is cosmopolitan and ecologically relevant in icy brines.

Here, we presented a detailed study on the seasonal, spatial, and vertical variations of calcium and magnesium species in the overlying water, interstitial water, and sediment profiles in eutrophic Taihu Lake under the circumstance of regional acid deposition. The result showed that both the acid deposition and biomineralization in Taihu Lake had effects on Ca and Mg species. In the lake water, calcium carbonate was saturated or over-saturated based on long-term statistical calculation of the saturation index (SI). On the sediment profiles, significant difference in Ca and Mg species existed between the surface sediment (0-10 cm) and deeper sediments (> 10 cm). The interstitial water Ca2+ and Mg2+, ion-exchangeable Ca and Mg in the surface sediment were higher than those in the deeper sediment. In the spring, when the acid deposition is more intensive, the acid-extracted Ca and Mg in the surface sediment were lower than that in the deeper sediment in the northwest lake, due to carbonate dissolution caused by the regional acid deposition. Spatially, the higher concentration of acid-extracted Ca and Mg in the northwest surface sediment than that in the east lake was observed, indicating the pronounced carbonate biomineralization by algae bloom in the northwest lake. Statistical analysis showed that acid deposition exerted a stronger impact on the variation of acid-extracted Ca and Mg in the surface sediment than the biomineralization in Taihu Lake. For the total Ca and Mg concentration in the spring, however, no significant change between the surface and deeper sediment in the northwest lake was observed, indicating that the carbonate precipitation via biomineralization and the carbonate dissolution due to acidic deposition were in a dynamic balance. These features are of major importance for the understanding of combined effects of acid deposition and eutrophication on freshwater lakes.

It is sensitive to the impacts of climate change and anthropogenic pressure. Carbon cycling on the TP is influenced by glaciation and degradation of the pasture ecosystem. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) connects carbon reservoirs, following the hydrological continuum from glaciers and headwaters to lakes. Due to its complexity, DOM cycling along the aquatic continuum and the impact of land use and climate change on DOM characteristics are still not well understood. Here, we study solid phase extracted (SPE) DOM molecular characteristics using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) along the TP hydrological continuum from glaciers, groundwater springs, and wetlands, including pastures and alpine steppes, to the endorheic Lake Nam Co. Our study revealed that the SPE-DOM composition was largely influenced by local sources of glaciers, wetlands, and groundwater springs as well as pasture degradation. Glacial meltwater SPE-DOM contained more saturated compounds suggesting microbial sources together with aromatic compounds probably derived from aeolian deposition. In comparison, wetland and stream SPE-DOM were characterised by a higher percentage of highly unsaturated and aromatic molecular formulae. These were likely derived from inputs of vascular plants and soils. Groundwater spring SPE-DOM from degraded pastures differed from intact pasture samples. In degraded systems a strongly oxidised signature with the lowest counts of P heteroatoms, a lower O/C ratio, and a higher aromaticity of SPE-DOM together with a high degradation index suggested a strong transformation of SPE-DOM. SPE-DOM of the endorheic lake was richer in unsaturated molecular formulae compared to the tributaries. This suggests algae and microbial sources and production in the lake. The SPE-DOM rich in aromatic and highly unsaturated formulae visible in the brackish zone of the lake shore contrasted sharply with that of the lake. Aromatic molecular formulae were strongly depleted in the lake deep water suggesting photooxidation of riverine SPE-DOM. This indicates that alpine SPE-DOM signatures are shaped by small-scale catchment properties, land degradation, and the influence of glaciers and wetlands. The close link of alpine SPE-DOM composition to landscape properties is indicative of a strong susceptibility of DOM characteristics to climatic and land use changes in High Asia.					; Dittmar, Thorsten/L-7796-2013; Guggenberger, Georg/C-8423-2013; Maurischat, Philipp/AAC-9153-2022	Guggenberger, Georg/0000-0002-6962-8264; Maurischat, Philipp/0000-0002-4352-0386; Seidel, Michael/0000-0003-0934-1939; 													1726-4170	1726-4189				JUL 27	2023	20	14					3011	3026		10.5194/bg-20-3011-2023	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-3011-2023													WOS:001037770100001

Determining Ice Pressure Distribution on a Stiffened Panel Using Orthotropic Plate Inverse Theory	JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING												Inverse algorithms are presented for calculating the variable pressure acting on a stiffened steel plate. The analytical models are formulated to calculate the quasi-static pressure caused by contact of lake ice driven primarily by thermal expansion and winds. Loading pressures are calculated using strain measurements from a stiffened plate installed on a Keweenaw Peninsula lighthouse in Lake Superior. The ice sheet was essentially stationary through the winter months. The linear relationships between pressure and strain values are obtained by both strip beam theory and orthotropic plate theory. Because the inverse solutions are not necessarily unique, multiple approaches are developed and compared. Fourier pressure terms are calculated from the strain measurements using the inverse orthotropic plate theory algorithms. Two of the approaches are applied using orthotropic plate theory to reflect the variability of the ice: the first submodel presumes the pressure acts over the entire plate; the second submodel presumes the pressure acts only within the depth of the measured ice thickness. Favorable comparisons are made of results determined from orthotropic plate theory to results from finite-element (FE) analyses. A truncated singular value expansion (TSVE) method is applied to retain the robustness of the inverse process for the second submodel. Both inverse approaches show results with satisfying accuracy and efficiency compared to the FE analysis. In addition, laboratory calibration and an examination using the recorded data from field measurements exhibit the effectiveness of the presented approach. Inverse strip beam theory and the inverse orthotropic methods are applied for the evaluations. Through the recorded winter season 2013-2014, the peak ice pressures calculated by the inverse orthotropic plate theories are in the range of 3.5 MPa for the local contact ice pressures and a maximum of 3.0 MPa for the average ice pressures over the entire plate.

Saharan dust has been proposed to be the main mineral source that fertilizes the Amazon basin, generating a dependence of the health and productivity of the rain forest on dust supply from the Sahara. Here we show that about half of the annual dust supply to the Amazon basin is emitted from a single source: the Bodele depression located northeast of Lake Chad, approximately 0.5% of the size of the Amazon or 0.2% of the Sahara. Placed in a narrow path between two mountain chains that direct and accelerate the surface winds over the depression, the Bodele emits dust on 40% of the winter days, averaging more than 0.7 million tons of dust per day.

Structural geology and lithology underpin landscapes from Killiniq to the Strait of Belle Isle. In central and southern Labrador, extending to the northernmost Northern Peninsula, glacial features are related to MIS 2 Laurentide glaciation. Local glaciation influenced the distinctive landscapes of Torngat Mountains National Park, and Mealy Mountains (Akami-UapishkU; KakKasuak) National Park Reserve. Postglacial relative sea levels vary from less than 20 m to more than 170 m asl. Relative sea level history varies from falling through rising episodes, reflecting differing glaci-isostatic regimes. Currently, relative sea level is falling along Lake Melville, but rising in central and southern Labrador and along the Northern Peninsula. Since the initial occupation in the early Holocene, through indigenous settlement and Viking visits, to modern times, geomorphology has been a dominant influence on human activity along the coastline.																			2213-2090	2213-2104	978-3-030-35137-3; 978-3-030-35135-9				2020							179	210		10.1007/978-3-030-35137-3_7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-35137-3_7	10.1007/978-3-030-35137-3												WOS:000811255300009
J	Monk, CT; Aslak, U; Brockmann, D; Arlinghaus, R				Monk, Christopher T.; Aslak, Ulf; Brockmann, Dirk; Arlinghaus, Robert			Rhythm of relationships in a social fish over the course of a full year in the wild	MOVEMENT ECOLOGY												BackgroundAnimals are expected to adjust their social behaviour to cope with challenges in their environment. Therefore, for fish populations in temperate regions with seasonal and daily environmental oscillations, characteristic rhythms of social relationships should be pronounced. To date, most research concerning fish social networks and biorhythms has occurred in artificial laboratory environments or over confined temporal scales of days to weeks. Little is known about the social networks of wild, freely roaming fish, including how seasonal and diurnal rhythms modulate social networks over the course of a full year. The advent of high-resolution acoustic telemetry enables us to quantify detailed social interactions in the wild over time-scales sufficient to examine seasonal rhythms at whole-ecosystems scales. Our objective was to explore the rhythms of social interactions in a social fish population at various time-scales over one full year in the wild by examining high-resolution snapshots of a dynamic social network.MethodsTo that end, we tracked the behaviour of 36 adult common carp, Cyprinus carpio, in a 25 ha lake and constructed temporal social networks among individuals across various time-scales, where social interactions were defined by proximity. We compared the network structure to a temporally shuffled null model to examine the importance of social attraction, and checked for persistent characteristic groups over time.ResultsThe clustering within the carp social network tended to be more pronounced during daytime than nighttime throughout the year. Social attraction, particularly during daytime, was a key driver for interactions. Shoaling behavior substantially increased during daytime in the wintertime, whereas in summer carp interacted less frequently, but the interaction duration increased. Therefore, smaller, characteristic groups were more common in the summer months and during nighttime, where the social memory of carp lasted up to two weeks.ConclusionsWe conclude that social relationships of carp change diurnally and seasonally. These patterns were likely driven by predator avoidance, seasonal shifts in lake temperature, visibility, forage availability and the presence of anoxic zones. The techniques we employed can be applied generally to high-resolution biotelemetry data to reveal social structures across other fish species at ecologically realistic scales.

Lake Tahoe is the second deepest lake in the US and an iconic oligotrophic subalpine lake with remarkable transparency. It has experienced offshore cultural eutrophication since the 1960s with observations of nuisance nearshore algal growth since the mid 2000s attributed to anthropogenic stressors. Samplings from November 2019-September 2020 provide useful snapshots against which older monitoring may be contextualized. A voucher flora, complete with descriptions, photo-documentation and referencing to species concepts employed, was created as a method of providing reproducible identification and enumeration of algal species, and more seamless reconciliation of detailed taxonomic data with future monitoring projects. The eulittoral zone (0-2 m) is seasonally dominated by elongate araphid (Synedra, Ulnaria) and stalked or entubed diatoms (Gomphonema, Cymbella, Encyonema). The sublittoral zone (>2 m) is dominated by a nitrogen-fixing Epithemia-cyanobacteria assemblage with less seasonal changes in dominance and composition that expanded to impinge on the 2 m depths of the eulittoral zone in the Fall. Sublittoral epipsammic samples, despite their proximity to rocks, had a very distinct diatom composition and high species dominance, similar to what was seen in the Fall eulittoral samples, with high numbers of Staurosirella chains and small biraphid diatoms. The deeper samples at 30 and 50 m contained high numbers of live Epithemia, and indicate a thriving sublittoral assemblage at these greater depths, but with less biomass. The 2019-20 data show many of the same diatom taxa observed in the 1970's and 1980's but with changes in species dominance. Notably, there was less of the green alga Mougeotia, when compared to the 1970's data, and a higher dominance by nitrogen fixing Epithemia in the sublittoral zone, persisting year-round. These new data show roughly double the algal species biodiversity that had been documented previously in the Lake Tahoe nearshore, and is largely attributed to the methods employed. Adopting these new methods in future monitoring efforts should improve harmonization of taxonomic data and help advance our knowledge of the contributions to nearshore cultural eutrophication.					; Seitz, Carina/HAX-3738-2022	Seitz, Carina/0000-0001-7985-3724; 													2296-701X					JAN 20	2023	10								1053499	10.3389/fevo.2022.1053499	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2022.1053499								38152478					WOS:000924795000001

It was found that Great Lakes ice cover has 1) a linear relationship with the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO), similar to the relationship of lake ice cover with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), but with stronger impact than NAO; 2) a quadratic relationship with the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), which is similar to the relationship of lake ice cover to Nino-3.4, but with opposite curvature; and 3) decadal variability with a positive (warming) trend in AMO contributes to the decreasing trend in lake ice cover. Composite analyses show that during the positive (negative) phase of AMO, the Great Lakes experience a warm (cold) anomaly in surface air temperature (SAT) and lake surface temperature (LST), leading to less (more) ice cover. During the positive (negative) phase of PDO, the Great Lakes experience a cold (warm) anomaly in SAT and LST, leading to more (less) ice cover. Based on these statistical relationships, the original multiple variable regression model established using the indices of NAO and Nino-3.4 only was improved by adding both AMO and PDO, as well as their interference (interacting or competing) mechanism. With the AMO and PDO added, the correlation between the model and observation increases to 0.69, compared to 0.48 using NAO and Nino-3.4 only. When November lake surface temperature was further added to the regression model, the prediction skill of the coming winter ice cover increased even more.

Bacteria were isolated from 22 spent females. The kidneys of two females contained no bacteria, and no eggs survived from the spawn of these two fish. All kidneys sampled appeared normal with no gross abnormalities. Twelve bacteria genera were isolated and identified to the genus level: Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Brevundimonas, Chryseobacterium, Flavobacterium, Acidovorax, Arthrobacter, Deinococcus, Enterococcus, Leucobacter, Micrococcus, and Oerskovia. Screening for Renibacterium salmoninarum was not conducted. Colony forming units (CFU) per gram ranged from 0 to 10,542. There were no significant correlations between egg survival and CFU from samples incubated on agar containing either R2A or Coomassie Brilliant Blue. In addition, no relationship was observed between any of the bacterial species isolated and egg survival to the eyed stage. Bacteria present in the kidneys of this specific population of Chinook Salmon do not appear to have any effect on female condition or subsequent egg survival, although several potentially pathogenic bacteria genera were isolated.																			1522-2055	1548-8454				JAN	2016	78	1					57	63		10.1080/15222055.2015.1094160	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15222055.2015.1094160													WOS:000369514900008

New fossil discoveries and stratigraphic descriptions in the Sable Mountain area allow for refined paleoenvironmental reconstructions and age interpretations. The formation consists of well-indurated conglomerate, sandstone, siltstone, and shale interpreted as gravelly and sandy channel, levee, crevasse splay, sheetflood, lacustrine, and floodplain sediments with interspersed debris flows. The overall depositional environment is interpreted as a braided river floodplain that interfingered with distal alluvial fan sedimentation. Plant fossils include leaves, branches, cones and rare seeds of taxodiaceous and other conifer taxa, fern fronds, rhizomes and stem segments of Equisetites, linear and broad-lanceolate monocot leaf fragments, cf. Kenella, and impressions of diverse angiosperm broad-leaf morphotypes likely belonging to menispermoid, platanoid and several Late Cretaceous hamamelid groups. A sparse palynoflora extracted from the finer-grained facies yielded the pollen taxa Taxodiaceaepollenites, Aquilapollenites and Alnipollenites; monosulcate cycadophyte or ginkgophyte pollen grains: bisaccate and monosaccate conifer pollen grains and a variety of trilete fern and psilate horsetail spores. The Middle to late Maastrichtian pollen taxon Aquilapollenites conatus provides a maximum age for the Sable Mountain deposits. Floral assemblages occur within distinct lithofacies deposited in a variety of depositional settings in the ancient floodplain. Angiosperm leaf fossils are dominant in channel and levee facies and were part of a mixed forest assemblage growing in floodplain and lake margin environments. A variety of different types of conifers indicated by saccate pollen types and rare long, thin leaf fragments probably inhabited distal floodplain realms and uplands. Frequent and abrupt changes in lithology and floral assemblages imply transitory habitats in a rapidly aggrading depositional setting. A Climate Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program (CLAMP) applied to a composite leaf collection yielded a mean annual temperature of 7.42 +/- 1.2 degrees C, a warmest monthly mean of 17.1 +/- 1.6 degrees C, and a coldest monthly mean of 2.3 +/- 1.9 degrees C. Growing season precipitation is estimated at 229.4 +/- 334.5 mm over 4.8 +/- 0.7 months. Results are suggestive of a cool temperate and highly seasonal paleoclimate with short, warm, dry summers and long, comparatively mild and probably wet winters. Temperature calculations are consistent with previous estimates from Alaska's North Slope and northeastern Russia suggesting a low polar temperature gradient and a slight cooling trend during the Middle to early Late Maastrichtian. Precipitation estimates for the growing season are low compared to overall wet climate predictions for the Maastrichtian. Like other Late Cretaceous Arctic floras the Cantwell flora is classified herein as a Polar Broad-leaved Deciduous Forest flora. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The projected loss of habitat varied among approaches, but all methods indicated a noticeable loss of habitat for even minor increases in temperature. An approach based on the use of summer air temperatures to define the thermal limits of cold water species estimated a loss of 9-76% of the present geographic range for temperature increases of 1-5 degrees C. A second approach, also based on air temperature limits, projected a loss of 7-64% of the stream distance currently having thermally suitable habitat for cold water fish for temperature increases of 1-5 degrees C. A third approach, based on the use of summer water temperatures to define the thermal limits of cold water species, projected a loss of 16-69% of the stream distance currently having thermally suitable habitat for temperature increases of 1-5 degrees C. In addition to habitat loss, population fragmentation would occur as remaining enclaves of cold water fish are forced to retreat to increasingly isolated headwater stream reaches.																			0024-3590					JUL	1996	41	5					1116	1123		10.4319/lo.1996.41.5.1116	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1996.41.5.1116													WOS:A1996VN45800035

Highest chlorophyll and cyanobacteria levels were observed in the tidal freshwater segment, particularly during dry summers when freshwater replacement time was long. Cyanobacteria accounted for a small proportion of phytoplankton biomass (7-15%), and Microcystis comprised a small proportion of the cyanobacteria (<1%). Despite this, measureable levels of microcystin were commonly observed in water (>85% of samples in July, August and September), fish tissues (87% of planktivorous fishes) and shellfish (83% of individuals). Generic indicators of algal blooms (chlorophyll and algal biomass) had limited utility for predicting microcystin concentrations. However, chlorophyll was found to be a useful predictor for the probability of exceeding specific toxin thresholds. Tissue microcystin concentrations were highest in fish and shellfish collected from the tidal fresh segment, but were detectable in biota collected from the oligohaline at distances 50 km seaward.

In this study, we investigate the in situ temporal dynamics of ALNs during 1 year in 3 different lakes, in relation to the physico-chemical and biological environment. ALN abundances in investigated lakes showed a marked seasonal dynamic (from no detectable to 4.28 +/- 0.75 x 10(6) ALNs mL(-1)), with characteristic peaks in spring. We recorded a correlation between ALNs and some prokaryotic phyla suggesting a broad and non-specific relationship. From their seasonal dynamics and potential link with prokaryotes, we conclude that ALNs represent an important ecological actor in the functioning of aquatic ecosystems.

Being a mountainous region, the peo-ple living in HKH are highly susceptible to the adverse impacts induced by climate change. This paper therefore mainly focused on monitoring snow cover changes in district Chitral using USGS satellite images (Landsat5-TM, Landsat7-ETM+, and Landsat8-OLI) for the years 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016. The maximum likelihood method was used for Land Use Land Cover (LULC) classification. For a better understanding of the pattern of seasonal variation in snow cover over time, the total study period was distributed in four quadrennials, and the dataset for each period was taken only for early winter (Oct-Nov). A marked increase (266.7%) in the built-up area and 135.9 km2 of agriculture expansion in this remote and mountainous area is quite sig-nificant. Results of the current study showed that in the year 2000, more than half (51.6%) of the total land of District Chitral was covered with snow in early winter, but it drastically decreased to only 6.8% in the year 2008. During the first two quadrennials, 44.7% (5694.6 km2) of glaciated area exposed the barren rocks, while the overall changes in snow-cover areas are approximately 43.3% (5514.6 km2). The most significant impact of melting snow and glaciers is Glacial Lakes Outburst Floods (GLOFs). GLOFs may cause human deaths and injuries, while these are also a threat to agricultural land, forest, and residential areas. Based on the current study, it is recom-mended to enhance institutional capacity in the country to face different environmental hazards, including early warning systems on the local scale. Keeping in view the water stress and based agriculture-based economy of Pakistan, proper analysis and monitoring of snow should be carried out for the sack of water availability, drought or floods, and other environmental vulnerabilities.

Mark			Temporal and spatial differences in smolting among Oncorhynchus nerka populations throughout fresh and seawater migration	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY					10th International Workshop on Salmon Smoltification	AUG 14-18, 2017	Univ Bergen, Bergen, NORWAY		Univ Bergen			Physiological changes that occur in the spring are preparatory for salmonid smolts to successfully enter seawater, but variation is likely to exist within species with a wide geographic distribution. Whether differences in development of seawater tolerance exist among populations that differ in distance to the ocean, temporally during the spring, or as fish migrate downstream is not known. Juvenile sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka from four regions in the Fraser River catchment, British Columbia, were intercepted to assess physiological differences among populations and at different times during migration to characterize the parr-smolt transformation. Pre-migratory fish had low levels of gill Na+-K+-ATPase (NKA) activity. High gill NKA activities were observed at the start of migration for some populations, but smolts leaving the lake did not consistently have higher gill NKA activity than non-migratory juvenile O. nerka sampled in their natal lakes. Gill NKA activity was highly variable at the start of migration with no relationship with distance from the ocean. Gill NKA activity changes with migration were also highly variable, but consistently smolts in the ocean had the highest enzyme activities. Internal and external factors may influence this variation, but the dynamic nature of smolting was not based on the region of origin, timing during migration or on the year of migration.																			0022-1112	1095-8649				SEP	2018	93	3			SI		510	518		10.1111/jfb.13678	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.13678								29882588					WOS:000445730700010

Based on the Web of Science (WoS) database, we applied a combination of three different search queries for retrieving the relevant literature: (1) on the decline and fall of the Roman Empire in general, (2) more specifically on the downfall in connection with a changing climate, and (3) on paleoclimatic research in combination with the time period of the Roman Empire and Late Antiquity. Additionally, we considered all references cited by an ensemble of selected key papers and all citing papers of these key papers, whereby we retrieved additional publications (in particular, books and book chapters). We merged the literature retrieved, receiving a final publication set of 85 publications. We analyzed this publication set by applying a toolset of bibliometric methods and visualization programs. A co-authorship map of all authors, a keyword map for a rough content analysis, and a citation network based on the publication set of 85 papers are presented. We also considered news mentions in this study to identify papers with impacts beyond science. According to the literature retrieved, a multitude of paleoclimatic data from various geographical sites for the time of late antiquity indicate a climatic shift away from the stability of previous centuries. Recently, some scholars have argued that drought in Central Asia and the onset of a cooler climate in North-West Eurasia may have put Germanic tribes, Goths, and Huns on the move into the Roman Empire, provoking the Migration Period and eventually leading to the downfall of the Western Roman Empire. However, climate is only one variable at play; a combination of many factors interacting with each other is a possible explanation for the pattern of long-lasting decline and final collapse. Currently, the number of records from different locations, the toolbox of suitable analytic methods, and the precision of dating are evolving rapidly, contributing to an answer for one of the most classic of all historical questions. However, these studies still lack the inevitable collaboration of the major disciplines involved: archeology, history, and climatology. The articles of the publication set analyzed mainly result from research in the geosciences.

Quantification of mRNA has been done with real-time PCR and expressed as whole body or pituitary contents depending the body size of fry. PRL mRNA levels of ayu caught in seawater of the coastal area remained low during early spring. Prior to the start of the upstream migration, the fish caught in the coastal area in mid spring showed increased levels of PRL mRNA. There were further increases in PRL levels in the fish caught in the river. Analysis of proportions revealed that there were significant differences among PRL mRNA in the fish caught in different environmental salinities. Body weight showed a positive relation with PRL mRNA in ayu caught in seawater. A landlocked population of ayu, which migrates from lake to river, showed no significant change in PRL mRNA levels before and after upstream migration. Results in this study indicate the importance of up-regulation of PRL gene expression of ayu during the upstream migration from seawater to fresh water. There is a possible relationship between body size and PRL in the early developmental stage of ayu in seawater, but not in the fish in fresh water.

Our principal finding is that the uplifting effect of the TP in an Atmospheric General Climate Model (AGCM), including air made warmer than its surroundings climatologically by the huge topography, results mainly in a local response in the atmosphere, i.e., a large ridge north of the TP in the troposphere in June. There was no Rossby wave response to the uplifting effect. However, simulations and statistical analyses strongly suggested that the anomalous TP atmospheric heating associated with global climate warming tends to excite a Rossby wave originating from the TP via Lake Baikal and continuing to move through the Okhotsk Sea to downstream areas. The appearance of the Rossby wave coincides with the positive phase of the eastern part of a normal stationary wave originating in the Caspian Sea traveling via the Okhotsk Sea to the sea area east of Japan that often occurs in June. Thus the TP atmospheric heating acts as an additional wave source in relaying and enhancing the eastern part of the normal wave propagation. Its path usually lies beyond 40 degrees N latitude, which is where the westerly jet stream takes over the role of waveguide.					li, wei/H-4093-2012														2169-897X	2169-8996				OCT 11	2011	116								D19108	10.1029/2011JD015979	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2011JD015979													WOS:000296014100001

G.; Neiff, Juan J.; Casco, Sylvina L.; Gallardo, Luciana, I			Macroinvertebrates of Eichhornia crassipes (Pontederiaceae) roots in the alluvial floodplain of large tropical rivers (Argentina)	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												Introduction: Eichhornia crassipes is a dominant aquatic plant of neotropical-river floodplains and is invasive in warm waters of different continents. Plants provide food and habitat for fish, especially Prochilodus lineatus and Gymnotus omarorum, which are relevant to subsistence fishing by local indigenous communities. Objective: In this study we describe the main traits of E. crassipes floating meadows, and analyze the abundance and composition of macroinvertebrate assemblages associated with their roots in two floodplain wetlands of the Parana River (within the Ramsar site Wetlands Chaco) and of the Pilcomayo River (within the Pilcomayo River National Park). Methods: During spring and summer, the macroinvertebrates were collected in monospecific stands of E. crassipes with a net of 962 cm(2) area and 500 mu m mesh size. Leaf density, the biomass of leaves and roots, the length of leaves and roots, and the water quality were measured simultaneously. Results: Temperature, oxygen concentration, and nutrient content were significantly higher and electrical conductivity was lower in the Pilcomayo than in the Parana floodplain. E. crassipes growing in the Pilcomayo floodplain had longer leaves and less root biomass than those found in the Parana floodplain. The number of macroinvertebrates per 1 000 g root dry weight and per m(2) was significantly different between both floodplains, but the taxon richness was similar. Non Metric Multidimensional Scaling analysis differentiated the abundance of 14 selected taxa between both floodplains, and showed a high correlation between the environmental variables and macroinvertebrate abundance. The most abundant taxonomic groups in the Parana River floodplain were oligochaetes (Naididae), ostracods mainly Cytheridella ilosvayi and larvae of non-biting midges (Chironomidae). Two families, Hydrobiidae (Heleobia parchappii) and Chironomidae accounted for 49.3 % of the total abundance in the Pilcomayo floodplain. The prawns Macrobrachium jelskii and M. amazonicum, frequent in the Pilcomayo floodplain, were not found in the Parana floodplain. Conclusions: The different environmental conditions in both floodplains affect the abundance, composition, and the dominance of macroinvertebrate assemblages; however, the total taxa richness was similar. The area occupied by E. crassipes in the floodplains of these rivers provides the habitat that contributes most to overall biotic diversity, which must be considered in management strategies.																			0034-7744	2215-2075				SEP	2020	68			2			S104	S115																WOS:000606833000008

Natural abundance mercury stable isotope ratios have been proven to be a useful tool to investigate mercury behavior in various ecosystems. In this study, mercury isotopic data were collected from seawater, sediments, air, and plant tissues in two mangrove forests in Guangxi and Fujian provinces. China, to study the transport and transformation of mercury in mangrove sediments. The mangroves were primarily subject to mercury inputs from external sources, such as anthropogenic activities, atmospheric deposition, and the surrounding seawater. An isotope mixing model based on mass independent fractionation (MIF) estimated that the mangrove wetland ecosystems accounted for <40% of the mercury in the surrounding seawater. The mercury in plant root tissues was derived mainly from sediments and enriched with light mercury isotopes. The exogenous mercury inputs from the fallen leaves were diluted by seawater, leading to a positive Delta Hg-199 offset between the fallen leaves and sediments. Unlike river and lake ecosystems, mangrove ecosystems are affected by tidal action, and the delta Hg-202 and Delta Hg-199 values of sediments were more negative than that of the surrounding seawater. The isotopic signature differences between these environmental samples were partially due to isotope fractionation driven by various physical and chemical processes (e.g., sorption, photoreduction, deposition, and absorption). These results contribute to a better understanding of the biogeochemical cycling of mercury in mangrove wetland ecosystems. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These results represent the first detailed data for toxaphene in Great Lakes precipitation. Seasonal volume-weighted mean concentrations for total toxaphene in precipitation ranged from 0.25 to 1.5 ng/L. Highest concentrations were found during the four spring (March-May) periods at roughly twice the annual means. The pattern for hexa-through nona-homologues over the 4 years did not vary appreciably with average ratios (relative to hepta-) of 0.08: 1.0:1.3:0.2. The volume-weighted mean concentrations for individual chlorobornane congeners were consistent in their season pattern with maximums seen in the spring. The major chlorobornane in precipitation, B8-2229 (Parlar 44), which was present at concentrations ranging from 0.016 to 0.079 ng/L, constituted 28 and 29% of the congener sum for 1997 and 1998, respectively. Lakewide loadings of toxaphene for Lake Ontario via precipitation were estimated to be 12, 17, 12, and 13 kg/year for 1995-1998, respectively. Previous toxaphene loading estimates were calculated for the individual Great Lakes on the basis of the only concentration data available, a single precipitation estimate of 0.2 ng/L from early work in northwestern Ontario. The loading estimates in this study indicate that precipitation inputs of toxaphene are 3-4 times higher than previously reported for Lake Ontario. The 1998 estimates of Lake Ontario wet deposition flux are 50% of the estimated gas deposition flux. However, wet flux values from this study exceed the net gas-phase mass transfer of toxaphene across the air-water interface.																			0013-936X					SEP 15	2005	39	18					7005	7011		10.1021/es050167y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es050167y								16201623					WOS:000231941700018

It is therefore important to establish how boreal ecosystems might respond to rapid changes in climate. Here we present palaeoecological evidence for changes in terrestrial vegetation and lake characteristics during an episode of climate warming that occurred between 5,000 and 4,000 years ago at the boreal treeline in central Canada. The initial transformation - from tundra to forest-tundra on land, which coincided with increases in lake productivity, pH and ratio of inflow to evaporation - took only 150 years, which is roughly equivalent to the time period often used in modelling the response of boreal forests to climate warming5,6. The timing of the treeline advance did not coincide with the maximum in high-latitude summer insolation predicted by Milankovitch theory7, suggesting that northern Canada experienced regionally asynchronous middle-to-late Holocene shifts in the summer position of the Arctic front. Such Holocene climate events may provide a better analogue for the impact of future global change on northern ecosystems than the transition from glacial to nonglacial conditions.					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696; Pienitz, Reinhard/0000-0002-3613-1673; Moser, Katrina/0000-0001-8633-5677; 													0028-0836					JAN 21	1993	361	6409					243	246		10.1038/361243a0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/361243a0													WOS:A1993KH61400053

The faunal content (mainly benthic foraminifera, corals and bryozoans) was analyzed to estimate paleo-environments and paleo-depths in order to determine if these sediments have been remobilized by reworking processes. Despite the occurrence of a depositional hiatus (including MIS 5d to MIS 9-time interval), the excellent preservation of faunal content suggests that the preserved sediment is in situ. The geochemical composition of the sediments (Nd and major elements) indicates that during MIS 12 riverine input was likely reduced because of enhanced aridity, and the sediment provenance (mainly atmospheric dust) is likely in the central (Lake Eyre) or eastern (Murray Darling Basin) parts of the Australian continent. MIS 2 is confirmed to be one of the driest periods recorded in Australia but with mixed dust sources from the eastern and western parts of the continent. More humid conditions followed the glacial maximum, which might correspond to the peak of the Indian-Australian Summer Monsoon.					; Jeandel, Catherine/P-3789-2014; AUBERT, Dominique/KAM-3369-2024; Bassetti, Maria-Angela/AAD-5998-2022; Saavedra-Pellitero, Mariem/I-7468-2019; Reuning, Lars/F-5594-2014	Saavedra, Mariem/0000-0003-0621-7932; Hallenberger, Maximilian/0000-0001-5112-0473; Moissette, Pierre/0000-0003-4432-1394; Bassetti, Maria Angela/0000-0003-3092-0046; AUBERT, Dominique/0000-0001-9130-3258; Korpanty, Chelsea/0000-0002-4718-8587; Reuning, Lars/0000-0002-3796-2874; Courtillat, Margot/0000-0003-4967-7621														2073-4433				NOV	2020	11	11							1251	10.3390/atmos11111251	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos11111251													WOS:000593636900001

We cleaned macrophytes in the subtropical shallow Mangueira Lake, southern Brazil, using soft sponges and sampled them randomly at short-term intervals. Simultaneously, we sampled and classified zooplankton from the littoral zone according to their particle ingestion size. Disturbance by wind was the main factor driving the epiphyton succession. Tightly attached diatoms were well adapted to the system's high mean wind velocity (15 m s(-1)), whereas low wind velocity (< 7 m s(-1)) reduced community diversity. Summer storms (46.7 mm of precipitation; 29.5 m s(-1) wind velocity) caused phosphorus input and favored prostrate diatoms. Epiphyton was very productive (8028.8 mg C m(-2) h(-1)), consistent with a heterogeneous community. Small rotifers and ciliates were abundant in the water column during the study. Our data indicate that rotifers as well as other zooplankton grazed on epiphyton, due to the positive correlation between algal diversity and rotifer abundance as well as between diatom and zooplankton biomasses, whereas Copepods and Cladocerans followed large motile diatoms in abundance. We conclude that epiphyton is an important food source for zooplankton in Mangueira Lake.					; Faria, Denise/E-3452-2013; de S Cardoso, Luciana/D-9523-2013	Matias de Faria, Denise/0000-0003-4241-9099; da Motta Marques, David/0000-0002-3809-8053; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2017	788	1					267	280		10.1007/s10750-016-3002-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-016-3002-5													WOS:000392386500019

Examining the impact of stream pH changes on transient P storage in streambed sediments across multiple temporal scales	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: Canadian Laurentian Great Lakes Basin. Study focus: Study examines the potential for stream pH changes to modulate the storage of phosphorus (P) in streambed sediments across multiple temporal scales by (i) synthesizing experimental data that quantify the relationships between pH and sediment P exchange, and (ii) comparing these relationships to measured long-term, seasonal, diel and event-based pH changes observed in streams. New hydrological insights for region: Synthesis of experimental data indicate that P exchange is highly sensitive to pH changes over the pH range typically observed in Ontario streams (pH >7). Of 157 monitored streams, 84 % experienced significant pH increases over the last 35 years, averaging + 0.24 pH change, and favouring long-term P release from streambed sediments or limiting P retention. Seasonally, most streams exhibited higher pH during summer, suggesting P release from sediments at times of high-productivity. Over shorter timescales, a subset of streams demonstrated diel pH fluctuations of > 1 pH unit in summer, and rapid pH changes (up to 1.7 pH units) during precipitation and snowmelt events. pH changes of this magnitude may drive rapid and extensive P exchange from streambed sediment. Overall, our results indicate pH changes may be an under-appreciated control on the transient P storage within streams, with relevance at multiple temporal scales. This finding has implications for P load predictions by mechanistic watershed nutrient models.

In this study, we employed the random forest approach to build a practical predictive model for phytoplankton biomass as determined by chlorophyll (CHL-a) levels. Using an integrative 15-year dataset, we obtained insights into CHL-a dynamics and identified important factors influencing it. Seasonal dynamics were crucial for shaping water quality, with meteorological and hydrological fluctuations playing pivotal roles. Elevated suspended solids and phosphorus levels during the summer monsoon indicated increased runoff and nutrient loading, contributing to fluctuations in nutrient ratios. CHL-a was also responsive to seasonal variations in nutrient availability, particularly in phosphorus and ammonium-nitrogen (NH4-N). These results suggest the importance of nutrient management strategies for controlling and mitigating eutrophication risk. The random forest model had practical accuracy (R-2 = 0.66, RMSE = 1.85) for predicting long-term CHL-a variation and identified phosphate-phosphorus, water temperature, and NH4-N as the most important predictors. However, our findings emphasize the importance of comprehensive analyses to identify the factors driving CHL-a variation. Combining the strengths of machine learning with multifaceted insights would enhance prediction accuracy and efficiency, ultimately facilitating informed decision-making for reservoir management and environmental conservation efforts.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				OCT	2024	167								112659	10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.112659	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.112659		SEP 2024											WOS:001327877700001

There are numerous seasonal lakes in the Poyang Lake region, and these lakes create a complex and diverse wetland landscape and serve as the main activity area for migratory birds. Seasonal lakes have significant effects on hydrological and ecological processes and are highly susceptible to various changes, but research on seasonal lakes is relatively limited. Based on long-term remote sensing images, this study analyzed the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of seasonal lakes and their influencing factors and ecological effects. The conclusions were as follows: the average water area of seasonal lakes showed a unimodal change during the year, reaching a maximum in July and a minimum in January. The interannual water area fluctuated greatly, and the overall water area showed a small downward trend. In terms of spatial variation, the seasonal lakes were connected with the main lake in the wet season and separated from the main lake in the dry season. Among the natural factors, the influences of temperature, evaporation, and rainfall on the water area of the seasonal lakes were successively reduced. In addition, the incoming water from the Yangtze River had an important influence. Among the human factors, the traditional fishing method "enclosing sublakes in autumn" had the greatest impact on the water area in a specific period, followed by the indirect impact of the Three Gorges Project.

We analysed the distribution of isoprenoid glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (isoGDGTs) in the sediments of Lake Chenghai in southwest China across the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, to extract both regional hydrological and temperature signals for this important transition period. The lake level was reconstructed from the relative abundance of crenarchaeol in isoGDGTs (%cren) and the crenarchaeol'/crenarchaeol ratio. The %cren-inferred lake level identified a single lowstand (15.4-14.4 ka cal BP), while the crenarchaeol'/crenarchaeol ratio suggests a relatively lower lake level between 15.4-14.4 and 12.5-11.7 ka cal BP, corresponding to periods of weakened ISM during the Heinrich 1 and Younger Dryas cold event. A filtered TetraEther indeX consisting of 86 carbon atoms (TEX86 index) revealed that lake surface temperature was similar to present-day values during the last deglacial period and suggests a substantial warming of similar to 4 degrees C from the early Holocene to the mid-Holocene. Our paleotemperature record is generally consistent with other records in southwest China, suggesting that the distribution of isoGDGTs in Lake Cheng-hai sediments has potential for quantitative paleotemperature reconstruction.					shulmeister, james/J-2859-2015; Shulmeister, James/J-2859-2015; Bird, Michael/G-5364-2010; sun, weiwei/GQA-5041-2022; Chang, Jie/R-2763-2016	shulmeister, james/0000-0001-5863-9462; Jiang, Qingfeng/0000-0003-2489-6801; Jiang, Qingfeng/0000-0003-3518-4279; Bird, Michael/0000-0003-1801-8703; 													1814-9324	1814-9332				MAY 7	2020	16	3					833	845		10.5194/cp-16-833-2020	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-16-833-2020													WOS:000531862100002

P.; Baquedano, Enrique			Phytoliths infer locally dense and heterogeneous paleovegetation at FLK North and surrounding localities during upper Bed I time, Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												The phytolith content of 10 samples collected immediately under Tuff IF (similar to 1.785 Ma) at FLK N and other surrounding localities (similar to 2 km(2)) provides a direct botanical evidence for woody vegetation in the eastern margin of Olduvai Gorge during uppermost Bed I time. Observation and counting of 143 phytolith types (5 to > 150 mu) reveal dense but heterogeneous woody cover (similar to 40-90%) of unidentified trees and/or shrubs and palms associated to the freshwater springs surrounding FLK N, and more open formation (presumably similar to 25-70% woody cover) in the southeast at localities VEK, HWK W and HWK E. The paleovegetation is best described as groundwater palm forest/woodland or bushland, which current analogue may be found near Lake Manyara in similar hydrogeological context (freshwater springs near saline/alkaline lake). Re-evaluating the published pollen data based on this analogy shows that 70% of the pollen signal at FLK N may be attributed to thicket-woodland, Acacia groundwater woodland, gallery and groundwater forests; while <30% is attributed to swamp herbage and grasslands. Micro-botanical, isotopic, and taphonomical studies of faunal remains converge on the same conclusion that the area surrounding FLK N, which attracted both carnivores and hominins in the early Pleistocene, was densely wooded during uppermost Bed I time.

The pond showed a low diversity of planktonic metazoans because of elevated pH, relatively high concentration of free dissolved ammonia and low oxygen concentration. The planktonic community was composed of the anomopod branchiopod Daphnia magna, and the cyclopoid copepods Cyclops vicinus and Cyclops strenuus. Both predation by cyclopoids and competition with D.magna excluded rotifers from the pond, except during a short period in spring 1996. Daphnia magna was the dominant organism from a biomass point of view. In parallel with biomass, demographic parameters, secondary production and the spatial distribution of D.magna were studied. A significant seasonal and interannual Variation in the density, biomass and production of D.magna was observed. The maximum density of daphnids varied from 264 x 10(3) to 686 x 10(3) individuals m(-2) and the maximum biomass from 4 to 30 g dry weight (DW) m(-2). The annual net production was high compared with the production of Daphnia in natural environments, ranging from 288 to 593 g DW m(-2) year(-1). The annual net production of exuviae accounted for similar to 25% of the total annual net production. Harvesting of daphnids for commercial applications that took place during the productive period did not have any discernible effect on the population dynamics of D.magna. Sexual reproduction was not observed during the three studied years. Negative mortality rates, occurring during early spring, however, indicated that recruitment from ephippia was effective in the pond of Differdange and that sexual reproduction took place before 1994. Swarming was regularly observed in relation to high densities.

Near-shore talik development beneath shallow water in expanding thermokarst lakes, Old Crow Flats, Yukon	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												It is generally assumed that permafrost is preserved beneath shallow lakes and ponds in the Western North American Arctic where water depth is less than about two thirds of the late-winter lake ice thickness. Here we present field observations of talik development beneath water as shallow as 0.2m despite a lake ice thickness of 1.5m, in Old Crow Flats (OCF), YT. Conditions leading to the initiation and development of taliks beneath shallow water were investigated with field measurements of shore erosion rates, bathymetry, ice thickness, snow accumulation, and lake bottom temperature near the shores of two expanding lakes in OCF. The sensitivity of talik development to variations in lake bottom thermal regime was then investigated numerically. Where ice reached the lake bottom, talik development was controlled by the ratio of freezing degree days to thawing degree days at the lake bottom (FDDlb/TDDlb). In some cases, spatial variations in on-ice snow depth had a minimal effect on annual mean lake bottom temperature (T-lb) but caused sufficient variations in FDDlb/TDDlb to influence talik development. Where T-lb was close to but greater than 0 degrees C simulations indicated that the thermal offset allowed permafrost aggradation to occur under certain conditions, resulting in irregular near-shore talik geometries. The results highlight the sensitivity of permafrost to small changes in lake bottom thermal conditions where the water column freezes through in early winter and indicate the occurrence of permafrost degradation beneath very shallow water in the near-shore zone of Arctic ponds and lakes.

Tropical cyclone activity enhanced by Sahara greening and reduced dust emissions during the African Humid Period	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Tropical cyclones (TCs) can have devastating socioeconomic impacts. Understanding the nature and causes of their variability is of paramount importance for society. However, historical records of TCs are too short to fully characterize such changes and paleosediment archives of Holocene TC activity are temporally and geographically sparse. Thus, it is of interest to apply physical modeling to understanding TC variability under different climate conditions. Here we investigate global TC activity during a warm climate state (mid-Holocene, 6,000 yBP) characterized by increased boreal summer insolation, a vegetated Sahara, and reduced dust emissions. We analyze a set of sensitivity experiments in which not only solar insolation changes are varied but also vegetation and dust concentrations. Our results show that the greening of the Sahara and reduced dust loadings lead to more favorable conditions for tropical cyclone development compared with the orbital forcing alone. In particular, the strengthening of the West African Monsoon induced by the Sahara greening triggers a change in atmospheric circulation that affects the entire tropics. Furthermore, whereas previous studies suggest lower TC activity despite stronger summer insolation and warmer sea surface temperature in the Northern Hemisphere, accounting for the Sahara greening and reduced dust concentrations leads instead to an increase of TC activity in both hemispheres, particularly over the Caribbean basin and East Coast of North America. Our study highlights the importance of regional changes in land cover and dust concentrations in affecting the potential intensity and genesis of past TCs and suggests that both factors may have appreciable influence on TC activity in a future warmer climate.

J	Harris-Parks, E				Harris-Parks, Erin			The micromorphology of Younger Dryas-aged black mats from Nevada, Arizona, Texas and New Mexico	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Black mats are organic-rich sediments and soils that form in wet environments associated with spring discharge. Micromorphological and geochemical analyses of 25 black mats dating to the Younger Dryas Chronozone (12.9-11.7 ka) and early Holocene were conducted to determine their composition and depositional environment. Samples were collected from Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Nevada. Micromorphological analyses were conducted on thin sections using polarized and blue fluorescent light. These analyses determined that black mats contain humic acids, fine (5-20 mu m) plant fragments, diatoms, phytoliths, and gastropods. The dominant type of organic matter in black mats is derived from herbaceous plants, contradicting previous studies that supported algal or charcoal sources. Differences in the micromorphological characteristics of the samples revealed that black mats formed as three different types, organic horizons, moist soils and, ponded sediments, depending on their topographic position in relation to the water table. The microscopic evidence found in black mats supports the presence of widespread wet environments in Nevada and Arizona during the Younger Dryas Chronozone, clearly indicating a sustained period of greater effective moisture, optimal for spring discharge and black mat formation.

Largemouth bass exhibited density-dependent size structure and growth, but not condition. Total annual mortality averaged only 30%. Deeper lakes contained low density largemouth bass populations with a high proportion of fish >380 mm, whereas larger lakes with little submerged vegetation had faster growth. The proportion of largemouth bass >380 mm and relative abundance tended to increase with emergent vegetation coverage. More stable recruitment was evident in shallower lakes with increased emergent vegetation coverage. Strong year classes were associated with cooler September air temperatures. Largemouth bass populations exhibited density-dependent effects in lakes up to 332 ha.

However, because the condition index (CI) of wild individuals varies from year to year in Lake Biwa, the number of larvae obtained by this method is variable. In the present study, a novel culture method to increase clam CI was examined. Both the CI and growth of the clams suspended in Nishinoko Lagoon during winter were compared with those of clams cultured in a tank supplied with lake water and in the harbor adjacent to the Shiga Prefectural Fisheries Experiment Station on the east shore of Lake Biwa. The CI of clams cultured in Nishinoko Lagoon was significantly larger than that of wild clams and those cultured in the tank or the harbor.

Seismic records of the flood provide new insights into GLOF mechanics and their ability to mobilize large boulders that otherwise prevent channel erosion. Because of this boulder mobilization, GLOF impacts far exceed those of the annual summer monsoon, and GLOFs may dominate fluvial erosion and channel-hillslope coupling many tens of kilometers downstream of glaciated areas. Long-term valley evolution in these regions may therefore be driven by GLOF frequency and magnitude, rather than by precipitation.

J	TRIJONIS, J				TRIJONIS, J			EXISTING AND NATURAL BACKGROUND LEVELS OF VISIBILITY AND FINE PARTICLES IN THE RURAL EAST	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												An investigation was conducted into existing and natural background levels of visibilityand fine particles in nonurban areas of eastern USA. An analysis of data for 100 airports nationwide indicated that nonurban areas of the East experienced relatively low visibilities; specifically, rural areas east of the Mississippi and south of the Great Lakes generally exhibited annual median visual ranges of 15-25 km. A review of data from 8 monitoring programs indicated that ambient fine (.ltoreq. 2.5 .mu.m) particle concentrations averaged .apprx. 29 .mu.g/m3 in the rural East. The largest components were water (.apprx. 11 .mu.g/m3), sulfates (.apprx. 9 .mu.g/m3) and organics (.apprx. 4 .mu.g/m3). The majority of the water was probably attached to hygroscopic sulfate aerosols. Sulfates and fine particles exhibited a pronounced maximum in the summer quarter, when visibility showed a pronounced minimum. This seasonal pattern was a new phenomenon historically; prior to the 1960s, visibility was distinctly higher during the summer then during the remainder of the year. An investigation of natural background conditions suggested that the natural fine aerosol concentrations averaged 5.5 .+-. 2.5 .mu.g/m3 in the East, with the largest components being organics and water. Natural background visual range for the East was estimated to be 95 .+-. 45 km. It was not possible to check this estimate of natural background visual range through an analysis of historical visibility trends from the 1930s-1970s because of limitations in historical emission trend data, uncertainties in airport visibility trend data and the confounding effects of meteorology. The best check would be to collect simultaneous measurements of fine particle mass, fine particle chemical composition and visibility in remote continental areas of the Southern Hemisphere.																			1352-2310	1873-2844					1982	16	10					2431	2445		10.1016/0004-6981(82)90133-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0004-6981(82)90133-0													WOS:A1982PN88900019
J	PORTER, KG				PORTER, KG			ENHANCEMENT OF ALGAL GROWTH AND PRODUCTIVITY BY GRAZING ZOOPLANKTON	SCIENCE												Colonies of the common planktonic green algae, Sphaerocystis schroeteri, are only partially disrupted and assimilated by Daphnia magna, a natural predator. The Daphnia break up the outer protective gelantinous sheath that surrounds Sphaerocystis colonies, but most of the algal cells emerge from Daphnia guts intact and in viable condition. During gut passage, these viable cells take up nutrients, such as P, both from algal remains and from Daphnia metabolites. This nutrient supply stimulates algal carbon fixation and cell division. Enhanced algal growth, observed after gut passage, can compensate for the minor losses to the population caused by grazing. Nutrients regenerated by grazers may produce the summer bloom of gelatinous green algae during the seasonal succession of lake phytoplankton.																			0036-8075	1095-9203					1976	192	4246					1332	1334		10.1126/science.192.4246.1332	http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.192.4246.1332								17739838					WOS:A1976BU52900017

Habitat Associations of Migratory Waterbirds Using Restored Shallow Lakes in Iowa	WATERBIRDS												Wetlands in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) have experienced declines in areal cover, and many remaining wetlands are degraded. Recently. restoration of wetlands has been a key management strategy for waterbirds. In Iowa, the Department of Natural Resources and Ducks Unlimited, Inc. have restored 38 shallow lakes. which are large. mostly permanent wetlands. To assess the impact of habitat variables on migrant waterbird use (waterfowl. shorebirds, and secretive marsh birds). surveys were conducted at 19 shallow lakes restored 1 to 12 years prior to this study and at 11 soon-to-be-restored shallow lakes in Iowa during the spring of 2016-2018. A total of 713,338 waterbirds were identified in 82 species. and more waterbirds and species were detected at restored shallow lakes (582,148 waterbirds and 78 species) than at non-restored shallow lakes (130,895 waterbirds and 70 species). Greatest numbers of diving ducks and waterbird species occurred around 40-50% emergent cover. Water level negatively influenced dabbling ducks and shorebirds and positively influenced diving ducks and total waterbird abundance. Years-since-restoration positively influenced goose/swan abundance and secretive marsh bird abundance, and total wetland area had a positive effect on all groups. These findings emphasize how management strategies for restored shallow lakes should mimic the natural wet-dry cycle of prairie wetlands to provide benefits for all waterbirds.																			1524-4695	1938-5390				JUN	2019	42	2					135	153		10.1675/063.042.0201	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/063.042.0201													WOS:000473158100001
J	Kleeberg, A; Heidenreich, M				Kleeberg, A; Heidenreich, M			Release of nitrogen and phosphorus from macrophyte stands of summer dried out sediments of a eutrophic reservoir	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Spremberg Reservoir, Lusatia, Germany, is a linear reservoir which impounds the lowland River Spree to a length of 8 km. Due to low summer runoff and continuous extraction from it for public water supply ca. 21% of the total area (6.8 km(2)) dried out from May/June to October/November in 2000. The seasonal P and N accumulation and release by the macrophytes growing on these areas were investigated. Two major groups of macrophyte stands, dominated either by water smartweed Polygonum amphibium L. (50-100%) or by marsh cudweed Gnaphalium uliginosum L. (50-75%), were distinguished. In September 2000, their above-ground biomass was harvested from from 15 representative 5 X 5 m plots. It varied between 34-420 g d.w. m(-2) for P. amphibium and 76-120 g d.w. m(-2) for G. uliginosum. Plant elemental composition, incubation of undisturbed sediment cores and litter bag exposure showed that the mean P accumulation rate of both stands (7.2 mg P m(-2) d(-1)) was less than the release rate (9.7 mg P m(-2) d(-1)), whereas the N accumulation rate (57.4 mg N m(-2) d(-1)) was higher than the release rate (43.4 mg N m(-2) d(-1)). The temporary storage of 0.52 t P and 6.51 t N by the macrophyte stands was compensated by release rates orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding benthic release rates (0.03-0.06 mg P m(-2) d(-1), 1.03-2.08 mg N m(-2) d(-1)) influencing the overall water quality of the reservoir periodically. Riparian zone fluxes apparently added little to the reservoir-wide internal loading since the high Fe supply guarantees an efficient P retention in the sediments.

Dreissena and the disappearance of the spring phytoplankton bloom in Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We determined the clearance rates of the profunda morph of the quagga mussel (Dreissena bugensis) using seston and Cryptomonas ozolini, a high-quality algal food, for the temperature range 1-7 degrees C, which is the full temperature range this morph is likely to experience during isothermal conditions or in the hypolimnion of deep lakes. Experiments at 3 degrees C with the shallow-water morph of the quagga and the zebra mussel provided very similar results. The clearance rates were combined with dreissenid abundance in 0-30 m, 30-50 m, 50-90 m, and >90 m depth zones of the southern basin of Lake Michigan to calculate a maximum (using Cryptomonas) and minimum (using seston) fraction of the water column cleared (FC) per day in the different depth zones at 3 degrees C to determine dreissenid impact on the spring phytoplankton bloom from 1994 to 2008. Starting in 2003 or 2004 with the replacement of zebra mussels by quagga mussels in shallow water and expansion of quagga mussel biomass in deep water, FC began to exceed likely phytoplankton growth in the 30-50 m zone. In 2007-2008, FC greatly exceeded likely phytoplankton growth by a factor of about 5 in the 30- to 50-m depth zone, where dreissenids were extremely abundant. Low FC in the offshore region led to the hypothesis of a mid-depth carbon (C) and phosphorous (P) sink caused by mussel uptake of seston-associated C and P that affected not only the mid-depth region, but also the offshore region "downstream" of the mid-depth zone.

Stratigraphic division was carried out by palynological studies and C-14-dating. It was revealed that variations of isotopic compositions and the dynamics of terrestrial vegetation were affected to some extent by common climatic forcing: birch expanded during relatively warm and/or arid phases (higher delta(18)O and/or delta(13)C), fir spread during relatively cold and/or humid phases (lower delta(18)O and/or delta(13)C), and grasses were abundant during relatively cold (lower 6180) or and phases (higher delta(13)C). A comparison of four pairs of delta(18)O and delta(13)C curves allowed the recognition of several palaeoclimatic events at a regional scale. Two main cold events interrupted by a warmer interval occurred in the Younger Dryas. A short-term episode of active permafrost decay at the end of the Younger Dryas and in the very beginning of the Preboreal caused an abrupt rise of lake levels followed by their rapid fall. A shift toward a lower precipitation- evaporation balance and lower lake levels took place roughly in the middle of the Boreal. A trend of decreasing temperatures throughout most of the Boreal culminated in a short-lived very cold phase at similar to 8100 C-14 year BP or similar to 9050 cal. C-14 year BP, according to the proposed age model. In the Atlantic I warmer phases were coincident with the phases of the lower precipitation-evaporation balance. An episode of significant short-term warming occurred in the last third of the Atlantic 1. Correlation of the delta(18)O curve derived from authigenic calcites precipitated between the beginning of the Preboreal 2 and the end of Atlantic 1 in the Ptich river valley with that from the GISP2 Greenland ice core allowed good matching of the trends and spikes (i.e. of the air temperature changes) under assumption that the ages of the Ptich pollen-based time model are 600-1000 years too old.

J	Yang, XX; Jin, ZD; Zhang, F; Ma, XL				Yang, Xiaoxiao; Jin, Zhangdong; Zhang, Fei; Ma, Xiaolin			Glacial-interglacial lake hydrochemistry in step with the Pleistocene Indian summer monsoon at the southeastern Tibetan Plateau	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The lake state and chemistry are sensitive to climate change at short timescales, but it is unclear how lake hydrochemistry responds to monsoonal climate, especially over glacial -interglacial cycles, owing to lack of welldated and continuous sedimentary records. The types and geochemical compositions of authigenic carbonates from lacustrine sediments can be used to reconstruct past hydrochemistry. Yet, little is known about the significance and influencing factors of the Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios of authigenic carbonates over glacial -interglacial cycles. Here, trace -element data of a 666 m long sediment sequence from the Heqing basin, a paleo-lake situated at the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, provide detailed glacial -interglacial hydrochemical conditions and their association with Indian summer monsoon (ISM) evolution during the entire Pleistocene. In interglacials, variation in both Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios can serve as proxies for salinity as a result of precipitation of low-Mg calcite, constrained by enhanced ISM intensity and catchment weathering product. Instead, in glacials, high Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios reflect high -Mg calcite and aragonite precipitation under low lake level conditions. There is a nonlinear response of the Sr/Ca ratio of lacustrine sediment to salinity variation when high -Mg calcite and aragonite precipitate in a hydrologically closed and evaporative lake. Based upon the sedimentary Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca ratios in the Heqing paleo-lake, the lake hydrochemistry during the Pleistocene experienced obvious glacial -interglacial ISM cycles at the life span of the lake itself: (1) in the old interval (2640-1840 ka), the salinity was low with cycles at the early stage of lake development owing to strong ISM; (2) in the middle interval (1840-920 ka), the lake was at a balance state and its salinity was more constrained by weathering solute, rather than ISM; and (3) in the young interval (920-130 ka), the salinity fluctuated with large amplitude over glacialinterglacial cycles and subsequent increase paced the weakened ISM. This study highlights the sensitivity of the types of lacustrine authigenic carbonates and lake chemistry to ISM changes over glacial -interglacial cycles.

Reconstructed late Quaternary hydrological changes from Lake Tso Moriri, NW Himalaya	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												We present the results of our investigations on the radiocarbon dated core sediments from the Lake Tso Moriri, NW Himalaya aimed at reconstructing palaeohydrological changes in this climatically sensitive region. Based on the detailed geochemical, mineralogical and sedimentological analysis, we recognise several short-term fluctuations superimposed upon seven major palaeohydrological stages identified in this lake since similar to 26 cal ka. Stage I (>20.2 cal ka): shallow lake characterised by input of coarse-grained detrital sediments; Stage II (20.2-16.4 cal ka): lake deepening and intensification of this trend ca. 18 cal ka; Stage III (16.4-11.2 cal ka): rising lake levels with a short term wet phase (13.1-11.7 cal ka); Stage IV (11.2-8.5 cal ka): early Holocene hydrological maxima and highest lake levels inferred to have resulted from early Holocene Indian monsoon intensification, as records from central Asia indicate weaker westerlies during this interval; Stage V (8.5-5.5 cal ka): mid-Holocene climate deterioration; Stage VI (5.5-2.7 cal ka): progressive lowering of lake level; Stage VII (2.7-0 cal ka): onset of modern conditions. The reconstructed hydrological variability in Lake Tso Moriri is governed by temperature changes (meltwater inflow) and monsoon precipitation (increased runoff). A regional comparison shows considerable differences with other palaeorecords from peninsular India during late Holocene. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

J	Jiang, CY; Constantinescu, G; Yuan, SY; Tang, HW				Jiang, Chenyu; Constantinescu, George; Yuan, Saiyu; Tang, Hongwu			Flow hydrodynamics, density contrast effects and mixing at the confluence between the Yangtze River and the Poyang Lake channel	ENVIRONMENTAL FLUID MECHANICS												In this study, eddy-resolving numerical techniques are used to investigate flow hydrodynamics and mixing at the asymmetric confluence between the Yangtze River and the Poyang Lake channel, one of the largest confluences in the world. The model was previously validated for small and medium-size river confluences. The study also investigates the effects of density contrast between the confluent flows due to unequal temperatures in the two tributaries. Simulations are conducted assuming first negligible density-induced effects (no coupling between the momentum and density equations; Richardson number, Ri = 0) and then with a nonzero Richardson number corresponding to the temperature difference |Delta T| = |T-1 - T-2| between the two streams. Given that the Yangtze River of temperature T-1 contains cooler water during the winter and warmer water during the summer compared to the Poyang River channel of temperature T-2, stratified flow simulations are conducted for |Delta T| = 2.5 degrees C with both T-1 > T-2 and T-2 < T-1. As opposed to small-size natural river confluences, no streamwise-oriented-vortical (SOV) cells forms in the vicinity of the mixing interface (MI) in the three scenarios investigated despite the relatively high confluence angle. The secondary flow is driven by the formation of helical cells of cross-flow motions. Similar to what was observed at small and medium-size river confluences with a low level of bed discordance, the main effect of density contrast between the confluent flows is to generate lateral near-bed intrusions of heavier fluid and to strongly tilt the boundaries of the MI. The density contrast is found to affect not only the position and width of the MI, the size of the patches containing energetic eddies shed from the wake region and the turbulent kinetic energy levels inside the MI, but also the position of the curvature-induced cells of secondary flow and the flow structure inside the wake region. The overall effect of density contrast is to increase mixing at large distances from the confluence apex where the near bed and free surface intrusions are relatively large and most of the mixing occurs beneath the free surface. The largest mixing is observed for the case the main tributary (Yangtze River) contains the warmer, less dense fluid. So, despite the absence of SOV cells, density contrast effects on flow structure and thermal mixing at the large-scale confluence investigated in the present study are qualitatively similar to those observed at several small and medium-size confluences.

Silicate concentration also simultaneously increased with total hydrogen sulfide concentration during the summer. Generally, dissolved silicate is readily adsorbed onto ferric hydroxide and precipitates in an oxidative environment. In this study, we focused on the behavior of ferric hydroxide adsorbing silicate in sediment and determined that hydrogen sulfide was the main cause of dissolved silicate elution from ferric hydroxide adsorbing silicate because the hydrogen sulfide produced via microbiological processes in the anoxic-reducing environment was reducible for other metal oxides. According to laboratory experiments, silicate was released from ferric hydroxide by reacting with sodium sulfide, causing increasing elution of dissolved silicate from anoxic-reducing sediments with increasing concentration of sodium sulfide in the solutions. This result shows that hydrogen sulfide is very crucial for silicate release under a reducing environment. Therefore, in Lake Nakaumi, silicate would be released from the bottom after ferric hydroxide adsorbing silicate reacted with hydrogen sulfide in a summer reductive environment.

J	Card, VM				Card, VM			Varve-counting by the annual pattern of diatoms accumulated in the sediment of Big Watab Lake, Minnesota, AD 1837-1990	BOREAS												The goal of this study was to develop a method for extracting quantitative annual records of diatoms and other microfossils from sediments that are resistant to existing varve-counting methods because of their variable, complex, or indistinct laminations. Very finely laminated organic sediments from a deep diamictic lake in central Minnesota, USA were collected by freeze-core, dehydrated by solvent exchange, embedded with epoxy, and petrographically thin-sectioned. Diatom frustules and pollen grains were counted in contiguous 400 mu m microscope fields-of-view and used to construct a sediment chronology. The concentration of diatoms in the sediment was cyclic and lowest in sediment deposited during summer. The concentration of pollen in the sediment was also cyclic and sediment deposited during the summer contained the highest concentrations of pollen and the highest percentages of ragweed (Ambrosia spp.) pollen. The sediment chronology that was produced accurately records the onset of regional (c. 1850) and watershed (c. 1880) development, a historic tornadic storm complex (1894), and individual drought years (1932, 1934 & 1935) within the 1930's drought.																			0300-9483					JUN	1997	26	2					103	112																WOS:A1997XR82600003

A 2,300-year-long annually resolved record of the South American summer monsoon from the Peruvian Andes	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Decadal and centennial mean state changes in South American summer monsoon (SASM) precipitation during the last 2,300 years are detailed using an annually resolved authigenic calcite record of precipitation delta O-18 from a varved lake in the Central Peruvian Andes. This unique sediment record shows that delta O-18 peaked during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) from A. D. 900 to 1100, providing evidence that the SASM weakened considerably during this period. Minimum delta O-18 values occurred during the Little Ice Age (LIA) between A. D. 1400 and 1820, reflecting a prolonged intensification of the SASM that was regionally synchronous. After the LIA, delta O-18 increased rapidly, particularly during the current warm period (CWP; A. D. 1900 to present), indicating a return to reduced SASM precipitation that was more abrupt and sustained than the onset of the MCA. Diminished SASM precipitation during the MCA and CWP tracks reconstructed Northern Hemisphere and North Atlantic warming and a northward displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) over the Atlantic, and likely the Pacific. Intensified SASM precipitation during the LIA follows reconstructed Northern Hemisphere and North Atlantic cooling, El Nino-like warming in the Pacific, and a southward displacement of the ITCZ over both oceans. These results suggest that SASM mean state changes are sensitive to ITCZ variability as mediated by Western Hemisphere tropical sea surface temperatures, particularly in the Atlantic. Continued Northern Hemisphere and North Atlantic warming may therefore help perpetuate the recent reductions in SASM precipitation that characterize the last 100 years, which would negatively impact Andean water resources.					; Vuille, Mathias/S-3906-2019	Vuille, Mathias/0000-0002-9736-4518; Stansell, Nathan/0000-0003-2477-1953													0027-8424	1091-6490				MAY 24	2011	108	21					8583	8588		10.1073/pnas.1003719108	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1003719108								21555548					WOS:000290908000019

The distribution of the pintail snipe (Gallinago Stenura) in the northeastern European tundra	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												The new data on the distribution of pintail snipe on Yugorskii Peninsula and in Malozemel'skaya and Bol'shemel'skaya tundras of the Nenets Autonomous Region (Arkhangel'sk oblast) are given. Presently, this species inhabits local areas of the northeastern tundra: lake depressions and river terraces in shrub tundra and forest tundra. Some of these areas are on the migratory ways, the others are breeding grounds. The pintail snipe arrives to the tundra in June 2-24, and the autumn migration occurs in late August-September. The courtship rituals lasts from the moment of its arrival before July 27. The number of the birds varies from 0.02 to 0.7 (average 22) ind./km(2).

Prior to 1977, alewife catch-per-effort (CPE) was high in all areas of the bay but declined drastically following unusually cold winters in 1976-77 and 1977-78. Beginning in 1980, alewife CPE recovered in the lower bay, adjacent to Lake Ontario. This recovery was not observed in the upper bay where predation by a resurgent walleye (Stizostedion vitreum) population maintained the reduced numbers of alewife. We conclude that walleye predation has played an important role in generating differences in alewife abundance between the upper and lower bays since 1980. There is a negative correlation between adult alewife CPE and young-of-year (YOY) alewife CPE suggesting that intraspecific predation is an important factor in the production of YOY alewife in the Bay of Quinte. Recruitment mechanisms for alewife in the Bay of Quinte may depend more on intraspecific predation, in contrast to Lake Ontario where intraspecific competition for zooplankton has been hypothesized as a limiting factor.

This project piloted the concept of using Web-based videoconferencing to allow university faculty to facilitate research in a precollege setting. This technology removed the more than 200 miles distance between the partners as an impediment to the participation of district teachers and students in Clemson University programs. To prepare teachers for the research, an online course was developed and disseminated from Clemson University via Macromedia Breeze. Teachers and administrators from Florence District Three met with Clemson University faculty through videoconferencing and bulletin board technology. District personnel chose the theme, "The Rise and Fall of Tobacco in the Lake City Market Area." The school district personnel also gained proficiency in digital technology skills (e.g. Adobe Photoshop Elements, Adobe Premier Elements, Movie Maker) that they and their students used to collect information and create a final DVD.

We conducted monthly censuses along shoreline sections of a continental lake (Lake Balaton, Hungary) to assess the abundance of 11 common species that use this lake as a feeding and staging area during migration and winter. We estimated the degree of urbanization of the same shoreline sections and also measured other habitat characteristics (water depth, extent of reed cover, biomass of zebra mussels, distances to waste dumps and to other wetlands). We applied linear models and model averaging to identify habitat variables with high relative importance for predicting bird distributions. Bird abundance and urbanization were strongly related only in one species. Other habitat variables exhibited stronger relationships with bird distribution: (1) diving ducks and coots preferred shoreline sections with high zebra mussel biomass, (2) gulls preferred sites close to waste dumps, and (3) the abundances of several species were higher on shoreline sections close to other wetlands. Our findings suggest that the distribution of waterbirds on Lake Balaton is largely independent of shoreline urbanization and influenced by food availability and connectivity between wetlands.

Vegetation and precipitation change inferred from the 8 13 C and 8 2 H values of n-alkanes from lake sediment from 18 cal ka BP, tropical NE Australia	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The carbon and hydrogen isotope compositions (8 13 C and 8 2 H) of sedimentary n-alkanes are excellent recorders of past vegetation and precipitation change. Yet, few studies have combined and compared n-alkanes in modern plants and paleoenvironmental records. Here we analyzed the 8 13 C and 8 2 H values of n-alkanes (8 13 C alk and 8 2 H alk , respectively) from a 7-m-long sediment sequence in Lake Barrine, modern catchment soils, fallen leaf mixtures, rainforest tree leaves and grasses from tropical northeastern Australia. We exploited the correlation between the relative abundances, 8 13 C, and 8 2 H values of n-alkanes from fresh modern rainforest leaves, grasses, fallen leaves, soils and surface sediments. Based on this, we developed two binary mixing models to determine C 3 plant abundances and the 8 2 H values of precipitation (8 2 H P-R ) to study rainfall and vegetation in the Lake Barrine catchment since 18.3 cal ka BP. Combining the results of this study with mean annual air temperature, pollen, and clastic influx, we reconstructed a robust climatic and environmental record for this site and compared it with other regional paleoenvironmental records. The modern samples indicate slight 13 C enrichment and obvious 2 H depletion in the n-alkanes from fresh rainforest leaves, fallen leaves, soils, and surface sediments, which is possibly due to microbial build-up of n-alkanes during decomposition. A broad consistency in regional paleoclimate trends was identified, including a cool, dry Last Glacial Maximum (23-17.0 cal ka BP), warmer, wetter last deglacial (17.0-14.9 cal ka BP), wetter with stable temperature Antarctic cold reversal (14.9-12.8 cal ka BP), (possibly) cooler, drier Younger Dryas (12.8-11.6 cal ka BP), warmer, wetter early-to-middle Holocene (11.6-5 cal ka BP) and cooler, slightly drier and more variable late Holocene (5 cal ka BP to the present).

J	Persaud, AD; Williamson, CE				Persaud, AD; Williamson, CE			Ultraviolet and temperature effects on planktonic rotifers and crustaceans in northern temperate lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Anthropogenic stressors such as climate change, ozone depletion and acidification may act in concert to alter ultraviolet (UV) light and temperature regimes in freshwater ecosystems. These physical and chemical changes will inevitably affect zooplankton community dynamics, but little is known about their relative effects on different species in natural communities. During spring, species that migrate to surface waters to take advantage of warmer temperatures may be especially vulnerable as UV levels can be high. 2. The objective of this study was to investigate the in situ effects of UV and temperature on a natural assemblage of planktonic rotifers and crustaceans during the spring. We performed in situ exposure experiments in two lakes with different surface temperatures. 3. Exposure to UV had a significant effect on the abundance and/or reproduction of four rotifers: Gastropus spp., Kellicottia bostonensis, Kellicottia longispina, Keratella spp.; two cladocerans: Holopedium gibberum, Daphnia catawba, and one copepod: Leptodiaptomus minutus. Incubation under cooler temperatures had a negative effect on K. longispina and H. gibberum. Temperature and UV had a significant interactive effect on abundance and/or reproduction of L. minutus and Ploesoma truncatum. Our results indicate that changes in underwater UV and temperature can significantly influence the composition of the zooplankton community and ultimately food web dynamics.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				MAR	2005	50	3					467	476		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01334.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01334.x													WOS:000226962200007

These data can constrain the interactions between sinkholes and deep seated fluid circulation, with a special focus on the possibility of the bedrock karst aquifer feeding the lake. The Rn budget accounted for all quantifiable surface and subsurface input and output fluxes including the flux across the sediment-water interface. The total value of groundwater discharge into Green Lake and Black Lake (similar to 540 +/- 160 L s(-1)) obtained from the Rn budget is lower than, but comparable with historical data on the springs group discharge estimated in the same period of the year (800 +/- 90 L s(-1)). Besides being an indirect test for the reliability of the Rn-budget "tool", it confirms that both Green and Black Lake are effectively springs and not simply "water filled" sinkholes. New data on the water chemistry and the groundwater fluxes into the sinkhole area of Vescovo Lakes allows the assessment of the mechanism responsible for sinkhole formation in Pontina Plain and suggests the necessity of monitoring the changes of physical and chemical parameters of groundwater below the plain in order to mitigate the associated risk.

J	Pigati, JS; Rech, JA; Quade, J; Bright, J				Pigati, Jeffrey S.; Rech, Jason A.; Quade, Jay; Bright, Jordon			Desert wetlands in the geologic record	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Desert wetlands support flora and fauna in a variety of hydrologic settings, including seeps, springs, marshes, wet meadows, ponds, and spring pools. Overtime, eolian, alluvial, and fluvial sediments become trapped in these settings by a combination of wet ground conditions and dense plant cover. The result is a unique combination of clastic sediments, chemical precipitates, and organic matter that is preserved in the geologic record as groundwater discharge (GWD) deposits. GWD deposits contain information on the timing and magnitude of past changes in water-table levels and, therefore, are a potential source of paleohydrologic and paleoclimatic information. In addition, they can be important archeological and paleontological archives because desert wetlands provide reliable sources of fresh water, and thus act as focal points for human and faunal activities, in some of the world's harshest and driest lands. Here, we review some of the physical, sedimentological, and geochemical characteristics common to GWD deposits, and provide a contextual framework that researchers can use to identity and interpret geologic deposits associated with desert wetlands. We discuss several lines of evidence used to differentiate GWD deposits from lake deposits (they are commonly confused), and examine how various types of microbiota and depositional facies aid in reconstructing past environmental and hydrologic conditions. We also review how late Quaternary GWD deposits are dated, as well as methods used to investigate desert wetlands deeper in geologic time. We end by evaluating the strengths and limitations of hydrologic and climatic records derived from GWD deposits, and suggest several avenues of potential future research to further develop and utilize these unique and complex systems.

Appraisal of groundwater quality in upper Manimuktha sub basin, Vellar river, Tamil Nadu, India by using Water Quality Index (WQI) and multivariate statistical techniques	MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT												Groundwater is a major natural resource for drinking and irrigation purpose. The overexploited of groundwater is increase year by year and quality of groundwater simultaneously decreases. Groundwater quality is the main issue because water is linked with our metabolism. In order to know the groundwater pollution and controlling factors of groundwater quality in the upper Manimuktha sub basin, Vellar river, Tamil Nadu, India. Forty eight groundwater samples were collected from entire study area on January 2014 and analysed for physicochemical properties. Major ions were as abundance of Na > Ca > Mg > K, and HCO3 > Cl > SO4 > NO3 respectively. Multivariate statistical analyses display the good correlation between all the physicochemical parameters except pH and F. The dendrogram reveals cluster 3 (EC and TDS), cluster 2 (alkalinity, TH, HCO3) and cluster 1 (F, K, NO3, Ca, Mg, Na, SO4, Cl). The hydrochemical processes reveal rock-weathering interactions and ion-exchange processes play an important role in groundwater quality of the study area. The WQI indicates 50.03% of the samples fall in excellent to good for drinking in the center of the study area. Remaining samples fall poor to very poor categories, signifying northern and southern side mainly polluted. Maximum of lakes located in the northern side also indicate poor quality, because of the contamination of wastewater at or near the lakes, migrate in the groundwater. This study has shown the great combination of GIS, statistical analysis and WQI in assessing groundwater quality give a clear view for decision makers can plan better for the operation and maintenance of groundwater resources.

Big Creek, the major tributary, drains a watershed of 317 square miles (81,818 hectares), and discharges 4700 million cubic feet (127,000 million liters) of water into the Bay annually. Summer water temperatures in the Creek and the Bay were positively correlated with air temperatures in 1962. The water in the Bay was subject to considerable seiche action. Levels of nutrients and suspended materials were characteristically higher in the Creek than in the Bay. Gross reductions in levels of turbitidy, total dissolved solids, nitrates, and phosphates occurred in the lower section of Big Creek and the adjacent area of the Bay. For example, phosphate levels of bottom samples were inversely correlated with those of water samples in lower Big Creek and its estuary. The path of Big Creek discharge through the Bay to Lake Erie was defined by an analysis of total dissolved solids and soil phosphate data.																									1966	23	2					275	+		10.1139/f66-021	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f66-021													WOS:A19667317700006
J	Aref, MA; Taj, RJ				Aref, Mahmoud A.; Taj, Rushdi J.			Recent evaporite deposition associated with microbial mats, Al-Kharrar supratidal-intertidal sabkha, Rabigh area, Red Sea coastal plain of Saudi Arabia	FACIES												The supratidal-intertidal sabkha of the Al-Kharrar area, Red Sea coast, Saudi Arabia, contains the evaporite minerals gypsum, anhydrite, and halite. Microbial mats flourish adjacent to the sabkha evaporites in tidal flats and pools of the Al Kharrar lagoon. Desiccation and decay of some microbial mats in tidal flat areas have led to precipitation of gypsum and halite there. The evaporite minerals have been precipitated through displacive, inclusive, and replacive growth within mud, sand, gravelly sand, and bioclastic sediment of the sabkha. Gypsum occurs as lenticular and tabular crystals whereas anhydrite occurs as nodular (individual, mosaic, and enterolithic) and pseudomorphs of lenticular gypsum crystals that grew displacively and replacively near the surface of the sabkha. Halite exists as a diagenetic cement within the sabkha sediment, or as primary rafts and skeletal crystals in desiccated tidal pools with salinity over 220aEuro degrees. Microbial mats are growing on the surface of the upper tidal flat areas and in pools at a salinity range of 80-110aEuro degrees, and they lead to biostabilization of the sediment. They have induced a range of sedimentary surface structures (MISS) including gas domes, reticulate patterns, tufts, pinnacles, wrinkles, and microbial shrinkage cracks. The occurrence, abundance, and association of evaporite minerals and MISS are controlled by local environmental factors such topography of the sabkha, emergence or submergence of tidal areas, surface area of the evaporite basin, contribution of meteoric water from floods from the adjoining Red Sea Mountains, and water salinity. These factors promote the growth of the microbial mats in the winter months, and deposition of evaporite minerals during summer months. Field and petrographic data indicate that the main recharge to the sabkha area is from tidal flow and water seepage from the Al-Kharrar lagoon. The results of this study indicate that within a small sabkha area of Al-Kharrar (3 x 17 km), a large variation in evaporite mineral types and morphologies grade into and are associated with MISS due to local environmental parameters. The interpretation of this association of evaporite minerals and MISS provides useful data for understanding the mechanisms responsible for precipitation of evaporite minerals and formation of MISS.

Microbial Mat Communities along an Oxygen Gradient in a Perennially Ice-Covered Antarctic Lake	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Lake Fryxell is a perennially ice-covered lake in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, with a sharp oxycline in a water column that is density stabilized by a gradient in salt concentration. Dissolved oxygen falls from 20 mg liter(-1) to undetectable over one vertical meter from 8.9- to 9.9-m depth. We provide the first description of the benthic mat community that falls within this oxygen gradient on the sloping floor of the lake, using a combination of micro-and macroscopic morphological descriptions, pigment analysis, and 16S rRNA gene bacterial community analysis. Our work focused on three macroscopic mat morphologies that were associated with different parts of the oxygen gradient: (i) "cuspate pinnacles" in the upper hyperoxic zone, which displayed complex topography and were dominated by phycoerythrin-rich cyanobacteria attributable to the genus Leptolyngbya and a diverse but sparse assemblage of pennate diatoms; (ii) a less topographically complex "ridge-pit" mat located immediately above the oxic-anoxic transition containing Leptolyngbya and an increasing abundance of diatoms; and (iii) flat prostrate mats in the upper anoxic zone, dominated by a green cyanobacterium phylogenetically identified as Phormidium pseudopriestleyi and a single diatom, Diadesmis contenta. Zonation of bacteria was by lake depth and by depth into individual mats. Deeper mats had higher abundances of bacteriochlorophylls and anoxygenic phototrophs, including Chlorobi and Chloroflexi. This suggests that microbial communities form assemblages specific to niche-like locations. Mat morphologies, underpinned by cyanobacterial and diatom composition, are the result of local habitat conditions likely defined by irradiance and oxygen and sulfide concentrations.					; Doran, Peter/ABS-7911-2022; Dillon, Megan/U-8656-2019; Sumner, Dawn/E-8744-2011; Eisen, Jonathan/H-2706-2019	Dillon, Megan/0000-0002-5706-6989; Hawes, Ian/0000-0003-2471-6903; Sumner, Dawn/0000-0002-7343-2061; Eisen, Jonathan A./0000-0002-0159-2197; Goroncy, Alexander/0000-0002-9192-174X; Mackey, Tyler/0000-0001-6377-3797													0099-2240	1098-5336				JAN	2016	82	2					620	630		10.1128/AEM.02699-15	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02699-15								26567300					WOS:000369373200021

We exposed a species-rich, summer phytoplankton assemblage from the mesotrophic Lake Schohsee (Germany) to logarithmically scaled abundance gradients of the microphagous cladoceran Daphnia hyalinaxgaleata and of a macrophagous copepod assemblage. Total phytoplankton biomass, chlorophyll a and primary production showed only a weak or even insignificant response to zooplankton density in both gradients. In contrast to the weak responses of bulk parameters, both zooplankton groups exerted a strong and contrasting influence on the phytoplankton species composition. The copepods suppressed large phytoplankton, while nanoplanktonic algae increased with increasing copepod density. Daphnia suppressed small algae, while larger species compensated in terms of biomass for the losses. Autotrophic picoplankton declined with zooplankton density in both gradients. Gelatinous, colonial algae were fostered by both zooplankton functional groups, while medium-sized (ca. 3,000 mum(3)), non-gelatinous algae were suppressed by both. The impact of a functionally mixed zooplankton assemblage became evident when Daphnia began to invade and grow in copepod mesocosms after ca. 10 days.

D. 1275 and 1300 [Miller GH, et al. (2012) Geophys Res Lett 39(2): L02708, 10.1029/2011GL050168]. Although this idea is supported by simulation experiments with general circulation models, additional support from field data are limited. In particular, the Northern Hemisphere network of temperature-sensitive millennial tree-ring chronologies, which principally comprises Eurasian sites, suggests that the strongest eruptions only caused cooling episodes lasting less than about 10 y. Here we present a new network of millennial tree-ring chronologies from the taiga of northeastern North America, which fills a wide gap in the network of the Northern Hemisphere's chronologies suitable for temperature reconstructions and supports the hypothesis that volcanoes triggered both the onset and the coldest episode of the Little Ice Age. Following the well-expressed Medieval Climate Anomaly (approximately A. D. 910-1257), which comprised the warmest decades of the last millennium, our tree-ring-based temperature reconstruction displays an abrupt regime shift toward lower average summer temperatures precisely coinciding with a series of 13th century eruptions centered around the 1257 Samalas event and closely preceding ice-cap expansion in Arctic Canada. Furthermore, the successive 1809 (unknown volcano) and 1815 (Tambora) eruptions triggered a subsequent shift to the coldest 40-y period of the last 1100 y. These results confirm that series of large eruptions may cause region-specific regime shifts in the climate system and that the climate of northeastern North America is especially sensitive to volcanic forcing.

J	Krawiec, ACL; Kaufman, DS				Krawiec, Anne C. L.; Kaufman, Darrell S.			Holocene storminess inferred from sediments of two lakes on Adak Island, Alaska	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												The abundance of sedimentary organic material from two lakes was used to infer past Holocene storminess on Adak Island where frequent storms generate abundant rainfall and extensive cloud cover. Andrew and Heart Lakes are located 10 km apart; their contrasting physical characteristics cause the sedimentary organic matter to respond differently to storms. Their records were synchronized using correlated tephra beds. Sedimentation rates increased between 4.0 and 3.5 ka in both lakes. Over the instrumental period, Andrew Lake biogenic-silica content (BSi) is most strongly correlated with winter sunlight availability, which influences photosynthetic production, and river input, which influences the dilution of BSi by mineral matter. Heart Lake BSi is likely affected by wind-driven remobilization of sediment, as suggested by correlations among BSI, the North Pacific Index, and winter storminess. The results indicate relatively stormy conditions from 9.6 to 4.0 ka, followed by drying between 4.0 and 2.7 ka, with the driest conditions from 2.7 to 1.5 ka. The stormiest period was between AD 500 and 1200, then drying from 1150 to 1500 and more variable until 1850. This record of Holocene storminess fills a major gap at the center of action for North Pacific wintertime climate. (C) 2014 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Intensive sampling over two years and various seasons has been completed. A multi-phase collection strategy (gas-, particle- and precipitation-phases) was employed to gain insight into the processes controlling concentrations and chemical/physical speciation of atmospheric Hg. Additional chemical and physical atmospheric determinations (e.g. ozone, particulate constituents, meteorology) were also made during these periods to aid in the interpretation of the Hg determinations. For example, correlations of Hg with ozone, sulfur dioxide and synoptic-scale meteorological features suggest a regionally discernible signal in Hg. Comparison to isosigma backward air parcel trajectories confirms this regionality and implicates the areas south southeast and northwest of the site to be sources for Hg. Particle-phase Hg (Hg-p) was found to be approximately 40% in an oxidized form, or operationally defined as ''reactive''. However, this was quite variable from year-to-year. Hg-p and other particle constituents (esp, sulfate) show significant correlation and similarity in behavior (concentration ratios in precipitation and in particles). These observations are part of the growing evidence to support the hypothesis that precipitation-phase Hg arises in large part from the scavenging of atmospheric particulates bearing Hg. Observed concentrations of rain and particle-Hg fit broadly the theoretical expectations for nucleation and below-cloud scavenging. Significant increases in the Hg/aerosol mass ratio appear to take place during transport. Enrichment of aerosols is taken as evidence of gas/particle conversion which could represent the step linking gas-phase Hg with rain The refined budget indicates ca. 24% of total deposition is from summer particle dry deposition, and that this deposition also contributes ca 24% of all reactive Hg deposition. Additionally, almost all (86%) deposition (wet and dry) occurs during the summer months.																			0049-6979					FEB	1995	80	1-4					189	198		10.1007/BF01189667	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01189667													WOS:A1995RM44200022

We addressed the possible interaction between these factors on two populations of the cosmopolitan charophytes Chara hispida and Chara vulgaris. Populations were taken from two different environments, a nitrate-poor mountain lake and a nitrate-rich Mediterranean coastal spring. The laboratory experiment had a 2 x 2 factorial design based on two nitrate levels (similar to and double the local conditions) and two temperatures. Increased temperatures favoured the growth of the four populations, but an increase in nitrate did not have any effect on their growth or architecture. Both species took up and stored more nitrogen (measured as %N in plant tissue) when more nitrate was supplied, and warming favoured this increase in %N and, consequently, in N:P ratio. The effects of both factors depended on the local conditions where the populations originated and on the species. Chara vulgaris, a pioneer species, exhibited more phenotypic plasticity than C. hispida, and its ecotype from the coastal spring was better adapted to changes in temperature and nitrate level. These differential responses to warming conditions and nitrate pollution may modify charophyte diversity, which might be reflected in ecosystem performance, a matter of concern in vulnerable Mediterranean water bodies where these species co-occur.

The travertines are composed of calcite + low-Mg calcite +/- aragonite. Both exhibit similar sedimentological transitions along their longitudinal profiles. In the proximal zones, biologically-influenced carbonates form in wetland-like environments. Spherulitic calcite precipitates in association with extracellular polymeric substances in microbial biofilms containing cyanobacteria-like molds at the vent of the south-facing travertine, while aragonite spherulite formation at the north-facing travertine vent also involves sulfate-reducing bacteria, as indicated by their close association with framboidal pyrite. Downstream, in the intermediate and distal zones, crystalline dendrites predominantly precipitate due to increased turbulence-induced CO2 degassing. Both travertines share a similar range of carbonate 87 Sr/ 86 Sr composition (0.70720-0.70740) and isotopic signatures of the spring waters, including S2H (ca.-110 %o VSMOW), S 18 O water (ca.-14 %o VSMOW) and S13C- DIC (ca.-5 %o VPDB), suggesting common sources and processes influencing fluid composition. This points to the dissolution of carbonates from mudstone-rich marine units of the Lower Cretaceous (S13C ca.-1 %o VPDB) and Upper Cretaceous (S13C ca.-10 %o VPDB) during shallow subsurface circulation of meteoric waters through the bedrock. The carbon isotopic composition of the deposits resembles those of endogenic travertines (S 13 C trav-1.2 to 5.3 %o VPDB), with the highest S 13 C trav values associated with carbonates from the vents. However, the involvement of deep CO2 sources is unclear and epigenic processes capable of producing the observed 13 C enrichments are discussed. Despite their common sources, similar sedimentological features and S 18 O trav compositional range (-12.4 to-10.1 %o VPDB), the S 13 C trav values are lower in the south-facing travertine (-1.2 to 1.9 %o VPDB) compared to the north-facing travertine (1.8 to 5.3 %o VPDB). This disparity is inferred to result from variations in local environmental conditions due to different levels of insolation, which favored the incorporation of soil-derived CO2 in the south-facing travertine and likely increased photosynthetic productivity in the north-facing travertine, thereby shifting their S 13 C trav signatures to lower and higher values, respectively. These relationships highlight the sensitivity of low-temperature spring carbonates to subtle environmental changes at basin scales.

In recent years, the ecological issues related to managing and restoring these critical aquatic ecosystems have come to the fore. Lingshui Pool (LSP) is one of the most-studied spring-fed lake ecosystems in south China, and it has well-preserved chronological profiles. The LSP was a very shallow lake before dam construction in 1962. Due to the dam's construction, rapid development and urbanization, this important freshwater ecosystem has suffered severe eutrophication and environmental degradation. In order to determine the environmental effects of recent anthropogenic disturbances and establish conservation recommendations for this lake ecosystem, we analyzed diatoms and weak-acid leachable elements from a well-dated sediment core from LSP to reconstruct the changes in aquatic conditions and diatom diversity during the period AD 1960-2013. This revealed shifts in diatom assemblages, diversity, and geochemistry that were strongly linked to the construction of a dam in 1962 and rapid eutrophication after 1990. Diatom diversity was stable and relatively high when submerged macrophytes were present between 1962 and 1990. Thus, the reintroduction of endemic macrophytes could benefit the ecological stability and diversity of this shallow lake.

Chlorophyll maxima and chlorophyll: Total phosphorus ratios in Missouri reservoirs	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Reducing the magnitude and frequency of peak algal biomass is a common goal of lake management. To better quantify such conditions in Missouri reservoirs, an upper boundary delineating maximum algal chlorophyll (Chl(max)) across the range of total phosphorus (TP) was developed using summer monitoring data (n = 8839) and compared with 2 other Missouri datasets (n = 8188 and 5151). Typically, other factors constrain Chl below the maximum, and most samples contained a fraction of Chl(max). Near maximum conditions (Chl(nm)) were provisionally defined as 70% of Chl(max); individual reservoirs differ in their history of supporting Chl(nm) measurements (from 0 to 43% of samples) irrespective of nutrient status or the duration of summer monitoring. There was a rapid increase in the yield of Chl(max) per unit TP across the oligo-mesotrophic range, while within the eutrophic range Chl(max) varied with changes in TP in a near-unity response. This general pattern was similar for Chl(nm) and provides a basis for predicting how high Chl levels would change with nutrient management. Values of Chl(max) in Missouri reservoirs are lower than lakes in Florida and larger than values in an international dataset, but the rate of change in Chl across the TP range is quite similar among these datasets, suggesting this pattern applies to different lake types.

A total of 61 taxa belonging to 36 genera and 5 taxonomic classes were identified. The ciliate assemblage was numerically dominated by spirotrichs (86% of total ciliates). This group is largely dominated by the choreotrichs (92%) among which tintinnids represented 99%. The total ciliates abundance showed a gradual decrease from the coastal area to the open sea and an increase from the surface to the bottom. The maximum abundance (400 cells l(-1)) and biomass (6.29 mu gC l(-1)) were found in station 27, close to Djerba Island. The tinitinnid Rhabdonella spiralis was cosmopolitan, being found almost at every station and at each depth, while other taxa may be exclusive to the neritic area, others to the open sea area. The distribution of species in the Gulf of Gabes seemed most likely influenced by the combined effects of hydrographic conditions, zooplankton predation and urban interferences.

Such understanding is severely limited by mechanistic models inability to reproduce the dynamics of multiple populations interacting in the field. We surpass this limitation here by extending general consumer-resource network theory to the complex dynamics of a specific ecosystem comprised by the seasonal biomass and production patterns in a pelagic food web of a large, well-studied lake. We parameterised our allometric trophic network model of 24 guilds and 107 feeding relationships using the lakes food web structure, initial spring biomasses and body-masses. Adding activity respiration, the detrital loop, minimal abiotic forcing, prey resistance and several empirically observed rates substantially increased the model's fit to the observed seasonal dynamics and the size-abundance distribution. This process illuminates a promising approach towards improving food-web theory and dynamic models of specific habitats.

On the premise that moraine lake is full, instantaneous burst in part of the lake bank happens, as flow velocity at burst mouth caused by overflow head is higher than threshold flow velocity of glacial till. Under some supposes, d(90) and d(10) of the glacial till in the hank were used as the threshold sizes of coarse and fine grains respectively. Thus, the formula of calculating threshold flow velocity of uniform sand was simplified, and threshold flow velocity of glacial till was calculated with the formula. Then, with synthesis formula calculating flow velocity of instantaneous part burst, flow velocity at overflow burst mouth was calculated, and calculation formula of critical height (H-0) of overflow head was derived. Overflow head was caused by volume and surge of glacial landslide falling into moraine lake, calculation formulas of ascendant height (H-1) of lake water surface and surge height (H-2) on burst mouth caused by glacial landslide falling into moraine lake were derived. To sum up, critical hydrologic conditions of moraine lake burst with overflow form are: the burst is inevitable as H-1 > H-0; the burst is possible as H-1 < H-0 and (H-1+H-2) > H-0; the burst is impossible as (H-1+H-2) < H-0. In the factors influencing the burst critical conditions, it is advantageous for the burst that scale of the lake is 10(5)m(2) range; terminal glacial till is more fine and is even more uniform; the width of overflow mouth is even smaller than the length of the bank; the landslide has large scale and steep slip surface; and glacial end is close to the lake. With burst of Guangxiecuo Lake in Midui Valley of the Polongzangbu River in Xizang as an example, the burst critical conditions were tested.					; Jiang, Liangwei/NXY-5523-2025	Cui, Peng/0000-0002-3973-5966; 													1002-0063	1993-064X				MAR	2004	14	1					39	47		10.1007/s11769-004-0007-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11769-004-0007-1													WOS:000206559400007

Determining lake surface water temperatures worldwide using a tuned one-dimensional lake model (FLake, v1)	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT												A tuning method for FLake, a one-dimensional (1-D) freshwater lake model, is applied for the individual tuning of 244 globally distributed large lakes using observed lake surface water temperatures (LSWTs) derived from along-track scanning radiometers (ATSRs). The model, which was tuned using only three lake properties (lake depth, snow and ice albedo and light extinction coefficient), substantially improves the measured mean differences in various features of the LSWT annual cycle, including the LSWTs of saline and high altitude lakes, when compared to the observed LSWTs. Lakes whose lake-mean LSWT persists below 1aEuro-A degrees C for part of the annual cycle are considered to be seasonally ice-covered. For trial seasonally ice-covered lakes (21 lakes), the daily mean and standard deviation (2 sigma) of absolute differences between the modelled and observed LSWTs are reduced from 3.07aEuro-A degrees CaEuro-+/- aEuro-2.25aEuro-A degrees C to 0.84aEuro-A degrees CaEuro-+/- aEuro-0.51aEuro-A degrees C by tuning the model. For all other trial lakes (14 non-ice-covered lakes), the improvement is from 3.55aEuro-A degrees CaEuro-+/- aEuro-3.20aEuro-A degrees C to 0.96aEuro-A degrees CaEuro-+/- aEuro-0.63aEuro-A degrees C. The post tuning results for the 35 trial lakes (21 seasonally ice-covered lakes and 14 non-ice-covered lakes) are highly representative of the post-tuning results of the 244 lakes. For the 21 seasonally ice-covered lakes, the modelled response of the summer LSWTs to changes in snow and ice albedo is found to be statistically related to lake depth and latitude, which together explain 0.50 (R-adj(2), p = 0.001) of the inter-lake variance in summer LSWTs. Lake depth alone explains 0.35 (p = 0.003) of the variance. Lake characteristic information (snow and ice albedo and light extinction coefficient) is not available for many lakes. The approach taken to tune the model, bypasses the need to acquire detailed lake characteristic values. Furthermore, the tuned values for lake depth, snow and ice albedo and light extinction coefficient for the 244 lakes provide some guidance on improving FLake LSWT modelling.

During winter 2007, an intensive sampling campaign was conducted to monitor the temporal and spatial variations of the nitrification capacity within the two plug-flow reactors. At the beginning of the six-week study, the CAS train was partially nitrifying, whereas the IFFAS train was nitrifying completely using the first two IFFAS cells only. Within one week, the CAS train lost nitrification because of a drop in solids retention time and pH caused by the onset of iron overdosing. When the IFFAS train received an iron spike, the carriers at the injection point (first cell) became iron-coated and lost 80% of their nitrification capacity. However, this train maintained its total nitrification capacity using the reserve capacity in the three remaining cells. Water Environ.

In an outflow lake-river system, water levels are reduced by a reservoir constructed at the river, which interferes with the river-lake interrelationships by impairing the river's blocking effect. This increases the lake-river hydraulic gradient and accelerates the lake's drainage to the river, resulting in shrinkage of the lake and damaging environmental issues. To respond to these issues, we propose an environmental flow assessment that considers the river's blocking effect on the lake. This novel methodology consists of four steps: data preparation, assessment of the lake's environmental water level, assessment of the river's environmental water level, and environmental flow assessment. We estimated the river's environmental water level through a hydraulic correlation between the lake and the river, and found that the river's blocking effect could be sustained. The Yangtze-Poyang system was selected as a case study to illustrate the methodology's procedures and applicability. The impoundment of the Three Gorges Reservoir, during the fall retreating season, decreased the Yangtze's water level and weakened the Yangtze's blocking effect on Poyang Lake. Poyang Lake's environmental water level, which ranges from 11.71 to 15.81 m in the month of October, was used to estimate the Yangtze's environmental water level as falling in a range of 11.95 to 16.17 m, which corresponds to an environmental flow range of 16,822 to 32,371 m(3)/s. This study offers a solution for reservoir-induced accelerated lake drainage, which may be helpful in mitigating the negative impacts of reservoirs and sustaining natural rive-lake interactions.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				AUG	2018	190	8							453	10.1007/s10661-018-6825-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-018-6825-x								29982885					WOS:000437845000003
J	Roadcap, GS; Kelly, WR; Bethke, CM				Roadcap, GS; Kelly, WR; Bethke, CM			Geochemistry of extremely alkaline (pH &gt; 12) ground water in slag-fill aquifers	GROUND WATER												Extremely alkaline ground water has been found underneath many shuttered steel mills and slag dumps and has been an impediment to the cleanup and economic redevelopment of these sites because little is known about the geochemistry. A large number of these sites occur in the Lake Calumet region of Chicago, Illinois, where large-scale infilling of the wetlands with steel slag has created an aquifer with pH values as high as 12.8. To understand the geochemistry of the alkaline ground water system, we analyzed samples of ground water and the associated slag and weathering products from four sites. We also considered several potential remediation schemes to lower the pH and toxicity of the water. The principal cause of the alkaline conditions is the weathering of calcium silicates within the slag. The resulting ground water at most of the sites is dominated by Ca2+ and OH- in equilibrium with Ca(OH)(2). Where the alkaline ground water discharges in springs, atmospheric CO2 dissolves into the water and thick layers of calcite form. Iron, manganese, and other metals in the metallic portion of the slag have corroded to form more stable low-temperature oxides and sulfides and have not accumulated in large concentrations in the ground water. Calcite precipitated at the springs is rich in a number of heavy metals, suggesting that metals can move through the system as particulate matter. Air sparging appears to be an effective remediation strategy for reducing the toxicity of discharging alkaline water.																			0017-467X					NOV-DEC	2005	43	6					806	816		10.1111/j.1745-6584.2005.00060.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6584.2005.00060.x								16324002					WOS:000233323800009

Accurately monitoring the dynamics of LRFS over long time series is fundamental and essential for their sustainable development. However, challenges remain because the spatial distribution of LRFS is never static due to inter- and intra-annual changes in environmental conditions. In this study, we developed and tested a methodological framework to re-construct the long-term wetland dynamics in Dongting Lake, China, utilizing an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm (UMLA) on the basis of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) time series. Our results showed that the UMLA achieved comparable performance to the time-consuming satellite image segmentation method with a Kappa coefficient of agreement greater than 0.75 and an overall accuracy over 85%. With the re-constructed annual wetland distribution maps, we found that 31.35% of wet meadows, one of most important ecological assets in the region, disappeared at an average rate of c.a. 1660 ha year(-1)during the past two decades, which suggests that the Dongting Lake is losing its ecological function of providing wintering ground for migratory water birds, and remediation management actions are urgently required. We concluded that UMLA offers a fast and cost-efficient alternative to monitor ecological responses in a rapidly changing environment.

It can be caused by several species of Eimeria. We sequenced the complete mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) of Eimeria anseris from wintering greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons) in China. The complete E. anseris mtDNA is 6179bp in size and contains three protein-coding genes (CYT B, COI, and COIII), 12 gene fragments for large subunit ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and seven gene fragments for small subunit rRNA, but no transfer RNA genes. Available complete Eimeria mtDNA sequences are highly conserved in sequence: the sequences are all similar in length; with the same three protein-coding genes and fragmented rRNA genes; ATG is generally the start codon, and TAA and TAG are the most frequently used stop codons. Our molecular phylogenetic analyses show some species clustering into host-specific clades, but many species do not follow clear coevolutionary host segregating patterns. The results suggest that Eimeria spp. from turkeys and chickens are paraphyletic groups, while Eimeria species isolated from rabbits are a monophyletic group. E. anseris, which infects A. albifrons, and another group of Eimeria isolated from chickens form a closely related monophyletic clade.																			0932-0113	1432-1955				APR	2019	118	4					1299	1306		10.1007/s00436-019-06252-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-019-06252-7								30778751					WOS:000462200300022

Timing and spatial distribution of mid-Holocene drying over northern China: Response to a southeastward retreat of the East Asian Monsoon	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												[1] To determine the timing and spatial distribution of mid-Holocene drying over northern China, the mineralogical and oxygen isotopic composition of authigenic carbonate from a closed lake at Bayanchagan, southern Inner Mongolia, were measured. Further analysis and synthesis of the spatial geological data were performed. Results from Lake Bayanchagan show a significant drying at 6000 calendar years (cal years) B. P., indicated by dolomite precipitation and a striking rise in delta(18) O values. The synthesis of spatial data reveals a zonal distribution for timing of drying over northern China in the mid-Holocene, which began at 9000-7000 cal years B. P. in deserts of north-central China. At 7000-5500 cal years B. P., drying extended into the desert-steppe transitional zone and at similar to 4500 cal years B. P. into northeastern and south-central China. This pattern indicates that the east Asian summer monsoon has significantly retreated southeastward since the mid-Holocene, which may be related to orbitally induced Northern Hemisphere insolation changes. A retreat of similar to 400-550 km is inferred for the front of the summer monsoon from 6500 to 4500 cal years B.

J	Hupfer, M; Lewandowski, J				Hupfer, M; Lewandowski, J			Retention and early diagenetic transformation of phosphorus in Lake Arendsee (Germany) - consequences for management strategies	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Repeated sediment core investigations over one decade, mass balance calculations, and vertical flux measurements by traps and dialysis samplers, were used to determine P retention rates, release potential, and early diagenetic transformation processes in the sediment of Lake Arendsee (Germany). Sediment cores were dated by varve Counting, by 137 cesium, and by a distinct layer originating from a restoration attempt in 1995, which involved the capping of the sediment with calcium rich material from the lake shore. P retention rates and the internal P cycle have not been altered by the sediment capping. The sharp decline of total P content within the first two centimeters of the sediment shows that diagenetic P mobilization is a rapid process. The temporary P pool in the sediment, calculated from core analysis (mean SE: 709 82 mg m(-2), n = 7), was small compared to the rates of hypolininetic SRP increase (10.7 +/- 0.45 mg m(-2) d(-1), 1992-1997) and total P losses in the epilimnion caused by sedimentation (11.7 +/- 0.53 mg m(-2) d(-1), 1992-1997), both of the latter calculated by mass balances during summer stratification. Without additional supply of freshly settled material, the temporary P pool in the sediment would be exhausted in less than three months. The fast P release of freshly settled material was also demonstrated during summer by the three times higher vertical P sedimentation rates calculated on the basis of mass balance data, compared to rates determined on the basis of cylindrical traps, in which some P was released during four weeks exposure time. The driving process for the rapid P release in Lake Arendsee is the remineralisation of organic P. This study demonstrates that high hypolimnetic P accumulation rates are not always correlated with a large total or potentially mobile P pool in the sediment. In lakes with small temporary P pools in the sediment, a decrease of P in the water body would immediately decrease the hypolimnetic P accumulation in summer; capping or dredging as in-lake measures are ineffective in such lakes.

Observed and simulated winter temperature over Gurudongmar area, North Sikkim, India	MAUSAM												The global warming and its impact on the cryosphere is a matter of serious concern. The Sikkim and the Eastern Himalaya are a canvas of vivid landscapes and of different climate zones. The study of cryosphere needs more attention on long term climatic trends of surface air temperature. The Gurudongmar area is very much important because this area is surrounded by glaciers and as well as cold desert and TsoLhamo Lake nearby. The Gurudongmar lake (located at an altitude of 17,800 ft) has been studied by several researchers in the context of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) and reported a high risk lake which is being largely affected by global warming and climate change. The present study is aimed to investigate the trend of temperature in recent past and in future time periods over the study area of Sikkim. The observed and model's simulated gridded temperature data is considered to inkling of rising trend in winter months of December-January-February (DJF) over the study area. An increase in temperature is found for the future time period. This can be linked to the increasing hazard risk and change in local cryosphere environment.

J	Knauer, K; Nepf, HM; Hemond, HF				Knauer, K; Nepf, HM; Hemond, HF			The production of chemical heterogeneity in Upper Mystic Lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Chemical heterogeneity in a lake may arise from spatially and temporally nonuniform inputs or from spatially nonuniform transformation rates within the water body. The potential for heterogeneity to persist at a given spatial scale then depends on the relative magnitudes of the hydraulic residence time, the timescale for mixing, and the timescale for transformations to and from the chemical species of interest. Through simple scaling arguments, the potential for heterogeneity in total arsenic (As) and arsenic speciation were predicted for Upper Mystic Lake, a small urban lake near Boston, Massachusetts. Specifically, heterogeneity in total arsenic was expected during periods of high inflow-which are typical of spring conditions-given a sufficient magnitude of inflow variation. Heterogeneity in As(III) was expected throughout the year, whenever spatial variations in the net As(V)-to-As(III) transformation rate exceeded a few percent per day. Observed heterogeneity was consistent with these predictions. Although modest, heterogeneity in total As was highest in early spring (7%, expressed as the spatial standard deviation divided by the lakewide mean). By contrast, heterogeneity of As(III) was as high as 36%, indicating that spatial variation in oxidation and reduction rates is sufficient to contribute to heterogeneity. Heterogeneity in As(III) varied significantly from month to month.

Late Wisconsinan and Holocene development of the Grand Lake Meadows area and southern reaches of the Saint John River Valley, New Brunswick, Canada	ATLANTIC GEOLOGY												A 67 m near-continuous stratigraphic core was recovered from drilling at Grand Lake Meadows, located near the junction of Grand Lake and the Saint John River, approximately 40 km south of Fredericton, New Brunswick. From analyses of recovered samples and finite radiocarbon dating, four phases of development of the study site and surrounding environs were identified to have occurred following the Late Wisconsinan glacial maximum. Phase I, related to the formation of the DeGeer Sea, commenced more than 15 000 calyBP from deglaciation accompanied by marine transgression. Phase II began similar to 14 000 calyBP and continued until approximately similar to 8000 calyBP during which time there was major isostatic readjustment in the region and formation of a stratified, mostly brackish, ancestral Grand Lake and transformation into a mostly freshwater, Lake Acadia. Phase III began shortly after 8000 calyBP and continued until after 3000 calyBP accompanied by return of the Saint John River to a fluvial-dominated system after down-cutting an outlet at the Reversing Falls gorge, and draining much of Lake Acadia. During phase IV, similar to 3000 calyBP to present, estuarine conditions were initiated as marine water advanced upstream over the Reversing Falls, leading to the development of the modern river system and Grand Lake Meadows.																			0843-5561	1718-7885					2015	51						206	220		10.4138/atlgeol.2015.007	http://dx.doi.org/10.4138/atlgeol.2015.007													WOS:000384236400001

Previous work has shown that temperatures around 6-8 degrees C trigger the onset of this sheltering behaviour. However, fish from colder environments would be expected to respond differently to temperature than fish from warmer environments. The incidence of sheltering at different temperatures between two Icelandic populations of both juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and juvenile Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) was examined by quantifying the use of refuges in identical controlled laboratory conditions. The results showed clear differences in the sheltering response between the different populations. Salmon from a warm, productive stream and riverine char emerged more by day from their shelter at low temperatures (5-8 degrees C) than did either salmon from a cold, unproductive stream or char from a landlocked lake population. These population differences indicate local adaptations that must be kept in mind when managing fish populations; moreover, the differences do not appear to be predictable on the basis of ambient thermal regimes.					; Metcalfe, Neil/C-5997-2009	Metcalfe, Neil/0000-0002-1970-9349; 													0706-652X					APR	2000	57	4					719	724		10.1139/cjfas-57-4-719	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-57-4-719													WOS:000086445800006

We describe the study design and report baseline characteristics of the study participants, including the proportion of participants with acute or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection at enrollment. Methods At enrollment and subsequent timepoints, participants recruited through digital and paper-based advertising campaigns reported their occupational and school-based exposure, risk factors, and behaviors, and provided nasal and serum specimens. Stratified enrichment was used to enhance enrollment into medium- and higher-risk groups within four occupational risk groups for SARS-CoV-2 infection. RT-PCR and serologic (IgG) testing were conducted to detect acute or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection in participants, respectively. Results Between November 2020 and January 2021, 1008 participants (female 70.7%, mean age +/- SD 51 +/- 13.8 years) completed the questionnaire and diagnostic testing. Among participants, 41.8% (n = 421) were considered low risk, 24.6% (n = 248) were medium-to-low risk, 22.3% (n = 225) were medium-to-high risk, and 11.3% (n = 114) were high risk. Of 56 (5.6%) participants with evidence of acute or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline, 11 (19.6%) were RT-PCR-positive, 36 (64.3%) were IgG-seropositive, and 9 (16.1%) were positive by both assays. Participants who were adherent vs nonadherent to social distancing measures (odds ratio [95% CI] 0.8 [0.4-1.8]) were less likely, while those in higher vs lower occupational risk groups (2.0 [1.0-4.4]) were more likely to have evidence for acute or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusion In fall/winter 2020/21, 5.6% of adults in a Lake County convenience sample had evidence for acute or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline. Nonadherence to social distancing measures and high-risk professions were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study is ongoing and future analyses will assess infection status over time.

The Hamburg meteorite fall: Fireball trajectory, orbit, and dynamics	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE												The Hamburg (H4) meteorite fell on 17 January 2018 at 01:08 UT approximately 10 km north of Ann Arbor, Michigan. More than two dozen fragments totaling under 1 kg were recovered, primarily from frozen lake surfaces. The fireball initial velocity was 15.83 +/- 0.05 km s(-1), based on four independent records showing the fireball above 50 km altitude. The radiant had a zenith angle of 66.14 +/- 0.29 degrees and an azimuth of 121.56 +/- 1.2 degrees. The resulting low inclination (<1 degrees) Apollo-type orbit has a large aphelion distance and Tisserand value relative to Jupiter (T-j) of similar to 3. Two major flares dominate the energy deposition profile, centered at 24.1 and 21.7 km altitude, respectively, under dynamic pressures of 5-7 MPa. The Geostationary Lightning Mapper on the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-16 also detected the two main flares and their relative timing and peak flux agree with the video-derived brightness profile. Our preferred total energy for the Hamburg fireball is 2-7 T TNT (8.4-28 x 10(9) J), which corresponds to a likely initial mass in the range of 60-225 kg or diameter between 0.3 and 0.5 m. Based on the model of Granvik et al. (2018), the meteorite originated in an escape route from the mid to outer asteroid belt. Hamburg is the 14th known H chondrite with an instrumentally derived preatmospheric orbit, half of which have small (<5 degrees) inclinations making connection with (6) Hebe problematic. A definitive parent body consistent with all 14 known H chondrite orbits remains elusive.

We used experiments to determine multiple reproductive parameters for E. affinis. In all experiments, we fed E affinis a mixture of Rhodomonas marina and Isochrysis galbana. Couples of pre-adult females (G) and adult males were mated until the female extruded a clutch of eggs and then individual females were observed every 6-12 hours until death to determine (a) embryonic development time, (b) inter clutch time and (c) clutch size throughout their adult lifespan. All reproductive parameters were negatively affected by low temperature (10 degrees C) and by high salinity (25). At 10 degrees C and a salinity of 25, mortality during the post-embryonic period was extremely high (85%). Differences in all reproductive parameters between salinities 5 and 15 were minimal. From 15 degrees C to 10 degrees C mean latency time (time between hatching of eggs and extrusion of new ones) increased from 0.8 to 2.25 days, the mean embryonic development time from 2.2 to 3.2 days and the mean clutch size decreased from 38 to 22 eggs female(-1). The mean clutch size decreased when females reached a critical age. The hatching success was high (near 95%) under all conditions except at high salinity. Egg production rates showed no significant differences between salinities 5 and 15 and were significantly higher at 15 degrees C (13 eggs female(-1) day(-1) at salinity 5 and 15) than at 10 degrees C (4 eggs female(-1) day(-1)). These values at 15 degrees C were higher compared to those from other populations of E affinis in estuaries or lakes. The high reproductive potential of E affinis from the Seine estuary at 15 degrees C and low salinities explain its high densities in the low salinity zone during spring and early summer.

More than 100 species of birds belonging to 38 families were recorded at lake during the year 2002, maximum species were sighted during the winter season. Due to scanty rainfall in 2002, this lake was also affected and had only one-fourth of water of its total capacity, which affected the numbers of migratory waterfowl also. In the wetland most water birds were found to be migratory and few being resident. Some rare, endangered, uncommon, vulnerable, threatened and near threatened species of birds those already listed in Red Data Book were sighted.																			0254-8704	2394-0379				JUL	2005	26	3					579	583											16334300					WOS:000230097000019

The moult of 16 hand-raised birds was also followed in experimental photoperiodic conditions simulating different hatching dates. The data from caged birds showed that the extent of moult in the Great Tit is photoperiodically controlled. Autumn short-light days reduce the extent of moult. The data from moulting birds trapped in the wild agreed with experimental results and revealed that the timing of feather replacement influenced the individual extent of moult. Annual variation in the extent of moult was influenced by the timing of breeding in the population. A possible explanation for the decline in the extent of moult during migration is discussed.

It has been shown that the allochthonous microflora, which is brought into the lake with the resort effluent in mid-summer, is the anthropogenic factor contributing to an increase in the number of freshwater bacteria that feature multiple antibiotic resistance in the central part of the lake. It has been found that resistance to ampicillin of freshwater and halophile heterotrophic bacteria is related to the increase in the biomass of blue-green and green algae in the central part of Shira lake between mid-July and the end of August. A mathematical model has been constructed to describe the dynamics of the antibiotic resistance of heterotrophic bacteria in the close-to-resort and the central parts of Shira lake under natural and anthropogenic impacts.

J	Gagné, V; Lavoie, C				Gagne, Vincent; Lavoie, Claude			Efficient and rapid control of Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum) by combining benthic mats and hand pulling	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum L.) is an aquatic vascular plant that forms extensive dense beds in lakes. This invader competes with native plants, interferes with aquatic activities, and decreases riparian property values. In Canada, the use of aquatic herbicides is highly restricted. Environmental managers must therefore rely on physical methods such as hand pulling or benthic matting for control. Although these methods are not new, there has been little scientific investigation regarding their effectiveness and cost over multiple years. Benthic matting and hand pulling were used in Lac des Abenaquis (area: 1.2 km(2)) to control 3.6 ha of M. spicatum beds. Initiated by citizens in 2016, control procedures were scientifically studied in 2020 and 2021. Benthic fiberglass mats were deployed on dense M. spicatum patches for 10 wk. Isolated plants and patches <100 m(2) were hand pulled by divers, and the harvested material surfaced via a suction hose or in hand-filled bags. By August 2021, all the M. spicatum patches had been eliminated, and only 560 widely scattered plants remained. Over the last 2 yr of control, hand pulling required 243 person-hours and removed 2,245 kg of biomass. The biomass brought to the surface was 2.4 times higher per person-hour with the suction system than with bags. The use of 1,000 m(2) of benthic mats required 47 to 51 person-hours per summer season, including installation, removal, and maintenance. Intensive management (years 1 to 5) using benthic mats and hand pulling cost an estimated Can$185,000 (US$140,000) ha(-1) of M. spicatum bed. Hand pulling of scattered individuals (years 6+), estimated at Can$20,000 (US$15,000) per summer, is essential to avoid reinfestation. An invasion of M. spicatum can successfully be managed in small lakes without herbicides, but control remains a costly and long-term endeavor.

Past and Future Changes in Arctic Lake and River Ice	AMBIO												Paleolimnological evidence from some Arctic lakes suggests that longer ice-free seasons have been experienced since the beginning of the nineteenth century. It has been inferred from some additional records that many Arctic lakes may have crossed an important ecological threshold as a result of recent warming. In the instrumental record, long-term trends exhibit increasingly later freeze-ups and earlier break-ups, closely corresponding to increasing air temperature trends, but with greater sensitivity at the more temperate latitudes. Broad spatial patterns in these trends are also related to major atmospheric circulation patterns. Future projections of lake ice indicate increasingly later freeze-ups and earlier break-ups, decreasing ice thickness, and changes in cover composition, particularly white-ice. For rivers, projected future decreases in south to north air-temperature gradients suggest that the severity of ice-jam flooding may be reduced but this could be mitigated by changes in the magnitude of spring snowmelt.					; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa/Y-6135-2019; Duguay, Claude/G-5682-2011; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019; McNamara, James/F-1993-2011	McNamara, James/0000-0001-7625-4507; Duguay, Claude/0000-0002-1044-5850; Pienitz, Reinhard/0000-0002-3613-1673; Beltaos, Spyros/0000-0002-2247-8588; Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; Korhola, Atte A./0000-0003-2577-6502													0044-7447	1654-7209				DEC	2011	40			1			53	62		10.1007/s13280-011-0216-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-011-0216-7													WOS:000305284800007

Two new species of the subterranean amphipod genus Stygobromus (Amphipoda: Crangonyctidae) from Siberia, with new data on Stygobromus pusillus (Martynov) and remarks on morphology and biogeographic relationships	ZOOTAXA												Two new species of the subterranean amphipod genus Stygobromus are described from groundwater habitats in Siberia: Stygobromus mikhaili n. sp. from a spring in the Central Altay Mountains and Stygobromus anastasiae n. sp. from two non-freezing springs in South Pribaikalye in the Irkutsk area. Additional taxonomic details of the previously described S. pusillus (Martynov) from Teletskoye Lake, also in Central Altay, are illustrated based on syntype material. Utilization of SEM has revealed a tiny structure on antenna 2 that appears to be a new character, and may prove useful in future analyses. Descriptions of the two new species raise the total number of described species in the genus Stygobromus to 134, but four or possibly five have been found in the Palearctic region outside North America. However, it is likely that continued exploration of subterranean groundwater habitats in Siberia and other parts of the Palearctic will reveal additional new species of Stygobromus and provide more insight into the origin and geographic distribution of this large, northern hemisphere, subterranean freshwater amphipod genus. Careful evaluation of taxonomic affinities of the new species and comparison with previously described congeners should provide further insight into the biogeographic history of Stygobromus.

Between 8000 and 5300 cal yr B.P., a warm, dry climate and zonal atmospheric circulation produced enriched stable oxygen and carbon isotopic values in combination with high percentages of pine pollen and sustained influx of charcoal particles. After 5300 cal yr B.P., decreasing isotopic values in mart and increasing pollen percentages of mesic hardwoods and northern white cedar indicate increase meridional air flow and precipitation from cold winter storms generated in Alberta, Canada. After 3000 cal yr B.P., abrupt declines in values of delta(13)C and delta(18)O and increased pollen representation of hemlock, American beech, spruce, and aquatic plants indicate paludification from increased lake-effect snowfall. The moisture was derived from the Great Lakes and transported by Alberta cyclonic storms that were steered across Lakes Superior and Michigan by a southward shift in the modal winter position of the polar jet stream.

J	Gao, SD; Tanji, KK; Peters, DW; Lin, ZQ; Terry, N				Gao, SD; Tanji, KK; Peters, DW; Lin, ZQ; Terry, N			Selenium removal from irrigation drainage water flowing through constructed wetland cells with special attention to accumulation in sediments	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												A flow-through experimental wetland system has been under investigation since 1996 to remove selenium (Se) from agricultural drainage water in the Tulare Lake Drainage District at Corcoran, California, U. S. A. The system consists of ten cells which have dimensions of 15 x 76 m continuously flooded and various substrates planted. The objectives of this article are to present the overall performance in Se removal after establishing the wetland for three years, and to examine factors affecting Se removal with special attention to accumulation in the sediments. In 1999, The wetland cells reduced Se from inflow water by 32 to 65% in concentration and 43 to 89% in mass. Vegetation plays an important role in Se removal as non-vegetated cell showed the least removal of Se. The inflow drainage water was dominated by selenate (Se(VI), 91%) with smaller percentages of selenite (Se(IV), 7%) and organic Se (org-Se(II-), 2%). The outflow water from the cells contained an average of 47% Se(VI), 32% Se(IV) and 21% org-Se indicating reduction processes occurring in the wetland cells. The surface sediment appears as a large sink of Se removal. The highest Se concentration was found in fallen litter, followed by the fine organic detrital layer on the sediment surface. The sediment Se concentration dramatically decreased with increasing sediment depth. The mass distribution of Se, however, was sediment (0-20 cm) > fine detrital matter > fallen litter. Fractionation of surface sediment (0-5 cm) reveals that elemental Se was the largest fraction (ave. 47%) followed by organic matter-associated Se (34%). Soluble, adsorbed, and carbonate-associated Se accounted for 1.2, 3.1 and 2.5% of the total sediment Se, respectively. The major Se sink mechanism in the cells is the reduction of selenate to elemental Se and immobilization into the organic phase of the sediments.																			0049-6979	1573-2932					2003	144	1					263	284		10.1023/A:1022915515425	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1022915515425													WOS:000181767100016
J	Pauls, GJ; Sauer, EK; Christiansen, EA; Widger, RA				Pauls, GJ; Sauer, EK; Christiansen, EA; Widger, RA			A transient analysis of slope stability following drawdown after flooding of a highly plastic clay	CANADIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL												The stability of slopes at bridge abutments across the Carrot River in east-central Saskatchewan was not influenced significantly by drawdown after flooding in the spring of 1995. Traditional methods of analysis for rapid drawdown predicted the factor of safety of slopes on highly plastic clays of proglacial Lake Agassiz would drop to 0.65 from an initial value of 1.0. Deformation along a well-defined slip plane has persisted at a more or less constant, slow rate since the bridge was constructed in 1975. The river rose approximately 10 m during a flood in the spring of 1995, yet there was only minimal response in piezometers and no measurable increase in the rate of deformation recorded by inclinometers. Pore-water pressures from a steady state seepage model, which was calibrated from piezometer measurements, were integrated into a stability analysis. Changes in pore-water pressures caused by flooding and subsequent drawdown were characterized from a transient seepage model using the flood hydrograph as a flux boundary. The stability analysis integrated with the transient seepage model estimated the factor of safety would drop from 1.0 to 0.91 after drawdown. Field measurements indicated the reduction in factor of safety was even less.																			0008-3674	1208-6010					1999	36	6					1151	1171		10.1139/cgj-36-6-1151	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cgj-36-6-1151													WOS:000085764500013

Climate and energy balance of the ground in University Valley, Antarctica	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												We report 3 years of data from one meteorological and three smaller stations in University Valley, a high-elevation (1677 m) site in the Dry Valleys of Antarctica with extensive dry permafrost. Mean air temperature was -23.4 degrees C. Summer air temperatures were virtually always < 0 degrees C and were consistent with the altitude lapse rate and empirical relationships between summer temperature, distance from the coast and elevation. The measured frost point (-22.5 degrees C) at the 42 cm deep ice table is equal to the surface frost point and above the atmospheric frost point (-29.6 degrees C), providing direct evidence that surface conditions control ground ice depth. Observed peak surface soil temperatures reach 6 degrees C for ice-cemented ground > 15 cm deep but stay < 0 degrees C when it is shallower. We develop an energy balance model tuned to this rocky and dry environment. We find that differences in peak soil surface temperatures are primarily due to the higher thermal diffusivity of ice-cemented ground compared to dry soil. Sensitivity studies show that expected natural variability is insufficient for melt to form and significant excursions from current conditions are required. The site's ice table meets the criteria for a Special Region on Mars, with 30% of the year > -18 degrees C and water activity > 0.6.					; Davila, Alfonso/A-2198-2013	McKay, Christopher/0000-0002-6243-1362; Marinova, Margarita/0000-0001-6741-6295													0954-1020	1365-2079				APR	2022	34	2					144	171	PII S0954102022000025	10.1017/S0954102022000025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954102022000025		APR 2022											WOS:000784033200001
J	Usmanova, RM				Usmanova, RM			Aral Sea and sustainable development	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY					3rd World Water Congress of the International-Water-Association	APR 07-12, 2002	MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA	Int Water Assoc				Until 1960 the Aral Sea was considered the 4th largest lake in the world by surface area. The Aral Sea has two main inflows - the Amudarya and Syrdarya rivers with about 30 tributaries. From early 1960s because of extensive water use - unreturned withdrawal of water for irrigation and consequent drying up of many tributaries before reaching the main rivers - the water level in the Aral Sea began falling very rapidly. In 1965 the Aral Sea received about 56 cubic km of fresh water yearly, but this number fell to zero by the early 1980s. By 1990 the level of the Aral Sea water fell by more than 17 m, the volume of water decreased by 75%, the salinity of seawater increased up to 30 g/l, and the surface area of the sea reduced from 66,400 sq. km to 31,500 sq. km. The ecological situation in Aral Sea zone has became very dramatic. It has led to the changing of climate in the region, irrigated soils becoming deserts, deterioration of underground and surface water quality, reducing of available water for domestic and agricultural needs, loss of Aral Sea fishing and transportation importance, numerous other problems and finally put the health of present and future generations under threat. This situation not only does not promote further development of the economy of the region, but has also caused damage with irreparable negative consequences. The fact is that the basis of the regional economy is fishing and other associated businesses. Since Uzbekistan is most agricultural country its economy has serious complications. In order to prevent further deepening of this catastrophe and to improve the present situation in this area the Government of the Republic of Uzbekistan has developed a series of measures: in particular it developed efficient water use schemes, changing the cotton situation (that during the Soviet period was grown as monoculture) by planting less water-consuming varieties, reviewing using of fertilizers in agriculture etc. The Aral Sea drought became an international disaster. World Bank, UNESCO, BMBF and others attacked the problem to protect the Aral Sea.																			0273-1223						2003	47	7-8					41	47		10.2166/wst.2003.0669	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2003.0669								12793660					WOS:000183453700006

Bacterial reads at all sites were dominated (>85%) by Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. Amongst phototrophs, microscopy and 16S sequencing revealed that both phytoplankton and cyanobacteria were represented, with a median of 1500 cyanobacterial sequence reads amongst 13 samples analyzed. The sequence analysis compared replicate Balaton and Ferto ice and water samples with an outgroup from three Hungarian soda lakes. In particular, both water and ice from Ferto contained high contributions from cyanobacteria. Two percent of total reads identified to the level of family in water at Nab were dominated by a single operational taxonomic unit (OTU) of a cyanobacterium within the Rivulariaceae, which was largely absent from ice. Conversely, ice samples from both lakes yielded an abundant OTU assigned to a Flavobacterium sp. known to be associated with freshwater ice. Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) revealed that the ice communities from all sites were similar to one another, and that the water communities did not cluster together. Fluorescence emission spectra obtained at 77 K confirmed the presence of intact cyanobacteria in Fento water and ice. Photosynthetic characterization of phototrophs resident in water and ice analyzed by assay of acid-stable photosynthetic (HCO3-)-C-14 incorporation showed that communities from both phases were photosynthetically active, thus adding to growing recognition of ice-covered lakes as viable habitat for phototrophs.

J	Blair, TC				Blair, TC			Sedimentology of the debris-flow-dominate Warm Spring Canyon alluvial fan, Death Valley, California	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Facies analysis of widely distributed exposures of the 32.6 km(2) and 8.1-km-long Warm Spring Canyon fan, central Death Valley, shows that it has been built principally by debris-now deposits. These deposits were derived from a mature Panamint Range catchment mostly underlain by Precambrian mudrock, quartzite and dolomite. Stacked, clast-rich and matrix-supported debris-flow lobes of slightly bouldery, muddy, pebble-cobble gravel in beds 20-150 cm thick dominate the fan from apex to toe, accounting for 75-98% of most exposures. Interstratified with the debris flows are less abundant (2-25% of cuts), thinner (5-30 cm) and more discontinuous beds of clast-supported and imbricated, pebble-cobble gravel deposited by overland flows and gully flows. This facies formed by the surficial fine-fraction water winnowing of the debris flows primarily during recessional flood stage of the debris-flow events. Two other facies associations make up a small part of the fan. The incised-channel tract consists of a 250-m-wide clast-supported ribbon of irregularly to thickly bedded, boulder, pebble, cobble gravel nested within debris-flow deposits. This channel fill is oriented generally perpendicular to the Panamint range front. It formed by extensive erosion and winnowing of debris flows deposited within the incised channel, into which all water discharge from the catchment is funnelled. The limited presence of this facies only straddling the present incised channel indicates that this channel overall has maintained a consistent position on the fan except for slight lateral shifts, some caused by strike-slip offset. Fault offset temporarily closed the upper incised channel, causing recessional debris-flow mud to be ponded behind the dam. The other local facies assemblage consists of subrounded to rounded, moderately sorted pebble gravel in low-angle cross-beds that slope both basinwards and fanwards. This gravel was deposited in beachface, backshore and shoreface barrier-spit environments that developed where Lake Manly impinged on the Warm Spring fan during late Pleistocene time. These deposits straddle headcuts into, and were derived from, erosion of the debris-flow deposits. Wave energy sorted finer sediment from the shore zone, concentrated coarser sediment and rounded the coarse to very coarse pebble fraction by selective reworking.																			0037-0746	1365-3091				OCT	1999	46	5					941	965		10.1046/j.1365-3091.1999.00260.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-3091.1999.00260.x													WOS:000083535300008

Weakening monsoon intensity and longer monsoon duration seem contradictory, as a weaker monsoon tends to produce less precipitation, while a longer duration increases the probability of precipitation. Past research has focused on how ISM's intensity affects precipitation, with little consideration of the impacts of ISM duration. Here, we investigate the long-term (1979-2100) variability in the ISM's duration and intensity. We find a prolonged ISM from 1979 to 2018, accompanied by monsoon weakening. Different combinations of duration and intensity have resulted in different spatial patterns of precipitation across the southeastern TP. Weakening and prolonged ISM is helpful to produce more precipitation around the southeastern TP, with intensity acting as a dominant control. Afterwards, an obvious impact can be found on potential water availability. Climate projections suggest that the ISM will weaken and lengthen until 2100, thereby increasing precipitation and potential water availability across the southeastern TP. This long-term trend should receive more attentions as increased regional extreme precipitation will increase the probability of flood risks until the end of this century.					liu, liu/JEO-6900-2023; Chen, Deliang/A-5107-2013; Wang, Lei/B-3113-2019; Yang, Kun/G-8390-2011; Li, Xiuping/P-8096-2019	Chen, Deliang/0000-0003-0288-5618; Yang, Kun/0000-0002-0809-2371; Liu, Liu/0000-0002-4915-206X													1748-9326					JUL 1	2023	18	7							074018	10.1088/1748-9326/acdd15	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/acdd15													WOS:001018526700001

Stabilising role of seed banks and the maintenance of bacterial diversity	ECOLOGY LETTERS												Coexisting species often exhibit negative frequency dependence due to mechanisms that promote population growth and persistence when rare. These stabilising mechanisms can maintain diversity through interspecific niche differences, but also through life-history strategies like dormancy that buffer populations in fluctuating environments. However, there are few tests demonstrating how seed banks contribute to long-term community dynamics and the maintenance of diversity. Using a multi-year, high-frequency time series of bacterial community data from a north temperate lake, we documented patterns consistent with stabilising coexistence. Bacterial taxa exhibited differential responses to seasonal environmental conditions, while seed bank dynamics helped maintain diversity over less-favourable winter periods. Strong negative frequency dependence in rare, but metabolically active, taxa suggested a role for biotic interactions in promoting coexistence. Together, our results provide field-based evidence that niche differences and seed banks contribute to recurring community dynamics and the long-term maintenance of diversity in nature.

The Tibetan Plateau (TP) contains the highest areal proportion of lakes in China, and dramatic past lake level changes have led to the formation of numerous relict shorelines. Here, we present 24 Be-10 and Al-26 exposure-ages for five of seven lake terraces situated north of Nam Co, on the southern TP. The ages of four high stands marked by terraces (T7, T6, T 5, and T4) are 81.5 +/- 9.0 ka, 33.6 +/- 1.9 ka, 19.9 +/- 1.9 ka, and 15.2 +/- 0.4 ka. The topographically highest terrace, T7, correlates with periods of enhanced Indian summer monsoon (ISM) and supports an MIS 5 maximum lake expansion on the TP, as opposed to MIS 3. Ages of two lower terraces (T5 and T4) possibly correspond to Melt Water Pulse (MWP) events. We also evaluate different possible sources of uncertainty from geologic processes on Be-10 exposure ages of lake terraces. Subaerial erosion following terrace exposure has the most significant influence on Be-10 exposure ages on ancient high terraces (for example > 80 ka), while inherited Be-10 from prior exposure and partial shielding by shallow water, beach or talus are the most important geological source error of Be-10 exposure ages for relatively low and young terraces (for example < 15 ka).

J	Iverson, JB; Higgins, H; Sirulnik, A; Griffiths, C				Iverson, JB; Higgins, H; Sirulnik, A; Griffiths, C			Local and geographic variation in the reproductive biology of the snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina)	HERPETOLOGICA												We studied female snapping turtles at two shallow lakes on the Crescent Lake National Wildlife Refuge from 1990-1994, most intensively during the nesting seasons of 1993 and 1994. Females matured at 28-29 cm carapace length (CL), 22-23 cm plastron length (PL), 5.5-6.5 kg body mass, and 10-12 winters of age. Nesting was recorded from 1-28 June, but in a given year season length was 13-18 days and its start may be inversely related to spring temperatures. Nesting began between 0400 and 0930 h and between 1800 and 0100 h. During the warm June of 1994, nesting was equally divided between morning and evening, but during the relatively cold June of 1993, smaller females apparently shifted predominately to evening nesting. II was not determined whether all females reproduced every year. Reproducing females produced one clutch per year of 20-73 eggs ((x) over bar = 46.8) weighing 6.4-19.1 g each ((x) over bar = 11.4). Egg size, clutch size, and clutch mass were each positively correlated with female size. However, relative to female body size, large females produce smaller eggs and smaller clutches, but the same total clutch mass, as small females. No differences in reproductive output were detectable between 1993 and 1994. Geographic variation in female size across the species range is significant. In temperate regions, mean female size is correlated with latitude, longitude, and elevation, with the largest females found in Nebraska and South Dakota. Females in the tropics are as large as the largest temperate females. Egg size does not vary with average female body size across populations or with latitude. Eggs in the tropics average nearly twice the mass of those in temperate regions, but relative to female body size, egg size in the tropics is not significantly different. Clutch size is positively correlated with female body size within and among populations, as well as with latitude. However, relative to body size, clutch size does not vary among temperate populations, although it is larger there than in the tropics. No trade-off between average egg size and clutch size was evident among populations. Clutch mass was correlated with female body size and varied geographically along with body size. However, relative to body size, there was no significant geographic variation in clutch mass. Variation in growth rate to maturity among temperate populations suggests that at northern, western, and high elevation locations a greater selective advantage accrues from maturing at a larger body size than from maturing at an earlier age, perhaps because of the strong body size-clutch size correlation.																			0018-0831	1938-5099				MAR	1997	53	1					96	117																WOS:A1997WQ55200010

Channels that experienced base-level fall may still be incising, often through glacial diamictons (tills). These tills can be quite competent, behaving more like weak bedrock than unconsolidated sediment, and erode at a fast pace, thus providing a unique opportunity to test models of channel incision and knickpoint migration in transient systems. Here, we integrate light detection and ranging (LiDAR) topography, strath terrace chronology, and numerical modeling to determine knickpoint migration and incision history of the Le Sueur River in central Minnesota, USA. Results indicate that the Le Sueur River is best modeled as a detachment-limited channel, with downstream coarsening related to lag clasts from tills playing a critical factor in longitudinal profile development. The Le Sueur River meanders as it incises, so we coupled the best-fit incision model to a meander model to determine valley excavation history. The excavation history was used to determine a natural background erosion rate, prior to land-use changes associated with settlement and agricultural expansion in the mid-1800s. We compared background fine sediment (silt and clay) erosion rates with historic decadal-average annual suspended loads. Results show that modern fine sediment contributions from sources associated with valley excavation are three times higher than modeled presettlement loads. Recent changes in hydrology associated with land use and climate change have increased flows in rivers, leading to higher sediment loads, not just from field erosion, but from increased bank and bluff erosion in the deeply incised valleys.

Analytical expressions offer insight into the dynamics of stratified lakes during severe wind events. However, it can be difficult to predict the aggregate response of a natural system to the superposition of hydrodynamic phenomena in the presence of complex bathymetry and when forced by variable wind patterns. Using an array of current, temperature, and water quality measurements at the upwind shore, we detail the hydrodynamic response of deep, rotationally influenced Lake Tahoe to three strong wind events during late spring. Sustained southwesterly winds in excess of 10 m s(-1) drove upwelling at the upwind shore (characteristic of non-rotational upwelling setup), with upward excursions of deep water exceeding 70 m for the strongest event. Hypolimnetic water, with elevated concentrations of chlorophyll a and nitrate, was advected toward the nearshore, but this water rapidly returned to depth with the relaxation of upwelling after the winds subsided. The relaxation of upwelling exhibited rotational influence, highlighted by an along-shore, cyclonic front characteristic of a Kelvin wave-driven coastal jet, with velocities exceeding 25 cm s(-1). The rotational front also produced downwelling to 100 m, transporting dissolved oxygen to depth. More complex internal wave features followed the passage of these powerful internal waves. Results emphasize the complexity of these superimposed hydrodynamic phenomena in natural systems, providing a conceptual reference for the role upwelling events may play in lake ecosystems.

However, other proxy data from lakes or loess, interpreted as monsoon rainfall, show a mid-Holocene monsoon optimum. This discrepancy may come from specific climate interpretation of different proxies. Here we report multiproxy records from a single loess-palaeosol sequence at Yulin in the monsoon marginal northern China, based on an independent and high-precision chronology. Our long-chain n-alkane delta D values, together with related biomarker proxies including the average chain length and concentration of long-chain n-alkanes, reveal a weakening trend in monsoon strength and less woody vegetation since similar to 6 ka. However, other soil formation-related proxies, such as magnetic susceptibility, grain-size distribution and total organic carbon, show a decreasing trend since 4-3 ka. We find that monsoon and vegetation are controlled by insolation variation, while soil formation is more related to temperature and humidity changes. Our multiple proxy comparison reveals different controlling mechanisms leading to different interpretations in monsoon, vegetation and soil formation reconstructions. This finding suggests that previous debates on Holocene monsoon changes in East Asia probably stem from the specific proxy interpretation.

Sequence architecture and palaeoclimate controls on diagenesis related to subaerial exposure of icehouse cyclic Pennsylvanian and Permian carbonates	LINKING DIAGENESIS TO SEQUENCE STRATIGRAPHY	Special Publications of the International Association of Sedimentologists											Subaerial exposure of icehouse sequences from the Pennsylvanian and Permian of the Hugoton embayment in western Kansas resulted in predictable patterns of carbonate diagenesis with fabric-selective dissolution and fine, blocky calcite cement and overgrowths. The observations show how sequence stratigraphy and shelf setting can be used to predict porosity in carbonate reservoirs. In the Amoco Rebecca K. Bounds core, most early cements show distribution of growth zones indicating formation during multiple events of subaerial exposure. These cements precipitated in freshwater or in evaporated marine-meteoric mixing zones, as indicated by delta O-18 between -5.7 parts per thousand and -1.2%(VPDB), delta C-13 between -2.5 parts per thousand and 0.7 parts per thousand(VPDB) and primary fluid inclusions with salinities between 5.3 and 0.0 wt% NaCl equivalent. The amount of early calcite cement is controlled by sequence architecture and, to a lesser extent, by climate during subaerial exposure. Sequences formed during high relative sea-level (S-architecture) contain more early calcite cement than sequences that reflect deposition well down on the falling leg of the sea-level curve (C-architecture). Duration of subaerial exposure was apparently longer for S-architecture than for C-architecture positions. At early stages of relative sea-level fall, climate was more humid, leading to more early-calcite cement. At late stages of relative sea-level fall, climate was more arid leading to less early-calcite cement. The relative importance of mixing-zone cementation may be best explained by the setting of the RB core, where the low slope and interstratified siliciclastic aquitards decreased recharge and flow of meteoric groundwater, leading to little flux of meteoric water and little meteoric calcite cement. Understanding the effects of sequence architecture and palaeoclimate on the distribution of diagenetic fabrics will help in the exploitation of Pennsylvanian and Permian carbonate reservoirs as well as other carbonate reservoir targets worldwide.																			0141-3600		978-1-118-48539-2				2012		45					55	79																WOS:000323950100004
J	Martin, C				Martin, C.			Comparative study of summer seston from nine lakes of the French Jura	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												First investigations on seston from lakes of the French Jura are presented. Nine lakes were analysed after having been sampled at the end of summer by vertical pumping at the deepest point of the lakes. Total Suspended Matter (TSM) concentrations vary from 0,89 mg/l to 5,51 mg/l. Throughout the results, three types of lakes can be distinguished : planktonic proliferation lakes, lakes showing dominating trypton, well-balanced lakes. Detrital fraction represents an average of 30 % of Total Suspended Particle Number. A microscopy study produced a classification with two orders of organic particles : detritus, and Heterogeneous Mineral and Organic Compounds. Macrophyte detritus and Heterogeneous Mineral and Organic Compounds, are dominant in seston of lakes where planktonic blooms take place or in lakes where trypton is numerically highest. A mode of production of Heterogeneous Mineral and Organic Compounds is proposed and discussed in relation to some ecological factors : littoral zone development, oxygen/temperature effects, and planktonic blooms. A general interpretation of the results in relation to Particulate Organic Matter transfer into the Limnological Ecosystem is also given.																			0003-4088					SEP	1993	29	3					365	381		10.1051/limn/1993029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/1993029													WOS:000208073900011

The water depth of the sampling site varied from 13 to 30 m resulting from the water level fluctuation of the TGR. The CH4 oxidation rates are measured in situ as the decline of dissolved CH4 concentration versus time in incubated, and those rates. The CH4 oxidation rates range from 1.18 x 10(-3) to 3.69 x 10(-3 )mu mol L-1 h(-1), with higher values and stronger variation during summer. A static floating chamber method is used to measure CH4 emitted to the atmosphere resulting in an annual mean flux of 4.79 mu mol m(-2) h(-1). The CH4 emission rate is significantly negatively correlated with the water level. The results show that a large fraction of CH4 is consumed in the water column with a range of 28.97-55.90 mu mol m(-2) h(-1), accounting for approximate to 69-98% of the total CH4 input into the water column, and more than 90% is consumed outside the summer, when the water level is lowest. Water depth, which is dominated by water level of the TGR, is a potentially important driver for CH4 oxidation and atmospheric emission in the tributary bay.

Detached algal clouds or metaphyton, dominated by algae from the family Zygnemataceae, accumulated over the summer in three of these lakes. Previous researchers have hypothesized that diminished grazing pressure due to extirpation of acid sensitive herbivores might enhance the development of metaphytic algae at pHs less than 6. No overt consistent differences existed among the abundances of small (cladocerans, cyclopoids, ostracods, oligochaetes, dipterans) or medium (amphipods, gastropods, emphemeropterans, trichopterans) grazers in study lakes with or without metaphyton. Notable differences did exist, however, with respect to what we term large grazers. Crayfish, algivorous fish (mostly cyprinids), and to a lesser extent tadpoles, were absent or rare in the three lakes with metaphytic algae but abundant in those without. If a reduction in grazing pressure can be implicated as a factor in enhanced metaphyton development, our correlative results suggest that it is the large grazers, particularly crayfish, that are the most likely candidates.					; Paterson, Michael/AGT-8809-2022	france, robert/0000-0002-9171-8426; 													0018-8158					AUG 1	1991	220	1					9	27		10.1007/BF00017488	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00017488													WOS:A1991GK03200002

Various rare landforms are also found on the slopes of the Badain Jaran megadunes, including spring streams, surface infiltration-excess runoff, erosion rills caused by surface runoff, slow-seepage runoff, as well as physical and chemical sediment resulting from subsurface lateral flow outflows. A variety of analyses were performed using electron microscope observation, X-ray diffraction, particle size analysis and field survey, investigating properties such as the mineral composition of the chemical sediment, the particle size composition of the physical sediment and aeolian sand, runoff type, the recharge conditions of precipitation to groundwater and lake water, and the water balance of the megadune area. The formation of the different types of runoff demonstrates that although precipitation in this area is low, effective heavy precipitation processes characterised by single events of more than 15 mm are present that likely act as a source for groundwater. Seven indicators, including the formation of spring water at the bottom of megadunes, multiple runoff types, as well as both physical and chemical sediments, clearly show that precipitation in the area reaches the bottom of megadunes via infiltration, which constitutes an effective supply of lake water and groundwater. The water-resisting property of the fine sand layer is likely the reason why the region is characterised by an outflow of subsurface runoff, with the latter and its sediment further confirming that the area also possesses a positive water balance. This positive water balance is the result of four unique characteristics: the presence of effective heavy precipitation, low transpiration due to scarce vegetation, the high infiltration rate of the sand layer and the small depth of the sand layer affected by evaporation. This in turn means that atmospheric precipitation is sufficient to supply groundwater, leading to the development of the numerous lakes found in the desert area. Water balance calculations revealed that, after accounting for evaporation, transpiration and other sources of consumption of atmospheric precipitation, around 134,648.4-135,976.9 m(3) of water per square kilometre per year is still supplied to the groundwater and lake water.

Ryan			Migratory Connectivity of the Monarch Butterfly (Danaus plexippus): Patterns of Spring Re-Colonization in Eastern North America	PLOS ONE												Each year, millions of monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) migrate up to 3000 km from their overwintering grounds in central Mexico to breed in eastern North America. Malcolm et al. (1993) articulated two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses to explain how Monarchs re-colonize North America each spring. The 'successive brood' hypothesis proposes that monarchs migrate from Mexico to the Gulf Coast, lay eggs and die, leaving northern re-colonization of the breeding range to subsequent generations. The 'single sweep' hypothesis proposes that overwintering monarchs continue to migrate northward after arriving on the Gulf coast and may reach the northern portion of the breeding range, laying eggs along the way. To examine these hypotheses, we sampled monarchs throughout the northern breeding range and combined stable-hydrogen isotopes (delta D) to estimate natal origin with wing wear scores to differentiate between individuals born in the current vs. previous year. Similar to Malcolm et al. (1993), we found that the majority of the northern breeding range was re-colonized by the first generation of monarchs (90%). We also estimated that a small number of individuals (10%) originated directly from Mexico and, therefore adopted a sweep strategy. Contrary to Malcolm et al. (1993), we found that 62% of monarchs sampled in the Great Lakes originated from the Central U. S., suggesting that this region is important for sustaining production in the northern breeding areas. Our results provide new evidence of re-colonization patterns in monarchs and contribute important information towards identifying productive breeding regions of this unique migratory insect.					; Hobson, Keith/Q-9306-2019; Wassenaar, Leonard/B-5996-2013; Norris, Ryan/F-4720-2011	Wassenaar, Leonard/0000-0001-5532-0771; 													1932-6203					MAR 13	2012	7	3							e31891	10.1371/journal.pone.0031891	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0031891								22427813					WOS:000303129700005
J	Kim, N; Walseng, B; Yan, ND				Kim, Natalie; Walseng, Bjorn; Yan, Norman David			Will environmental calcium declines hinder Bythotrephes establishment success in Canadian Shield lakes?	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Recently, calcium-rich daphniids have declined on the Canadian Shield in response to falling lake-water calcium concentrations, or [Ca]. Meanwhile the invader Bythotrephes longimanus, a predator that feeds on Daphnia, continues to spread. Our goal was to determine if ongoing calcium declines might directly or indirectly affect Bythotrephes' establishment success. To address direct effects, we provide the first quantification of Bythotrephes' calcium content, which is very low (0.03% as dry mass) compared with other Cladocera. We also examined the effects of differing [Ca] (0.1-2.6 mg.L-1) on Bythotrephes' performance in the laboratory. For all [Ca], population growth rates remained positive, indicating that Bythotrephes has great tolerance of low [Ca]. Finally, we examined Bythotrephes' distribution in relation to [Ca] on the Shield where is it relatively new, alongside its distribution in Norway where it is endemic and found that Bythotrephes inhabits very low calcium environments in Norway (minimum = 0.2 mg.L-1). These results suggest that Bythotrephes establishment in Canada is currently not - and in the future will likely not - be limited by falling calcium. Rather, as Bythotrephes is more tolerant of low [Ca] than are its daphniid prey, we propose that both calcium decline and Bythotrephes invasions may contribute to Daphnia decline.

In total, 20 species belonging to 15 genera of I I eurotatorian families were identified. The highest total rotifer abundance (346,667 individuals/m(3)) was recorded in December, while the lowest total abundance (7,640 individuals/m(3)) was seen in February. The densities of most rotifer species were highest in the spring months. Species richness was related directly to rotifer abundance. Rotifers were dominated numerically by two species, Polyarthra remata and Polyarthra vulgaris (14.9% and 14.4% respectively). Species abundance was positively related to temperature.

Our analysis uses hydrologic data from the glaciated Crow Wing watershed in central Minnesota, USA, combined with a hydrologic model of transient coupled unsaturated/saturated flow (HYDRAT2D). Analysis of historical water-table (1970-1993) and lake-level (1924-2002) records indicates that larger amplitude and longer period fluctuations occur within the upland portions of watersheds due to the response of the aquifer system to relatively short-term climatic fluctuations. Under drought conditions, lake and water-table levels fell by as much as 2-4 m in the uplands but by 1 m in the lowlands. The same pattern can be seen on millennial time scales. Analysis of Holocene lake-core records indicates that Moody Lake, located near the outlet of the Crow Wing watershed, fell by as much as 4 m between about 4400 and 7000 yr BP. During the same time, water levels in Lake Mina, located near the upland watershed divide, fell by about 15 m. Reconstructed Holocene climate as represented by HYDRAT2D gives somewhat larger drops (6 and 24 m for Moody Lake and Lake Mina, respectively). The discrepancy is probably due to the effect of three-dimensional flow. A sensitivity analysis was also carried out to study how aquifer hydraulic conductivity and land-surface topography can influence water-table fluctuations, wetlands formation, and evapotranspiration. The models were run by recycling a wet year (1985, 87 cm annual precipitation) over a 10-year period followed by 20 years of drier and warmer climate (1976, 38 cm precipitation). Model results indicated that groundwater-supported evapotranspiration accounted for as much as 12% (10 cm) of evapotranspiration. The aquifers of highest hydraulic conductivity had the least amount of groundwater-supported evapotranspiration owing to a deep water table. Recharge was even more sensitive to aquifer hydraulic conductivity, especially in the lowland regions. These findings have important implications for paleoclimatic studies, because the hydrologic response of a surface-water body will vary across the watershed to a given climate signal.

J	Bellec, VK; Cirac, P; Faugères, JC				Bellec, Valerie Karin; Cirac, Pierre; Faugeres, Jean-Claude			Formation and evolution of paleo-valleys linked to a subsiding canyon, North Aquitaine shelf (France)	COMPTES RENDUS GEOSCIENCE												High resolution seismic data display four channel sets in front of the Lake of Hourton and the Lake of Lacanau covering a faulted and folded unit (U2) deposited during a high sea level at the end of the Burdigalian. The next unit (U3-1) shows sigmoid to oblique reflections (U3-1) but without apparent channels. However, during the sea level fall at the end of the Langhian, chaotic seismic facies and channels developed. The explanation should be the tectonic phase of the Aquitaine margin with an uplift of the North Aquitaine shelf. This induced the deformation of the unit U2 and provoked the creation of an alluvial plain on the North Aquitaine shelf with the formation of distributary channels (U3-2). The three following sea level falls during the Serravalian could explain the formation of the three other sets of channels (U3-3, U3-4 and U4). The last channels have a reduced mobility and correspond downstream to small paleo-canyons joining southwards the canyon of Cap Ferret. These channels disappear suddenly at the boundary at the Basin of Parentis. To cite this article: VK. Bellec et al., C. R. Geoscience 341 (2009). (C) 2008 Academie des sciences.

We investigated abundance-size spectra and body size-density allometry using an exceptionally detailed data set from a stony stream. The body size distribution of the whole metazoan community was expressed in terms of both density and biomass over a 14-month survey, and the relationships of body size with population density and taxon richness were also evaluated. 2. The distribution of density among size classes varied considerably between sampling occasions, although that of biomass was rather more consistent. This suggests that the body size distribution is dynamic and does not always fall into any single pattern or category, as has been assumed hitherto. 3. Analysis of the modes in the density-body size distribution in individual sample-units revealed small-scale spatial variation, with little consistency in the number or position of modes in any one month. 4. This stream community did not conform to the -0.75 (or indeed to any other significant regression) relationship between body size and population density, although such patterns are very sensitive to methodological details. 5. In data aggregated over the whole study, most metazoan taxa fell into the size range < 10-100 mu g. The annual average density- and biomass-body size spectra appeared tri- and bimodal, respectively (on log-log scales), with minor troughs in the density spectrum at about 100 and 0.1 mu g body mass. This could indicate, at this scale of analysis, discontinuities in the way in which benthic species exploit their environment. 6. Spatial and temporal heterogeneity in size spectra, and the lack of clear density-body size allometry, could be due to biotic or physicochemical fluctuations and environmental change (including seasonal and longer-term changes in acidity) that cause rapid species turnover and changes in density and distribution, particularly among the meiofauna. Small and rare species may thus be in the process of colonization or decline and the pattern would indicate a lack of equilibrium, particularly among organisms in the smallest size classes, at this temporal scale of the study.

Brown (2000) has alleged that the sex of this individual cannot be determined from the available evidence, since the skeleton lacks the most diagnostic areas of the skull and pelvis. In an effort to reexamine the sex diagnosis of Lake Mungo 3 our team collected an exhaustive battery of postcranial measurements from the skeleton. These measurements are compared to a number of Australian samples of known sex, both from the Pleistocene as well as the Holocene. In all, approximately 55 postcranial measurements are used for these comparisons. Many of the measurements sampled for Lake Mungo 3 fall at the extreme high end of the Holocene male sample, sometimes beyond the observed Holocene male range, and likewise fall well outside the Holocene female range. Lake Mungo 3 is also very similar in size to 'robust' Pleistocene and early Holocene males and larger than a known Pleistocene female. These results support the assignment of male sex to Lake Mungo 3. However, they also lead us to question the attribution of Lake Mungo 3 to a 'gracile' category amongst early Australians.																			0728-4896	1834-4453				JUL	2009	44	2					77	83		10.1002/j.1834-4453.2009.tb00050.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/j.1834-4453.2009.tb00050.x													WOS:000268289700004

Fine-grained carbonates, which are mainly authigenic, are likely to have formed in the epilimnion of the lake and their isotopic composition reflects the summer temperature and, more importantly, the isotopic composition of the near-surface waters, which is mainly a function of evaporative concentration. Ostracod shells are secreted in the benthos of the lake, and their isotopic composition reflects summer bottom-water conditions, together with fractionation effects, which may differ between species. Differences between contemporaneous values from authigenic carbonates and ostracod shells may provide an indication of stratification within the lake and variations in effective precipitation over the northeast part of the Tibetan Plateau over the past 300 years. A period of moderate evaporative concentration, from about 300 to 100 yr BP, was interrupted by a marked wet phase from similar to100 to 40 yr BP, which was in turn followed by a return to drier conditions in the most recent part of the record. The increase in delta(18)O values in the latter part of the record accords well with instrumental records of lake-level lowering and salinity increase since about 1955 AD.

A large number of SWHP systems have been used in residential and commercial buildings in coastal areas due to the attractive advantages of high efficiency and environmental friendliness. In this paper, two mathematical models that described heat transfer process of casted heat exchanger (CHE) adopted by SWHP systems in the icing and non-icing conditions in winter have been developed and validated by an experimental study. The CHE is consisted of pipes immersed in the seawater and used for transferring heat between the seawater and the heat exchanger pipes of the SWHP. In addition, a computer code has been implemented to simulate the effects of flow rate of the secondary refrigerant, length of the CHE and the temperature of the seawater on the heat transfer performance. The effect of the ice outside the pipe due to the low seawater temperature on heat transfer has been discussed and the comparison of the heat transfer rate in two conditions demonstrates that the effect of icing on heat transfer performance is great. As a result, application of SWHP systems with CHE in coastal areas in China is feasible due to the favorable geographical conditions and environment. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, the paleo-flooding activities along the upper Amur River Delta were reconstructed based on the grain-size dataset of three sedimentary cores along a 120-kmtransect fromits alluvial valley. Our results indicate that the coarse sand fraction in marshes surrounding the upper Amur River Delta is closely linked to historical flooding activities. Six "busy" flooding periods were identified at 4.4-4.0 ka BP, 3.63.2 ka BP, 1.7-1.4 ka BP, 1.1-0.9 ka BP, 0.7-0.5 ka BP, and 0.2-0 ka BP, respectively. These flooding intervals correspond well to other sedimentary flooding records from the East Asia Summer Monsoon (EASM) domain, and are in-line with the strengthened EASM stages throughout the Late-Holocene. Thus, our dataset suggests that the EASM circulation, especially its associated precipitation, has played a critical role in the evolution of flooding regime during the Late-Holocene epoch in the Amur River Delta. The last 0.2 ka BP is an exception as the coarse sand accumulation rate increased significantly while the EASM precipitation shows no equivalent shift. The increased coarse sand signals were likely attributed to floods induced by human interference instead of the long-term climate influence. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Linking Mountain Glacier Retreat and Hydrological Changes in Southwestern Yukon	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												This study aims to isolate and quantify the role of shrinking glaciers in recent hydrological changes in eight watersheds in the southwestern Yukon (Canada) by using an original dual approach that consists of (i) watershed hydrological regime identification, followed by a trend analysis of discharge time series, and (ii) a model-based peak water (PW) analysis using glacier cover change measurements. A distinction between hydrological regimes is a necessary add-up to commonly used trend attribution methods as the lake runoff regime shares common characteristics with the glacier regime. Results show a link between shrinking glaciers and hydrological changes in the region, but the link is complex, and glacier retreat does not explain all the observed changes. Model outputs show that the two watersheds with a glacierized area exceeding 30% and one watershed with 2.9% glacierized area have not reached PW, whereas a 9.2% glacierized watershed and another watershed with 2.1% glacierized area have already passed it. These results suggest that glacierized area alone cannot explain short-term changes related to watershed current position in terms of PW, and the rate of glacier retreat must be considered. By contrast, the actual rate of glacier retreat does not influence long-term changes, such as the magnitude of PW and of the consequent drop in discharge. Once glaciers will have retreated to a point close to extinction, declines in summer discharge from 10% to 70% and proportional to the actual glacier cover are anticipated at watersheds that are currently more than 9% glacierized.

In spite of an extremely cold climate in addition to varied topographies, the polar aquatic regions are teeming with microbial life. Even in sub-glacial regions, cellular life has adapted to these extreme environments where perhaps there are traces of early microbes on Earth. As grazing by macrofauna is limited in most of these polar regions, viruses are being recognized for their role as important agents of mortality, thereby influencing the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients that, in turn, impact community dynamics at seasonal and spatial scales. Here, we review the viral diversity in aquatic polar regions that has been discovered in the last decade, most of which has been revealed by advances in genomics-enabled technologies, and we reflect on the vast extent of the still-to-be explored polar microbial diversity and its enigmatic virosphere.					; Yau, Sheree/AAX-9078-2021	Yau, Sheree/0000-0003-1878-132X; 													1999-4915					FEB	2019	11	2							189	10.3390/v11020189	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v11020189								30813316					WOS:000460803200099

Radon activity concentration and CO2 concentration exhibited a clear annual variation. The daily average of radon concentration ranged 1300-27 700 Bq/m(3) at the Lake Hall station and 3600-42 200 Bq/m(3) at the Gallery station. Radon reached its maximum in the summer months, from June to September. The annual maximum of CO2 concentration is registered approximately one month later than radon maximum. The annual variation of radon and CO2 is controlled by the seasonal change of ventilation regime associated with the seasonal variation of the difference between the temperature measured inside the cave and the atmospheric temperature.

Setting: Alcon Research LLC, Lake Forest, California. Design: Experimental study. Methods: A mechanical spring eye model was used to test the Centurion with Active Sentry, WhiteStar Signature Pro, and Stellaris PC. Raw oscilloscope data were converted to volumetric and pressure measurements. Fitted average surge traces were generated for each test condition and used to develop an interpolation algorithm to predict transient occlusion break surge events. Two-dimensional heat maps were generated. Results: During occlusion break surge, the Centurion with Active Sentry had smaller aqueous volume losses than the WhiteStar or Stellaris PC. Maximum surge volumes within the mechanical spring eye model displacement limit were 74.7 mL, 157.5 mL, and 151.7 mL using Centurion with Active Sentry, WhiteStar, and Stellaris PC, respectively. In the aphakic state, heat maps showed that Centurion with Active Sentry had less than 20% aqueous volume loss across all vacuum limits and target intraocular pressure; WhiteStar and Stellaris PC systems had up to 35% and 50% aqueous volume losses, respectively, at the higher vacuum limits. In the phakic state, Centurion with Active Sentry had up to 30% aqueous volume loss and WhiteStar and Stellaris PC systems had up to 50% aqueous volume losses. In addition, predicted transient traces demonstrated that Centurion with Active Sentry had the lowest percentage simulated aqueous volume loss compared with WhiteStar or Stellaris PC. Conclusions: Centurion with Active Sentry had lower aqueous volume losses after occlusion break than WhiteStar and Stellaris PC systems at all surgical settings.

Investigated in the present study were the reproductive feeding aspects and growth of H. siamensis living in a lake system. The gonadosomatic index peaked in August, which was delayed compared to river fish, and individuals took 1.5 years to attain the length of 50% maturity (about 200 mm). Stomach contents were dominated by phytoplankton and showed considerable seasonal variation. Asymptotic length of H. siamensis was 264.2 mm, with a 0.75 year(-1) growth coefficient and slower growth during the winter. The role of the flood pulse as a major influence on the life history of the fish is also discussed.

Adapting water allocation management to drought scenarios	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Climate change dynamics have significant consequences on water resources on a watershed scale. With water becoming scarcer and susceptible to variation, the planning and reallocation decisions in watershed management need to be reviewed. This research focuses on an in-depth understanding of the current allocation balance of water resources among competitors, placed along the course of the Adda River. In particular, during the summer period, the demand for water dramatically increases. This is due to the increase in irrigation activities in the lower part of the basin and to the highest peaks of tourist inflow, in the Como Lake and Valtellina areas. Moreover, during these months, the hydroelectric reservoirs in the upper part of the Adda River basin (the Valtellina) retain most of the volume of water coming from the snow and glacier melt. The existing allocation problem among these different competing users is exacerbated by the decreasing water supplies. The summer of 2003 testified the rise in a number of allocation problems and situations of water scarcity that brought about environmental and economical consequences. The RICLIC project is committed to the understanding of water dynamics on a regional scale, to quantify the volumes involved and offer local communities an instrument to improve a sustainable water management system, within uncertain climate change scenarios.

Effects on lower trophic levels in Lake Lyng, Denmark	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Conference on Trophic Cascades in Shallow Freshwater and Brackish Lakes	AUG 20-25, 1995	WARSAW, POLAND	Inst Ecol, Polish Acad Sci, Univ Warsaw, Polish Hydrobiol Soc				In order to study how pike stocking affects trophic structure pike fingerlings (0-3600 ha(-1)) were stocked during six years in eutrophic Lake Lyng (lake area 10 ha), Denmark. Subsequently, marked changes were recorded in the abundance of zooplanktivorous fish, catch per unit effort of roach, which was the dominant fish species, thus varied from 17 to 272. Simultaneously, marked changes were recorded in the abundance and relative composition of zooplankton. Daphnia abundance ranged from 7 to 36 ind. l(-1) and Bosmina from 2 to 99 ind. l(-1), mean summer abundance of Daphnia being highest and Bosmina lowest in years with low fish density. Additionally, cyclopoid copepod and rotifer abundance correlated significantly (p < 0.05, r(2) = 0.70 and 0.83, respectively) and positively with fish abundance. Mean summer chlorophyll a correlated significantly (p = 0.04, r(2) = 0.70) with the abundance of roach, suggesting an impact on phytoplankton level also, disregarding that the phytoplankton biomass was dominated by filamentous cyanobacteria. Total phosphorus concentration was lowest in years with low zooplanktivorous fish abundance, which is hypothesized to be due to lower sedimentation of organic material and lower phosphorus release from the sediment in years with high zooplankton grazing on phytoplankton. It is concluded that pike stocking can be used as a lake restoration tool to increase lake water transparency by creating a trophic cascade. The effect of stocking, however, seems to last only during the season in which it has been undertaken, the impact being most significant at high stocking densities. The method is therefore regarded to be most useful in shallow, turbid lakes in which the nutrient loading has been sufficiently reduced to allow a substantial and permanent macrophyte coverage if clearwater conditions are established.

Species emphasis changed from predominately dabbling ducks in the earlier period, when most lakes were newly flooded, to greater numbers of submerged macrophyte feeders in the later period. Diving duck numbers were little changed and competition for food from high populations of stocked coarse fish is suggested as a factor limiting lake use by birds which feed on benthic invertebrates. There was a large increase in numbers of wildfowl using a 17 ha lake after the fish populations were removed in November 1987. Use by herbivorous species, Mute Swan, Coot and Gadwall, increased dramatically in response to new weed growth. Shoveler and Pochard numbers both increased significantly and more Tufted Duck were counted. It is suggested that these changes were related to demonstrated increases in benthic invertebrates post-fish removal. The implications for manipulating both new and maturing gravel pit lakes are discussed; fish removal is suggested as a useful technique for managing wetland nature reserves.																			0006-3657					NOV	1992	39		3				177	185		10.1080/00063659209477116	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00063659209477116													WOS:A1992JZ91400004

The plume is generated at the bottom of a basin that contains sediment in suspension, which is at a higher temperature than the water immediately above (the hypolimnion of the lake). The rising convective plume entrains colder hypolimnetic water and develops upward, until it reaches the base of the seasonal thermocline, carrying an important amount of sediment particles from the bottom, which are used as tracers to describe the spatial distribution of the plume. At the level of neutral buoyancy, the plume spreads laterally, as a horizontal baroclinic intrusion.

Here, two chironomid-based training sets from Finland were amalgamated to create a more accurate transfer function of summer air temperature. The aim was to reconstruct Holocene paleoclimate in northernmost Lapland, in an area that has been either too warm or too cold for reliable reconstructions using the original calibration models. The results showed that the combined calibration model had improved performance statistics. The temperature trends inferred from the downcore chironomid record using the original and combined models were very similar. However, there were major changes in their absolute values with the combined model showing greatly improved accuracy. The chironomid-based temperature reconstruction showed significant correlation with the previous pollen-based reconstructions from northwestern Finnish Lapland. However, differences were observed in the temperature trends of the early Holocene, when the chironomid-inferred temperatures rapidly increased, but the pollen-based reconstructions lagged behind suggesting that a cool climate continued for much longer. However, similar to the chironomid record, new plant macrofossil evidence from northwestern Finland also showed warmer-than-present early Holocene temperatures. Therefore, we conclude that the early Holocene was probably warm in northern Lapland. (C) 2013 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Here, we reconstructed the history of ISM precipitation during the past ca. 800 yr based on multiple proxies, including sediment grain size, organic matter content, biogenic silica content, magnetic susceptibility, and major element data (e.g., Fe, Ti, and Ca), obtained for a core from Lake Mahu in southwestern China. Relatively humid climate conditions prevailed during the Little Ice Age (LIA; 1400-1700 CE), whereas a relatively dry climate has characterized the Current Warm Period (CWP; 1800 CE-present). A significant dry event occurred during the transition from the LIA to CWP. The hydroclimatic record for the last millennium from Lake Mahu is generally similar to those of other areas affected by the ISM, including southwestern China, South China, the South China Sea, and northern India. We propose that southward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone may have been responsible for the abrupt hydroclimatic change during the transition from the LIA to CWP.

Assessment of soil and source water characteristics of disused shrimp ponds in selected coastal states of India and their suitability for resuming aquaculture	INDIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES												The key objective of this study was to assess the suitability of soil and source water quality of abandoned shrimp farms in selected coastal states of India, for resuming aquaculture activities. Soil samples along with associated source water were collected from 60 disused shrimp ponds in different districts of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Odisha and Kerala and analysed for basic physico-chemical parameters. Results of the analysis indicated that the reason for disuse might be reduction in price/repeated occurrences of diseases and that the sampled farms are suitable for aquaculture use. Most of the soil in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are suitable for aquaculture without any remediation. Few ponds in Jagatsingpur and Puri districts of Odisha and Kerala needs simple remediation measures like application of lime to increase the soil pH. Source water in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha (Harishpur Creek, Budhabalanga Creek and the coastal canal) fall under high saline areas and are suitable for culture of tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon, white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei and finfishes like Asian seabass Lates calcarifer and mullets whereas, Kerala and northern parts of Chilka Lake of Odisha fall under low saline areas and are suitable for culture of white shrimp L. vannamei and pearlspot Etroplus suratensis.																			0970-6011						2016	63	2					118	122		10.21077/ijf.2016.63.2.45664-17	http://dx.doi.org/10.21077/ijf.2016.63.2.45664-17													WOS:000379719900017

We found that different types of convective precipitation respond differently to the PGW signal. Isolated deep convection (IDC), usually concentrated in the southern domain, shows an increase in precipitation to the north of the GLR. Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), usually concentrated upwind of the GLR, shift to the downwind region with increased precipitation. Thermodynamic variables such as convective available potential energy (CAPE) and convective inhibition energy (CIN) are found to increase across almost the entire studied domain, creating a potential environment more favorable for stronger convection systems and less favorable for weaker ones. Meanwhile, changes in the lifting condensation level (LCL) and level of free convection (LFC) show a strong correlation with variations in convective precipitation, highlighting the significance of these thermodynamic factors in controlling precipitation over the domain. Our results indicate that the decrease in LCL and LCF in areas with increased convective precipitation is mainly due to increased atmospheric moisture. In response to the prescribed warming perturbation, MCSs occur more frequently downwind, while localized IDCs exhibit more intense rain rates, longer durations, and larger rainfall area.

Samples were analyzed for multiple proxies for climate conditions, including grain size, magnetic susceptibility (MS), and carbonate content, which were combined with accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) C-14 data. The results show that from 10.0 to 6.3 kyr BP, the study area experienced an interval of increasing precipitation and rising water level at Lake Baiyangdian. For a very short period, similar to 8.4 kyr BP, the extent of the lake reached the sampling point. The climate during this stage was relatively humid. The water level dropped abruptly at 6.5 kyr BP as a result of a weak monsoon event. From 6.3 to 2.9 kyr BP the climate became humid once again. The continuous lacustrine sediment of the strata indicated that the water level of Lake Baiyangdian expanded rapidly during this period and reached the sampling point. After 2.9 kyr BP, the climate in the region changed again from humid to dry. The abrupt increase in MS after similar to 1 kyr BP (993 AD) is consistent with records of human activities in local chronicles, which indicates that the environment in the study area was influenced by human activities. Through a comparison of the BZ section and the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) records, we found that precipitation in the study area was controlled by the EASM. A series of cold Holocene events were clearly recorded by the sediment in the BZ section, and these events are synchronous with the North Atlantic ice-rafting events (IRD). The connection between the characteristics of the BZ section and the EASM and IRD indicate that climate evolution in the study area was strongly affected by EASM and IRD.

On the survival and habitat use of hatchery-reared cisco ( Coregonus artedi ) in Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Cisco ( Coregonus artedi ) have been extirpated from Lake Erie in North America since the 1960s, but they once supported one of the largest Laurentian Great Lakes fisheries. Numerous potential impediments to rehabilitation have been identified, including summer habitat refugia and predation. We used acoustic telemetry to investigate the thermal habitat use and survival of hatchery-reared adult cisco in Lake Erie. Fish were experimentally released (n = 50 per site) offshore at Dunkirk, New York, in the eastern basin and Huron, Ohio, in the central basin. Cisco in both basins found suitable summer oxythermal habitat in the metalimnion, suggesting that coldwater habitat availability is likely not an impediment for reestablishment. However, track end dates or predation dates were distributed across only four months with the last detection at 155 days. Predation sensors combined with temperature values during digestion indicated different potential predators: lake trout ( Salvelinus namaycush ) for the Dunkirk group and walleye ( Sander vitreus ) for the Huron group. Additionally, digestion temperatures of two tags indicated bird predation was also important, likely underestimated and suggested substantial use of the epilimnion by tagged fish. The results highlight the need for additional studies to address stocking optimization questions in support of future reintroduction experiments and related cisco conservation efforts.					; Schmitt, Joseph/AAC-3110-2021; Vandergoot, Christopher/JAO-1190-2023; Gorsky, Dimitry/AGI-7846-2022	Gorsky, Dimitry/0000-0003-1708-539X; 													0380-1330					JUN	2024	50	3							102343	10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102343	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102343		MAY 2024											WOS:001243035700001

During late summer of two years, 0+ fish were sampled from inshore and offshore habitats along the longitudinal reservoir axis. Offshore catches of 0+ fish from the surface layer were dominated by roach (Rutilus rutilus), bream. (Abramis brama) and perch (Perca fluviatitis), whereas in the deeper open water perch predominated. Inshore catches of 0+ fish were constituted mainly by perch and roach. The proportions of roach in the inshore catches were highest at the upper and most eutrophic part of the reservoir, whereas the proportions of perch in the inshore catches were higher at the downstream areas. Total catches of both inshore and offshore 0+ fish increased upstream in the reservoir. Offshore 0+ perch were of consistently smaller size than inshore 0+ perch. Inshore 0+ perch had significantly smaller size at the upstream reservoir part than at the downstream, more lacustrine regions. The diet of both inshore and offshore 0+ fish consisted predominantly of crustacean zooplankton. Perch diet was generally dominated both by cladocerans and copepods, whereas roach diet consisted chiefly of cladocerans.

Impact of snow deposition on major and trace element concentrations and elementary fluxes in surface waters of the Western Siberian Lowland across a 1700 km latitudinal gradient	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												In order to better understand the chemical composition of snow and its impact on surface water hydrochemistry in the poorly studied Western Siberia Lowland (WSL), the surface layer of snow was sampled in February 2014 across a 1700 km latitudinal gradient (ca. 56.5 to 68 degrees N). We aimed at assessing the latitudinal effect on both dissolved and particulate forms of elements in snow and quantifying the impact of atmospheric input to element storage and export fluxes in inland waters of the WSL. The concentration of dissolved+colloidal (< 0.45 mu m) Fe, Co, Cu, As and La increased by a factor of 2 to 5 north of 63 degrees N compared to southern regions. The pH and dissolved Ca, Mg, Sr, Mo and U in snow water increased with the rise in concentrations of particulate fraction (PF). Principal component analyses of major and trace element concentrations in both dissolved and particulate fractions revealed two factors not linked to the latitude. A hierarchical cluster analysis yielded several groups of elements that originated from alumino-silicate mineral matrix, carbonate minerals and marine aerosols or belonging to volatile atmospheric heavy metals, labile elements from weatherable minerals and nutrients. The main sources of mineral components in PF are desert and semi-desert regions of central Asia. The snow water concentrations of DIC, Cl, SO4, Mg, Ca, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Mo, Cd, Sb, Cs, W, Pb and U exceeded or were comparable with springtime concentrations in thermokarst lakes of the permafrost-affected WSL zone. The springtime river fluxes of DIC, Cl, SO4, Na, Mg, Ca, Rb, Cs, metals (Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb), metalloids (As, Sb), Mo and U in the discontinuous to continuous permafrost zone (64-68 degrees N) can be explained solely by melting of accumulated snow. The impact of snow deposition on riverine fluxes of elements strongly increased northward, in discontinuous and continuous permafrost zones of frozen peat bogs. This was consistent with the decrease in the impact of rock lithology on river chemical composition in the permafrost zone of the WSL, relative to the permafrost-free regions. Therefore, the present study demonstrates significant and previously underestimated atmospheric input of many major and trace elements to their riverine fluxes during spring floods. A broader impact of this result is that current estimations of river water fluxes response to climate warming in high latitudes may be unwarranted without detailed analysis of winter precipitation.

J	White, JDL; Houghton, BF; Hodgson, KA; Wilson, CJN				White, JDL; Houghton, BF; Hodgson, KA; Wilson, CJN			Delayed sedimentary response to the AD 1886 eruption of Tarawera, New Zealand	GEOLOGY												Sedimentary response to tephra deposition from substantial volcanic eruptions is generally immediate and dramatic. An important exception is the A.D. 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera, New Zealand, which blanketed >200 km(2) with greater than or equal to 50 cm of basaltic scoria and ash fall erupted from a fissure through the Tarawera dome complex. This fall deposit has suffered very little rilling or other surface erosion, and there was no immediate downstream redistribution of tephra by lahars or dilute floods. We attribute this lack of early response to the high permeability of the tephra deposit and gentle relief in the areas of substantial accumulation. Numerous small lakes occur among the dome complexes of Okataina caldera, and one direct result of the eruption was constriction of Lake Tarawera's outflow, which caused the lake to rise substantially. Eighteen years after the eruption, collapse of a tephra bank that had controlled lake level triggered a breakout flood from this raised intracaldera lake, triggering a decades-long period of intense tributary erosion in the upper catchment and damaging stream-bed aggradation outside the caldera. This abrupt increase in sediment yield from an initially stable posteruptive landscape has no documented precedents, yet may be a common posteruptive sedimentary response in caldera complexes of temperate to humid regions.

Carbon sink and source dynamics of a eutrophic deep lake using multiple flux observations over multiple years	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS												Recent research has shown lakes play an outsized role in carbon cycling, but long-term continuous observations and analysis of carbon dynamics are rare, limiting our understanding of interannual variation, important timescales of variability, and drivers of efflux. Therefore, we examined lake-atmosphere carbon fluxes with the goal of quantifying annual trends and patterns in lake carbon efflux and identifying important timescales. To do so, this study integrated 6 yr of eddy-covariance flux tower observations of lake-atmosphere fluxes with high-frequency observations of in-lake temperature, dissolved oxygen, and partial pressure of CO2, for a eutrophic lake in Wisconsin, U.S.A. While growing season fluxes are variable and switch between source and sink, annual net carbon fluxes show the lake acts as an annual sink of carbon, with the magnitude depending on climate, along with the timing and strength of fall turnover, with half of the total annual carbon uptake happening in October and November.					; Desai, Ankur/A-5899-2008; Gutmann, Ethan/I-5728-2012	Dugan, Hilary/0000-0003-4674-1149; Reed, David/0000-0002-8892-1423; 														2378-2242				JUN	2018	3	3			SI		285	292		10.1002/lol2.10075	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lol2.10075													WOS:000456696200023

Gillnets of mesh 32 mm bar were used. Up to 1974 the nets were set in Low Wray Bay, but, because of interference by the public, from 1975 they have been set at Thompson Holme, a less accessible site. The results from the 2 sites are not directly comparable. The main spawning time is Nov., and catch per unit effort (net day) in Nov. was calculated. From 1944-1974 the catch per unit effort showed an increasing trend, and from 1975-1982 it was relatively stable. Growth was similar in the 1940s and 1970s. The increase in numbers of charr could be due to reduced predation by pike.																			0022-1112	1095-8649					1984	24	2					229	234		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1984.tb04793.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1984.tb04793.x													WOS:A1984SE43500010

Experimental study of Microcystis-associated and free-living bacteria	MICROBIOLOGY												In the experiment with water from the hypereutrophic Lake Frederiksborg Slotso (Denmark) sampled during the autumn peak of Microcystis growth, the quantity and production of free-living and cyanobacteria-associated heterotrophic bacteria were determined, as well as the extracellular enzymatic (aminopeptidase) activity. The functional diversities of associated and free-living bacterial communities were additionally compared using BIOLOG GN microplates to reveal the possible export of Microcystis-attached bacteria into ambient water. It has been shown that the cell size, production values, and growth rates of associated bacteria were less than those of free-living bacteria. At the same time, the potential aminopeptidase activity of associated bacteria was always higher than that of free-living bacteria. The experimental results have shown significant compositional differences in the structure of bacterial communities from different habitats.																			0026-2617	1608-3237				SEP-OCT	2006	75	5					606	610		10.1134/S0026261706050110	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0026261706050110													WOS:000240998800011
J	Wu, WY; Zhang, DS; Tian, LH; Zhang, HW				Wu Wangyang; Zhang Dengshan; Tian Lihui; Zhang Hongwei			Aeolian Activities and Protective Effects of Artificial Plants in Re-vegetated Sandy Land of Qinghai Lake, China	CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE												Land desertification and aeolian activity are currently the greatest threats to alpine ecological environments and are also the primary challenges of desertification control and ecological restoration projects. Afforestation of sandy lands around the Qinghai Lake in China has effectively controlled the desertification of this watershed. However, certain issues remain which challenge its overall success, including lack of diverse biological species and poor theoretical understanding of aeolian processes, such as controlling wind-sand flow in relation to complex alpine ecological factors. Therefore, to help improving afforestation techniques, this research focused on Hippophae rhamnoides, Salix cheilophila, Pinus sylvestris, Populus simonii and Artemisia desertorum vegetation implanted in the mobile dunes on the eastern shore of Qinghai Lake. Aeolian transport characteristics and annual changes to community ecological factors from 2010-2016 were monitored in comparison with uncontrolled sand dunes. Based on simultaneous observations using gradient anemometers and sand samplers, it was found that the aeolian activities exhibited the following features: 1) In re-vegetated lands, the logarithmic growth of wind speed was disrupted by the wind speed amplification in the middle and high layers and wind speed reduction in the low layers, while vegetation had significant wind-breaking (> 37%) and sand-fixing (> 85%) effects in 2016. 2) Wind speeds in re-vegetated lands and mobile dunes showed a linear correlation, especially in lower layers of H. rhamnoides and S. cheilophila, while sand transport in re-vegetated land increased linearly or exponentially with increasing wind speed. 3) The four artificial shrubs and forests had greater sand deposition with intensities of 280-860 t/(ha center dot yr), largely concentrated during winter and spring which accounted for 60%-85% of the annual cycle, while A. desertorum experienced significant root undercutting; and 4) Intensity of aeolian activity in re-vegetated lands, except for A. desertorum, was significantly negative with respect to plant growth structure, community cover, topsoil moisture, and regional precipitation. Overall, these five sand-binding species produced optimistic wind-sand protection effects for the alpine sandy lands, which relied on the plants' physical disturbance of wind-sand flow during the early stages of community development. In comparison, H. rhamnoides and S. cheilophila individually maintained stable wind-sand protection effects, while P. sylvestris and P. simonii were better in mixing with other shrubs and herbs to achieve a comprehensive ecological system for future control of aeolian activity.

Detailed mapping of horned grebes (Podiceps auritus (L.)) on the North Basin of LakeMyvatn, Iceland, was carried out in late summer 2000 in order to compare their dispersion with water depth and submerged vegetation. Depth and vegetation were measured on sampling sites that were evenly distributed over the North Basin, and the information obtained compared to the distribution of the grebes. Four species of submerged macrophytes dominated in the North Basin; Myriophyllum spicatum, M. alterniflorum, Potamogeton filiformis and P. perfoliatus, mainly at depths < 2.5 m. The grebes seemed to prefer to dive in shallow areas vegetated with stands of Myriophyllum spp. Densities of three-spined sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus were compared in stands of M. spicatum and P. filiformis in order to estimate food availability. No difference was found, so the sticklebacks could not explain the preference of the grebes for areas vegetated with Myriophyllum spp. Nevertheless, this study indicates that shallow areas, vegetated with Myriophyllum spp., are important feeding areas for the horned grebe.

Last interglacial lake sediments preserved beneath Laurentide and Greenland Ice sheets provide insights into Arctic climate amplification and constrain 130 ka of ice-sheet history	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Sediment cores from 13 lakes in a 1500 km transect along the eastern North American Arctic contain up to four superposed stratified interglacial units. All 13 lakes contain one unit with sediment similar in character and mass to Holocene gyttja, with C-14 ages >40 ka, luminescence ages 90 to 120 ka, and pollen assemblages that require nearly complete Laurentide deglaciation, supporting a Last Interglacial (LIG; MIS 5e) age. Two lakes preserve an older interglacial, with luminescence ages suggesting an MIS 7 age. Four adjacent lakes record a thin, stratified organic unit between the LIG and Holocene units with C-14 ages >50 ka, that is probably from late in MIS 5. Temperature estimates from biotic proxies suggest LIG summer temperatures 4-6 degrees C above mid-20th century values; pollen, chironomids and DNA document a poleward expansion of woody plants and invertebrate species during the LIG, supporting arguments that positive feedbacks native to the Arctic amplified insolation-driven summer temperature increases. The stratigraphic succession implies the Laurentide Ice Sheet remained intact with sea level below -40 m from similar to 115 ka to similar to 11 ka, and places new constraints on the interpretation of cosmogenic radionuclide inventories in erratic boulders older than the Holocene throughout this region.

Fates of methane from different lake habitats:: Connecting whole-lake budgets and CH4 emissions	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Methane (CH4) represents a major product of organic matter decomposition in lakes. Once produced in the sediments, CH4 can be either oxidized or emitted as a greenhouse gas to the atmosphere. Lakes represent an important source of atmospheric CH4, but the relative magnitudes of the internal pathways that lead to CH4 emissions are not yet clear. We quantified internal cycling and methane emissions in three lakes during summer stratification. These methane budgets included: sediment release of CH4 at different depths; water column transport patterns and methane oxidation; methane storage in the water column; and methane emissions to the atmosphere by diffusion and ebullition. The contribution of CH4 carbon, via oxidation by methanotrophic bacteria, to pelagic food webs was also estimated. Despite the very low concentration of CH4 in surface waters, shallow, epilimnetic sediments were major contributors of CH4 to the atmosphere. While 51 - 80% of the CH4 produced in deep sediments was oxidized in the water column, most of the CH4 released from shallow sediment escaped oxidation and reached the atmosphere. Epilimnetic sediments accounted for 100% of CH4 emitted during summer stratification, and 14 - 76% considering the release of CH4 stored in deep water layers during lake circulation after the stratification period; diffusive emission accounted for 26 - 48% and ebullition the remainder. These results indicate that it is important to address transport rates of CH4 from the shallow sediment along with the production-consumption processes when trying to understand methane dynamics and the regulation of lake methane emissions.

Seasonal growth patterns, substratum preference, and potential effects of bryozoan colonies on algal assemblages attached to artificial and natural substrata were determined. Colony growth on artificial substrata (pine sticks) and natural ones (dead cypress twigs and aquatic plants) was monitored at biweekly intervals from the appearance of bryozoans during early autumn to the loss of colonies from substrata in late December. Maximum colony growth occurred during late September and early October. Some colonies reached up to 65 cm in length and 10 cm in diameter. Colonies showed no preference among the substrata examined, but young colonies always developed first on the shaded side of the substratum. The presence of bryozoan colonies affected the composition of attached algae. Blue-green algae (90%) dominated on surfaces enclosed by the colonies and also within the gelatinous colony matrix, whereas surfaces uncolonized by Bryozoa developed mixed communities of diatoms (78%), blue-green algae (12%), and green algae (11%).																			0887-3593					SEP	1992	11	3					324	333		10.2307/1467652	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1467652													WOS:A1992JP40900007

Extreme reconciliation - A case study from Diavik Diamond Mine, Canada	6TH INTERNATIONAL MINING GEOLOGY CONFERENCE	Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy Publication Series				6th International Mining Geology Conference	AUG 21-23, 2006	Darwin, AUSTRALIA	Australasian Inst Min & Met, GAA, Australasian Inst Geosci, Acquire, Minesight, SnoWDEN, Newmont, AMC Consultants, AngloGold Ashanti				The Diavik Diamond Mine is a world-class operation located in an extreme environment 220 Ion south of the Arctic Circle in Canada's Northwest Territories. The mine has a number of distinctive characteristics - such as limited winter access via an ice road, mine infrastructure being located on an island, with mining taking place behind dykes holding back a lake, temperatures at the mine that get down to -45 degrees C in winter, and the presence of bears, wolves, foxes and wolverines! One thing that Diavik does have in common with other mines around the world is the need for reconciliation. In late 2005 Diavik implemented Snowden's Reconcilor software system to facilitate the process of reconciling geological models, mine plans, production data and plant results. This paper provides a case study of the reconciliation system implementation. It outlines the migration of Diavik away from a comprehensive and effective spreadsheet-based reconciliation process to a commercial grade, automated and web-based information management system. This paper documents the reasons for moving away from the spreadsheet system, the key parameters used for reconciliation, and the benefits gained by closing the loop between reconciliation and ongoing process improvement.																					978-1-920806-50-7				2006							313	+																WOS:000243725700035

Chironomid-based reconstructions of summer air temperature from lake deposits in Lyndon Stream, New Zealand spanning the MIS 3/2 transition	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We present chi ronomid-based temperature reconstructions from lake sediments deposited between ca 26,600cal yr BP and 24,500cal yr BP from Lyndon Stream, South Island, New Zealand. Summer (February mean) temperatures averaged 1 degrees C cooler, with a maximum inferred cooling of 3.7 degrees C. These estimates corroborate macrofossil and beetle-based temperature inferences from the same site and suggest climate amelioration (an interstadial) at this time. Other records from the New Zealand region also show a large degree of variability during the late Otiran glacial sequence (34,000-18,000cal yr BP) including a phase of warming at the MIS 2/3 transition and a maximum cooling that did not occur until the global LGM (ca 20,000cal yr BP). The very moderate cooling identified here at the MIS 2/3 transition confirms and enhances the long-standing discrepancy in New Zealand records between pollen and other proxies. Low abundances (< 20%) of canopy tree pollen in records from late MIS 3 to the end of MIS 2 cannot be explained by the minor (< 5 degrees C) cooling inferred from this and other studies unless other environmental parameters are considered. Further work is required to address this critical issue. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Scott, L				Scott, L.			Fluctuations of vegetation and climate over the last 75 000 years in the Savanna Biome, South Africa: Tswaing Crater and Wonderkrater pollen sequences reviewed	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Quaternary palynological information from the Savanna Biome of South Africa is limited due to the scarcity of suitable pollen traps and new extensive pollen records of palaeoenvironments in the region are unlikely to be obtained easily. Those that are available, including the Tswaing Crater and the Wonderkrater spring sequences, can, however, be reassessed and their data optimised. These two pollen records are relevant to palaeo-environmental research in the area, although they have chronologies beyond the radiocarbon dating range that complicate interpretations. The Tswaing sequence in this study focuses on the upper 34 m of pollen-rich layers out of a total of 90 m of lake deposits. A new chronology is experimented with for this upper part of the sequence. It differs slightly from the previous one in that it does not rely on adjustments of the ages according to the precession cycle. Accordingly the age at 34 m is estimated to be c. 75 ka based on interpolation of the radiocarbon sequence and a basal fission track date of c. 200 ka at 90 m. In the case of the second site, Wonderkrater, recently published excavation and dating of the deposits and comparisons with the Tswaing pollen sequence provide new clues for the age of the lowermost deposit of the original borehole sequence of peats, sands and clay, which is estimated at c. 60 000 years. The new results better situate the two pollen sequences in a wider regional and global palaeoenvironmental framework. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Rock Glacier Hydrology in Alpine Glacial-Periglacial Systems	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Frozen sediment accumulations, including rock glaciers, talus, and moraines, constitute complex aquifers in permafrost-affected terrain. The spatial distribution of permafrost ice largely governs the flow of water through the subsurface, which exhibits a spectrum of flow patterns, ranging from diffuse flow through a porous matrix to concentrated flow along discrete channels. This study characterizes the groundwater flow system within three active rock glaciers drained by springs in the Austrian Alps. We study the alteration of recharge pulses traveling through the rock glaciers to decipher the dominant flow pattern. Key hydraulic properties are explored through a combined evaluation of spring hydrographs and fluorescence tracer tests. Water predominantly flows through a network of channels within the frozen subsurface. This flow is rapid and highly turbulent, implying high energy dissipation and effective heat transfer. Although the channels exhibit large hydraulic diameters, their irregular structure contributes to exceptionally high frictional resistance. These high energy losses accelerate the melting process and promote flow-melt feedback loops, driving permafrost degradation and facilitating flow concentration. Ultimately, the hydraulic properties of these channel networks influence permafrost thaw, solute transport, lake outburst hazards, and slope stability.					; Winkler, Gerfried/Z-3158-2019	Winkler, Gerfried/0000-0003-1742-1242; Seelig, Simon/0000-0002-2740-7260													0043-1397	1944-7973				FEB	2025	61	2							e2024WR037235	10.1029/2024WR037235	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024WR037235													WOS:001419301400001

However, few attempts have been made to study the community structure and activity of parasites at the natural community level. To analyse the dynamics of zoosporic fungal parasites (i.e. chytrids) of phytoplankton, samples were collected from February to December 2007 in two freshwater lakes. Infective chytrids were omnipresent in lakes, with higher diversity of parasites and infected phytoplankton than in previous studies. The abundance and biomass of parasites were significantly higher in the productive Lake Aydat than in the oligomesotrophic Lake Pavin, while the infection prevalence in both lakes were similar and averaged about 20%. The host species composition and their size appeared as critical for chytrid infectivity, the larger hosts being more vulnerable, including pennate diatoms and desmids in both lakes. The highest prevalence (98%) was noted for the autumn bloom of the cyanobacterium Anabaena flosaquae facing the parasite Rhizosiphon crassum in Lake Aydat. Because parasites killed their hosts, this implies that cyanobacterial blooms, and other large size inedible phytoplankton blooms as well, may not totally represent trophic bottlenecks because their zoosporic parasites can release dissolved substrates for microbial processes through host destruction, and provide energetic particles as zoospores for grazers. Overall, we conclude that the parasitism by zoosporic fungi represents an important ecological driving force in the food web dynamics of aquatic ecosystems, and infer general empirical models on chytrid seasonality and trophodynamics in lakes.

J	Landsteiner, E				Landsteiner, E			The crisis of wine production in late sixteenth-century Central Europe: Climatic causes and economic consequences	CLIMATIC CHANGE												From the mid-1580s wine production all over Central Europe dropped to a low level that was maintained beyond the turn of the century. This is concluded on the basis of four series of wine production from Lower Austria, Western Hungary, Wurttemberg, and the region surrounding the lake of Zurich (Switzerland) for the period 1550-1630. This long sequence of crop failures is related to a temperature decline in all seasons, particularly in winter, affecting Europe north of the Alps. The economic, social and political consequences of this climatic "gearshift" are investigated from the example of Lower Austria. It is shown that it had far-reaching effects for major social groups depending on the wine economy and the revenues of the Habsburg crown.																			0165-0009					SEP	1999	43	1					323	334		10.1023/A:1005590115970	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1005590115970													WOS:000082597000013

Sexual difference in PCB concentrations of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												We determined polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations in 35 female coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and 60 male coho salmon caught in Lake Michigan (Michigan and Wisconsin, United States) during the fall of 1994 and 1995. In addition, we determined PCB concentrations in the skin-on fillets of 26 female and 19 male Lake Michigan coho salmon caught during the fall of 2004 and 2006. All coho salmon were age-2 fish. These fish were caught prior to spawning, and therefore release of eggs could not account for sexual differences in PCB concentrations because female coho salmon spawn only once during their lifetime. To investigate whether gross growth efficiency (GGE) differed between the sexes, we applied bioenergetics modeling. Results showed that, on average, males were 19% higher in PCB concentration than females, based on the 1994-1995 dataset. Similarly, males averaged a 20% higher PCB concentration in their skin-on fillets compared with females. According to the bioenergetics modeling results, GGE of adult females was less than 1% higher than adult male GGE. Thus, bioenergetics modeling could not explain the 20% higher PCB concentration exhibited by the males. Nonetheless, a sexual difference in GGE remained a plausible explanation for the sexual difference in PCB concentrations.

Intermittent CAOs over East Asia significantly contribute to the global equatorward cold airmass flux. An autocorrelation analysis indicates that CAO events persist for approximately 5 days. The geographical distributions of lagged correlations/regressions with the CAO index (CAOI) clarify the temporal evolution of synoptic conditions associated with CAOs. The developing Siberian high located northwest of Lake Baikal (65 degrees N, 100 degrees E) on day -4 slowly moves southeastward, reaches maximum intensity over Siberia (50 degrees N, 110 degrees E) on day 0, and then decays while moving rapidly southward. By contrast, the Aleutian low is almost stagnant and maintains a strong intensity. The eastward pressure gradient geostrophically induces the equatorward cold airmass flux. After day -2, the cold air mass significantly decreases over Siberia, but increases over East Asia and the western North Pacific Ocean. The cold air mass continues to migrate southward while spreading eastward, and disappears mainly over the ocean. The leading edge of the high pressure anomaly moves southward at 13 ms(-1) and reaches the equator simultaneously with the equatorward wind anomaly on about day 14. An additional analysis of separating the equatorward flux into 90 degrees-135 degrees E and 135 degrees E-180 degrees suggests that CAOs are, to some extent, caused by the Siberian high and the Aleutian low acting separately.

However, there may be seasonal variability of cladoceran delta C-13 and ephippia production that could affect their use as palaeoecological indicators of pelagic carbon transfers. This is particularly likely in stratified lakes where availability of different pelagic carbon sources is seasonal. In addition, there are currently no studies on spatial variability of ephippia delta C-13 in deep areas of lakes and its implications for sampling strategies in paleolimnological studies. Four French lakes were sampled for over a year to evaluate seasonal variation of the carbon sources consumed by Daphnia using analyses of the Daphnia carbon isotope signature (delta C-13(Daphnia)) and suspended organic matter signature (delta C-13(seston)). Daphnia ephippia were also collected from surface sediments at maximum depth in the four lakes. Ephippia signatures (delta C-13(ephippia)) were compared to the delta C-13(Daphnia) to evaluate ephippia production periods and the implications for the use of delta C-13(ephippia) in trophic functioning studies. In addition, spatial variability of delta C-13(Daphnia) among the four lakes and the variability of delta C-13(ephippia) in the deep area of one lake were assessed to determine the relevance of a single sampling point in the context of paleolimnological studies. A similar pattern was observed in all four lakes: delta C-13(Daphnia) was close to delta C-13(seston) during the summer stratification period, but delta C-13(Daphnia) became much lower than delta C-13(seston) after the autumnal turnover. Ephippia seem to be produced either during the summer stratification period or after autumnal turnover depending on the lake. No spatial variability was observed among the sampling points in delta C-13(Daphnia) in the four lakes, and delta C-13(ephippia) seems to be spatially randomly distributed in the deep zone of the studied lake. In the four lakes, summer delta C-13(Daphnia) values were never below -40 parts per thousand, reflecting mainly the consumption of phytoplankton, which in turn uses varying amounts of CO2 from respiration (depending on the lake). After autumnal turnover, the delta C-13(Daphnia) values reached values far below -40 parts per thousand, reflecting the transfer of a non-negligible part of C-CH4 for three of the lakes. Seasonal stratification and turnover mechanisms seem to influence the availability of carbon sources in the pelagic compartment of the four lakes. This study shows that the timing of ephippia production affects the information provided by delta C-13(ephippia) due to seasonal differences in the mechanisms (stratification, autumnal turnover) that determine which carbon sources are available in the pelagic compartment. Therefore, using delta C-13(ephippia) to study past pelagic transfers of carbon in stratified lakes may entail uncertainty if used alone and requires multi-proxy studies. Finally, delta C-13(ephippia) appear to be homogeneously distributed in the deepest area of a medium-sized, single basin. A single core retrieved from the deepest part of the lake should therefore provide a representative sample of the ephippia produced in a lake.

This, combined with the general scarcity of terrestrial organic matter, makes obtaining a reliable and accurate chronological model based on radiocarbon ages a challenge. As a result, age-depth models based on radiocarbon dating are often constructed by correcting for the modern reservoir effect, but commonly without consideration of spatial and possible temporal variations of reservoir ages within the lake and across the basin. In order to get a better constraint on the spatial variability of the radiocarbon reservoir effects, we analyse C-14 ages of modern terrestrial and aquatic plants from the El Peinado basin in the southern Puna Plateau, which hosts Laguna del Peinado fed by hydrothermal springs. The oldest C-14 ages of modern samples (> 18 000 and > 26 000 BP) were found in hot springs discharging into the lake, likely resulting from the input of C-14-depleted carbon from old groundwater and C-14-free magmatic CO2. In the littoral and central part of Laguna del Peinado, C-14 ages of modern samples were several thousand years younger (> 13 000 and > 12 000 BP) compared to the inflowing waters as a result of CO2 exchange with the atmosphere. Altogether, our findings reveal a spatial variability of up to 14 000 C-14 years of the modern reservoir effect between the hot springs and the northern part of the Peinado lake basin. Temporal changes of reservoir effects in sediment records are more difficult to quantify, but C-14 ages from a short core from Laguna del Peinado may suggest temporal reservoir age variations of a few thousand years. This study has implications for accurate C-14-based chronologies for palaeoclimate studies in the Altiplano-Puna Plateau and similar settings. Our results highlight the need to consider spatial and likely also temporal variations in the reservoir effects when constructing age-depth models.

J	Marion, L; Paillisson, JM				Marion, L; Paillisson, JM			A mass balance assessment of the contribution of floating-leaved macrophytes in nutrient stocks in an eutrophic macrophyte-dominated lake	AQUATIC BOTANY												In this study we examine the contribution of three floating-leaved macrophyte species, Nymphaea alba, Trapa natans and Nymphoides peltata (covering about 700-750 ha), in the N and P stocks in a shallow eutrophic lake (4000-6300 ha) during a 3-year period (1995-1997). The monthly nutrient standing stocks in the above-ground structures of the plants were derived from biomass, nutrient content and area covered by each plant species during the growth period. These N and P quantities were compared to the net nutrient inputs of the lake waters from the catchment area recorded in the winter (water discharging phase), preceding the vegetation period. N and P contents reached high values for the three species (2.16-3.23% N and 0.29-0.68% P) showing the ability of the plants to accumulate large nutrient contents. Despite significant annual fluctuations in nutrient contents and biomass, not always in the same way for each floating-leaved macrophyte, and changes in the area they covered, the maximum monthly P stocks in the plants were globally uniform between the 3 years (7.10-8.85 tonnes). Maximum values for N ranged from 40.85 to 54.55 tonnes in summer. The vast beds of N. alba (until 75% of the total area in 1997), contributed largely to these annual nutrient stocks (50-72% and 46-70%, respectively, for N and P). Whereas the nutrient stocks estimated in the plants during the biomass peak represented little proportions of the annual net flux of N in the lake waters (3.35-5.00%), they reached high proportions for P sometimes exceeding the annual net loading of P in the lake according to years (16.80-156.25%). These results suggest that the nutrient-enriched sediments of the lake (6-53 and 2-6 times the net annual P and N inputs) probably compensate for annual variations in the external nutrient loading, notably for P, and floating-leaved macrophytes are likely not limited when the inputs from the catchment area are small.

J	Pierce, RB				Pierce, RB			Variable catchability and bias in population estimates for Northern Pike	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The magnitude of biases introduced into population estimates by the varying catchability of fish was observed by employing several strategies for estimating population sizes of northern pike Esox lucius in six north-central Minnesota lakes. The strategies relied on commonly used sampling techniques for northern pike and differed in the degree to which they addressed differences in catchability among fish. Biases were measured as percent differences among population estimates. Estimates of known populations of tagged fish showed that the Petersen technique, which incorporated independent gear types for marking and recapture, was relatively unbiased. Biases from differences in catchability due to fish size were small. In contrast, large biases from differing fish behaviors and habitat uses were found in removal or multiple mark-recapture methods. Both method types relied on sampling nearshore movements of northern pike during early spring, and both severely underestimated population sizes. Removal estimates were lower than the number of fish actually caught, and multiple mark-recapture estimates averaged 39% lower than Petersen estimates. These results suggest that population estimates derived by sampling a fish behavior pattern (such as nearshore spring movements of northern pike) may not be valid. The assumption of equal catchability during such movements was very sensitive. Violations of this assumption caused critically large differences in population estimates for northern pike.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				JUL	1997	126	4					658	664		10.1577/1548-8659(1997)126<0658:VCABIP>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1997)126<0658:VCABIP>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1997XU26600009

Ozone episode analyses indicate a frequency of about nine episodes per year (15 episode-days). These occur primarily in the summer months and are generally manifestations of the northern extent of the O3 problem in eastern North America. Widespread elevated O3 levels tend to occur under wheather classes indicative of back or centre of the high pressure situations and associated flow/trajectory from areas south/southwest of the lower Great Lakes. These episodes vary considerably from year-to-year. Local impacts on O3 levels are generally small. A study of O3 levels during cloud-free summer days for the period 1981-1985 gave local ''background'' O3 levels of about 20-30 ppb daily and 30-50 ppb hourly maxima. The O3 contributions from the U.S. to southern Canada (assuming local ''background'' O3 levels to be independent of wind direction) were estimated to be 30-35 ppb daily and 30-50 ppb hourly maxima. These results indicate an overall O3 contribution of about 50-60% from the U.S. to southern Ontario. For episode-days, the U.S. contribution is even more significant.																			1352-2310	1873-2844					1988	22	6					1161	1168		10.1016/0004-6981(88)90346-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0004-6981(88)90346-0													WOS:A1988P364600015

Prior to treatment, internal total phosphorus (TP) loading was 3 to 6 times greater than external TP loading during summer stratification. Periodic increases in epilimnetic TP mass and chlorophyll a concentrations closely corresponded with elevated internal TP loading. For one year following treatment, internal TP loading and concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) in the hypolimnion were substantially reduced. However, abnormally high external TP loading during the stratified period of 1986 resulted in high TP mass and chlorophyll a in the epilimnion. During the summers of 1987 and 1988, effects of alum treatment on internal TP loading were essentially negated, and epilimnetic TP mass and chlorophyll a remained unchanged from pretreatment years. Multiple potential sources of P input to this reservoir make it difficult to reduce epilimnetic P and phytoplankton growth.																			0018-8158					JUN 21	1991	215	3					231	241		10.1007/BF00764858	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00764858													WOS:A1991FY90900006

The primary focus of this study is to investigate the variability of lake levels in seven lakes scattered across Turkey using the method of continuous Wavelet transforms and global spectra. The long winter (December, January, February and March) lake-level series and the NAO index (NAOI) series were subjected to wavelet transform. The global wavelet spectrum (energy spectrum of periodicities) of lake levels and winter NAOI anomalies, in most cases, revealed a significant correlation. It was shown that the Tuz, Sapanca, and Uluabat lakes reflect much stronger influences of the NAO than the other four lakes. In contrast, weak correlations were found in the coastal areas of the Mediterranean and eastern Turkey. The periodic structures Of Turkish lake levels in relation to the NAO revealed a spectrum between the 1-year and 10-year scale level. Although the periodicities of more than 10-year scale levels were detected, explaining significant relations between the NAO and these long-term periodicities remains a challenging task. The results of this study are consistent with the earlier studies concerning the teleconnection between the NAO and climate variables in Turkey. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	POTTER, IC; BEAMISH, FWH				POTTER, IC; BEAMISH, FWH			FRESHWATER BIOLOGY OF ADULT ANADROMOUS SEA LAMPREYS PETROMYZON-MARINUS	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The lengths, weights and condition factors of young adult lampreys caught feeding on gaspereau (Alosa pseudoharengus), shad (A. sapidissima) and white suckers (Catostomus commersoni) in the lake-like extensions of the St. John River system [Canada] during May, suggest that many lampreys do not feed in the 9-10 mo. following the initiation of metamorphosis in mid-July. The mean lengths (.+-. 95% confidence limits) of individuals taken in 4 samples between May 13-29 did not differ significantly and ranged from 132.7 .+-. 2.81 to 135.7 .+-. 3.71 mm. A significant increase in mean condition factor from 1.115-1.353 during this time indicates that the short period spent feeding in May enables the animal to replenish its food reserves prior to its downstream migration. Since several of the 81 feeding adults caught between the latter part of June and mid-July, at a point 140 km from the estuary of the St. John, were still attached to spawning-run Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar; this teleost host had probably been responsible for their transport upstream. The wide range in their length (156-403 mm), together with the presence in the lakes in May of a few young adults larger than those which have only just started feeding, suggest that the time of onset of the parasitic phase is variable but may generally commence in either the late autumn or in the spring. Scarring on salmon due to lamprey attack was predominantly (84%) on the ventral surface between the operculum and caudal peduncle. Of the salmon examined in June 1975, > 35% had been attacked, more of these attacks being on the right side of the body of males (59.6%) and females (49.8%) than on either the left (20.2 and 23.7%) or both sides (20.2 and 26.5%). While lamprey attacks may cause some mortality among the smaller teleosts, any effect on salmon is probably indirect through causing increased susceptibility to infection and stress. The ability of adult anadromous sea lampreys to feed and grow in fresh water demonstrates the relative ease with which landlocked forms could have evolved in response to extreme environmental changes. This evolutionary step has involved a decline in the ability to osmoregulate in high salinities and a reduction in body size and fecundity, the adaptive significances of which are discussed. Data on upstream migrants indicate that males and females undergo length reductions of at least 11 and 15%, respectively, between the time of their entry into fresh water and the completion of spawning.																			0952-8369	1469-7998					1977	181	JAN					113	130																WOS:A1977CU52000009

This problem is exacerbated in situations where carbonate dissolution and precipitation occur in close spatial proximity. We describe here a new endolithic stigonematalean cyanobacterium, found boring into freshwater carbonate deposits that form in a spring-fed lake in Northeastern Mexico. The organism is part of a well-defined endolith layer, often underlying a zone of active carbonate precipitation. Culture studies confirm this organism's endolithic properties, and demonstrate its ability to undergo complementary chromatic adaptation. Propagation in culture occurs by hormogonia. The presence of true, subdichotomous branches, the lack of heterocysts (both in nature and in culture), and presence of terminal whips justify the placement of this organism within the genus Iyengariella DESIKACHARY. Its demonstrated endolithic habit lead us to describe it as a new species, Iyengariella endolithica sp. nov.																			0003-9136					DEC	1991				92			399	410																WOS:A1991HW77700030

Flume experimentation conducted on mixtures of quartz, pyroxene, magnetite, and lead sand transported over rough cobble beds demonstrated that the sand distribution was more uniform above the bed than theory predicted. The deviation from theory was inversely proportional to the density of the mineral. Fall velocity was not a good predictor of the amount of a mineral species carried in suspension, as coarse-grained quartz dominated the suspension Population in the flume runs where lead was a major constituent in the traction population, even though the quartz had a greater fall velocity. Applying these results to placer deposits indicates that during flood events, even the smaller dense minerals and especially the super-dense minerals will be transported with the gravel and cobble load, whereas the quartz and feldspar will be spatially segregated during transport and temporally and spatially, segregated during deposition. This mechanism of placer formation is capable of creating the types of deposits present in orebodies and showings such as the uraniferous paleoplacers at Elliot Lake, Canada, and the gold-bearing longitudinal bars in the Witwatersrand.																			0361-0128	1554-0774				DEC	2008	103	8					1657	1664		10.2113/gsecongeo.103.8.1657	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/gsecongeo.103.8.1657													WOS:000263925500004

J	Persson, I; Jones, ID				Persson, Irina; Jones, Ian D.			The effect of water colour on lake hydrodynamics: a modelling study	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The one-dimensional equation solver, PROgram for Boundary layers in the Environment, was used to simulate the temperature structure of Lake Erken, a medium-sized Swedish lake, assuming differing extinction coefficients for a series of modelled years driven by observed meteorological data and by a set of idealized meteorological data. Results suggested that, as expected, larger extinction coefficients initially led to surface waters becoming warmer. The reverse was true late in the summer, however, as the warming induced by greater absorption of solar radiation was outweighed by the cooling effects of entrained colder hypolimnetic water. 3. There was between a two- and fourfold inter-annual variation in the effects on key physical lake parameters, induced by changing extinction coefficient, such as maximum heat flux, heat content and Schmidt stability. 4. The change in surface heat flux induced by a change in extinction coefficient was up to almost 50 W m(-2). In the summer, changes in extinction coefficient from 0.5 to 0.2 m(-1) led to a dramatic shift in the duration of the stratified period as well as to enormous changes in Schmidt stability and hypolimnetic temperature. 6. Future changes to extinction coefficients of small and medium-sized lakes are likely to have wide-ranging effects on lake thermal structure and ecology.

Based on records of multiple geochemical indicators and branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers from the sediments of alpine Lake Bihu on the NETP, we reconstructed high-resolution precipitation sequences and quantified the variation of the mean air temperature of months above freezing (MAF, between May and October) over the past similar to 3500 years. The MAF reconstruction shows obvious fluctuations on decadal to centennial timescales, and the absolute values of the reconstructed temperature range from 0.70 to 3.98 degrees C, with an average of 2.19 degrees C. The precipitation record reflects the highfrequency variability of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). The maximum precipitation and temperature on the NETP occurred during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP, similar to 800-1400 CE), rather than during the Current Warm Period (CWP, the last 150 years). We also observed broadly similar patterns of warm-wet and cold-dry climatic variations over the NETP and the broader EASM region; moreover, the decadal to centennial temperature fluctuations were consistent on a large spatial scale. Our results indicate that temperature variability during the late Holocene was primarily controlled by solar radiation, interrupted by multiple decades of successive volcanic eruptions. In addition, anomalous and rapid warming during the CWP may also be related to the unprecedented increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases. Precipitation variability in this region, driven by changes in the EASM, may have been primarily a response to changes in total solar irradiance and associated changes in atmospheric-oceanic modes (e.g., the El Nin similar to o-Southern Oscillation, Intertropical Convergence Zone, and Western Pacific Subtropical High). Overall, our results provide robust evidence for global climate teleconnections between different regions, especially in high mountains, in the past, present, and potentially in the future.					; Wu, Duo/ACI-5090-2022	Youmo, Li/0009-0007-5546-3757; Lin, Chen/0000-0001-6325-6677; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				APR 1	2023	615								111442	10.1016/j.palaeo.2023.111442	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2023.111442		FEB 2023											WOS:000993666400001

Urban parks and green spaces play a crucial role in urban planning and layout, significantly impacting residents quality of life and livability. This study constructs a comprehensive landscape evaluation model, "AHP-TOPSIS-POE" from the perspective of behavioral psychological perception. It uses four urban parks in Jinan City (Qianfoshan Park, Baotu Spring Park, Daming Lake Park, and Quancheng Park) as case study samples. This method validates its feasibility by converting subjective perceptions into objective data. The research findings are as follows: (1) Urban park green space landscapes are significantly correlated with public psychological recovery; (2) The weight ranking of the criteria layer is as follows: Landscape Perception (B4) 0.5135 > Social Interaction (B3) 0.3015 > Spatial Form (B2) 0.1244 > Visual Quality (B1) 0.0606; (3) The relative closeness ranking of the four typical urban parks in Jinan City is as follows: Qianfoshan Park > Quancheng Park > Daming Lake Park > Baotu Spring Park. This study aims to reduce the subjectivity of evaluation indicators, raise public awareness of high-quality cognition and emotional experiences, and provide a scientific basis for the development of scientifically reasonable urban park green landscapes.					cheng, qingtao/GWR-0388-2022														1664-1078					FEB 6	2025	16								1418477	10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1418477	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1418477								39981382					WOS:001426397700001

Glacial Erosion Drives High Summer Mercury Exports from the Yukon River, Canada	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY LETTERS												Mercury concentrations and yields in the Yukon River are the highest of the world's six largest panarctic drainages. Permafrost thaw has been implicated as the main driver of these high values. Alternative sources include mercury released from glacial melt and erosion, atmospheric mercury pollution, or surface mining. To determine the summer source and speciation of mercury across the Yukon River basin within Canada, we sampled water from 12 tributaries and the mainstem during July 2021. The total (unfiltered) mercury concentration in the glacier-fed White River was 57 ng/L, >10 times higher than all other sampled tributaries. The White River's high total mercury concentrations were driven by suspended sediment and persisted similar to 300 km downstream of glacierized headwaters. Total mercury concentrations were lowest (typically <2 ng/L) in tributaries downstream of still-water landscape features (e.g., lakes and settling ponds), suggesting these features are effective sinks for sediment-bound mercury. Low total mercury concentrations (similar to 2 ng/L) were also observed in five tributaries across diverse thawing permafrost landscapes. These results suggest that glacial erosion and meltwater transport, not permafrost, drive enhanced exports of mercury with suspended sediment. Mercury exports may decline as glacial watersheds pass peak water. Other factors, including mercury released from permafrost thaw, are minor components at present.					; Cooke, Colin/E-7842-2011	Cooke, Colin/0000-0002-7417-5263; Reyes, Alberto/0000-0002-7838-4214; Staniszewska, Kasia/0000-0002-8906-1744													2328-8930					OCT 9	2023	10	11					1117	1124		10.1021/acs.estlett.3c00427	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.estlett.3c00427		OCT 2023						38025955					WOS:001082590500001

A non-parametric regression method, generalized additive models (GAM), was used to analyse the correlations among eleven physicochemical and biological parameters as well as three meteorological factors (wind speed, rainfall and solar radiation) which we collected from 2000 to 2011. The results indicate that the three meteorological factors may have positive effects on SS. Moreover, statistically significant correlations between many water quality parameters and SS or TDS were exhibited seasonally. The correlations between electrical conductivity (EC) and SS were opposite to correlations between EC and TDS. This finding reveals that TDS have a positive impact on EC, while EC negatively affects SS. The results indicated that many parameters, such as total nitrogen, total phosphorus, biological oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD), were related to SS due to the adsorption of SS. Moreover, both positive and negative correlations between COD and TDS were observed in this freshwater reservoir. The positive correlation between chlorophyll a and SS suggested that the change of SS concentration in autumn was caused by the growth of algae. Meanwhile, significant correlations between SS and meteorological factors were also observed, indicating that meteorological factors had effects on SS dynamics. This study provides useful information regarding the correlations among water quality parameters, SS and TDS with meteorological factors in a freshwater reservoir.

Eels were highly nocturnal and crepuscular, with 98.1% of positions detected between sunset and sunrise, and were more active during dusk and dawn compared with nighttime, and during full moons compared with other lunar periods. Most diurnal activity occurred during darker conditions, and two individuals extended their activity into the morning, suggesting that overcast skies reduced light intensity and prolonged nocturnal activity into daytime. Individual eels had different home-range patterns, but appeared to rest nearshore during the day, with space utilization expanding offshore at dusk and night, followed by returning to nearshore at dawn. Their home ranges and core activity areas were bordered by the shoreline, with eels tending to exhibit small activity spaces and strong site fidelity. This study provides valuable ecological knowledge about the individual behavior of eels inhabiting a small brackish lake at the northern limit of the natural distributional range of the species along the Sea of Japan, which can contribute to management and conservation of the species.

A Systematic Investigation into the Environmental Fate of Microcystins and The Potential Risk: Study in Lake Taihu	TOXINS												A systematic investigation was conducted in Lake Taihu in autumn of 2013 and 2014, in order to understand the environmental fate of microcystins (MCs) and evaluate the health risk from MCs. Samples of water, algal cells, macrophytes, shrimps and fish were taken to detect MCs by HPLC-MS/MS after solid phase extraction. Widespread MC contamination in water, algal cells, macrophytes, shrimps and fish was found in Lake Taihu. The ubiquitous presence of MCs in water, algal cells and biota was found in 100% of samples. MC accumulation was in the order of primary producer > tertiary consumer > secondary consumer > primary consumer. The highest levels of MCs in macrophytes, shrimps and fish tissue were found in Potamogeton maackianus, Exopalaemon modestus, and Hyporhamphus intermedius, respectively. The MCs level in shrimps and the tissues of three fish species, Neosalanx tangkahkeii taihuensis, Coilia ectenes and silver carp, was closely linked to their dietary exposure. Ceratophyllum demersum L. was an ideal plant for introduction into lakes to protect against Microcystis blooms and MCs, due to its ability to absorb nutrients, accumulate large amounts of MCs and tolerate these toxins compared to other macrophytes. The average daily intakes (ADIs) of MCs for Exopalaemon modestus and three fish species, Coilia ectenes, Hyporhamphus intermedius and Carassius carassius, were all above the tolerable daily intakes (TDI) set by the World Health Organization (WHO), implying there existed potential threats to human health.					; Lauridsen, Torben/JAX-3118-2023	Lauridsen, Torben/0000-0003-0139-2395; 														2072-6651				JUN	2016	8	6							170	10.3390/toxins8060170	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/toxins8060170								27271667					WOS:000378808700013

They represent an active and rapidly growing component of freshwater bacterioplankton, with the highest numbers observed usually in summer. Species diversity of freshwater AAP bacteria has been studied before in lakes, but its seasonal dynamics remain unknown. In this report, we analysed temporal changes in the composition of the phototrophic community in an oligo-mesotrophic freshwater lake using amplicon sequencing of the pufM marker gene. The AAP community was dominated by phototrophic Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria, with smaller contribution of phototrophic Chloroflexota and Gemmatimonadota. Phototrophic Eremiobacteriota or members of Myxococcota were not detected. Interestingly, some AAP taxa, such as Limnohabitans, Rhodoferax, Rhodobacterales or Rhizobiales, were permanently present over the sampling period, while others, such as Sphingomonadales, Rhodospirillales or Caulobacterales appeared only transiently. The environmental factors that best explain the seasonal changes in AAP community were temperature, concentrations of oxygen and dissolved organic matter.

Effects of solar forcing and North Atlantic oscillation on the climate of continental Scandinavia during the Holocene	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												10,000-year-long varved sediment records from lakes Nautajarvi and Korttajarvi, Finland provide evidence of climate and environment oscillations at multi-decadal to millennial timescales. We used two independent methods to extract periodic features from these time series of clastic laminae and assess their statistical reliability. Analyses revealed that seasonal sediment fluxes correspond to environmental changes with statistically significant periodicities of 1500-1800, 1000, 600-800, nearly 300, nearly 200, 150-170, nearly 90 and 47 years, showing variable coherency with different climate forcing factors and other palaeoproxy records in the Northern Hemisphere. Results indicate that the Holocene winter climate in continental Scandinavia was forced by a combination of several factors, at least by solar variability and the North Atlantic ocean atmosphere circulation-patterns, with varying influences through time.

J	Yan, Q; Owen, LA; Zhang, ZS; Jiang, NX; Zhang, R				Yan, Qing; Owen, Lewis A.; Zhang, Zhongshi; Jiang, Nanxuan; Zhang, Ran			Deciphering the evolution and forcing mechanisms of glaciation over the Himalayan-Tibetan orogen during the past 20,000 years	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												The evolution of past glaciations over the Himalayan-Tibetan orogen and their links with climate change remain elusive, partially owing to the immense scale of the orogen preventing the investigation of all areas. Numerical modeling aids in filling the gaps, verifying the geologic observations, and exploring forcing factors. Based on a transient climate-ice sheet simulation for the past 20 kyr, we demonstrate that the maximum extent of glaciation over the Himalayan-Tibetan orogen occurs around the last glacial maximum (LGM; defined here at similar to 20 ka), with expanded ice caps and extensive valley glaciers and being equivalent to a fourfold/sixfold expansion of today's glacier area/volume. The glacier extent shrinks rapidly after the LGM and reaches the minimum around similar to 8-7 ka, followed by a slight longterm advancing trend afterwards. Our results suggest a dominant role of summer temperature in controlling the overall trend of glacier response, with precipitation generally modulating the regional extent of glaciation. However, the timing and extent of glaciation in the simulations varies across the Himalayan-Tibetan orogen on millennial timescale, especially between the monsoon-influenced southern and westerly-influenced western parts, further confirming previous speculations based on glacial geologic records. Despite the uncertainties in the simulations and the discrepancy in glaciation between the simulations and the glacial geologic evidence (e.g., Be-10 ages), our results provide additional clues on the relationship between climatic change and glacier response. In addition, the modeling aids in advancing our knowledge of the paleoglaciological history of the Himalayan-Tibetan orogen. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Sediments deposited before the twentieth century contained low diatom abundances comprising species associated with oligotrophic conditions. Diatom-assemblage reorganization in the early to mid-twentieth century resulted in an increase in diatom-model-inferred water-column-phosphorus concentrations associated with cultural eutrophication. In recent decades, better nutrient management and water-quality recovery drove a decline of high-nutrient indicating diatom taxa. The most recent two decades manifest the effects of the extensive dreissenid invasion (a continued reduction in diatom-accumulation rate) and likely atmospheric warming (the rise in summer-diatom taxa representing a longer summer stratification and ice-free period). Like many areas of the Great Lakes basin, Lake Michigan's paleolimnological sequence reflects the widespread eutrophication of the twentieth century, followed by remediation and a modern condition affected by multiple stressors.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				AUG	2025	73	4					347	360		10.1007/s10933-025-00363-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-025-00363-1		JUN 2025						40655310					WOS:001501649400001

Temperature probes indicated that during the winter benthic invertebrates in sediments at 0.5 and 1.75 m were exposed to temperature as low as -18 and -8.degree. C, respectively. Mortality in animals that had overwintered in the frozen samples ranged from 13 to 84% (mean 46%) and was attributed mostly to sample processing. With the possible exception of chironomids, no conclusive evidence was found that benthic invertebrates avoid freezing by emigrating to deeper portions of the lake. Exposure to subzero temperatures for 8 months or more increased the synchrony in development of the population of the harpacticoid Attheyella nordenskioldii and shifted its peak reproductive period by about 4 months. These changes implied increases in the population''s gross production, growth efficiency, and ecological efficiency. The exposure of shallow-dwelling benthic invertebrates to subzero temperatures is a widespread phenomenon, the effects of which on life cycles and population energetics are poorly known.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				DEC	1985	63	12					2825	2834		10.1139/z85-422	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z85-422													WOS:A1985A024000018

The field site, Lake Tahoe (CA-NV) during winter, is characterized by the presence of a weak density stratification and the passage of several storm fronts of varying character. Under these conditions internal waves with periods greater than 5 days and displacements of 30 m are possible. The model used is shown to have negligible numerical dissipation and sufficiently small phase lag over the time periods needed to represent basin-scale waves. Both the numerical results and the observations identify the presence of three Kelvin modes and one Poincare mode. While the wave periods are consistent with theoretical predictions, the spatial characteristics are far more complex than theory can predict. The spatial features are revealed through analysis of the integrated potential and kinetic energy fields yielded by the model. This shows that the basin topography exerts an influence on both Kelvin and Poincare waves. The effect of the variable storms and, in particular, the phasing of the storms with respect to the internal waves is shown to be responsible for the amplification and annihilation of the basin-scale waves.

JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China located at the midstream of the Yangtze River, and the water level has witnessed a decline both interannually and annually since the operation of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) located at the upstream of the Yangtze River in 2003. However, the impact of TGD on the spatial and temporal variation of water levels in the Poyang Lake remains to be elucidated. In this study, the long-term observed water levels at different stations in the Poyang Lake and Yangtze River were analyzed by seasonaltrend decomposition based on loess to determine the impact of TGD on the spatial and temporal variation of water levels in the Poyang Lake. The results reveal that TGD has no obvious impact on the interannual variation of water levels, but accounts for a major part of the annual variation of water levels in the impounding season of TGD (autumn). The effect of the Yangtze River is larger in the northern area that is close to the Yangtze River than that in the southern area of the lake; but the effect of the Poyang Lake itself is most obvious in the central area. TGD has both positive and negative consequences on the water level of the Poyang Lake. It can result in an obvious decrease in the water level and prolong the duration of drought, but it can also reduce the variation amplitude of water levels anywhere in the Poyang Lake and control the maximum and minimum water levels. This study may provide insights into the impact of TGD on the Poyang Lake and thus contribute to water resources conservation and ecological restoration of the lake in the future.					; Si-Yi, Zhang/ISS-2652-2023; Jin, Guangqiu/B-2590-2012; Zhang, ZT/GQG-9530-2022	Xu, Jing/0000-0002-0848-2361; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				FEB	2022	605								127356	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.127356	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.127356		DEC 2021											WOS:000752448600003

Monitoring of Lake Marathonas, a water reservoir of Athens, Greece	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												A method for the determination of the hepatotoxic cyanotoxins microcystins (MCs, i.e. MC-LR, MC-RR, MC-YR, MC-LA) and nodularin (NOD) in water was developed using liquid chromatography with electro-spray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) after solid phase extraction (SPE). New patterns of fragmentation of MC-LA were observed under the experimental conditions used. The method was fully validated to meet accreditation criteria. Mean recoveries at three concentration levels (0.006, 0.1 and 1 mu g L-1) ranged between 70 and 114% with %RSD values generally below 20%. Detection limits were 2 ng L-1 for all hepatotoxins. The method was applied to study the occurrence of MCs and NOD in Lake Marathonas, a water reservoir of Athens, over a period from July 2007 to December 2010. The protein phosphatase inhibition assay (PPIA) was additionally used for fast screening of samples. MC-YR, MC-LR and MC-RR were detected and found to vary seasonally with consistent peaks during early autumn, having maximum concentrations of 717, 451 and 174 ng L-1, respectively. The results of this study constitute the first report on the presence, concentration levels and seasonal variations of MCs in Lake Marathonas.

In this study, we present an accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon dated record of delta O-18 variations in authigenic carbonates derived from Lake Chenghai in southwest China, a region that receives moisture mainly from the Indian Ocean. The delta O-18 values vary from -11.9 to +0.1 parts per thousand, providing a detailed record of variations in ISM precipitation delta O-18 values, and lake hydrological balance. The record shows that the ISM generally strengthened in the post-glacial between 15.6 and 8.8 cal ka BP, but that three centennial to millennial-scale drought events were superimposed on the long-term trend. Drought events, as indicated by substantial positive shifts in 8 18 0 value, occurred from 15.6 +/- 0.2 to 14.4 +/- 0.2, 12.5 +/- 0.2 to 11.7 +/- 0.2 and 10.1 +/- 0.1 to 10.0 +/- 0.1 cal ka BP, corresponding to the Heinrich 1, Younger Dryas, and Bond 7 cold events in the North Atlantic region, respectively. The timings of these droughts are suggested to be related to meltwater discharge into the North Atlantic.

Public concern was heightened when a large percentage of winter flounder taken from Boston Harbor was found to have visible cancer of the liver; winter flounder outside the estuary area had no liver lesions. Long-term chemical carcinogenesis studies could be easily and feasibly designed using laboratory rodents offered diets containing fish caught in polluted waters. Induced cancers in rodents would corroborate field observations in fish; positive results from these studies would provide further evidence about potential human health hazards from eating substantial amounts of chemically contaminated fish. Nonetheless, fish and aquatic organisms should be viewed as environmental biological monitors of pollution or of potential human health hazards, and authorities responsible for assuring clean and safe rivers, bodies of water, and biota should give more attention to these valid biological indicators or sentinels of environmental pollution. Consequently, fish and other sea creatures alone should serve as alarms regarding whether water areas constitute public health hazards.																			0091-6765	1552-9924				JAN	1991	90						127	132		10.2307/3430856	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3430856								2050050					WOS:A1991FD60300019
J	Insel, N; Berkelhammer, M				Insel, Nadja; Berkelhammer, Max			The influence of orbital parameters on the North American Monsoon system during the Last Interglacial Period	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												The response of summer precipitation in the western United States to climate variability remains a subject of uncertainty. For example, palaeoclimate records indicate the North American Monsoon (NAM) was stronger and spatially more extensive during the Holocene, whereas recent modelling suggests a weakened NAM response to increasing temperatures. These illustrate diverging pictures of the NAM response to warming. Here, we examine summer precipitation in the southwestern US related to Last Interglacial insolation forcing. Using a high-resolution climate model, we find that Eemian insolation forcing results in overall wetter conditions throughout most of the southwestern US, but significantly drier than present conditions over Arizona. The overall wetter conditions are associated with a northward shift of the anticyclonic circulation aloft and increased moisture in the lower and mid-troposphere during the Eemian. Increased advection of Gulf of Mexico moisture is responsible for increasing precipitation in New Mexico and the northern edges of the NAM region. Drier conditions over Arizona are likely related to reduced local convection associated with reduced vertical moisture transport. These results highlight the spatial complexity of the NAM response to increasing radiative forcing and allow a better understanding of monsoon dynamics and variability in response to a warming climate.																			0267-8179	1099-1417				MAY	2021	36	4					638	648		10.1002/jqs.3311	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jqs.3311		MAY 2021											WOS:000649015100001

Lacustrine mineral magnetic record of postglacial environmental changes from Dahu Swamp, southern China	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Systematic studies of lacustrine magnetic sediments can provide useful information to decipher the catchment processes of specific environmental changes. To explore the magnetic mineral-paleoenvironment connections, we have conducted a mineral-magnetic investigation on a lacustrine sediment core recovered from a closed basin lake in the eastern Nanling Mountains of southern China. Our results show that the magnetic minerals in the sediments were mainly catchment-derived, and the post-depositional effects, or biogenic and authigenic growth of secondary ferrimagnetic minerals, were probably insignificant or absent. The catchment soil erosion, pedogenic development, and vegetation coverage are interpreted as the main forcing in controlling the variations in magnetic parameters. During the last deglaciation period (similar to 16,500-11,100 yr BP), the relatively high and significant variations in magnetic parameters of sediments could have corresponded to the rapid climate fluctuations after the cool and dry Last Glacial Maximum. In the Holocene (11,100 yr BP to present), the low magnetic concentrations and increases in finer magnetic particles likely resulted from the stabilization of the watershed and more intense pedogenic processes under the warm and wet climate. Because changes in surface runoff, vegetation coverage, and soil pedogenic processes are closely related to Asian summer monsoon (ASM) intensity, the sedimentary magnetism of Dahu Swamp can provide another valuable source of information to investigate the development of the ASM in southern China.

Brongn.) infestation and removal on macroinvertebrate biodiversity and conservation in spring-fed streams in the Australian arid zone	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												Removal of invasive macrophytes is a priority for river managers. However, the ecological effects of macrophyte removal on macroinvertebrate diversity are rarely examined but may be of particular significance in conservation reserves and when threatened species are present. 2This study investigated the macroinvertebrate fauna inhabiting invasive and native macrophytes in spring-fed channels in the Millstream-Chichester National Park, Australia. The effects of waterfern management (periodic hand-weeding) were examined by comparing assemblages at weeded and unweeded reaches on three occasions. 3Ceratopteris thalictroides harboured a diverse, insect-dominated macroinvertebrate assemblage, including the endangered damselfly Nososticta pilbara. Total taxon richness was similar between waterfern and native macrophytes, but macroinvertebrate assemblages differed in the dry season. Damselflies (including N. pilbara) were associated with waterfern-dominated reaches, whereas dragonfly nymphs were more common among native macrophytes. 4Weeding altered macroinvertebrate assemblage composition. Some weeded reaches developed assemblages indistinguishable from those in native-dominated reaches, but others did not. Weeded reaches often supported taxa that were rare or absent from waterfern-dominated reaches, including suspension feeders, found also in native-dominated reaches. 5Odonata are particularly diverse at Millstream, with 18 species recorded. Odonate species richness was significantly lower at weeded reaches than unweeded reaches. Nososticta pilbara and other short-range endemic species were absent from weeded reaches. As most odonates are univoltine, these adverse effects on local population size may affect species persistence. 6Invasive macrophyte species may support a high diversity of native invertebrates, including endangered and short-range endemic species. Furthermore, although hand-weeding appeared to enable a greater diversity of species to co-exist, the removal of a large biomass of macrophytes appeared to remove whole cohorts of insect populations from stream reaches, including endangered species. Removal of invasive macrophytes should not be implemented without understanding their effects on invertebrate assemblage composition and life-cycles.

Here, we investigated the effects of biological invasions on the seasonality of leaf litter decomposition, a crucial freshwater ecosystem function. Decomposition rates were quantified in 18 temperate shallow lakes distributed along a gradient of crayfish invasion and a temperature-based model was constructed to predict yearly patterns of decomposition. We found that, through direct detritus consumption, omnivorous invasive crayfish accelerated decomposition rates up to fivefold in spring, enhancing temperature dependence of the process and shortening the period of major detritus availability in the ecosystem by up to 39 days (95% CI: 15-61). The fact that our estimates are an order of magnitude higher than any previously reported climate-driven phenological shifts indicates that some powerful drivers of phenological change have been largely overlooked.

The model reasonably reproduces the in situ measured ice thickness and water temperature profile, and satellite retrieved ice coverage and lake surface temperature. Seasonally, the lake ice first forms in the eastern basin during early January, expands from east to west during January and February, covers nearly the entire LNC in March, starts melting from west to east in April, and eventually disappears in May. The eastward drift of thin ice throughout the ice-covered phase and the eastward water heat transport during the ice melting phase are key factors to determine the spatial variation of ice and freeze-thaw processes. A multiple linear regression analysis confirms that the eastward drift of thin ice can be mostly attributed to the prevailing westerly. During 2007-2017, ice volume, duration, ice-on and ice-off dates show significant interannual variations, and they are highly correlated with the surface air temperature (T2m) averaged over January-March, from the preceding December to May, in December and over March-May, respectively, suggesting the "cumulative effects" of T2m. Seasonal and interannual variations of ice drift are attributed to the combined effects of wind and ice volume variations. Sensitivity analysis further points out the important impacts of ice on the lake temperature and circulation structure in winter and spring, hence the necessity of hydrodynamic-ice coupled models in large TP lakes. The space-time variations of ice play fundamental roles in controlling a wide range of physical and biogeochemical processes within lakes, as well as the regional climate, mainly by modulating the lake-air interactions. In this study, we use a three-dimensional lake-ice coupled model to investigate the space-time variations of ice and the underlying mechanisms in Lake Nam Co, the third largest lake over Tibetan Plateau. The numerical model reasonably reproduces the seasonal evolution of ice coverage from satellite remote sensing and ice thickness from in situ observations. Model results reveal that the eastward drift of thin ice throughout the ice-covered phase and eastward water heat transport during the ice melting phase, which are related to the prevailing westerly, are key factors controlling the spatial variation of lake ice. The ice area, volume, duration, ice-on date and ice-off date all show large interannual variability, which can be mostly attributed to the "cumulative effects" of surface air temperature over different preceding months.

Five N-S faults close to known hot springs were identified for geoelectric ground investigation. Aeromagnetic data were employed to further probe faults at greater depths and determine the Curie-point depth. Results indicate a funnel-shaped fluid-filled (mostly saline hydrothermal) zone with relatively low resistivity values of less than 1 Omega-m, separated by resistive structures to the west and east, to a depth of 75m along the resistivity profiles. There was evidence of saline hydrothermal fluid flow toward the surface through the fault splays. The observed faults extend from the surface to a depth of 7.5 km and are probably the ones that bound the graben laterally. They serve as major conduits for the upward heat flux in the study area. The aeromagnetics spectral analysis also revealed heat source emplacement at a depth of about 12 km. The relative shallowness implies a high geothermal gradient evidenced in the surface manifestations of hot springs along the lake margins. Correlation of the heat source with the hypocenters showed that the seismogenetic zone exists directly above the magmatic intrusion, forming the commencement of geodynamic activities.

Impact of Summer Cattle Grazing on the Sierra Nevada Watershed: Aquatic Algae and Bacteria	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH												Introduction. We evaluated periphytic algal and microbial communities to assess the influence of human and cattle impact on Sierra water quality. Methods. 64 sites (lakes and streams from Lake Tahoe to Sequoia National Park, California) were sampled for suspended indicator bacteria and algae following standardized procedures. The potential for nonpoint pollution was divided into three categories: cattle-grazing areas (C), recreation use areas (R), or remote wildlife areas (W). Results. Periphyton was found at 100% of C sites, 89% of R sites, but only 25% of W sites. Eleven species of periphytic algae were identified, including Zygnema, Ulothrix, Chlorella, Spirogyra, mixed Diatoms, and Cladophoria. Mean benthic algae coverage was 66% at C sites compared to 2% at W sites (P < 0.05). The prevalence of E. coli associated with periphyton was 100% at C sites, 25% of R sites, and 0% of W sites. Mean E. coli CFU/gm of algae detected was: C = 173, 000, R = 700, W = 0. (P < 0.05). Analysis of neighboring water for E. coli bacteria > 100 CFU/100 mL: C = 91%, R = 8%, W = 0 (P < 0.05). Conclusion. Higher periphytic algal biomass and uniform presence of periphyton-attached E. coli corresponded to watersheds exposed to summer cattle grazing. These differences suggest cattle grazing compromises water quality.

Levels of pesticide residues in water, sediment, and fish samples collected from Nile River in Cairo, Egypt	ENVIRONMENTAL FORENSICS												Pesticides constitute one of the major sources of environmental hazards to human and animals as they concentrate in the food chain. Organochlorine, organophosphorus, and carbamate pesticides were investigated using water, sediment, and fish (Clarias gariepinus, Oreochromis niloticus, and Tilapia zillii) muscle samples of the Nile River in Cairo region (Egypt). Pesticide residues were analyzed seasonally using gas chromatography. The results showed that the average total pesticide residue in sediment was higher (63.5 +/- 36.2ppb) than that in water samples (45.1 +/- 35.0ppb). High levels of total pesticide residues in water and sediment samples were detected in autumn (73.57 +/- 62.97 and 103.03 +/- 16.05ppb, respectively), which may be attributed to the increase in suspended matter (low flood) and high application of pesticides during that season. Pesticide residue in tissue samples of C. gariepinus amounted to 49.1 +/- 17.8ppb followed by T. zillii (48.3 +/- 18.9ppb) and O. niloticus (45.6 +/- 28.7ppb). The relatively high levels of total pesticide residue on C. gariepinus tissue may be explained by the nature of catfish habits and feeding. The estimated pesticide residual concentrations in fish samples did not exceed the maximum residue limits. Health risk estimation revealed that all tested pesticides in the studied fish species had no potential for systemic toxicity to consumers, but regular monitoring is recommended to control the levels of pesticide residues in the Nile River ecosystem.

J	Zhao, DH; Jiang, H; Yang, TW; Cai, Y; Xu, DL; An, SQ				Zhao, Dehua; Jiang, Hao; Yang, Tangwu; Cai, Ying; Xu, Delin; An, Shuqing			Remote sensing of aquatic vegetation distribution in Taihu Lake using an improved classification tree with modified thresholds	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Classification trees (CT) have been used successfully in the past to classify aquatic vegetation from spectral indices (SI) obtained from remotely-sensed images. However, applying CT models developed for certain image dates to other time periods within the same year or among different years can reduce the classification accuracy. In this study, we developed CT models with modified thresholds using extreme SI values (CTm) to improve the stability of the models when applying them to different time periods. A total of 903 ground-truth samples were obtained in September of 2009 and 2010 and classified as emergent, floating-leaf, or submerged vegetation or other cover types. Classification trees were developed for 2009 (Model-09) and 2010 (Model-10) using field samples and a combination of two images from winter and summer. Overall accuracies of these models were 92.8% and 94.9%, respectively, which confirmed the ability of CT analysis to map aquatic vegetation in Taihu Lake. However, Model-10 had only 58.9-71.6% classification accuracy and 31.1-58.3% agreement (i.e., pixels classified the same in the two maps) for aquatic vegetation when it was applied to image pairs from both a different time period in 2010 and a similar time period in 2009. We developed a method to estimate the effects of extrinsic (EF) and intrinsic (IF) factors on model uncertainty using Modis images. Results indicated that 71.1% of the instability in classification between time periods was due to EF, which might include changes in atmospheric conditions, sun-view angle and water quality. The remainder was due to IF, such as phenological and growth status differences between time periods. The modified version of Model-10 (i.e. CTm) performed better than traditional CT with different image dates. When applied to 2009 images, the CTm version of Model-10 had very similar thresholds and performance as Model-09, with overall accuracies of 92.8% and 90.5% for Model-09 and the CTm version of Model-10, respectively. CTm decreased the variability related to EF and IF and thereby improved the applicability of the models to different time periods. In both practice and theory, our results suggested that CTm was more stable than traditional CT models and could be used to map aquatic vegetation in time periods other than the one for which the model was developed.

Scatterometer observations identify two physical sources of backscatter from the ice cover: the snow-ice and ice-water interfaces. Backscatter time series at all frequencies show increases from the ice-water interface prior to the inclusion of tubular bubbles in the ice column based on in situ observations, indicating scattering mechanisms independent of double-bounce scatter. The co-polarized phase difference of interactions at the ice-water interface from both scatterometer and SAR observations is centered at 0 degrees during the time series, also indicating a scattering regime other than double bounce. A Yamaguchi three-component decomposition of the RADARSAT-2 C-band time series is presented, which suggests the dominant scattering mechanism to be single-bounce off the ice-water interface with appreciable surface roughness or preferentially oriented facets, regardless of the presence, absence, or density of tubular bubble inclusions. This paper builds on newly established evidence of single-bounce scattering mechanism for freshwater lake ice and is the first to present a winter time series of ground-based and spaceborne fully polarimetric active microwave observations with polarimetric decompositions for bubbled freshwater lake ice.					; Duguay, Claude/G-5682-2011	Gunn, Grant/0000-0003-4886-5364; Duguay, Claude/0000-0002-1044-5850													0196-2892	1558-0644				MAY	2018	56	5					2887	2903		10.1109/TGRS.2017.2786158	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2017.2786158													WOS:000430739600030
J	STRAYER, RF; TIEDJE, JM				STRAYER, RF; TIEDJE, JM			KINETIC-PARAMETERS OF CONVERSION OF METHANE PRECURSORS TO METHANE IN A HYPER-EUTROPHIC LAKE SEDIMENT	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The kinetic parameters Km, Vmax Tt (turnover time), and v (natural velocity) were determined for H2 and acetate conversion to methane by Wintergreen Lake [Michigan USA] sediment, using short-term (a few hours) methods and incubation temperatures of 10 to 14.degree. C. Estimates of the Michaelis-Menten constant, Km, for both the consumption of H2 and the conversion of H2 to methane by sediment microflora averaged about 0.024 .mu.mol g-1 of dry sediment. The maximal velocity, Vmax, averaged 4.8 .mu.mol of H2 g-1 h-1 for H2 consumption and 0.64 .mu.mol of CH4 g-1 h-1 for the conversion of H2 to methane during the winter. Estimated natural rates of H2 consumption and H2 conversion to methane could be calculated from the Michaelis-Menten equation and estimates of Km, Vmax, and the in situ dissolved-H2 concentration. These results indicate that methane may not be the only fate of H2 in the sediment. Among several potential H2 donors tested, only formate stimulated the rate of sediment methanogenesis. Formate conversion to methane was so rapid that an accurate estimate of kinetic parameters was not possible. Kinetic experiments using [2-14C]acetate and sediments collected in the summer indicated that acetate was being converted to methane at or near the maximal rate. A minimum natural rate of acetate conversion to methane was estimated to be about 110 nmol of CH4 g-1 h-1, which was 66% of the Vmax(163 nmol of CH4 g-1 h-1). A 15-min preincubation of sediment with 5.0 .times. 10-3 atmospheres of H2 had a pronounced effect on the kinetic parameters for the conversion of acetate to methane. The acetate pool size, expressed as the term Km + Sn (Sn is in situ substrate concentration), decreased by 37% and Tt decreased by 43%. The Vmax remained relatively constant. A preincubation with H2 also caused a 37% decrease in the amount of labeled CO2 produced from the metabolism of [U-14C]valine by sediment heterotrophs.

The limnocorrals were 5 m in diameter and from 5-6 m in depth and were open to the sediments. In 1983 four limnocorrals were deployed in an isolated bay of Toolik Lake within a cross-classified treatment regime of high and low inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus additions and high and low free swimming fish additions. The objective of the nutrient addition was to stimulate phytoplankton growth and determine the extent to which increased plant production was passed through pelagic and benthic food chains. The objective of the fish addition was to determine the impact of fish predation on large-bodied zooplankton, especially the zooplanktivorous copepod Heterocope, then to study the effect of altered Heterocope densities on small-bodied zooplankton species population dynamics. In 1984 two more limnocorrals were deployed, one a low fish, 1 x nutrient addition treatment and the other a no fish, no nutrient treatment. The fish manipulation was changed to confining several fish in cages with the cages held in corrals for varying lengths of time. The addition of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus dramatically increased phytoplankton productivity. This increase in algal biomass and production greatly altered the light environment and water quality in the nutrient treated limnocorrals. The secchi disk depth in the nutrient treated limnocorrals declined each summer reaching as low as 1 m in 1985. Both oxygen content and pH increased in the nutrient treatment corrals. Corrals not receiving nutrient additions remained near lake concentrations for most water quality parameters. While phytoplankton biomass was stimulated in 1983 phytoplankton growth was not sufficient to draw down all the nitrogen and phosphorus added and these nutrients reached high levels in the last half of the summer. In 1984 phosphorus remained above 20 mug in the nutrient-treated corrals but ammonia dropped to reference levels by day 25. In 1985 both nutrient concentrations rapidly declined to reference levels. Most pelagic components responded to the nutrient additions. Microbial production was stimulated in the nutrient treated limnocorrals and bacterial population sizes built up to nearly 8-10 times those of the reference corrals. However, microheterotrophs soon increased in abundance and apparently grazed down bacteria to reference levels. Phytoplankton population density, as estimated by chlorophyll a determinations, increased dramatically with nutrient addition such that each year the phytoplankton densities were higher than before. Primary productivity was also stimulated and appeared not to be light limited even when phytoplankton densities rose to high levels. In the first two years of the experiment zooplankton densities were little altered by the increased phytoplankton densities. However, by 1985 daphnid densities were quite a bit higher in the high nutrient addition limnocorrals. The benthic community and sediment response was much less affected by nutrient addition. Overall sediment respiration increased in the nutrient treated corrals but underlying sediments seemed little affected. Decomposition of Carex litter was likewise little affected by nutrient addition. Benthic invertebrates were also little impacted by the nutrient addition and increased sedimentation of phytoplankton. However, the response of benthic invertebrates is difficult to assess fully in the current experiment because chironomids, a prominent component of the benthic community, failed to recruit into the limnocorrals and the corrals physically shifted during ice-out in the spring of 1984 disturbing the sediment in several corrals. The fish additions in 1983 of free swimming grayling essentially eliminated large bodied zooplankton, especially Heterocope septentrionalis, from all four limnocorrals. In subsequent summers Heterocope were not so dramatically preyed upon but generally were found in higher densities in the low or no fish treatments. However, either when Heterocope were eliminated in 1983 or were in rough inverse proportion to fish density, altered Heterocope abundance had no obvious affect on small-bodied zooplankton abundance. The fish treatment apparently influenced the zooplankton response to high nutrient addition in 1985. In the high nutrient limnocorrals daphnid populations became very abundant, but in the high fish treatment the daphnid responding was the small-bodied D. longiremis while in the low fish treatment the daphnid responding was the large-bodied D. middendorffiana. Thus we have considerable evidence for bottom up control of phytoplankton density and production. This increased production ultimately, but not for two years, stimulated zooplankton density increases. Increased nutrients had little effect on the benthos or sediments. Fish manipulations influenced large-bodied zooplankton but had little effect on small-bodied zooplankton. Because grayling are predominantly plankton feeders in lakes, no fish effect on benthic invertebrates was expected. Limnocorrals thus seem good systems to study nutrient-phytoplankton interactions. They are not as suitable for benthic invertebrate studies and fish manipulations may be difficult. Most other limnocorral studies were of brief duration; however, in the present study the limnocorrals seemed to perform well over a three year period.																			0018-8158					SEP 21	1992	240	1-3					143	188		10.1007/BF00013459	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00013459													WOS:A1992JQ94000014
J	Cáceres, CE; Tessier, AJ				Cáceres, CE; Tessier, AJ			To sink or swim: Variable diapause strategies among Daphnia species	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Although dormancy is assumed to be fundamental to population persistence in temporary ponds, it has been suggested that diapause may be less frequent in populations that inhabit permanent lakes. We compared the seasonal timing and magnitude of investment in diapausing eggs and their subsequent storage in the sediment among Daphnia species from both temporary ponds (Daphnia pulex and Daphnia ephemeralis) and permanent lakes (Daphnia pulicaria and Daphnia dentifera). Species exhibited strong temporal segregation in the timing of diapausing eggs production in both temporary and permanent systems. All populations of D. ephemeralis produced ephippia in early April whereas D. pulex and D. pulicaria produced the majority of ephippia in May-June and D. dentifera did not produce males or ephippia until autumn. Maximum investment in dormant clutches (as opposed to immediately hatching eggs) was always 100% in the temporary pond species but ranged from 3% to 100% among populations living in the lakes. The number of eggs stored in the egg bank varied within and among species but was usually lower in the temporary pond species. Our results indicate that the use of dormancy in Daphnia varies considerably among populations and species and that whether the system is temporary or permanent is not necessarily a good predictor of a population's investment in dormancy.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	2004	49	4	2				1333	1340		10.4319/lo.2004.49.4_part_2.1333	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2004.49.4_part_2.1333													WOS:000224979800011

Starting in 1990, uniquely finclipped, hatchery-raised fish were stocked in the Sheboygan River and two other Lake Michigan tributaries (Pigeon and Root rivers) to determine whether PCB accumulation in salmonine species warranted a continued ban on stocking fish into that system. Smolts were collected, homogenized, and analyzed (whole-body) monthly until they migrated from the river. Skin-on fillets and whole-body PCB analyses were performed on returning sub-adults and adults. To determine levels of PCB contamination in stocked salmonines, we (1) measured PCB levels in rainbow trout Oncorhyncus mykiss and coho salmon O. kisutch smelts stocked in the Sheboygan River and compared these data with comparable data from two reference locations; (2) measured PCB levels in returning adult rainbow trout and coho salmon after residence in Lake Michigan; and (3) made recommendations regarding future salmonine stocking policy for the Sheboygan River. Sheboygan River smelts stocked in the fall accumulated higher PCB concentrations than smelts stocked in other rivers and those stocked in the spring. Total PCB concentrations in skin-on fillets of sub-adult and adult coho salmon and sub-adult and adult rainbow trout from the Sheboygan River did not differ significantly from concentrations in subadults and adults returning to reference rivers. Returning sub-adult and adult fillet samples did not exceed the U.S. Food and Drug Administration tolerance level for PCBs of 2.0 mu g/g wet weight. Results indicated that PCB concentrations in smelts were not correlated with PCBs concentrations in adult skin-on fillet samples. Therefore, we recommended the Sheboygan River be stocked with chinook salmon O. tshawytscha, coho salmon, and rainbow trout.																			0380-1330						1996	22	2					403	413		10.1016/S0380-1330(96)70965-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(96)70965-6													WOS:A1996VC21200023

However, forecast guidance for the lakes is largely focused on the ice-free season and associated state variables (currents, water temperatures, etc.) A coupled lake-ice model is proposed with potential to provide valuable information to stakeholders and society at large about the current and near-future state of Great Lakes Ice. The model is run for three of the five Great Lakes for prior years and the modeled ice cover is compared to observations via several skill metrics. Model hindcasts of ice conditions reveal reasonable simulation of year-to-year variability of ice extent, ice season duration, and spatial distribution, though some years appear to be prone to higher error. This modeling framework will serve as the basis for NOAA's next-generation Great Lakes Operational Forecast System (GLOFS); a set of 3-D lake circulation forecast modeling systems which provides forecast guidance out to 120 h.					; Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi/AAA-5852-2021; Anderson, Eric/JYO-8924-2024	Chu, Philip/0000-0002-3089-0353; Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi/0000-0001-5466-6332; Kessler, James/0000-0001-8643-7569; Anderson, Eric/0000-0001-5342-8383; 														2077-1312				DEC	2018	6	4							123	10.3390/jmse6040123	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jmse6040123													WOS:000455412500016

Potamogeton pectinatus L. remained present in the lake even during the hypertrophic period with total phospohorus (P) levels of about 0.6 mg P l(-1). Furthermore, the data suggest that there may be one critical level of Secchi depth for the presence of charophytes (about 0.4 m), whilst there may be two critical P levels (0.3 mg P l(-1) for loss and 0.1 mg P l(-1) for their return). Logistic regression of detailed vegetation maps over the past 10 years (1988-1997) showed that occurrence of Chara spp. was positively related with spring averages of Secchi depth, while the occurrence of P. pectinatus was slightly negatively related with Secchi depth. Both species had a negative sigmoid response to water depth. Sites without vegetation can be easily predicted by water depth and Secchi depth (97% for Chara and 99% for P. pectinatus correctly predicted cases). The sites where the species will appear are difficult to predict (50% for Chara and 3% for P. pectinatus correctly predicted cases, respectively). If the vegetation of a year prior to the census was included as variable, the predictability of the occurrence of P. pectinatus and Chara can be improved to 71% and 53% correctly predicted cases, respectively. Grid cells which had been covered 1 year earlier with dense Chara vegetation showed a different relationship with Secchi depth than the grid cells without earlier cover. Previous dense Chara (> 50% cover) stands returned always in the subsequent year independent on water depth or Secchi depth. Measurements in 1995 showed that dense charophyte beds decrease the turbidity to below 1 m(-1) (estimated light attenuation, K-d) in high summer, while outside the vegetation the water remained turbid (estimated K(d)similar to 3 to 5 m(-1)). The positive effect on transparency, together with formation of dense propagule banks, may stabilize the Chara vegetation. Dominance of P. pectinatus may be restricted to turbid water, since Chara appears to be a stronger competitor than P. pectinatus in clear water.					; van Nes, Egbert/F-2681-2011; Scheffer, Marten/C-1852-2012	van Nes, Egbert/0000-0002-6345-104X; 													0018-8158	1573-5117					1999	408						335	342		10.1023/A:1017074211970	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017074211970													WOS:000084892400037

Priest Pot in the English Lake District: a showcase of microbial diversity	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The distinctive characteristic of the water column of Priest Pot in summer is its intense physical and chemical stratification. The changing dissolved oxygen tension with depth is the main factor determining which microbes live where; distinct microbial communities exploit the different microbial niches at different depths and times. 2. Most biological activity in Priest Pot, whether in sediment or water column, is driven by microorganisms. The number of protist species recorded thus far is 883. Much remains to be discovered, particularly concerning scale-bearing protists. 3. Transmission electron microscopy has been used to study the microscales from, and on, the surfaces of microbial eukaryotes living in Priest Pot. The biological material was collected from fresh samples of the water column, from the sediment surface and from the pond's immediate surrounding habitats. 'Subfossils' from the superficial sediment of the pond at the end of summer were also examined. 4. A total of 220 species of scale-bearing protists have been documented in the pond, belonging to the three functional groups or 'body plans' of protozoa: the amoeboid protozoa, the flagellates and the ciliates. The following genera are reported and illustrated: Acanthocystis, Chrysochromulina, Chrysolepidomonas, Chrysosphaerella, Cochliopodium, Cyathobodo, Gyromitus, Korotnevella, Lepidotrachelophyllum, Luffisphaera, Mallomonas, Paraluffisphaera, Paraphysomonas, Pompholysophrys, Pseudodendromonas, Raphidiophrys, Spiniferomonas, Synura, Thuamatomastix and Trachelophyllum / Bylamellophrya.

Pairing and classification assessment of CM chondrites from the Meteorite Hills, Transantarctic Mountains	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE												The Meteorite Hills dense collection area in the Transantarctic Mountains has yielded 1130 meteorites over several ANSMET field seasons. Twenty-three CM carbonaceous chondrites were recovered as part of the 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 field seasons. Many of these CMs have unique or rare features, but most are small (<50 g), making their preservation of highest priority, so material can be available for future researchers. One major contributor to preservation is knowing which samples are paired with others. Because CM chondrites are fine grained and petrographic features are subtle, standard petrography is not as helpful in classification. To strengthen the understanding of pairing and classification, we initiated a focused study of the 23 CM chondrites recovered from Meteorite Hills. Combining magnetic susceptibility (MS), modal mineralogy as determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD), and published information about a subset of samples, we have reassessed the classification and pairing. Many samples have MS log chi values between 3.7 and 3.9, but there are a few exceptions such as MET 00432 (4.85), MET 01076 and 77 (4.06 and 4.63, respectively), and MET 01073 (3.21). Fifteen of the samples exhibit intermediate to high levels of aqueous alteration with phyllosilicate fractions (PSF) of 0.88-0.93. A trio of samples exhibit even higher levels of alteration with PSFs of 0.96-0.98. Find locations and cosmic ray exposure (CRE) ages of these two groups are similar and the latter very short at 0.1-0.2 Ma, raising the possibility that they are all part of the same heterogeneous fall. Since the three heavily altered samples are rare and have distinctive mineralogy relative to other MET CMs, they should be preserved regardless of whether they are from one large fall or two separate falls. Two samples (MET 01076 and MET 01077) contain a much greater fraction of olivine and pyroxene, have longer CRE ages, and most likely are heated CM chondrites. Three samples are unpaired and have unique characteristics: MET 00432 has a high magnetite fraction and other mineralogical and chemical properties comparable to C2 ungrouped chondrites such as Tagish Lake and Tarda, while MET 001087 (PSF = 0.77) and MET 00633 (PSF = 0.76) are less aqueously altered than the other meteorites, with the former in particular showing a significant tochilinite peak in its XRD pattern. Although MET 00633 could arguably be part of the larger pairing group of samples given its similar find location, we recommend keeping it unpaired given its distinct mineralogy.

The most visible effect of this is a decrease in the transmission solar radiation, which is mostly absorbed in the shallow surface layer mainly through an accumulation of primary production in subsurface layer. The paradigm of spring blooms or an annual maximum of phytoplankton biomass in spring in deep temperate lakes has been pervasive but many exceptions have been demonstrated including evidence of greater seasonality of chlorophyll a with decreasing health state of lake. The behavior of photosynthetically active radiation in vertical profile of water, especially light attenuation with depth, has important implications for water quality and ecological conditions. The transformation of light energy flux under the influence of optically active substances (dissolved yellow substances, tripton, plankton and others) may cause its strong absorption or transmission to larger depths. On one hand the high level of epilimnetic solar radiation inhibits photosynthesis, but from other the intensive utilization of light by phytoplankton occurs. Aim of study was to analysis the influence of optically active substances generated by phytoplankton blooms on range of PAR in lakes of similar trophic state. Variation in the underwater light regime was also indexed by Secchi disk, vertical attenuation coefficient and depth of the photic zone derived from using an underwater spherical quantum sensor of PAR. Analysis of the physical features of water in the photic zone, defined as the depth of 1% subsurface PAR, permitted identification of characteristic substances blocking the penetration of light in lakes.

Here, we present a similar to 10,000-year pollen record from Shuanghaizi Lake, northwestern Yunnan, which we use to reconstruct vegetation dynamics, climatic fluctuations and variability in the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM). The results suggest that, between 10,000 and 7900 cal. yr BP, vegetation comprised mainly mixed needle- and broad-leaved forest (mostly Abies, Pinus, Quercus, and Salix), indicating a warm and humid climate, corresponding to a strong ISM. From 7900 to 6900 cal. yr BP, the mixed needle- and broad-leaved forest persisted, while an increase in Abies pollen and decrease in pollen of Pinus and Salix implies a reduction in temperature and precipitation, suggesting a slightly weaker ISM than in the preceding phase. Between 6900 and 2400 cal. yr BP, an expansion of Pinus and Quercus in mixed needle- and broad-leaved forest, together with the first occurrence of the aquatic Potamogeton, suggest a warmer and more humid climate, likely due to the strengthening monsoon, consistent with the Holocene climatic optimum. From 2400 to 970 cal. yr BP, the vegetation shifted to needle-leaved forest with sparse patches of broad-leaved forest, concurrent with a weakening ISM through the middle of this period. During the first half of the period covering 970 to 470 cal. yr BP, Abies and Picea increased and we inferred the lowest temperature and precipitation of the whole study, implying the weakest ISM. In the middle of this period, an expansion of broad-leaved trees including Quercus, Alnus, Betula and Castanopsis plus diverse herbaceous plants suggests that the climate developed towards warmer and more humid conditions, in agreement with a gradual intensification of the ISM. After 470 cal. yr BP, the vegetation became dominated by needle-leaved forest and most broad-leaved elements became intermittent. Although the climate was generally cool and dry in this period, temperature and precipitation gradually increased compared with the previous stage, indicating a slight intensification of the ISM. These findings provide a more detailed understanding of Holocene vegetation dynamics, climatic change, and the evolution of the palaeomonsoon in the Hengduan Mountains biodiversity hotspot, southwestern China.

J	BRINKMANN, WAR				BRINKMANN, WAR			LOCAL TREE-RINGS AND TELECONNECTIONS - WAYS TO IMPROVE THE RECONSTRUCTION OF LAKE-SUPERIOR WATER-SUPPLIES	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Hydrological records can be extended back in time using tree-rings. A basic assumption is that tree growth and the reconstructed variable respond in a similar fashion to a given combination of climate variables. It was documented in an earlier study that this assumption poses a problem in reconstructing water supplies to Lake Superior. Low summer temperatures at times of drought reduce the stress on trees induced by a lack of water. The water supplies to Lake Superior, on the other hand, are largely unaffected by air temperature; evaporation is low in summer because of low water temperatures. Tree-rings therefore tend to overpredict water supplies at times of cool summer drought. It was shown in the earlier study that using air temperature as an additional predictor will improve the modeling of Lake Superior water supplies. The observed air temperature record is however too short to be useful. Results of the present study show that the well-known teleconnection between atmospheric circulation patterns over western North America and air temperature over the Great Lakes region can be used to improve the modeling. Including western tree-ring chronologies - as a surrogate for local temperature - in regression models results in an increase in explained variance of 0.14 above that obtained by using only local chronologies, and most of this improvement in explanation occurs in the lower (drier) half of the water supply distribution. There is therefore information in the western tree-ring chronologies that could be useful in reconstructing Great Lakes water supplies. Many of the chronologies were however collected in the 1960s and 1970s. Updated chronologies would lengthen the record available for model calibration and verification by more than 20 years which is about a third of the length of the record presently available.																			0380-1330						1992	18	3					357	363		10.1016/S0380-1330(92)71303-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(92)71303-3													WOS:A1992JW93600002

Winter diet of cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) was studied using pellet analysis. Diet was expressed in terms of numerical abundance, frequency and biomass of prey. A detailed methodology is described of how to prepare a reference collection of otoliths, pharyngeal bones and chewing pads (key-elements), essential for species-specific identification of fish remains in stomachs and pellets, and to estimate ingested fish biomass. Correlations between mass (mg) of key-elements and mass of corresponding fish were significant, and exponential regression models were used to calculate biomass of each single prey item directly from the mass of its key-elements. Advantages of this method are compared with the more traditional two step approach in which size of elements is used to estimate fish length, followed by calculating fresh mass from fish length. Cyprinids formed the largest part of the diet for both predators. Great crested grebes selected small prey, feeding mainly on bleak (Alburnus alburnus alborella), while diet composition of cormorants varied significantly in relation to prey availability.

However, despite decades of painstaking limnological research on Baikal, broad spatial data on nutrient (nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), silica (Si)) concentrations and temperature are sparse, as is our understanding of the bottom-up factors that limit phytoplankton in the lake. Earlier studies have suggested both N and P as limiting nutrients in Baikal, but the evidence, mostly based on elemental ratios, is limited and somewhat conflicting. We present experimental evidence that N and P co-limit phytoplankton productivity in some areas of Baikal during summer, along with the results of a comprehensive spatial survey of surface temperature, nutrients and chlorophyll a (Chl a) in Lake Baikal that support the experimental finding of colimitation. Surface water incubations from two trophically contrasting locations revealed co-limitation by N and P, as well as a positive effect of temperature (fluorescence after 5 d was similar to 10% higher at 15 degrees C than at 10 degrees C). In a linear model of the survey data (26 sampling locations), N, P, and their interaction (N x P) were all significant predictors of Chl a concentration, indicating that either N or P (or both) may limit summer phytoplankton, depending on location. In contrast to the incubation experiments, temperature was not a significant predictor of Chl a concentration across the 26 sites we sampled. Lake Baikal is undergoing rapid warming and increased nutrient loading, which may boost phytoplankton productivity in the lake; however, the magnitude of this response will depend on ratios of soluble N and P inputs.

Six AMS C-14 dates reveal that the studied interval corresponds to sediments deposited from similar to AD 700 to 1600. Sulfur content of the bulk sediment and multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) axis 1 of fossil benthic foraminifera indicate that the composition of the benthic foraminifera community was closely related to dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in the hypolimnion. The sulfur content and MDS axis 1 also revealed two shifts over the 900-year interval. In the first phase (similar to AD 700-1250), the Shannon-Wiener Index (H'), E (S-200), evenness and rank abundance curve (RAC) kurtosis indicate a gradual deterioration in structure of the benthic foraminifera community. In that period, there are statistically significant correlations between the faunal composition (MDS axis 1) and faunal structure [Shannon-Wiener (H'), E (S-200), evenness and RAC kurtosis]. In the second phase (similar to AD 1250-1600), however, faunal composition and structure show no marked correspondence. Instead, abundance of benthic foraminifera fluctuated on a scale of similar to 200 years. Thus, a shift in the biotic response of benthic foraminifera in Aso-kai lagoon occurred in ca. AD 1250. Gradual deterioration of benthic foraminifera, with taxonomic losses, is consistent with declining DO in the first phase, possibly associated with the increasing influence of the Tsushima Warm Current. The possibility that closure of Aso-kai lagoon and development of the sand bar affected benthic foraminifera cannot, however, be ruled out. No corresponding response was observed in the second phase, during which there was no distinct taxonomic loss. Large variations in abundance, however, were a consequence of strength of the East Asian summer and winter monsoons. The shift in the biotic response of benthic foraminifera in Aso-kai lagoon during the period AD 700-1600 was apparently a result of changes in climate and ocean conditions on the East Asian continental margin.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				MAR	2014	51	3					421	435		10.1007/s10933-014-9764-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-014-9764-8													WOS:000331105500007
J	Mullins, HT				Mullins, HT			Environmental change controls of lacustrine carbonate, Cayuga Lake, New York	GEOLOGY												Dated sediment cores from Cayuga Lake, New York State, document that biologically mediated precipitation of calcite has been controlled by environmental change, both natural and anthropogenic, over the past 10 000 yr. During the Holocene Hypsithermal (similar to 9-4 ka [C-14]), Milankovitch forcing of summer insolation in the Northern Hemisphere resulted in a broad increase (to 55%), then decrease (to <5%), of calcite content in bottom sediment. Warmer summers resulted in earlier onset of thermal stratification of the water column, which increased the duration of primary production as well as the abundance of picoplankton, which in turn increased the amount of calcite precipitated. At the end of the Hypsithermal ca. 3500 yr ago, global cooling greatly reduced the amount of calcite precipitated. However since A.D. 1940, calcite contents in Cayuga Lake sediments have risen up to similar to 20%. One hypothesis is that this recent increase in calcite is the result of cultural eutrophication (nutrient loading). However, this rise in calcite also closely tracks the anthropogenic rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide, suggesting a possible link to global environmental change. Further research on hard-water lake basins will be needed to test which of these two hypotheses is correct.																			0091-7613					MAY	1998	26	5					443	446		10.1130/0091-7613(1998)026<0443:ECCOLC>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0091-7613(1998)026<0443:ECCOLC>2.3.CO;2													WOS:000073509400015

Absorption spectra and quenching studies of the transients provided confirming evidence that hydrated electrons were formed by all of the DOM that were studied. The DOM from the Suwannee River in Georgia [USA] and from the Greifensee, a Swiss lake, exhibited great variability in light-absorbing properties. Despite this high variability in absorption coefficients, the primary quantum yields for electron ejection from the Greifensee and Suwannee DOM fell in a narrow range (0.005-0.008). Steady-state irradiations (355 nm) of the DOM with 2-chloroethanol (0.02 M) present as an electron scavenger produced chloride ions with quantum yields that were about 2 orders of magnitude lower than the primary quantum yields. This result indicates that most of the photoejected electrons recombine with cations before escaping into bulk solution. Irradiations of DOM solutions under sunlight (April, latitude 34.degree. N) photoproduced electrons at rates falling in the range of 0.2-0.4 .mu.mol/[(mg of DOC)h]. These results indicate that hydrated electrons can play a significant role in the environmental photoreduction of persistent, electronegative pollutants but may be relatively unimportant in the environmental production of hydrogen peroxide.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				MAY	1987	21	5					485	490		10.1021/es00159a010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es00159a010								22296137					WOS:A1987H076400014

Using multisource observations and reanalysis data during 1979-2013, this study explores the possible reasons for recent land surface warming over this region by considering atmospheric forcing and regional land-atmosphere interaction related to extratropical cyclones (ECs). Results show that there is a close relationship between land surface warming and weakened ECs over East Asia. Recent land surface warming was attributed to local atmospheric forcing and feedback of land-atmosphere interaction associated with weakened ECs. The abnormal large-scale circulation associated with anomalous ECs produced evident dynamic forcing on the land surface. Weakened ECs are usually accompanied by an abnormal high pressure system and anticyclonic circulation around Lake Baikal, which benefit the intensification of anomalous southerly wind in the rear of the anomalous anticyclone, leading to positive temperature advection and temperature increase over East Asia. Meanwhile, the anomalous adiabatic warming caused by abnormal descending motion associated with the anticyclonic anomaly also contributes to local warming. The feedback of local land-atmosphere interaction plays an important role in land surface warming. Weakened ECs increase both incident solar radiation and precipitation. The increased precipitation reduces the soil moisture and in turn weakens the surface evaporation and local cooling effect, resulting in land surface warming. Our findings are helpful for better understanding the mechanisms responsible for recent summer land surface warming over East Asia as well as its climatic effects.

Reconstruction of Last Glacial to early Holocene monsoon variability from relict lake sediments of the Higher Central Himalaya, Uttrakhand, India	JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES												Proglacial lake sediments at Goting in the Higher Central Himalaya were analyzed to reconstruct the summer monsoon variability during the Last Glacial to early Holocene. Sedimentary structures, high resolution mineral magnetic and geochemical data suggest that the lacustrine environment experienced fluctuating monsoonal conditions. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating indicates that the lake sedimentation occurred before 25 ka and continued after 13 ka. During this period, Goting basin witnessed moderate to strengthened monsoon conditions around 25 ka, 23.5 ka-22.5 ka, 22 ka-18 ka, 17 ka-16.5 ka and after 14.5-13 ka. The Last Glacial phase ended with the deposition of outwash gravel dated at similar to 11 ka indicating glacial retreat and the onset of Holocene condition. Additionally, centennial scale fluctuations between 16.5 ka and 12.7 ka in the magnetic and geochemical data are seen. A close correspondence at the millennial scale between our data and that of continental and marine records from the Indian sub-continent suggests that Goting basin responded to periods of strengthened monsoon during the Last Glacial to early Holocene. We attribute the millennial scale monsoon variability to climatic instability in higher northern latitudes. However, centennial scale abrupt changes are attributed to the result of albedo changes on the Himalaya and Tibetan plateau. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Sedentary and mobile fish did not differ by age or sex. Largemouth bass in Mittry lake maintained their respective behavior pattern (resident or mobile) throughout the year and did not move off-shore in the fall. The shallow depth of the lake and the moderate year round temperatures may explain this lack of seasonal movement. Harvest rates appeared to be modest. Lack of vulnerability and or angler access may explain low harvest rates.

Since then, species abundance patterns were determined for several environments, but temporal changes in species composition were not studied to the same level of resolution. Using massively parallel sequencing on the 454 GS FLX platform we identified a highly dynamic turnover of the seasonal abundance of protists in the Austrian lake Fuschlsee. We show that seasonal abundance patterns of protists closely match their biogeographic distribution. The stable predominance of few highly abundant taxa, which previously led to the suggestion of a low global protist species richness, is contrasted by a highly dynamic turnover of rare species. We suggest that differential seasonality of rare and abundant protist taxa explains the-so far-conflicting evidence in the 'everything is everywhere' dispute. Consequently temporal sampling is basic for adequate diversity and species richness estimates.

Our model took into account the diurnal variability of the heat fluxes and wind stress on the lake surface based on the atmospheric data from the Babushkin weather station archive during 1-30 May 2015. Propagation of the thermal bar is driven principally by the mechanical and thermal energy of the river inflow together with shortwave radiation while longwave radiation and latent and sensible heat fluxes make smaller contributions. Numerical modeling of the lake hydrodynamics demonstrated that the thermal bar propagation decelerated at night and that strong reverse motion of the thermal bar (toward the shore) was possible within some specific areas due to night cooling and opposing wind. These effects appear following an initial period in which the dynamics are dominated by the river inflow. As the distance from the mouth of the Selenga to the thermal bar increased, the impact of westerly winds on the reverse movement of the thermal bar was reinforced, although the influence of wind does not extend to the full depth of the lake.

Successful invasion: camera trap distance sampling reveals higher density for invasive raccoon dog compared to native mesopredators	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Monitoring population parameters of invasive species gains importance as these species continue to expand all over the world. Monitoring of invasive mammalian mesopredators is, however, complicated due to their nocturnal and secretive behaviour. In the European Union, the most common invasive mesopredator is the raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides), which causes concerns for native species, such as endangered waterfowl that may be subject to nest predation. We studied the density of mesopredators in southern Finland with wildlife cameras, using methodology of distance sampling. We deployed in total of 175 camera traps around 11 (spring 2020) and 16 (spring 2021) lakes or wetlands. We inferred densities for raccoon dogs, and for native mesopredators the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and the European badger (Meles meles) for comparison. Raccoon dogs were found to have higher overall as well as site-specific densities (about 3.7 ind./km2) than badgers (1.2 ind./km2) and red foxes (0.6 ind./km2). The raccoon dogs also were present at every study wetland, while badgers were not found at all sites. The red fox showed more diurnal activity compared to raccoon dogs and badgers. Camera trap distance sampling enabled us to provide a density estimates on a rather small spatial and temporal scale for species of similar size and movement speed. It could therefore prove valuable as a long-term monitoring option, as climate trends are likely to further enable raccoon dog expansion. Currently this invasive species appears to be the most common mesopredator around wetlands in the southern boreal zone of southern Finland.

We analyzed migration speed using ringing data obtained at these stations. The percentage of moulting birds involved in migration was higher in the northern site Gumbaritsy as compared with the southerly site (Kabli). During migration, body mass increased seasonally ill the Goldcrests trapped in Gumbaritsy in 2001, but at the more southern trapping sites this trend was absent (Kabli) or recorded only in the later part of migration (Rybachy). Median fat reserves peaked in Gumbaritsy. Migration speed was affected by time pressure (i.e., it increased with date during migration and was more pronounced in the north) and the position of a certain part of migration route. Migration speed was significantly higher along the routes that crossed the Baltic Sea than at coastal routes. Birds that gained more fat at the time of ringing migrated with a higher speed.

Our study is based on an analysis of 260 pollen samples from Holocene lacustrine sediments at Ningjinpo in northern China, and employs the biomisation method to reconstruct regional vegetation types and vegetation changes, and to decipher their driving factors, by incorporating regional climatic data and information on human activities. Results indicate that, in the early Holocene (10,000-8100 cal yr B.P.), regional climate was dry, with annual precipitation of 470 mm. In the middle Holocene (8100-3000 cal yr B.P.), a rapid increase was observed in precipitation, reaching 580 mm. During the late Holocene (2600-600 cal yr B.P.), climate became drier again, with annual precipitation decreasing to 480 mm. Between 10,000-600 cal yr B.P., vegetation exhibited distinct successional patterns dominantly influenced by climate, transitioning from meadow-steppe to forest, and then back to meadow-steppe. After 600 cal yr B.P., vegetation succession decoupled from climate change, with human activities emerging as the primary driving force, as indicated by the substantial increase in anthropogenic pollen and charcoal concentrations. In the future, under the combined influence of global warming and intensified human activity, the implementation of scientific environmental planning measures will become increasingly important for the restoration and sustainable development of regional vegetation ecosystems.

Chaoborus flavicans, Hyalella azteca, and Callibaetis sp. composed over 90% of cutthroat trout diets, and these prey taxa showed the greatest response to the introduction. Although cutthroat trout selectively consumed larger individuals of these taxa and reduced mean length of prey in autumn populations, no change in size distribution of overwintering individuals was apparent 6 years after the fish were introduced. Reported changes in spatial distribution of these prey support the hypothesis that prey refuge space in littoral regions buffers prey populations from the direct effects of cutthroat trout predators.

J	Wang, ZY; Ding, YH; Zhou, BT; Chen, LJ				Wang, Zunya; Ding, Yihui; Zhou, Botao; Chen, Lijuan			Comparison of two severe low-temperature snowstorm and ice freezing events in China: Role of Eurasian mid-high latitude circulation patterns	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												A severe low-temperature snowstorm and ice freezing event occurred in China in early 2018. This event was similar to that occurred in early 2008 but with a weaker intensity and salient difference in location and extent. The reason for this discrepancy was investigated in this study using station data and atmospheric reanalysis data. The results reveal that two different circulation patterns (i.e., zonal dipole pattern and meridional dipole pattern) over the mid-high latitudes of Eurasia played an important role. The zonal dipole pattern, which is closely related to the 2018 event, is characterized by positive anomalies over the Ural Mountains and negative anomalies over Lake Baikal in the 500 hPa geopotential height field. This pattern can cause intense low temperatures in northern China through its influence on the anomalous cyclone over Northeast Asia. The meridional dipole pattern, which is highly associated with the 2008 event, is characterized by positive anomalies over Siberia and negative anomalies over Asia in the 500 hPa geopotential height field. This pattern corresponds to a strong East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) and can drive cold air to move further southward, causing nearly nationwide chilly weather, particularly in northwestern China and south of the Yangtze River valley. The two patterns, combined with the strengthened western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH), have a synergistic role in the occurrence of snowfall. However, these patterns have weak correlations with the number of icy days but provide favourable conditions for ice freezing events.					; chen, lijuan/HSE-1019-2023	zhou, Botao/0000-0002-5995-2378; 													0899-8418	1097-0088				JUN 15	2020	40	7					3436	3450		10.1002/joc.6406	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.6406		DEC 2019											WOS:000502471100001

Diel variation of phytoplankton functional groups in a subtropical reservoir in southern Brazil during an autumnal stratification period	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												A knowledge of diel variation and the vertical distribution of phytoplankton communities may contribute to a better understanding of the driving factors of key species. Applying functional-group classification provides important information on the causes of species selection in the pelagic community. The diel variation of phytoplankton functional groups was analysed during an autumnal stratification period with the aim of understanding their changes in the vertical position related to light, mixing regime and grazing pressure. Phytoplankton and zooplankton communities were sampled every 4 h during a 24-h period in a vertical profile in a subtropical meso-eutrophic reservoir. Strong stratification during a 24-h cycle and a mixed clear epilimnion with partial atelomixis marked the autumn season in the Faxinal reservoir, southern Brazil. The highest phytoplankton densities and biomass were found during the second part of the day, a general pattern reported in the literature, and may be explained by zooplankton dynamics. During the 24-h cycle, phytoplankton functional groups lacking a self-regulating capacity and those able to regulate their vertical position were vertically segregated in the lake. The diel behaviour of both groups was driven by the mixing regime (including atelomixis), light and zooplankton grazing pressure.

This transformation dramatically accelerated in the late 1980s after the introduction of two invasive species of filter-feeding mussels of the genus Dreissena. We performed a detailed analysis of spatial and temporal patterns of this transformation using remotely sensed surface chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) from the multi-satellite long-term Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) dataset as a proxy of ecosystem state. We analyzed 25 years (1997-2022) of monthly composites covering most of the Great Lakes' area detecting regime shifts in Chl-a employing an integrated approach combining Seasonal-Trend decomposition (STL) and Sequential T-test Analysis of Regime Shifts (STARS). The results identified the timings (shift points) when Chl-a stabilized at new lower trophic regimes, the magnitudes of Chl-a decrease across various lake regions and depths, and the changes in Chl-a seasonal cycles. In Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Ontario, the timings and magnitudes of regime shifts and vanishing of spring phytoplankton bloom suggest that dreissenid mussel presence was a primary driving factor of the observed transformation. We demonstrate that the OC-CCI dataset is a reliable source of information that enables the detection of these regime shifts in major lakes, with only minor effects of inconsistencies resulting from the biases between different satellites collecting data during different time periods.

Ice Cover Influences Redox Dynamics in Prairie Pothole Wetland Sediments	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Sediment cores were collected under ice-cover in late winter from three wetlands located along a subsurface hydrologic gradient within the Prairie Pothole Region of North America. Within each core, sediment porewaters were analyzed by in situ voltammetry for a suite of redox active species as a function of depth and revealed shifts in complex oxidation-reduction dynamics related to ice cover in these wetlands. We observed a reduced sulfur boundary that is close to or above the sediment-water interface (SWI) under ice cover. In contrast, the reduced sulfur boundary retreats several centimeters deeper in the sediments under ice-free conditions. These findings are analogous to previous observations in shallow lakes that show anoxia at the SWI during ice cover but not under ice-free conditions. Further, biogeochemical processes varied depending upon wetland type. During winter, sulfide levels in sediment porewaters in groundwater fed "flow-through" wetlands were significantly lower than under ice-free conditions. The converse applied to groundwater discharge wetlands where reduced sulfur concentrations in porewaters increased under ice cover. Decreases in ice cover extent and duration due to climate change coupled with profound landscape changes due to agriculture will affect the biogeochemical cycles of these wetlands and could lead to increased carbon emissions in the future.					; Wilkins, Michael/A-9358-2013	Wilkins, Michael/0000-0002-3595-0853; Arnold, William/0000-0003-0814-5469; McAdams, Brandon/0000-0002-9289-048X; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				OCT	2021	126	10							e2021JG006318	10.1029/2021JG006318	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JG006318													WOS:000711969900024
J	Wu, XY; Mitsch, WJ				Wu, XY; Mitsch, WJ			Spatial and temporal patterns of algae in newly constructed freshwater wetlands	WETLANDS												Spatial and temporal patterns of metaphyton, periphyton, phytoplankton, and water-column primary productivity were studied in two 1-ha newly constructed riparian freshwater marshes (one planted with macrophytes and the other unplanted) at the Olentangy River Wetland Research Park at The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, USA. Surface cover and mid-summer biomass of metaphyton, biomass and production of periphyton and phytoplankton, and water-column primary productivity were sampled from July to November 1994. Methods of spatial statistics were used to examine the spatial patterns in surface coverage and mid-summer biomass of metaphyton. Our results showed that for both wetlands, dense mars of metaphyton (up to 86% surface coverage) acted as nutrient "filters" shaping the spatial distribution of nutrients that in turn affected the spatial pattern of metaphyton by limiting the growth at locations further away from inflow. Metaphyton cover was strongly correlated with phosphorus retention and also influenced the spatial pattern of periphyton and water-column primary productivity. There was no significant difference between the two wetlands in the production and spatial distribution of metaphyton and phytoplankton or water-column primary productivity.					Wu, X.

Konnevesi (187 km(2)) was studied in 1983-90 and that of L. Keitele (526 km(2)) in 1964 and 1975. A total of 22 species was observed; of these 15 in the littoral stony belt of L. Konnevesi where a more intensive sampling was carried out in 1983. Considerable seasonal fluctuations were observed in the occurrence of nymphs in the kick samples from the stony belt. High catches (> 10 nymphs/sample) were detected in August and in May-June while in July the mean catch was 2.2/sample. Abundant species in the vernal kick samples were Leptophlebia vespertina and Heptagenia fuscogrisea and in August Caenis horaria, H. fuscogrisea and Leptophlebia spp. Other species favouring the stony belt were Ephemerella ignita, Heptagenia dalecarlica, Ecdyonurus joernensis and Procleon bifidum. The emergence of subimagoes started at the end of May and lasted to the end of September. In the stony belt, the mean emergence of subimagoes was 69.7 ind/trap/summer (=193.5 ind/m(2)), and there were two maxima (>10 ind/trap/week); one at the end of June and another at the end of July. In the adjacent traps on the sandy substratum, the catches of subimagoes were low throughout the summer (mean 6.5 ind/trap) but owing to the high occurrence of Baetis rhodani-females in some traps, the total catches of mayflies were high especially near the outlet of the lake. The annual catches of subimagoes in L. Konnevesi were somewhat smaller than those observed in the littoral traps from L. Paajarvi, which probably reflects the different traps used. The floating emergence traps used in L. Konnevesi didn't catch subimagoes of Caenis spp. although nymphs of C. horaria occurred abundantly in the kick samples.																					9985-830-29-6				1999							23	30																WOS:000081720700003

The mean abundance in Lake Kilpisjarvi (age groups 1+-10+ years), ranged between 103.5 +/- 17.3 in 1992-1993 to 110.9 +/- 80.0 plerocercoids per fish in 1997. The asymptotic value of the infection levelled at 113 plerocercoids per host after age 3. No significant difference in abundance was detected between study years (P>0.10). Abundances in other lakes ranged between 4.8 +/- 9.7 and 91.1 +/- 115.1. Two seasonal peaks of plerocercoid recruitment were observed in Lake Kilpisjarvi; between March and April (P<0.002) and between September and October (P=0.042). In autumn the numbers of larvae increased particularly in female fish. The invasion rate of the parasite was lower in other lakes studied, and the infection rate in whitefish was closely related to the copepod food eaten.

J	Cable, JE; Burnett, WC; Chanton, JP				Cable, JE; Burnett, WC; Chanton, JP			Magnitude and variations of groundwater seepage along a Florida marine shoreline	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Direct groundwater inputs are receiving increasing attention as a potential source of nutrients and other dissolved constituents to the coastal ocean. Seepage into St. George Sound, Florida was measured extensively from 1992 to 1994 using seepage meters. Spatial and temporal variations were documented along a 7-km stretch of coastline and up to 1 km from shore. Measurements were made at 3 transects perpendicular to shore and 1 transect parallel to shore. The general results indicated that seepage decreased with distance from shore (2 of 3 transects), and substantial temporal and spatial variability was observed in seepage flow from nearshore sediments. In addition, trends in mean monthly integrated seepage rates were similar to precipitation patterns measured at a nearby coastal weather station. Based on these measurements, we estimate that the magnitude of groundwater seepage into the study area is substantial, representing from 0.23 to 4.4 m(3) . sec(-1) of flow through the sediments, approximately equivalent to a first magnitude spring. Although it is unknown how representative this region is with respect to global groundwater discharge, demonstrates that groundwater flow can be as important as riverine and spring discharge in some cases. Our subsurface discharge rates suggest groundwater is an important hydrologic source term for this region and may be important to the coastal biogeochemistry as well.

Fontivita pretiosa gen. nov., sp. nov., a thermophilic planctomycete of the order Tepidisphaerales from a hot spring of Baikal lake region	SYSTEMATIC AND APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY												A novel facultatively anaerobic moderately thermophilic bacterium, strain B-254T, was isolated from a terrestrial hot spring near the town of Goryachinsk in the Baikal lake region (Russian Federation). Motile spherical cells of the strain were present as single cocci, in pairs, or aggregates. The cells had a Gram negative cell wall and reproduced by binary fission. The isolate grew at 30-57 degrees C (opt. 50-54 degrees C) and at pH 5.1-8.4 (opt. 6.6-7.1). Strain B-254T was a chemoorganoheterotroph, growing on mono-, di -and polysaccharides (xylan, starch, galactan, galactomannan, xyloglucan, arabinan, curdlan, beta-glucan, locust bean gum, xanthan gum). Sodium chloride or yeast extract were not required for growth. Major cellular fatty acids were iso-C16:0, anteiso-C17:0, and C20:0; major polar lipid was phos-phatidylethanolamine. The complete genome of strain B-254T was 5.54 Mb; its GC content was 64 %. According to the results of 16S rRNA gene sequence-based phylogenetic analysis and the conserved pro-teins sequences-based phylogenomic analysis strain B-254T was on a separate lineage within the order Tepidisphaerales (Phycisphaerae, Planctomycetes). Based on phylogenetic and phylogenomic analyses of Phycisphaerae, whole genome comparisons of Tepidisphaerales as well as distinctive phenotypic features of the strain, it was assigned to a novel genus and species for which the name Fontivita pretiosa gen. nov. sp. nov. is proposed.

J	WILCOX, DA; MEEKER, JE				WILCOX, DA; MEEKER, JE			DISTURBANCE EFFECTS ON AQUATIC VEGETATION IN REGULATED AND UNREGULATED LAKES IN NORTHERN MINNESOTA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												The effects of water-level regulation on aquatic macrophyte communities were investigated by comparing two regulated lakes in northern Minnesota with a nearby unregulated lake. Natural annual fluctuations of about 1.8 m were replaced with fluctuations of 1.1 m and 2.7 m in the regulated lakes, and the timing of water-level changes was also altered. Quadrats were sampled along transects that followed depth contours representing different plant habitats in the unregulated lake. Ordinations showed that the macrophyte communities at all sampled depths of the regulated lakes differed from those in the unregulated lake. The unregulated lake supported structurally diverse plant communities at all depths. In the lake with reduced fluctuations, only four taxa were present along transects that were never dewatered; all were erect aquatics that extended through the entire water column. In the lake with increased fluctuations, rosette and mat-forming species dominated transects where drawdown occurred in early winter and disturbance resulted from ice formation in the sediments. The natural hydrologic regime at the unregulated lake resulted in intermediate disturbance and high diversity. There was either too little or too much disturbance from water-level fluctuations in the regulated lakes, both resulting in reduced structural diversity.																			0008-4026					JUL	1991	69	7					1542	1551		10.1139/b91-198	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b91-198													WOS:A1991GE79600020

In particular, it has increasingly been used for assessing the chronic physiological stress over long time periods. This study showed for the first time the experience of using hair of Baikal seals to examine their hormonal status. We collected hair samples from live Baikal seals captured during summer expeditions to the Ushkany Islands, Lake Baikal in 2019 and 2021. Age differences in hair cortisol concentration were found: hair cortisol levels were higher among the young seals and declined with age. We suppose this may be related to different extents of nutritional stress, hunting success and social factors on summer rookeries. There was no sex effect on hair cortisol in young animals. We observed that hair cortisol concentrations were higher in young animals captured in 2019 compared to seals taken in 2021, with no differences in ice conditions between these years found.

Estimate of brown bear (Ursus arctos) spring population size using an aerial census method of bear tracks in tundra	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												The results of determining the number of brown bears (Ursus arctos (Linnaeus 1758)) in the tundra based on the data of the aerial survey of their tracks after the release of this predator from the dens are discussed. The aerial survey of brown bear tracks was conducted at the time when the maximum number of bears including a females with cubs, left their dens. Thirty-seven tracks of adult brown bears were recorded during air routes with a total length of 2,290 km, of which 34 (92%) were located near rivers, large lakes and sea coasts and were located at an average distance of 1.2 km from the shoreline of these reservoirs. It is suggested that the population density of brown bear can be calculated from the indicators of the density of the shoreline of reservoirs (km/km(2)) and the number of crossed bear tracks belonging to different individuals are located for the flying transects laid along the shoreline of reservoirs. The population density of the brown bear is calculated as the product of the density of the shoreline of the reservoirs (km/km(2)) and the number of registered bear tracks belonging to different individuals per 1 km of fly transects along the reservoirs. According to the results of the aerial survey in the spring season, the maximum bear density (3.8 individuals per 1000 km(2)) in the taiga zone, the minimum (1.8 individuals per 1000 km(2)) - in the southern tundra. In the northern tundra, the brown bear was absent.

The chief merits were rapidity and reproducibility of operation and high resolution.

In addition, density of main predators (perch and zander, age groups 1 to 3), water temperature and zooplankton biomass were recorded to determine whether these factors may have influenced yes. During the four years, yes varied substantially. Higher yes correlated with greater fish length in June and warmer water temperatures in spring, but there was no relationship with zooplankton biomass during that period. By contrast, the length of fish at the end of the year was negatively correlated to ycs, thus reflecting density-dependent growth, possibly because of the midsummer decline of Daphnia galeata. Variability in abundance of predatory perch and zander did not directly explain the year-class strength of age-0 perch. However, we suggest that length-dependent and hence temperature-dependent predatory mortality of age-0 perch in spring, may cause the observed variability in yes. Whereas temperature effects cannot be controlled by biomanipulation, the positive effect of high zooplankton biomass on perch growth, yes and early piscivory shows the central importance of perch in biomanipulation experiments.

Three predictiveworkflows were tested, one based solely on available measurements and theothers applying a two-step approach, first estimating lake nutrients thathave limited observations and then predicting Chl using observed andpre-generated environmental factors. The third workflow was developedusing hydrodynamic data derived from a PB model as additional trainingfeatures in the two-step ML approach. The performance of the ML models wassuperior to a PB model in predicting nutrients and Chl. The hybrid modelfurther improved the prediction of the timing and magnitude of algal blooms.A data sparsity test based on shuffling the order of training and testingyears showed the accuracy of ML models decreased with increasing sampleinterval, and model performance varied with training-testing yearcombinations.

The L-mode snow bands with multicellular structure in 1991 and 1993 formed, respectively, at the early onset of and toward the end of cold-air outbreaks, where the magnitude of the band-transverse vertical shear was roughly 2 x 10(-3) s(-1) in the lower-half of the mixed layer. This magnitude was larger than that associated with L-mode snow bands characterized by axi-symmetric circulation, which will be described in Part II. Thermodynamical structures and the spatial distributions of water substances in the two snow bands were inferred from variational-based retrieval. A pronounced feature of the airflow structures in both snow bands was upshear-tilting updrafts in the band-transverse vertical cross-section. At least two factors could account for their formation: the existence of a certain depth of the vertical layer of the environmental band-transverse system-relative wind components directing to the upshear, and the lower terminal fall velocities of snow and graupels. The retrieval results showed that both snow bands had a subsaturated cold pool beneath the band around the surface, whose collision with the unstable ambient air could have been responsible for overall upward motion in the bands. With regard to the energetics of the band circulation, energy production by buoyancy and the band-transverse shear was dominant. The repeated formation of new cells was observed in the two snow bands in the downshear side, which may have been triggered by the low-level collision of the outflow from active cells or a cold pool with the unstable ambient air. As the new cell developed enough, the older cell significantly decayed. Consequently, the successive formation of cells did not change the overall echo pattern of the L-mode snow bands without producing elongated echoes branching off into the downshear direction at large angles to the orientation of the L-mode snow bands.

Although a gradual reduction in duration and occurrence of lake ice cover in boreal lake ecosystems has been confirmed, little attention to the ice-covered period is received compared to open water studies. In this study, novel-developed diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT, ZrO-Chelex) probes were deployed to obtain the in-situ and high-resolution information on metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, Mn, Cd, Cr, and As) at the sediment-water interface (SWI) in a seasonal ice-covered lake, Chagan Lake. In addition, "source-sink" characteristics of each metal related to their endogenous release were determined based on Fick's first law. Concentrations of labile metals at the SWI demonstrated significant spatial heterogeneity, peaking exactly below the SWI. Compared with other similar studies, concentrations of Pb (0.55 mu g/L), Cr (0.58 mu g/L), and As (2.4 mu g/L) were a little higher even under-ice than that in other freshwater rivers and lakes, indicating potential pollution due to the agricultural intensification and petroleum extraction. The apparent diffusive fluxes suggested that sediments acted as a sink for Pb (-0.01 mg m(-2) day(-) (1)), Cr (-2.37 mg m(-2) day(-1)), and Cd (-0.1 mg m(-2) day(-1)), diffusing from the overlying water into the sediment, while Cu (0.12 mg m(-2) day(-1)), Zn (0.75 mg m(-2) day(-1)), Mn (15.89 mg m(-2) day(-1)), and As (2.12 mg m(-2) day(-1)) as a source from sediments into the overlying water. Dissolved oxygen was the principal factor (79.5%, P = 0.032), determining the variation of the available metals at the SWI. As the urgent need for research focused on under-ice ecosystem dynamics, this study addressed the previously unknown behavior of the labile metals at the SWI and provided a unique perspective for the lake management during the ice-cover periods when external nutrient input was cut off.					zhu, xiaoyan/AAQ-6601-2021; Yuan, Yuxiang/ACN-6178-2022; wang, qichen/KVY-3026-2024	Zuo, Yunjiang/0000-0003-4810-678X													2296-701X					AUG 12	2022	10								956903	10.3389/fevo.2022.956903	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2022.956903													WOS:000844901200001
J	London, D				London, David			A Rayleigh model of cesium fractionation in granite-pegmatite systems	AMERICAN MINERALOGIST												The K/Cs ratios of K-feldspars from granitic pegmatites are compared to models derived from the Rayleigh equation. The K/Cs and K/Rb ratios of K-feldspars and micas exhibit decreasing values when plotted against their Cs or Rb contents across cogenetic suites of granites and pegmatites and from margin to core of individual bodies. The trends in elemental ratios conform to Rayleigh fractionation for the crystallization of feldspars and micas from a silicate melt. Within two individual pegmatite bodies, the K/Cs ratio of K-feldspar initially falls more rapidly than the Rayleigh model predicts. That might reflect a local increase in the concentration of Cs relative to K due to the pile-up of incompatible elements in a boundary layer of melt adjacent to the crystal growth front. The addition of an aqueous solution to the Rayleigh model (i.e., the simultaneous crystallization of K-feldspars from melt and from aqueous solution) predicts high and increasing K/Cs ratios of K-feldspars that are not observed in natural rock suites, except when K-feldspars crystallize in miarolitic cavities or when primary K-feldspar recrystallizes to microcline perthite in an open hydrothermal system. In those cases, the Cs content of K-feldspars falls to nil because of the high solubility of Cs in aqueous solution and low compatibility of Cs in K-feldspar. Otherwise, the observed patterns of K/Rb or K/Cs in K-feldspar and micas in pegmatites conform to crystal-melt fractionation in which an aqueous solution plays no part.

Periodically, blood PO2, PCO2, pH, plasma [Cl-], [Na+], [K+], total Ca, total Mg, lactate, glucose, and osmolality were measured; hematocrit and body mass determined; and blood [HCO3-] calculated. On day 14 of anoxic submergence, five of eight softshell turtles were dead, one died immediately after removal, and the remaining two showed no signs of life other than a heartbeat. After I I days of submergence in anoxic water, blood pH fell from 7.923 to 7.281 and lactate increased to 62.1 mM. Plasma [HCO3-] was titrated from 34.57 mM to 4.53 mM. Plasma [Cl-] fell, but [K+] and total Ca and Mg increased. In normoxic submergence, turtles survived over 150 days and no lactate accumulated. A respiratory alkalosis developed (pH-8.195, PCO2-5.49 after 10 days) early and persisted throughout; no other variables changed in normoxic submergence. Softshell turtles are very capable of extrapulmonary extraction of O-2, but are an anoxia-intolerant species of turtle forcing them to utilize hibernacula that are unlikely to become hypoxic or anoxic (e.g., large lakes and rivers).																			0174-1578					APR	2003	173	3					263	268		10.1007/s00360-003-0332-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00360-003-0332-1								12687397					WOS:000183373000010

Monitoring of benthic invertebrates of the river showed that the fauna was dominated by acid-tolerant species before liming and during the first year after the start of the treatment. Moderately acid-sensitive species, like Diura nanseni, Isoperla grammatica and Hydropsyche siltalai were found only in small numbers in a few localities in this period. In autumn 1987, the fist appearance of the highly acid-sensitive mayfly Baetis rhodani was recorded at two stations in the main river. During the following years. this species colonized other localities and several other sensitive invertebrates, such as Heptagenia sulphurea, Caenis horaria, Hydropsyche pellucidula and Lepidostoma hirtum were also recorded. The change in faunal composition was highly significant compared to unlimed reference stations.																			0269-7491						1992	78	1-3					173	178		10.1016/0269-7491(92)90026-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0269-7491(92)90026-7								15091944					WOS:A1992JG10700025
J	Hamdan, AMA; Rady, ARA				Hamdan, Ali Mohamed Ali; Rady, Ahmed Ragab Abdel			Vulnerability of the groundwater in the quaternary aquifer at El Shalal-Kema area, Aswan, Egypt	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												El Shalal-Kema area is located east of Aswan town and Nile River. The Quaternary sediments (unconsolidated material of sands, gravels, and clays intercalation) represent the main aquifer in the studied area. Its water is under unconfined condition, and the water table is shallow (vary from 7.5 to 16.3 m). The concerned aquifer is recharged mainly from Aswan Dam Lake, from the excess irrigation water and from septic tanks, where the area is not served by sewage system. The direction of the groundwater movement is generally from south to north. The transmissivity values of the Quaternary aquifer (from three pumping tests) are relatively high (vary from 1,996 to 3,029 m(2)/day). The exploitation of groundwater is carried out where there is continuous withdrawal for industrial and domestic uses with a total average quantity of groundwater of 71,304 m(3) per day (25.67 million m(3) per year). The hydrochemical characteristics of the Quaternary aquifer is studied based on the chemical analysis of 29 groundwater and four surface water samples collected from different sites. The chemical composition of the groundwater is dominated by calcium Ca2+ from the cations and bicarbonate (HCO (3) (-) ) from the anions, and the order of cation abundance is Ca2+ > Na+ > Mg2+ > K+ and HCO (3) (-) > SO (4) (2-) > Cl- among the anions. The groundwater types are normal chloride water, normal sulfate water, and normal carbonate water. The hypothetical salt combination revealed the presence of different salts arranged in terms of their predominant as Ca(HCO3)(2), Mg(HCO3)(2), NaCl, Na2SO4, MgSO4, KCL, NaHCO3, MgCl2, CaSO4, and K2SO4. The analytical measurements to the NO2 and NH3 reveal that their values decrease in summer and increase in winter due to the stoppage of pumping which leads to the increase of the wastewater quantities that reach the groundwater. The chemical and microbiological analyses show that the aquifer in this area is contaminated with fecal and disease-causing bacteria. The main cause of this contamination is the outflow from the septic tanks; therefore, the construction of sewage network is a vital solution. Chlorination is important to disinfect the groundwater at the tanks before its distribution to the houses.

Causes of complexity in a fallout dominated plinian eruption sequence: 312 ka Fasnia Member, Diego Hernandez Formation, Tenerife, Spain	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												The 312 ka Fasnia eruption from the Las Canadas Caldera on Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain, produced a complex sequence of twenty-two intercalated units, including 7 pumice fall, 7 ignimbrite and 8 ash surge and fall deposits that define two distinct eruption sequences (Lower and Upper Fasnia sequences). The fallout units themselves are internally complex, reflecting waxing and waning of the eruption column, while many of the ignimbrites reflect multiple intra-plinian partial column collapse events associated with the injection of lithic clasts into the eruption column. The Lower and Upper Fasnia eruption phases were each terminated by caldera collapse and complete column collapse events. Probable blockage of the conduit and vent system during Lower Fasnia caldera collapse event briefly terminated the eruption, resulting in a short-lived period of erosion and sedimentation prior to the onset of the Upper Fasnia phase. The transition to the Upper Fasnia eruption phase coincided with the eruption of more geochemically homogeneous pyroclasts. In total, 62 km(3) of tephra were erupted, including 49 km(3) of juvenile clasts and > 12 km(3) of lithic clasts. The DRE volume of magma erupted was 13 km(3) (Lower Fasnia > 5 km(3), Upper Fasnia > 8 km(3)), two thirds of which (similar to 9-10 km(3)) was deposited purely by fallout. The Fasnia Member is one of the most complex plinian sequences known. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Martyn			Are spherulitic lacustrine carbonates an expression of large-scale mineral carbonation? A case study from the East Kirkton Limestone, Scotland	GONDWANA RESEARCH												Lacustrine carbonate deposits with spherulitic facies are poorly understood, but are key to understanding the economically important "Pre-Salt" Mesozoic strata of the South Atlantic A major barrier to research into these unique and spectacular facies is the lack of good lacustrine spherulite-dominated deposits which are known in outcrop. Stratigraphy and petrography suggest one of the best analogue systems is found in the Carboniferous of Scotland: the East Kirkton Limestone. Here we propose a hydrogeochemical model that explains why the CaCO3, SiO2, Mg-Si-Al mineral suite associated with spherular radial calcite facies forms in alkaline lakes above basaltic bedrock. Demonstrating links between igneous bedrock chemistry, lake and spring water chemistry and mineral precipitation, this model has implications for studies of lacustrine sediments in rift basins of all ages. Using empirical and theoretical approaches, we analyze the relationship between metal mobilization from sub-surface volcaniclastic rocks and the potential for precipitation of carbonate minerals, various Mg-bearing minerals and chalcedony in a lacustrine spherulitic carbonate setting. This suite of minerals is most likely formed by in-gassing of CO2 to a carbon-limited alkaline spring water, consistent with the reaction of alkali igneous rocks in the subsurface with meteoric groundwater. We suggest that an analogous system to that at East Kirkton caused development of the 'Pre-Salt' spherulitic carbonate deposits. (C) 2017 International Association for Gondwana Research.

J	KONDOLF, GM; VORSTER, P				KONDOLF, GM; VORSTER, P			CHANGING WATER-BALANCE OVER TIME IN RUSH CREEK, EASTERN CALIFORNIA, 1860-1992	WATER RESOURCES BULLETIN												Rush Creek, the principal tributary to Mono Lake, has undergone profound hydrologic modifications as a result of flow regulation for hydroelectric generation and irrigation, diversions for irrigated agriculture, and diversions for water export to the City of Los Angeles. Lower Rush Creek (the lowermost 13 km down-stream of Grant Lake Reservoir) was dry by 1970, but now receives flow as a result of court-ordered efforts to restore former ecological conditions. Using available historic data and recent field measurements, we constructed the water balance for Lower Rush Creek, identifying six distinct historical periods characterized by very different patterns of gain and loss. The hydrologic patterns must be understood as a basis for modeling ecosystem response to stream-flow alteration. A gradually gaining stream under natural conditions, the advent of irrigation diversions caused the middle reaches of Lower Rush Creek to be often completely dry, while irrigation-recharged springs still maintained a baseflow in the downstream ''Meadows'' ranch. Increased water exports from the basin subsequently reduced irrigation and dried up the springs.																			0043-1370					SEP-OCT	1993	29	5					823	832																WOS:A1993ML38300010
J	Yan, DD; Wünnemann, B; Zhang, YZ				Yan, Dada; Wuennemann, Bernd; Zhang, Yongzhan			Late Quaternary lacustrine Ostracoda and their implications for hydro-climatic variation in Northeastern Tibetan Plateau	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Ostracoda from non-marine waters have a significant potential role in monitoring ecological conditions and reconstructing paleoenvironments. During the last decades, the increase in research on ostracods on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) has been achieved, although there are still taxonomical and ecological problems in their application in Quaternary studies. The aim of this review is to summarize the occurrences of ostracods in surface samples from four selected lakes (Qinghai Lake, Lake Donggi Cona, Lake Kuhai and Hala Lake) along the modern monsoon marginal zone on the northeast Tibetan Plateau and to compare the ostracod associations in sediment cores from different sites with available proxy data after re-evaluation of chronologies in order to reconstruct hydroclimatic conditions and monsoon influence during the late Quaternary. Comprehensive reanalysis of ostracod data from selected lakes (including 3 closed and 1 open lake basins) on the northeastern TP shows that their occurrence and disappearance responded sensitively to salinity and related water depth changes during the late Quaternary. This could lead to a re-interpretation of other proxy data related to hydro-climatic interpretation. Ostracod-based reconstructions of lake level changes along the modern summer monsoon marginal zone of the northeastern TP during the late Quaternary indicate an overestimation of the contribution from monsoonal rainfall to strong lake level changes, while the glacier/snow meltwater supply was underestimated in previous studies. This inference sheds more light on moisture source and the interplay between westerlies and Asian Summer Monsoon on the northern TP.																			0012-8252	1872-6828				AUG	2020	207								103251	10.1016/j.earscirev.2020.103251	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2020.103251													WOS:000556899700024
J	Yin, QZ; Guo, ZT				Yin, Q. Z.; Guo, Z. T.			Strong summer monsoon during the cool MIS-13	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												The delta O-18 record in deep-sea sediments show a significant reduced amplitude of the ice volume variations before Marine Isotope Stage 11, about 400 ka ago, with less warm interglacials and less cold glacials. The deuterium temperature and the greenhouse gases records in the Antarctic ice cores show the same feature. As the reduction in the amplitude of climate and greenhouse gases concentration variations before 400 ka BP is present in both deep-sea and ice cores, it is tempting to conclude that this is a worldwide phenomenon. This is not necessarily true, at least as far as some of the records, in particular of China and Europe, are concerned. The loess in northern China, the sedimentary core in the eastern Tibetan Plateau and the palaeosols in southern China all record an unusually warm and wet climate during Marine Isotope Stage 13, indicating an extremely strong East Asian summer monsoon. The pollen record from Europe shows that the climatic conditions during the interglacials previous to Marine Isotope Stage 11 are at least as warm as the younger interglacials. During Marine Isotope Stage 13, unusually strong African and Indian monsoon are recorded in the sediments of the equatorial Indian Ocean and of the Mediterranean Sea. Other extreme climate events are also recorded in sediment cores of the equatorial Atlantic, the Pacific, the subtropical South Atlantic Ocean and in the Lake Baikal of Siberia.

J	Marie, A; Vengosh, A				Marie, A; Vengosh, A			Sources of salinity in ground water from Jericho area, Jordan Valley	GROUND WATER												One of the major problems in the lower Jordan Valley is the increasing salinization (i.e., chloride content) of local ground water. The high levels of salinity limit the utilization of ground water for both domestic and agriculture applications. This joint collaborative study evaluates the sources and mechanisms for salinization in the Jericho area. We employ diagnostic geochemical fingerprinting methods to trace the potential sources of the salinity in (1) the deep confined subaquifer system (K2) of Lower Cenomanian age; (2) the upper subaquifer system (K1) of Upper Cenomanian and Turonian ages; and (3) the shallow aquifer system (Q) of Plio-Pleistocene ages. The chemical composition of the saline ground water from the two Cenomanian subaquifers (K1 and K2) point to a single saline source with Na/Cl similar to0.5 and Br/Cl similar to7 X 10(-3), This composition is similar to that of thermal hypersaline springs that are found along the western shore of the Dead Sea (e.g., En Gedi thermal spring). We suggest that the increasing salinity in both K1 and K2 subaquifers is derived from mixing with deep-seated brines that flow through the Rift fault system. The salinization rate depends on the discharge volume of the fresh meteoric water in the Cenomanian Aquifer, In contrast, the chemical composition of ground water from the Plio-Pleistocene Aquifer shows a wide range of CT (100-2000 mg/L), Na/Cl (0.4-1.0), Br/CI (2-6 x 10(-3)), and SO4Cl (0.01-0.4) ratios. These variations, together with the high SO42-, K+, and NO3- concentrations, suggest that the salinity in the shallow aquifer is derived from the combination of (1) upconing of deep brines as reflected by low Na/Cl and high Br/CI ratios; (2) leaching of salts from the Lisan Formation within the Plio-Pleistocene Aquifer, as suggested by the high SO42- concentrations; and (3) anthropogenic contamination of agriculture return flow and sewage effluents with distinctive high K+ (80 mg/L) and NO3-(80 mg/L) contents and low Br/Cl ratios (2 x 10-3). Our data demonstrates that the chemical composition of salinized ground water can be used to delineate the sources of salinity and hence to establish the conceptual model for explaining salinization processes.

J	Chen, XJ; Sheng, YP				Chen, XJ; Sheng, YP			Three-dimensional modeling of sediment and phosphorus dynamics in Lake Okeechobee, Florida: Spring 1989 simulation	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Lake Okeechobee is a large and shallow freshwater body in south Florida. Due to the shallowness of Lake Okeechobee, the nutrient dynamics are strongly influenced by hydrodynamic processes (circulation and wind-induced waves) and sediment transport processes. To study water quality and the effects of hydrodynamic and sediment transport processes on nutrient dynamics in the lake, a three-dimensional simulation system that closely couples hydrodynamic and sediment transport processes with nutrient dynamics was developed and used. In this paper, we present, a three-dimensional, coupled hydrodynamics-sediment-nutrient model for Lake Okeechobee. The coupled model was used to simulate a four-week survey conducted in spring 1989 in Lake Okeechobee. By comparing model results to measured field data, it is shown that the coupled model system is able to simulate weekly sediment and phosphorus dynamics in Lake Okeechobee. Model applications demonstrated that the resuspension flux of phosphorus from the lake bottom is significantly higher than the molecular flux during resuspension events and can cause increases of phosphorus concentrations in the water column. Sensitivity runs of the model show that both the advective/diffusive transport and the algal uptake promote the release of phosphorus from suspended sediments and thus affect the phosphorus budget in the lake and the net resuspension flux of phosphorus from the lake bottom.

The Algar do Carvao lake is located inside a volcanic pit on Terceira at an altitude of 92 m and has a surface area of 11,500 m(2) and a maximum depth of 8.2 m. The Furna do Enxofre lake is located inside a lava cave on Graciosa at an altitude of 500 m and has a surface area of approximately 300 m(2) and a maximum depth of 9.3 m. The water temperature of both lakes is low, with values ranging between 11 degrees C and 13 degrees C, in both the winter and summer periods, and no variations are observed along their water columns. The electrical conductivity ranges from 585 mu S cm(-1) to 687 mu S cm(-1) in Furna do Enxofre and from 1170 cm(-1) to 131 mu S cm(-1) in Algar do Carvao, reflecting a higher mineralisation in the former lake. The pH values in Furna do Enxofre range between 6.50 and 6.58, which reflects the effect of CO2 dissolution, while in Algar do Carvao, the pH values are more basic (7.42-8.53). The water types are Mg-HCO3 for Furna do Enxofre and Na-HCO3 for Algar do Carvao; the Mg-enrichment in Furna do Enxofre is associated with water-rock interactions, which are enhanced by the acidic environment. Diffuse CO2 flux measurements were made using the accumulation chamber method, with a total of 37 measurements split into two surveys at Algar do Carvao and 71 measurements during a single survey at Furna do Enxofre. The total CO2 emitted from Furna do Enxofre was 6100 kg d(-1), which was much lower than that emitted from Algar do Carvao (0.32-2.0 kg d(-1)). A volcanic origin was assigned to the lake on Graciosa due to the delta C-13 isotopic signature of the CO2; conversely, the CO2 released in Algar do Carvao is derived from a biogenic CO2 source. Considering the surface areas of the studied lakes, the CO2 flux is in the range of 1.5-6.7 t km(-2) d(-1) for Algar do Carvao and is 508.3 t km(-2) d(-1) for Furna do Enxofre.

In case of the terminal and alkaline Lake Van, however, previous studies have shown that bulk oxygen isotope compositions are in disagreement with other proxies when interpreted in a conventional manner. Similarly, the reports on the nature and the timing and site of carbonate precipitation in Lake Van are inconsistent. This study provides evidence on the mineralogy (X-ray powder diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscope imaging, confocal Raman microscopy, electron microprobe analysis) and isotope composition (delta O-18 and delta C-13) of non-skeletal carbonate minerals in a Lake Van sedimentary profile spanning the last ca. 150 kyr. Carbonate phases present in the sediment include aragonite, low-Mg calcite, and calcian dolomite. Dolomite forms as an early diagenetic phase and occurs episodically in high concentrations driving the bulk isotope record towards the higher dolomite delta O-18 and varying delta C-13 values. Aragonite and low-Mg calcite precipitate in the surface water and are present in the sediments in varying amounts (relative aragonite to calcite content for dolomite-poor samples Ar/(Ar + Cc) of 93 to 41 wt%). In an attempt to explain this variation, we revised a precipitation model based on annually laminated sediments containing both aragonite and calcite spatially separated in light and dark coloured laminae, respectively. According to our model, spring calcite precipitation, under close-to-freshwater conditions, is followed by evapoconcentration-driven aragonite precipitation in late summer. The precipitation of these carbonate polymorphs from chemically differing surface waters (i.e. freshwater-influenced and evapoconcentrated) leads to distinctly different oxygen and carbon isotope signatures between sedimentary penecontemporaneous aragonite and calcite. The delta O-18 and delta C-13 values of aragonite relative to calcite are significantly higher by several per mille than inferred from aragonite-calcite fractionation factors alone, suggesting that the generalised assumption of sedimentary coeval calcite and aragonite precipitating from water with the same isotopic composition is flawed. The here proposed revised hydrologically-separated carbonate precipitation model is not only taking (i) differences in the isotopic fractionation between carbonate minerals into account, but also (ii) considering the hydrological conditions and the processes favouring the precipitation of a given mineral and ultimately controlling its isotopic composition. If mixed mineralogies are present, this mineralogy-specific approach has the potential of refining environmental reconstructions and reconciling apparently equivocal interpretations of different proxy records.					; Kwiecien, Ola/AAC-8309-2021; Nehrke, Gernot/LZG-2902-2025	Kwiecien, Ola/0000-0001-6018-9181; Nehrke, Gernot/0000-0002-2851-3049; McCormack, Jeremy/0000-0002-5995-877X; Jons, Niels/0000-0002-1011-1113; Immenhauser, Adrian/0000-0001-9494-2450													0009-2541	1872-6836				MAY 20	2019	513						167	183		10.1016/j.chemgeo.2019.03.014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2019.03.014													WOS:000464007200014

On some features of diurnal dynamics of solonchak emissivity in summer	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Widely represented in many arid regions of the world, dry marshes pose a potential threat to the adjacent areas because of soil salinization caused by wind transfer (for long distances) of toxic mineral salts from the dried surface. For environmental monitoring of such soils, remote microwave sensing methods are used. In this work, we study at a 2.3 cm wavelength the summer diurnal dynamics of microwave radiation of sodic solonchak formed on the dried bottom of a hypersaline lake. It has been established that the study indicator (in the centimetre range) depends on the cumulative changes in temperature, moisture and salinity of soils. With rise in soil temperature, intensive evaporation and topsoil drying, a salt crust and the underlying layer with less moisture (accompanied by microwave radiation interference on the layered structure of solonchak) can be formed. In the experiment, a daily variation in the brightness temperature of the study object (a specific object) by 25 K occurred with change in thermodynamic temperature of the skin layer by 10 K.

J	Schooley, J; Proctor, JTA				Schooley, J; Proctor, JTA			Freeze damage to north American ginseng	HORTTECHNOLOGY												The Lake Erie counties of southern Ontario, Canada are the major producers of ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) in North America. In this area there is about 1740 ha (4299.5 acres) of ginseng and an annual production of 1455 t (1603.8 tons). Spring freeze damage to the crop is rare as the mean date of last freeze in spring is 12 May. On 21 May 2002, following three to six nights when air temperatures dropped below freezing, extensive damage to the crop was evident. A survey by the Ontario Ginseng Growers Association showed that 78% of growers had gardens showing freeze damage. The extent of the damage was variable across the growing area, and on individual farms. Most damage to plants occurred in low-lying areas where heavy cold air collected. Recently germinated seedlings that were exposed above the straw mulch were severely damaged, and many did not survive because they did not have leaves and no perennating bud was formed. Damage to 2-year-old plants was expressed as leaves wilting and turning black. In some cases stems froze and the plants toppled. In 3-year-old and older plants, damage was variable with some leaf collapse and stems broken, or damaged with corking-over taking place. Damage to inflorescences ranged from death and abscission, to distorted flowers and shriveled and split peduncles. Plant health was a concern following the freeze episode, and throughout the subsequent growing season. The fungicide fenhexamid received emergency registration to combat recurring problems in Botrytis control. The seed crop for 2002 was light. Damaged seedling gardens were replanted. Older gardens will undergo a period of adjustment. Root yield in 2002 was reduced by 30%, a 500 t (551.1 tons) loss. The full extent of the damage and associated financial implications are unknown and could impact the industry until 2005.																			1063-0198	1943-7714				OCT-DEC	2003	13	4					697	701		10.21273/HORTTECH.13.4.0697	http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTTECH.13.4.0697													WOS:000185618900023

Drought-induced metal release from a wetland at Plastic Lake, central Ontario	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												With climate change, droughts may become more frequent in southern Ontario, which could release metals from peat and degrade downstream water quality. Monthly volume- weighted metal ( Al, Ba, Be, Cd, Co, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr, and Zn) concentrations and fluxes in streams and bulk deposition at Plastic Lake were monitored over 20 months in 2002- 2003, during which there was a summer drought. Monthly concentrations in the outflow from the wetland ( PC1) were variable, with very high concentrations following the drought. With the exception of Pb, statistically significant models of metal concentrations with SO42- and dissolved organic carbon concentrations were developed, and these relationships were used to estimate monthly metal exports between 1980 and 2000. Model predictions for Cd and Zn in PC1 agreed well ( p < 0.001) with concentrations measured between 1989 and 1991. Model predictions suggesting peaks in metal concentrations are common in years with pronounced summer droughts. In contrast to ombrotrophic bogs, the PC1 wetland receives the majority of its metal input from the terrestrial catchment, and mass balance approximations indicate no substantial depletion of metal reserves in peat. Drought- induced metal peaks may persist for many decades, potentially contributing to the delayed recovery of surface waters at Plastic Lake, despite declining S deposition.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				MAY	2008	65	5					834	845		10.1139/F07-195	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F07-195													WOS:000255671700006
J	McHale, MR; Cirmo, CP; Mitchell, MJ; McDonnell, JJ				McHale, MR; Cirmo, CP; Mitchell, MJ; McDonnell, JJ			Wetland nitrogen dynamics in an Adirondack forested watershed	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Wetlands often form the transition zone between upland soils and watershed streams, however, stream-wetland interactions and hydrobiogeochemical processes are poorly understood. We measured changes in stream nitrogen (N) through one riparian wetland and one beaver meadow in the Archer Creek watershed in the Adirondack Mountains of New York State, USA from 1 March to 31 July 1996. In the riparian wetland we also measured changes in groundwater N. Groundwater N changed significantly from tension lysimeters at the edge of the peatland to piezometer nests within the peatland. Mean N concentrations at the peatland perimeter were 1(.)5, 0(.)5 and 18(.)6 mumol L-1 for NH4+, NO3- and DON (dissolved organic nitrogen), respectively, whereas peatland groundwater N concentration was 56(.)9, 1.5 and 31(.)6 mumol L-1 for NH4+, NO3- and DON, respectively. The mean concentrations of stream water N species at the inlet to the wetlands were 1(.)5, 10(.)1 and 16(.)9 mumol L-1 for NH4+, NO3- and DON, respectively and 1(.)6, 28(.)1 and 8(.)4 mumol L-1 at the wetland outlet. Although groundwater total dissolved N (TDN) concentrations changed more than stream water TDN through the wetlands, hydrological cross-sections for the peatland showed that wetland groundwater contributed minimally to stream flow during the study period. Therefore, surface water N chemistry was affected more by in-stream N transformations than by groundwater N transformations because the in-stream changes, although small, affected a much greater volume of water. Stream water N input-output budgets indicated that the riparian peatland retained 0(.)16 mol N ha(-1) day(--1) of total dissolved N and the beaver meadow retained 0(.)26 mol N ha(-1) day(-1) during the study period. Nitrate dominated surface water TDN flux from the wetlands during the spring whereas DON dominated during the summer. This study demonstrates that although groundwater N changed significantly in the riparian peatland, those changes were not reflected in the stream. Consequently, although in-stream changes of N concentrations were less marked than those in groundwater, they had a greater effect on stream water chemistry-because wetland groundwater contributed minimally to stream flow.

Surface ozone-temperature relationships in the eastern US: A monthly climatology for evaluating chemistry-climate models	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												We use long-term, coincident O-3 and temperature measurements at the regionally representative US Environmental Protection Agency Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNet) over the eastern US from 1988 through 2009 to characterize the surface O-3 response to year-to-year fluctuations in weather, for the purpose of evaluating global chemistry-climate models. We first produce a monthly climatology for each site over all available years, defined as the slope of the best-fit line (m(O3-T)) between monthly average values of maximum daily 8-hour average (MDA8) O-3 and monthly average values of daily maximum surface temperature (T-max). Applying two distinct statistical approaches to aggregate the site-specific measurements to the regional scale, we find that summer time m(O3-T) is 3-6 ppb K-1 (r = 0.5-0.8) over the Northeast, 3-4 ppb K-1 (r = 0.5-0.9) over the Great Lakes, and 3-6 ppb K-1 (r = 0.2-0.8) over the Mid-Atlantic. The Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) Atmospheric Model version 3 (AM3) global chemistry-climate model generally captures the seasonal variations in correlation coefficients and m(O3-T) despite biases in both monthly mean summertime MDA8 O-3 (up to +10 to +30 ppb) and daily T-max (up to +5 K) over the eastern US. During summer, GFDL AM3 reproduces m(O3-T) over the Northeast (m(O3-T) = 2-6 ppb K-1; r = 0.6-0.9), but underestimates m(O3-T) by 4 ppb K-1 over the Mid-Atlantic, in part due to excessively warm temperatures above which O-3 production saturates in the model. Combining T-max biases in GFDL AM3 with an observation-based m(O3-T) estimate of 3 ppb K-1 implies that temperature biases could explain up to 5-15 ppb of the MDA8 O-3 bias in August and September though correcting for excessively cool temperatures would worsen the O-3 bias in June. We underscore the need for long-term, coincident measurements of air pollution and meteorological variables to develop process-level constraints for evaluating chemistry-climate models used to project air quality responses to climate change.

Here, various aspects of phenotypic and life-history variation of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L., brown trout Salmo trutta L., and Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (L.) are reviewed. While many strategies and tactics are commonly used by these species, there are also differences in their ecology and population dynamics that result in a variety of interesting and diverse topics that are challenging for future research. Atlantic salmon display considerable phenotypic plasticity and variability in life-history characters ranging from fully freshwater resident forms, where females can mature at approximately 10 cm in length, to anadromous populations characterised by 3-5 sea-winter (5SW) salmon. Even within simple 1SW populations, 20 or more spawning life-history types can be identified. Juveniles in freshwater can use both fluvial and lacustrine habitats for rearing, and while most smolts migrate to sea during the spring, fall migrations occur in some populations. At sea, some salmon undertake extensive oceanic migrations while other populations stay within the geographical confines of areas such as the Baltic Sea. At the other extreme are those that reside in estuaries and return to freshwater to spawn after spending only a few months at sea. The review of information on the diversity of life-history forms is related to conservation aspects associated with Atlantic salmon populations and current trends in abundance and survival. Brown trout is indigenous to Europe, North Africa and western Asia, but was introduced into at least 24 countries outside Europe and now has a world-wide distribution. It exploits both fresh and salt waters for feeding and spawning (brackish), and populations are often partially migratory. One part of the population leaves and feeds elsewhere, while another part stays as residents. In large, complex systems, the species is polymorphic with different size morphs in the various parts of the habitat. Brown trout feed close to the surface and near shore, but large individuals may move far offshore. The species exhibits ontogenetic niche shifts partly related to size and partly to developmental rate. They switch when the amount of surplus energy available for growth becomes small with fast growers being younger and smaller fish than slow growers. Brown trout is an opportunistic carnivore, but individuals specialise at least temporarily on particular food items; insect larvae are important for the young in streams, while littoral epibenthos in lakes and fish are most important for large trout. The sexes differ in resource use and size. Females are more inclined than males to become migratory and feed in pelagic waters. Males exploit running water, near-shore and surface waters more than females. Therefore, females feed more on zooplankton and exhibit a more uniform phenotype than males. The Arctic charr is the northernmost freshwater fish on earth, with a circumpolar distribution in the Holarctic that matches the last glaciation. Recent mtDNA studies indicate that there are five phylogeographic lineages (Atlantic, Arctic, Bering, Siberian and Acadian) that may be of Pleistocene origin. Phenotypic expression and ecology are more variable in charr than in most fish. Weights at maturation range from 3 g to 12 kg. Population differences in morphology and coloration are large and can have some genetic basis. Charr live in streams at sea and in all habitats of oligotrophic lakes, including very deep areas. Ontogeneti The charr feed on all major prey types of streams, lakes and near-shore marine habitats, but has high niche flexibility in competition. Cannibalism is expressed in several cases, and can be important for developing and maintaining bimodal size distributions. Anadromy is found in the northern part of its range and involves about 40, but sometimes more days in the sea. All charr overwinter in freshwater. Partial migration is common, but the degree of anadromy varies greatly among populations. The food at sea includes zooplankton and pelagic fish, but also epibenthos. Polymorphism and sympatric morphs are much studied. As a prominent fish of glaciated lakes, charr is an important species for studying ecological speciation by the combination of field studies and experiments, particularly in the fields of morphometric heterochrony and comparative behaviour.

Spatially referenced Bayesian state-space model of total phosphorus in western Lake Erie	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Collecting water quality data across large lakes is often done under regulatory mandate; however, it is difficult to connect nutrient concentration observations to sources of those nutrients and to quantify this relationship. This difficulty arises from the spatial and temporal separation between observations, the impact of hydrodynamic forces, and the cost involved in discrete samples collected aboard vessels. These challenges are typified in Lake Erie, where binational agreements regulate riverine loads of total phosphorus (TP) to address the impacts from annual harmful algal blooms (HABs). While it is known that the Maumee River supplies 50 % of the nutrient load to Lake Erie, the details of how the Maumee River TP load changes Lake Erie TP concentration have not been demonstrated. We developed a hierarchical spatially referenced Bayesian statespace model with an adjacency matrix defined by surface currents. This was applied to a 2 km-by-2 km grid of nodes, to which observed lake and river TP concentrations were joined. The model generated posterior samples describing the unobserved nodes and observed nodes on unobserved days. We quantified the impact plume of the Maumee River by experimentally changing concentration data and tracking the change in in-lake predictions. Our impact plume represents the spatial and temporal variation of how river concentrations correlate with lake concentrations. We used the impact plume to scale the Maumee River spring TP load to an effective Maumee River TP spring load for each node in the lake. By assigning an effective load to each node, the relationship between load and concentration is consistent throughout our sampling locations. A linear model of annual lake node mean TP concentration and effective Maumee River load estimated that, in the absence of the Maumee River load, lake concentrations at the sampled nodes would be 23.1 mu g L-1 (+/- 1.75, 95 % CI, credible interval) and that for each 100 t of spring TP effective load delivered to Lake Erie, mean TP concentrations increase by 11 mu g L-1 (+/- 1, 95 % CI). Our proposed modeling technique allowed us to establish these quantitative connections between Maumee TP load and Lake Erie TP concentrations which otherwise would be masked by the movement of water through space and time.					; Stow, Craig/AAG-8109-2020; Godwin, Casey/JVZ-2099-2024	Maguire, Timothy/0000-0002-7742-769X; Stow, Craig/0000-0001-6171-7855													1027-5606	1607-7938				APR 25	2022	26	8					1993	2017		10.5194/hess-26-1993-2022	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-1993-2022													WOS:000786552200001

The theoretical diffusive fluxes of dissolved pore-water carbon gases to the overlying water ranged from 0.16 mg.m(-2)d(-1) to 3.84 mg.m(-2)d(-1) and from 20.68 mg.m(-2)d(-1) to 99.88 mg.m(-2)d(-1) for methane and carbon dioxide, respectively. The comparison between the diffusive fluxes of methane at the sediment-water interface and its fluxes at the water-atmosphere interface showed that an ebullition is probably the major pathway for CH4 transport from the sediment to the atmosphere. The fluxes of CO2 at the sediment-water interface were considerably lower than its fluxes at the water-atmosphere interface. This indicates that most CO2 is generated in the water column, whereas only a small portion originates from sediments.					; Koszelnik, Piotr/D-4747-2013	Gruca-Rokosz, Renata/0000-0001-8222-2480; Koszelnik, Piotr/0000-0001-6866-7432													1230-1485	2083-5906					2011	20	1					81	86																WOS:000287461100010

Diatom microstratigraphy was determined for the succession between 60 and 68 cm core depth. The frequency of Synedra spp. varied from more than 40% in the light-colored laminae to less than 10% in the dark laminae. Aulacoseira spp. or Cyclotella (?) spp. were dominant in the dark laminae, in which the proportion of Synedra spp. was relatively low. The correlation of these diatom assemblages with alternating lamina color indicates a seasonal succession within the diatom biota. Each couplet of light- and dark-colored laminae in the sediment is, therefore, considered to be an annual sedimentation increment.

Cortisol Concentration in Hair of the Baikal Seal (Pusa sibirica, Gmelin, 1788, Carnivora, Phocidae): The Effects of Sex, Age, and the Dynamics of Ice Destruction	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												Measuring cortisol concentrations in hair is a widespread method of hormonal research in natural populations. In particular, it has increasingly been used for assessing chronic physiological stress over long periods of time. This study showed for the first time the experience of using the hair of Baikal seals to examine their hormonal status. We collected hair samples from live Baikal seals captured during summer expeditions to the Ushkany Islands, Lake Baikal in 2019 and 2021. Age differences in the cortisol concentrations in hair were found: hair cortisol levels were higher among the young seals and declined with age. We suppose this may be related to different extents of nutritional stress, hunting success, and social factors on summer rookeries. There was no sex effect on cortisol in hair in young animals. We observed that the cortisol concentrations in hair were higher in young animals captured in 2019 compared to seals taken in 2021, with no differences in ice conditions between these years found.

Cottonwood conservation requires periodic seedling replenishment, which depends upon coordinating river flows with the limited seed dispersal interval. Tracking seed dispersal phenology is laborious and we recognized a complementary approach with photographs and videos of prolific cottonwood seed release on internet websites. We searched the internet for 'cottonwood seeds' or 'summer snow', and about 800 images were posted since 2004. The 337 reports from North America with dates and/or locations revealed sequential seed dispersal in the American Southwest, the Pacific Northwest, the Great Lakes Region, and finally Alaska. Mean dispersal was June 3, with two-thirds of reports in the flanking four week interval. Dispersal was later at higher latitude and elevation, and a two-factor regression model provided 85% accuracy with reported peak dispersal from nine previous studies across western North America. The 49 Eurasian reports also revealed later seed dispersal with increasing latitude. This study revealed the utility of internet searching for tracking cottonwood seed dispersal, which could facilitate environmental flows for riparian restoration. More broadly, internet reports could reveal spatiotemporal patterns in other natural phenomena.

Based on 5 radiocarbon dates, Vanevan record covers the Mid Holocene (from ca. 7800 to ca. 5100 cal. BP). The Late Holocene is today absent in the peat stratigraphy due to modern peat exploitation by surface mining. This study focuses on a multi-proxy approach including pollen, charcoals, and pollen-inferred climate reconstruction. An open-land, steppic vegetation is recorded up to ca. 7700 cal. BP, followed by a more forested landscape during the Mid Holocene (up to ca. 5700 cal. BP), and ending again with an open-land vegetation (to the end of record, 5100 cal. BP). This vegetation dynamics responds to general climate changes documented in the Near East. Whether human activities are documented since ca. 7500 cal. BP (Late Neolithic) in Vanevan, they remain marginal and probably did not affect the area. Early Holocene dry climate, which caused the steppic environment to be widespread through the Near East, is strongly related to low late spring precipitation (PMay-Jun = 180 mm). Mid Holocene forested landscape and increasing lake-level seem related to late spring precipitation (+28%), which is the main change in estimated climate parameters. This has to be linked with reinforcement of the Westerlies and less active Siberian High, which are inversely involved in the following, dry phase starting at ca. 5700 cal. BP.

Early Holocene monsoonal fluctuations in the Garhwal higher Himalaya as inferred from multi-proxy data from the Malari paleolake	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												A 4.9-m-thick lake sequence, formed due to the landslide damming of a stream in the semiarid Garhwal Himalaya, was studied to understand past monsoonal variations in the region. The Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) chronology indicates that the lake existed between similar to 12 and similar to 7 ka ago. Chronologically constrained trends of sand percent organic phosphorus (OP), apatite inorganic phosphorus (AIP) and parameters of environmental magnetism were measured in the paleolake profile. Measured proxies indicate that the Indian summer monsoon ameliorated in the early Holocene after 12 ka cooling, and it appears that all the proxies from the lake have captured this globally recognized early Holocene warming. Four phases of wet conditions (intensified monsoon) are recognized at similar to 11.5 lea, similar to 11-10.5 ka, similar to 10-9 ka and similar to 8-7 ka with maximum uncertainties of similar to 1000 years. The wet phases are characterized by high magnetic susceptibility, increased OP and reduced AIP. In an attempt to understand the primary forcing of the sharp fluctuations in monsoonal activity in the region, we show that changes in magnetic susceptibility match variations of residual atmospheric delta C-14, suggesting a role for solar variability as an explanation of climatic variability.

J	Wu, ZS; Lai, XJ; Li, KY				Wu, Zhaoshi; Lai, Xijun; Li, Kuanyi			Water quality assessment of rivers in Lake Chaohu Basin (China) using water quality index	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												This study aims at assessment the water quality condition in the rivers of Lake Chaohu Basin (LCB), and exploring the crucial parameters affecting its water quality. Four sampling activities were conducted seasonally from April to December in 2018 at 83 sites covering main rivers of LCB. We measured 15 physicochemical parameters, such as turbidity (tur), dissolved oxygen (DO), ammonium (NH4-N), nitrate (NO3-N), and permanganate index (CODmn ). There were significant differences of the 15 environmental parameters (except T) on spatial level, and three significant groups (i.e., Group I, II, and III) were divided according to cluster analysis. Water quality was evaluated by a water quality index (WQI) based on these parameters, which are commonly used in WQI calculation. Generally, the water quality state was classified as "moderate" in LCB (mean value of 69.1). Meanwhile, the state varied obviously among the three groups, with "good" in Group I and "moderate" in Group II and III. Seasonally, WQI in autumn was highest, which was significantly different from that in the other seasons. The distribution of water quality was consistent with other studies regardless of some typical rivers and the whole basin. Moreover, a minimum water quality index (WQI(min)) consisted of 5 crucial parameters (i.e., tur, DO, NH4-N, NO3-N, and CODmn ) was not significantly different with the WQI based on all the 15 parameters, and its percentage error was relatively low (6.02%). With the excellent application in Lake Taihu Basin (LTB) nearby LCB, this WQI(min) was robust and potentially universal in determining river water quality assessment in both basins. This finding is probably beneficial to low-cost and quick water quality evaluation in adjacent basins. In addition, TN maybe not suitable for WQI(min) development in rivers, especially in the area with relatively high concentration, which probably resulted in an underestimation of water quality condition.

Geomorphology of a Harbor-Breakwater Beach along a High Sand-Supply, Wave-Dominated Great Lakes Littoral Cell	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The geomorphology of a breakwater beach along Lake Superior's high-energy SE margin is investigated from aerial photographs, historic nautical charts, and ground-penetrating radar imagery to provide information on littoral dynamics. The study goal was to address shoreline behavior and depositional architecture of the expanding beach in the context of hydrodynamic changes over the last century. Understanding influences of variables such as wave climate, lake level, and winter-ice cover on breakwater-beach development has many coastal management applications, particularly along highly modified coastlines characterized by fragmented littoral cells. Subsurface architectural models of the wedge-shaped Grand Marais beach and shoreline reconstructions are evaluated in the context of hydrologic data. Statistical analyses suggest that although event-based shoreline changes can create lasting depositional architectures, multiyear to decadal patterns of beach development are driven largely by hydrodynamic trends that affect littoral sediment delivery, alter the beach face directly, or both. Periods of above-average wave-height maxima coincide with increased beach growth phases, while high lake levels favor a reduction therein. The direct geomorphic effects of increased erosion through beach inundation and stronger wave climate appear to outweigh influences of higher littoral sediment inputs from increased bluff erosion upstream and accelerated rates of longshore transport. This dynamic stands in contrast to that observed for systems along the southern Lake Erie margin, which are highly sensitive to upstream changes in sediment input. Winter-ice-cover extents and durations are statistically nonsignificant or marginally convincing drivers (low R-2) of beach geomorphology.																			0749-0208	1551-5036				JAN	2019	35	1					41	55		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-17-00209.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-17-00209.1													WOS:000457248700006

Lake Naleng is located on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau (31.10 degrees N 99.75 degrees E, 4200 m) along the upper tree-line. Variations in the summer monsoon are evident from shifts in vegetation that correspond to late glacial climate trends from other monsoon-sensitive regions. Alpine steppe was recorded between 17,700 and 14,800 Cal yr BP. indicating low effective moisture at the study site. Expansion of alpine meadows followed by advances in the position of tree-line around Lake Naleng suggest that climate became warmer and wetter between similar to 14,800 and 12,500 Cal yr BP, probably representing an enhancement of the Asian monsoon. Climatic cooling and reduced effective moisture are inferred from multivariate analysis and the upward retreat of tree-line between similar to 12,500 and 11,700 Cal yr BP. The timing and nature of these shifts to warm, wet and then cold, dry climatic conditions suggest that they correspond to the Bolling/Allerod and Younger Dryas intervals.

Annual mean concentrations of GEM, PBM, and GOM reached 2.77 ng m(-3), 60.8 pg m(-3), and 82.1 pg m(-3), respectively. GEM concentrations were elevated in all the seasons except autumn. High mercury concentrations were related to winds from the south, southwest, and north of the measurement site. Combining analysis results from using various source apportionment methods, it was found that GEM concentration was higher when quasi-local sources dominated over long-range transport. Six source factors belonging to the anthropogenic sources of GEM were identified, including the common sectors previously identified (industrial and biomass burning, coal combustion, iron and steel production, cement production, and incineration), as well as an additional factor of shipping emissions (accounting for 19.5 % of the total), which was found to be important in east China where marine vessel shipping activities are intense. Emissions of GEM from natural surfaces were also found to be as important as those from anthropogenic sources for GEM observed at this site. Concurrences of high GOM concentrations with elevated O-3 and temperature, along with the lagged variations in GEM and GOM during daytime demonstrated that the very high GOM concentrations were partially ascribed to intense in situ oxidation of GEM. Strong gas particle partitioning was also identified when PM2.5 was above a threshold value, in which case GOM decreased with increasing PM2.5.					; xie, zhouqing/P-9661-2019; Huang, Kan/E-4824-2011	Yu, Guangyuan/0000-0001-6350-1097; Xie, Zhouqing/0000-0003-1703-5157; Fu, Qingyan/0000-0003-2192-5654													1680-7316	1680-7324				MAY 6	2019	19	9					5923	5940		10.5194/acp-19-5923-2019	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-5923-2019													WOS:000466950500003

In this paper, we present Artemisia/Chenopodiaceae (A/C) ratios in pollen assemblages of surface sediments from 42 lakes on the central and western TP. Relationships between vegetation, climate and A/C ratio are investigated. The results show that the A/C ratio in the study region can distinguish desert from steppe vegetation. As a whole, the A/C ratio was higher than 1.2 in the steppe vegetation and lower than 1.2 in the desert vegetation zone. Statistical analysis revealed that the A/C ratio can be used as a moisture indicator on the TP. Based on the A/C ratio in pollen assemblages of sediment core TAN12-2 from Lake Tangra Yumco, we reconstructed the vegetation and climate history of the southern TP during the transitional period from the late glacial to the Holocene (17.5-10 cal kyr BP). From 17.5 to 16 cal kyr BP, desert vegetation occurred and climate was extremely dry. During 16-15 cal kyr BP, desert was replaced by steppe vegetation and climate became wetter. From 15 to 10 cal kyr BP, the lake basin of Tangra Yumco was covered by the steppe vegetation and climate tended to be more humid. Comparing our results with other lacustrine records on the TP, we found that the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) significantly affected the southern TP earlier than the northeastern TP.

Study of the composition and optical characteristics of aerosols in the atmosphere above it is an urgent problem. This work analyzes the results of studies of the microstructural and physicochemical properties of near-water and near-ground aerosol in the atmosphere of Lake Baikal basin in summer 2024 onboard Research Vessel Akademik V.A. Koptyug and at the Boyarsky research station on the southeastern coast of the lake. The aerosol spatial distribution over the lake water area and the content of black carbon in aerosol particles are shown to be determined by the location of anthropogenic sources in the absence of smoke plumes from wildfires. Hygroscopicity and volatility of atmospheric aerosols, which depend on aerosol particle size, are studied for the first time. The aerosol condensation activity over the coastal zone is found to be stronger than over the lake. The results can be useful for the development of regional models of atmospheric aerosol.																			1024-8560	2070-0393				OCT	2025	38	5					550	558		10.1134/S1024856025700423	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1024856025700423													WOS:001590990800001

The diurnal behavior for two Taylor Valley streams of different character was examined during the summer of 2010-11. Andersen Creek is a short, 1st-order proglacial stream, whereas Von Guerard Stream is a long, high-order stream with an extensive hyporheic zone that has a substantial cyanobacterial algal mat community in its middle reaches. Both streams display strong daily cycles for temperature, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and pH. Conductivity varies in concert with flow, with solute dilution occurring during the daily high-flow pulse. Dissolved oxygen co-varies strongly with pH at Andersen Creek but not for Von Guerard Stream. Each stream has a distinct geochemical character that for Andersen Creek is a direct reflection of its glacial source, unmodified by secondary effects, whereas that for Von Guerard Stream is modulated by its resident algal mat community and through extensive hyporheic zone interaction and exchange.

Leakage of plastics and other debris from landfills to a highly protected lake by wintering gulls	WASTE MANAGEMENT												General context: Gulls ingest plastic and other litter while foraging in open landfills, because organic matter is mixed with other debris. Therefore, gulls are potential biovectors of plastic pollution into natural habitats, especially when they concentrate in wetlands for roosting. Novelty: We quantified, for the first time, the flow of plastic and other anthropogenic debris from open landfills to a natural lake via the movement of gulls. We focused on Fuente de Piedra, an inland closed-basin lake in Spain that is internationally important for biodiversity. Methodology: In 2022, we sampled gull pellets regurgitated in the lake by lesser black-backed gulls Larus fuscus that feed on landfills, as well as their faeces, then characterized and quantified debris particles of >= 0.5 mm. By combining GPS and census data from 2010 to 2022, together with plastic quantification based on FTIR-ATR analysis, we estimated the average annual deposition of plastic and other debris by the wintering gull population into the lake. Main results: 86 % of pellets contained plastics, and 94 % contained other debris such as glass and textiles. Polyethylene (54 %), polypropylene (11.5 %) and polystyrene (11.5 %) were the main plastic polymers. An estimated annual mean of 400 kg of plastics were moved by gulls into the lake. Only 1 % of plastic mass was imported in faeces. Discussion: Incorporating the biovectoring role of birds can provide a more holistic view of the plastic cycle and waste management. Biovectoring is predictable in sites worldwide where gulls and other waterbirds feed in landfills and roost in wetlands. We discuss bird deterrence and other ways of mitigating debris leakage into aquatic ecosystems.

The dynamics of these photosynthetic cells are linked to annual fluctuations of temperature, water column mixing, resource availability, and consumption. Climate can modify these environmental factors and alter phytoplankton structure, seasonal dynamics, and taxonomic composition. Here, we review mechanistic links between climate alterations and factors limiting primary production, and highlight studies where climate change has had a clear impact on phytoplankton processes. Climate affects phytoplankton both directly through physiology and indirectly by changing water column stratification and resource availability, mainly nutrients and light, or intensified grazing by heterotrophs. These modifications affect various phytoplankton processes, and a widespread advance in phytoplankton spring bloom timing and changing bloom magnitudes have both been observed. Climate warming also affects phytoplankton species composition and size structure, and favors species traits best adapted to changing conditions associated with climate change. Shifts in phytoplankton can have far-reaching consequences for ecosystem structure and functioning. An improved understanding of the mechanistic links between climate and phytoplankton dynamics is important for predicting climate change impacts on aquatic ecosystems.

J	Gerdeaux, D; Dufour, E				Gerdeaux, Daniel; Dufour, Elise			Inferring occurrence of growth checks in pike (Esox lucius) scales by using sequential isotopic analysis of otoliths	RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY												RATIONALE: Sequential analysis of otolith oxygen isotope (delta O-18(oto)) values was performed by classical mechanical microdrilling and dual inlet mass spectrometry to infer the timing of growth checks in pike (Esox lucius) scales from Lake Annecy (France). It indicated that the first check on scales occurs before the first winter of life of the fish. METHODS: Eleven fish caught in February and June 2008 were studied. Intra-individual isotopic profiles exhibit cyclic variations that are consistent with that of modeled delta O-18(oto) values using variations in epilimnion temperature and otolith-specific isotope fractionation equations. The positions of growth checks on scales were compared with the periodic variations of delta O-18(oto) values on otolith radii using an allometric relationship. RESULTS: All individuals presented at least one check deposited before the first winter. Deposition of some checks might be linked to a shift in fish diet or habitat or to catch-and-release induced stress. CONCLUSIONS: Although coupling between sequential analysis of delta O-18(oto) values and observation of scale growth features has been shown to be useful, there are limitations in the methodology, especially for the growth-attenuated region of otoliths associated with older ages.

Late Pleistocene and Holocene sea-level change and coastal paleoenvironment evolution along the Iranian Caspian shore	MARINE GEOLOGY												The level of the Caspian Sea is influenced by rivers mostly from the high latitudes of the Northern hemisphere and therefore any change of its catchments including temperature and precipitation directly reflects on Caspian Sea-level. We reconstructed Late Pleistocene to Holocene Caspian Sea-level by a multi-disciplinary approach from a 27.7 m long core in the SE corner of the Iranian Caspian coast in the Gomishan Lagoon. Late Pleistocene deposits containing typical Pleistocene fauna and dated around 20,120 cal yr BP bordered with a major hiatus indicating sea-level fall. Lagoonal deposits with shells dated at around 10,590 cal yr BP suggest that, after this deep lowstand, an initial transgression started, leading to landward advance of barrier-lagoon systems which still continued without any lowstand until 8400 cal yr BP. This corresponded to a biofacies change from lagoonal to the deeper biofacies including diatom and Gastropoda species. Around 8400 cal yr BP sea-level started to fall again, and reddish oxidized sediments with abundant foraminifera (Ammonia beccarii) record a regressive phase around 7700 cal yr BP. The mid-Holocene between 15.7 and 4.9 depths is characterized by a shallow marine environment mostly with high carbonate and gypsum contents, and lagoonal and highstand tract with no subaerial fades. The upper part of the core above a 4.9 m depth reflects at least five Late Holocene Caspian Sea-level cycles from 3260 cal yr BP onward. The Caspian Sea-levels are influenced both by global and regional events. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The results of determinations of general parameters, biogenic substance concentrations and mineralisation indices also showed small but yet clear differences in the chemistry of the lakes under analysis, which was connected with different anthropogenic pressure on respective ecosystems and limitation of the water flow through consecutive lakes down the drainage basin. It was showed that the occurrence of low water saturation by O-2 in the body of water of the lakes under analysis was connected with progressive dystrophication of the analysed ecosystems, being manifested as exuberant growth of rush vegetation and, first of all, floating plants.																			1898-6188	2084-4530					2013	20	1					7	20		10.2428/ecea.2013.20(01)001	http://dx.doi.org/10.2428/ecea.2013.20(01)001													WOS:000420361200001
J	Vadadi-Fülöp, C; Hufnagel, L				Vadadi-Fueloep, Csaba; Hufnagel, Levente			Climate change and plankton phenology in freshwater: current trends and future commitments	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												A solid body of empirical, experimental and theoretical evidence accumulated over recent years indicated that freshwater plankton experienced advance in phenology in response to climate change. Despite rapidly growing evidence for phenological changes, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of how climate change alters plankton phenology in freshwater. To overcome current limitations, we need to shed some light on trends and constraints in current research. The goal of this study is to identify current trends and gaps based on analysis of selected papers, by the help of which we can facilitate further advance in the field. We searched the literature for plankton phenology and confined our search to studies where climate change has been proposed to alter plankton phenology and rates of changes were quantified. We did not restrict our search for empirical contributions; experimental and theoretical studies were considered as well. In the following we discuss the spatio-temporal setting of selected studies, contributions of different taxonomic groups, emerging methodological constraints, measures of phenological trends; and finally give a list of recommendations on how to improve our understanding in the field. The majority of studies were confined to deep lakes with a skewed geographical distribution toward Central Europe, where scientists have long been engaged in limnology. Despite these findings, recent studies suggest that plankton in running waters may experience change in phenology with similar magnitude. Average rate of advancement in phenology of freshwater plankton exceeded those of the marine plankton and the global average. Increasing study duration was not coupled either with increasing contribution of discontinuous data or with increasing rates of phenological changes. Future studies may benefit from i) delivering long-term data across scientific and political boundaries; ii) extending study sites to broader geographical areas with a more explicit consideration of running waters; iii) applying plankton functional groups; iv) increasing the application of satellite data to quantify phytoplankton bloom phenology; v) extending analyses of time series beyond the spring period; vi) using various metrics to quantify variation in phenology; vii) combining empirical, experimental and theoretical approaches; and last but not least viii) paying more attention to emergence dynamics, nonresponding species and trophic mismatch.

The Mann-Kendall tests and the Sen's method were applied to determine the statistical significance and the rates of change of the maximum air and water temperatures. The results show that the average annual LWST cycles of Lake Titicaca fluctuate between 12.3 degrees C (August) and 13.8 degrees C (April) in region A (Major Lake), and between 10.6 degrees C (July) and 14.8 degrees C (November) in region B (Minor Lake). In addition, there is a general increasing trend of the average LWST during the coldest time (winter) of the year, with more intense warming effects in some shallow areas and in coastal areas. In Major Lake, the significant increasing trend of daytime and nighttime LWST was maintained at a rate of 0.30 [0.14, 0.401 degrees C/decade and 0.34 [0.18, 0.451 degrees C/decade respectively. Also, the maximum local air temperature trend during the austral winter (JJA) shows a significant increasing trend of 0.52 [0.16, 0.871 degrees C/decade between 1983 and 2013. This fact could be responsible for the change in trend in the surface temperature of Lake Titicaca.

Aerial photocounts showed that numbers at both lakes fluctuated in parallel, from a total of similar to3.56 million in 1997, then crashing to 1.60 million in 1998. The decline was coincident with a major El Nino, during which hundreds of thousands starved in the Gulf of California. The population rebounded to 3.27 million by 2000, illustrating the species' potentially high survivorship throughout the year. Catastrophic events are evidently the major factors affecting proximate changes in population size. Factors that set the ultimate limit to the population can be clarified through long-term studies at staging areas.																			0004-8038					OCT	2002	119	4					1162	1166		10.1642/0004-8038(2002)119[1162:MCARRP]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1642/0004-8038(2002)119[1162:MCARRP]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000180649200028

The abundance of three genera Bosmina, Daphnia and Ceriodaphnia of the total pool of ephippia was significantly related to the total abundance of the same taxa in the pelagic zone. However, in most lakes the abundance of Ceriodaphnia was higher in the sediment than in the water, which may be attributed to the overall preference by this genus for the littoral habitat. Using contemporary data from 27 Danish lakes sampled fortnightly during summer for 10 years, we found substantial inter-annual variations in the abundance of Daphnia spp., Ceriodaphnia spp., B. longirostris and B. coregoni. Yet, the sediment record mimicked the medium level well for most of the lakes, which suggests that the sediment record provides an integrated picture of the pelagic cladoceran community, which otherwise can be obtained only by long-term frequent contemporary sampling for several years. The contribution of Daphnia to the sum of Daphnia and Bosmina ephippia was negatively correlated with the abundance of fish expressed as catch per night in multi-mesh sized gill nets (CPUE). Yet, region-specific differences occurred, which partly could be eliminated by including nutrient state expressed as total phosphorus (TP) in a multiple regression. The average ratio of ephippia to the sum of ephippia and carapaces of Bosmina varied 40-fold between the sampling regions and was significantly negatively related to summer mean air temperature, and for Danish lakes also, albeit weakly, to fish CPUE but not to chlorophyll a. Apparently, temperature is the most important factor determining the ratio of parthenogenetic to ephippia producing specimens of Bosmina. We conclude that the sediment record of cladocerans is a useful indicator of community structure of pelagic cladocerans and the abundance of fish and temperature.

These interactions are controlled by river morphology and by transient hydraulic gradients between river and surrounding groundwater. Here we document the existence of spatiotemporal variations in groundwater-surface water interactions in the bed of the Lower Jordan River through pore water analysis of shallow sediment cores using major ions (Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl-, Br-, SO42-) and stable isotopes (delta O-18, delta H-2). Our results demonstrate that temporal variations are neither spatially uniform nor steady. Upwelling of groundwater is seasonally dependent and forced by a winter pulse of groundwater recharge and by estival low river discharge.

Autotrophic energy sources for Paracheirodon axelrodi (Osteichthyes, Characidae) in the middle Negro River, Central Amazon, Brazil	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The cardinal tetra (Paracheirodon axelrodi) is the most abundant species of the Brazilian ornamental fish trade, constituting more than 80% of the ornamental fish collected in the middle Negro River basin. Stable isotope analyses were used to identify the autotrophic carbon sources and trophic position for the cardinal in relation to the plant groups at the base of its foodchain. Filamentous algae, tree and plant leaves and cardinals were collected in stream habitats, flooded forest and interfluvial swamps (campos) during peak flood, falling water and low water periods. delta N-15 values of the cardinal in relation to the plants at the base of the food chain indicated a trophic position of omnivore. Values of delta C-13 for the plants ranged from -43.1 to -26.4 parts per thousand, with averages of -37.6, -30.4, and -29.4 parts per thousand for filamentous algae, flooded forest leaves, and campo leaves, respectively. The delta C-13 values for the cardinal ranged from -35.0 to -27.9 parts per thousand, with an average of -31.4 parts per thousand. Relative contributions of plants to fish carbon were estimated in a two end-member mixing model which determined that the leaves (flooded forest and campo leaves combined) and filamentous algae had average relative contributions to cardinal carbon of 71% and 29%, respectively. However, seasonal variation in the relative contributions was encountered throughout the hydrological cycle. The cardinals least enriched in C-13 were encountered in November during the falling water period, indicating that they had perhaps recently migrated down from interfluvial campos where filamentous algae production is significant. Considering that algal production has been reported to be less than 1% of total primary production in the Negro River, these results could suggest some evidence of selective herbivory in the cardinal's food chain.					forsberg, bruce/AAE-4092-2020	forsberg, bruce/0000-0001-7606-0585													0018-8158					JAN	2008	596						95	103		10.1007/s10750-007-9060-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-9060-y													WOS:000251729800009

The sedimentary sequence, which covers the Late Pleistocene and Holocene, is marked in its Late Pleistocene section by well-developed black and grey/brownish laminae, which promptly disappear under oxidising conditions. Studies of granulometry, major elements, carbonate and organic matter content, and magnetic parameters, were conducted at laminae scale. In non-magnetic parameters, only sulphur clearly changes between black and grey/brownish laminae. Magnetic parameters indicate the presence of high contents of iron sulphide (greigite) in black laminae, while low contents of iron oxide (magnetite) are detected in grey/brownish laminae. The lamination is due to early diagenesis in sediment just below the sea bed, related to the oxygenation state of the bottom water. Under poorly oxygenated conditions, greigite is formed in anoxic sediment, with increased oxygenation, detrital magnetite is preserved. Broadly similar processes were described from the Southern Caspian Sea basin. During the Late Pleistocene, both basins were subjected to the same, rhythmic ventilation of bottom waters. Efficient ventilation is most probably related to the harshness of the winter (cold/mild winters) and thus production of more or less cold, dense descending waters, and the content of fresh water supply from the catchment area. These two processes can act annually, as well as on a longer time scale. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

THE DESCRIPTIVE LIMNOLOGY OF HAMILTON HARBOR	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The physical and chemical features of Hamilton Harbor (Lake Ontario, Canada) from 1975-1977 are described. The Harbor is basically dimictic with winter ice cover, but periods of partial overturn occur at all times during the year. Thermal structures are complex and the depth to the maximum temperature change fluctuates rapidly over a wide range. Nutrient loadings are very high (P: 10.5 g m-2 .cntdot. yr-1, N:320 g m-2 .cntdot. yr-1) and continuous. Exchange with Lake Ontario dominates the hydraulic balance. Dissolved O2 [DO] depletion occurred rapidly in hypolimnetic waters after stratification. The high rates of DO depletion (3-5 mg .cntdot. 1-1 mo.-1) were associated with the decomposition of the dissolved organic C in the water column. Vertical fluxes of O2 (atmospheric invasion) were high but high O2 demands and rapid vertical exchange (even under stratified conditions) ensured that the epilimnion was often undersaturated. Soluble reactive P [SRP] concentrations in surface waters ranged from 10-50 .mu.g l-1 and showed irregular fluctuations due to high inputs and periodic overturns. SRP was not correlated with algal biomass. Nitrate concentrations averaged 2 mg l-1 and showed little fluctuation. Rapid nitrification of NH3 occurred in June and July. Soluble silica concentrations may have been limiting for diatom growth on 1 or 2 occasions. Total P concentrations ranged from 40-340 .mu.g l-1 and the Harbor was optically deep with vertical attenuation coefficients of photosynthetically active irradiance ranging from 0.8-2.1 m-1. The summer algal biomass (as chlorophyll a) ranged from 20-70 mg m-3, values well below those predicted by the loadings of total P or the concentration of total P in the water. Perturbation of the physical regime in the Harbor by both internal motions and by events in Lake Ontario suppressed algal growth in this optically deep body of water. In Hamilton Harbor the classical relationships between P loadings and algal biomass do not apply.																			0003-9136						1980	88	3					303	327																WOS:A1980JU85700002

In China, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has substantial lithium resources, and the Bangor Co Salt Lake is a typical Li-rich carbonate salt lake in northern Tibet. Research into the lithium source of the lake is of great significance for future sustainable industrial development. This article selects the Bangor Co Salt Lake recharge water system (river and cold spring water) and brine samples as the research objects, conducts hydrochemical composition and isotope testing of the water body, and determines the anions, cations, and B isotopes of the samples. This article uses the Piper three-line diagram, Gibbs diagram, and ion ratio relationship to study the hydrochemical characteristics and major ion sources of recharge water systems and salt lakes. The results indicate that the hydrochemical type has transitioned from the strong carbonate type to the moderate carbonate type from the recharge area to the lake area. The major source of ions in lakes is the weathering products of carbonate rocks, followed by evaporite and silicate solutes. The enrichment of lithium in salt lakes is mainly related to the contribution of rivers, followed by geothermal-related cold springs, and early sedimentary carbonate minerals may also make potential contributions. These findings provide a scientific basis for the mechanism of lithium enrichment, as well as for the further development and evaluation of lithium resources.					he, maoyong/ADO-7723-2022; LI, ZHENGYAN/KCY-9486-2024	li, bin kai/0000-0002-5352-2457; he, maoyong/0000-0002-9545-5037														2071-1050				DEC	2023	15	23							16235	10.3390/su152316235	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su152316235													WOS:001116884000001
J	Grismer, ME				Grismer, M. E.			Soil disturbance/restoration effects on stream sediment loading in the Tahoe Basin-detection monitoring	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Quantifying the relative impacts of soil restoration or disturbance on watershed daily sediment and nutrients loads is essential towards assessing the actual costs/benefits of the land management. Such quantification requires stream monitoring programs capable of detecting changes in land-use or soil functional and erosive area "connectivity" conditions across the watershed. Previously, use of a local-scale, field-data based runoff and erosion model for three Lake Tahoe west-shore watersheds as a detection monitoring "proof of concept" suggested that analyses of midrange average daily flows can reveal sediment load reductions of relatively small watershed fractional areas (similar to 5 %) of restored soil function within a few years of treatment. Developing such an effective stream monitoring program is considered for tributaries on the west shore of the Lake Tahoe Basin using continuous (15-min) stream monitoring information from Ward (2,521 ha), Blackwood (2,886 ha), and the Homewood (260 ha, HMR) Creek watersheds. The continuous total suspended sediment (TSS) and discharge monitoring confirmed the hysteretic TSS concentration-flowrate relationship associated with the daily and seasonal spring snowmelt hydrographs at all three creeks. Using the complete dataset, daily loads estimated from 1-h sampling periods during the day indicated that the optimal sampling hours were in the afternoon during the rising limb of the spring snowmelt hydrograph, an observation likely to apply across the Sierra Nevada and other snowmelt driven watersheds. Measured rising limb sediment loads were used to determine if soils restoration efforts (e.g., dirt road removal, ski run rehabilitation) at the HMR creek watershed reduced sediment loads between 2010 and 2011. A nearly 1.5-fold decrease in sediment yields (kg/ha per m(3)/s flow) was found suggesting that this focused monitoring approach may be useful towards development of TMDL "crediting" tools.

Summer Diel Diet and Feeding Periodicity of Four Species of Cyprinids in the Salmon River, New York	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												The diel diet composition and feeding periodicity of Luxilus cornutus (common shiner), Exoglossum maxillingua (cutlip minnow), Semotilus corporalis (fallfish), and Notropis hudsonius (spottail shiner) were examined in the Salmon River, New York over a 24 h period during the summer. Chironomids were the major prey of common shiner (60.6%) and cutlip minnow (54.7%), whereas terrestrial invertebrates (30.0%) and amphipods (38.4%) were the primary food of fallfish and spottail shiner, respectively. Diet overlap was high between common shiner and cutlip minnow (Morisita's index = 0.88) and moderate between fallfish and common shiner (0.54) and fallfish and cutlip minnow (0.50). Diel temperal variation in diet composition was greatest (0.64) for spottail shiner. Three species exhibited diel variation in food consumption. Fallfish had a distinct feeding peak, whereas peak food consumption of common shiner and cutlip minnow occurred over a more extended period. Spottail shiner did not have a distinct feeding peak but food consumption was highest from 2400 to 0800 h. Each of the four species exhibited some degree of variation in their diel feeding ecology in regards to either diet composition or food consumption.																			0003-0031	1938-4238				APR	2015	173	2					326	334		10.1674/amid-173-02-326-334.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1674/amid-173-02-326-334.1													WOS:000353211400013

The vegetation of the western hills is a modification of the surrounding forests and includes Picea albertiana, Pinus banksiana and Populus spp. The Arceuthobium is parasitic on the pine, principally on the dry hill tops with maximum exposure to the sun. The spread of the mistletoe is slow, although its seeds may travel 11 yards when expelled. The [female] plants have a more marked effect upon the host than the [male], and the infested pine branches retain their leaves for a longer time. Only in cases of very severe infection is there a decrease in the growth rate of the wood. The aerial portions of Arceuthobium are perennial. The flowers are pollinated in May, the fruits maturing in Sept. of the 2nd summer and the seed germinating on the pine twigs in June of the 3rd summer.																			0022-0477	1365-2745					1929	17						82	105		10.2307/2255914	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2255914													WOS:000200121300003

An Impact of Cobalt on Freshwater Phytoplankton in Warming Polar Regions?	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Polar freshwater ecosystems are sensitive to climate change, facing increasing temperatures and its consequences such as glacier retreat. Phosphorus and/or fixed nitrogen are widely expected to limit primary production in most freshwater environments, however the role of micronutrients is largely un-characterized. We measured dissolved nitrate and nitrite, phosphate, cobalt, iron, manganese and zinc in a selection of Greenland and Antarctic lakes, and report the first evaluation of cobalt regulating phytoplankton growth in these systems using bioassay incubations. Results showed cobalt potentially co-limited phytoplankton in three of the eight sites tested. A time-series of dissolved cobalt measured in Kobbefjord (southwest Greenland) runoff corroborated low cobalt availability during summer. This was in contrast to manganese and iron which remained at high concentrations throughout summer. We hypothesize that high manganese:cobalt and/or zinc:cobalt ratios in runoff, may impede cellular cobalt acquisition, meaning cobalt co-limitation of primary production is plausible in many polar freshwater environments.					; Hopwood, Mark/E-2187-2019; Mestre, Mireia/R-7145-2018; Achterberg, Eric/C-5820-2009; Höfer, Juan/MSX-7977-2025; Browning, Thomas/B-8451-2019	Zhu, Kechen/0000-0002-1801-3593; Hofer, Juan/0000-0002-5887-4929; Hopwood, Mark/0000-0002-9743-079X; Mestre, Mireia/0000-0003-0986-633X; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				DEC 16	2024	51	23							e2024GL110065	10.1029/2024GL110065	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024GL110065													WOS:001370235800001

Water Collection from Air Humidity in Bahrain	WORLD RENEWABLE ENERGY CONGRESS-17 (WREC)	E3S Web of Conferences				17th World Renewable Energy Congress (WREC)	DEC 04-08, 2016	Univ Bahrain, Manama, BAHRAIN		Univ Bahrain			The Kingdom of Bahrain falls geographically in one of the driest regions in the world. Conventional fresh surface watcr bodies, such as rivers and lakes, arc nonexistent and for watcr consumption, Bahrain prominently relies on the desalination of sea water. This paper presents an ongoing project that is being pursued by a group of student and their advising professors to investigate the viability of extracting water from air humidity. Dehumidifiers have been utilized as water extraction devices. Those devices have been distributed on six areas that were selected based on a rigorous geospatial modeling of historical meteorological data. The areas fall in residential and industrial neighborhoods that are located in the main island and the island of Muharraq. Water samples have been collected three times every week since May of 2016 and the collection process will continue until May of 2017. The collected water samples have been analyzed against numerous variables individually and in combinations including: amount of water collected per hour versus geographical location, amount of water collected per hour versus meteorological factors, suitability of collected watcr for potable human consumption, detection of air pollution in the areas of collection and the economy of this method of water collection in comparison to other nonconventional methods. An overview of the completed analysis results is presented in this paper.																			2267-1242						2017	23								03001	10.1051/e3sconf/20172303001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/20172303001													WOS:000461098300011

Holocene vegetation and climate change from a lake sediment record in the Tengger Sandy Desert, northwest China	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												We present lithology and fossil pollen data from a 384 cm sediment section from Qingtu paleolake in arid northwest China and discuss their environmental interpretations. The chronology was controlled by four accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dates on peat and bulk lake sediments. Lithology changes suggest a general sequence of local environment shifts from a non-lake environment before 7200 cal yr BP, through a shallow lake during 7200-3500 cal yr BP and a marsh during 3500-3000 cal yr BP, to a sandy desert after 3000 cal yr BP. Fossil pollen assemblages suggest a steppe desert during 7200-5200 cal yr BP, a period of rapid switches between upland and lowland pollen types from 5200 to 3000 cal yr BP, and a desert since 3000 cal yr BP. Both lithology and pollen data indicate that in a generally arid context, climate was extremely dry in the early Holocene, relatively wet at 7200-5200 cal yr BP, highly variable during 5200-3000 cal yr BP, and dry again after 3000 cal yr BP. The climate change around Qingtu Lake was likely controlled by the interplay of the East Asian summer monsoon, the mid-latitude westerlies and local topography around the Tibetan Plateau.

Mid-late Holocene evolutionary history and climate reconstruction of Vellayani lake, south India	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The lake sediments received wide attention for archiving paleoclimate and paleo sea-level variability during the late Quaternary period. It has also been extensively used to disentangle the interrelationships existing among the regional and the global climate systems. In the present study, the applicability of lake sediments has been the major impetus to delineate the mid-late Holocene climate and sea level variability using a similar to 10 m sediment core retrieved from a protected freshwater lake-the Vellayani lake, southern Kerala, southwest India. The sediment core was investigated using multiproxy approach and was chronologically supported by AMS radiocarbon dates. The results show monsoon intensification and a high sea level during 6430-4390 cal yr BP led to the formation of a coastal lagoon system in the area. Climatically, a marginal reduction in monsoon during 4390-2600 cal yr BP interspersed by an intensified phase during 3800-2600 cal yr BP was observed while concurrently, a sea regression during 4390-2600 cal yr BP restricted sea water influence in the study area. Proxies indicated a significant monsoon reduction during 2600-1000 cal yr BP followed by monsoon intensification post-1000 cal yr BP. After 2600 cal yr BP, a thick pile of alluvial sediments was deposited by the Karamana River which might have hindered the tidal influence and later the basin was transformed into a freshwater lake. The present lake configuration was attained after 440 cal yr BP. Further, comparison of paleoclimate reconstructed from the present study with the global records revealed a teleconnection of Indian monsoon with the global climate system.					; Banerji, Upasana Swaroop/AAX-5015-2020; Banerji, Upasana/AAX-5015-2020	DABHI, ANKUR/0000-0003-4738-0226; , Dr. Maya K./0009-0002-3109-7776; Bhushan, Ravi/0000-0003-1347-5446; Banerji, Upasana Swaroop/0000-0001-5536-1442; 													1040-6182	1873-4553				OCT 20	2021	599				SI		72	94		10.1016/j.quaint.2021.03.018	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2021.03.018		JUL 2021											WOS:000674601600003

A mathematical model of dissolved oxygen transport during the thermal bar evolution	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-MATEMATIKA I MEKHANIKA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS AND MECHANICS												The article describes. 2.5D non-hydrostatic model of dissolved oxygen transport in a freshwater lake. The oxygen dynamics are carried out through oxygen exchange with the atmosphere and physical transfer due to the effect of the thermal bar. An intraday change in wind speed (that influences the rate of oxygen transition from gas to liquid) is taken into account at the air-water interface. Space-time distributions of temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration were obtained during the spring thermal bar on an example of Barguzin Bay of Lake Baikal. The results of simulation showed that the vertical flows generated by the spring thermal bar contributed to an increase in dissolved oxygen content in the thermoactive region of the bay. Due to the action of the thermal bar, areas with different levels of oxygen are formed in the body of water. There is not only a quantitative but also a qualitative difference between the oxygen distributions obtained for the thermoactive and the thermoinert regions. It has been also found that the wind speed and the wind duration affect the oxygen saturation of water at the thermal bar. The results of this study confirm the barrier function of the thermal bar.

An assessment of the ecological and toxicological state of wastewaters and contaminated areas was carried out. Methods for their purification are proposed aimed at their further use and obtainment of environmentally safe agricultural products. An area of about 0.5 ha, next to the rural community of Syunik in southern Armenia, has been polluted for many years by mining sludges from the nearest mine watertight cofferdam of the Zangezur copper-molybdenum combine. Activities have been carried out to clean up the soil in this area. After plowing, soil improvers (zeolite, bentonite, and manure) were introduced into the soil. On-site treatments, soil tillage, and the introduction of soil improvers into the soil was implemented in late autumn. Soil and plant samples were taken to determine the content of heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, Co, Mo, Ni). In the following spring, the area was planted with potatoes, eggplant, and peas. A rather high yield was obtained. Analysis of plant samples showed that the content of heavy metals does not exceed the permissible level of the international food safety standard. At the same time, soil studies were carried out in the adjacent areas of the Sotk mine, located to the southeast of Lake Sevan. It was revealed that due to the increase in the volume of the mining industry and the amount of rock dumps, the organoleptic and chemical indicators of the waters of the Sotk and Masrik rivers deteriorated. Compared to the previous decade, the amounts of suspended particles per 1 L of water have increased by 210 horizontal ellipsis 317.0%, in the waters of Sotk-by 32.1 mg/L, and in the waters of Masrik-by 13.2 mg/L. The same tendency is observed regarding the amounts of nitrates, sulfates, and hydrogen index, which is mainly due to the chemical composition of rocks. They contain a large amount of Ca, K, Na, Mg, etc. This trend is especially noticeable along the rivers, where intensive agriculture, primarily livestock farming is carried out. The material of the work solves a complex of environmental and economic problems. It is aimed at ensuring environmental safety, improving the ecological and resource properties of soils, increasing the productivity of cultural phytocenoses and the sanitary and hygienic quality of food products.					; Sayadyan, Hovik/JCE-0633-2023; Larionov, Maxim/N-8885-2016	Sayadyan, Hovik/0000-0003-1703-3098; Larionov, Maxim/0000-0003-0834-2462														2075-1729				FEB	2023	13	2							394	10.3390/life13020394	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/life13020394								36836751					WOS:000941104100001

J	Straile, D				Straile, D			North Atlantic Oscillation synchronizes food-web interactions in central European lakes	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												A regular and distinct feature of seasonal plankton succession in temperate lakes is the early summer period of algal suppression by herbivores, i.e. the clearwater phase. Within the last 30 years the timing of this food-web interaction between algae and herbivores has advanced on average by approximately two weeks in central European lakes due to faster population growth of herbivores in warmer water. Trend and interannual variability in clearwater timing were strongly related to the climate dynamics of the North Atlantic, i.e. the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Due to its large-scale effects, the NAO synchronized plankton succession in central European lakes, causing a striking temporal coherence of a food-web interaction over several hundreds of kilometres.

In the extension of the Gulf of Aden, the opening of the Gulf of Tadjourah in the last 30 million years was followed by the establishment of parallel NW-SE oriented depressions (Gobaad, Hanle, Gaggade, AssalGhoubbet). This region is characterised by high heat flow, complex volcanic and tectonic activity, and a dense network of faults favorable to the development of hydrothermal activities. A field survey was conducted to study the gas composition and origin in thermal springs and fumaroles along a transect running from the Lake Abbhe & PRIME; to Djibouti. Hydrogen traces were detected at fumaroles and hot springs associated with hydrothermal systems at the edges of the Gobaad, Hanle & PRIME;, Gaggade, Assal-Ghoubbet and Arta area. The processes governing to the origin of H2 and its consumption at different levels of the magmatic-hydrothermal systems are discussed. H2 is interpreted as related to several processes including, chemical equilibrium in magmatic gases, alteration of FeII-rich rocks, and oxidation of volcanic H2S. Methane associated with the hydrogen has mostly an abiotic origin and could result from the reaction of hydrogen with carbon oxides. Also, helium emanations have been observed notably on the sides of the Lake Abbhe & PRIME; in boiling hot springs. Gas samples have shown R/RA isotopic ratios of helium up to 10, which is are characteristic values for helium of mantle origin characterized an 3He enrichment with respect to air values.

J	Hill, JM; Renfrew, RB				Hill, Jason M.; Renfrew, Rosalind B.			Migratory patterns and connectivity of two North American grassland bird species	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Effective management and conservation of migratory bird populations require knowledge and incorporation of their movement patterns and space use throughout the annual cycle. To investigate the little-known migratory patterns of two grassland bird species, we deployed 180 light-level geolocators on Grasshopper Sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) and 29 Argos-GPS tags on Eastern Meadowlarks (Sturnella magna) at Konza Prairie, Kansas, USA, and six US Department of Defense (DoD) installations distributed across the species' breeding ranges. We analyzed location data from 34 light-level geolocators and five Argos-GPS tags attached for 1 year to Grasshopper Sparrows and Eastern Meadowlarks, respectively. Grasshopper Sparrows were present on the breeding grounds from mid-April through early October, substantially longer than previously estimated, and migrated on average 2,500 km over 30 days. Grasshopper Sparrows exhibited strong migratory connectivity only at a continental scale. The North American Great Lakes region likely serves as a migratory divide for Midwest and East Coast Grasshopper Sparrows; Midwest populations (Kansas, Wisconsin, and North Dakota; n = 13) largely wintered in Texas or Mexico, whereas East Coast populations (Maryland and Massachusetts, n = 20) wintered in the northern Caribbean or Florida. Our data from Eastern Meadowlarks provided evidence for a diversity of stationary and short- and long-distance migration strategies. By providing the most extensive examination of the nonbreeding movement ecology for these two North American grassland bird species to date, we refine information gaps and provide key insight for their management and conservation.

James; Nakai, Sento; Yamaguchi, Satoru			Factors Affecting the Inland and Orographic Enhancement of Sea-Effect Snowfall in the Hokuriku Region of Japan	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												The Hokuriku region along the west coast of the Japanese island of Honshu receives exceptionally heavy snowfall accumulations, exceeding 500 cm from December to February near sea level and 1300 cm at high elevation sites, much of which is produced by sea-effect systems. Though the climatological enhancement of snowfall is large, the lowland-upland snowfall distribution within individual storms is highly variable, presenting a challenge for weather forecasting and climate projections. Utilizing data from a C-band surveillance radar, the ERA5 reanalysis, and surface precipitation observations, we examine factors affecting the inland and orographic enhancement during sea-effect periods in the Hokuriku region during nine winters (December-February) from December 2007 to February 2016. The distribution and intensity of precipitation exhibits strong dependence on flow direction due to three-dimensional terrain effects. For a given flow direction, higher values of boundary layer wind speed and sea-induced CAPE favor higher precipitation rates, a maximum displaced farther inland and higher in elevation, and a larger ratio of upland to lowland precipitation. These characteristics are also well represented by the nondimensional mountain height H<^>, with H<^><1 associated with a precipitation maximum over the high elevations and a larger ratio of upland to lowland precipitation, and H<^>>1 having the opposite effect. Nevertheless, even in high enhancement periods, precipitation rates decline as one moves inland from the first major mountain barrier, even over high terrain. These results highlight how the interplay between sea-effect and orographic processes modulates the distribution and intensity of precipitation in an area of complex and formidable topography.

One point of focus was the species lineage of the melanopsid gastropod Microcolpia parreyssii, which exhibited a tremendous diversity of shapes during the earlier Holocene. As a consequence many new species, subspecies, and variety-names have been introduced over time, trying to categorize this overwhelming variability. In contrast to the varied subfossil assemblage, only a single phenotype is present today. We critically review the apparent "speciation event" implied by the taxonomy, based on the presently available information and new data from morphometric analyses of shell outlines and oxygen and carbon isotope data. This synthesis shows that one turning point in morphological evolution coincides with high accumulation of peaty deposits during a short time interval of maximally a few thousand years. The formation of a small, highly eutrophic swamp with increased input of organic matter marginalized the melanopsids and reduced population size. The presented data make natural selection as the dominating force unlikely but rather indicates genetic drift following a bottleneck effect induced by the environmental changes. This claim contrasts the "obvious trend" and shows that great morphological variability has to be carefully and objectively evaluated in order to allow sound interpretations of the underlying mechanisms.

To examine this hypothesis, fish (upper water column species - glassfish, Ambassis vachellii; river mullet, Chelon subviridis; diamond scale mullet, Ellochelon vaigiensis; and ponyfish, Leiognathus equulus; and lower water bottom dwelling species - whiting Sillago analis) were caught in an artificial tidal lake in tropical north Queensland (Australia), and transported to a laboratory tank to acclimate (3wks). After acclimation, fish (between 10 and 17 individuals each time) were transferred to a temperature ramping experimental tank, where a thermoline increased (2.5 degrees C/hr; which is the average summer water temperature increasing rate measured in the urban lakes) tank water temperature to establish threshold points where each fish species lost equilibrium (defined here as Acute Effect Temperature; AET). The coolest AET among all species was 33.1 degrees C (S. analis), while the highest was 39.9 degrees C (A. vachellii). High frequency loggers were deployed (November and March representing Austral summer) in the same urban lake where fish were sourced, to measure continuous (20min) surface (0.15 m) and bottom (0.1 m) temperature to derive thermal frequency curves to examine how often lake temperatures exceed AET thresholds. For most fish species examined, water temperature that could be lethal were exceeded at the surface, but rarely, if ever, at the bottom waters suggesting deep, cooler, water provides thermal refugia for fish. An energy-balance model was used to estimate daily mean lake water temperature with good accuracy (+/- 1 degrees C; R-2 = 0.91, modelled vs lake measured temperature). The model was used to predict climate change effects on lake water temperature, and the exceedance of thermal threshold change. A 2.3 degrees C climate warming (based on 2100 local climate prediction) raised lake water temperature by 1.3 degrees C. However, small as this increase might seem, it led to a doubling of time that water temperatures were in excess of AET thresholds at the surface, but also the bottom waters that presently provide thermal refugia for fish.

J	Andersen, T; Andersen, FO				Andersen, T; Andersen, FO			Effects of CO2 concentration on growth of filamentous algae and Littorella uniflora in a Danish softwater lake	AQUATIC BOTANY												An experiment was conducted from May to November in Lake Hampen, Denmark, to study the effect of higher CO2 concentration on the biomass of filamentous algae. Three enclosures (1.5 m diameter) were enriched with free CO2 to similar to 10 times atmospheric equilibrium (similar to 170 mu M) and three enclosures were kept at atmospheric equilibrium (similar to 17 mu M). The isoetid Littorella uniflora dominated the vegetation in the enclosures. Low concentrations of nitrate and phosphate in the water were observed, especially in the summer months. During the summer, a high biomass of filamentous algae (dominated by Zygnema sp.) developed in both types of enclosures (18-58 g dry wt. m(-2) in July and August), but the biomass of algae was significantly higher (1.9-38 times) in the CO2 enriched enclosures than in enclosures with low CO2 concentration. L uniflora biomass, especially leaf biomass, also showed a significant positive response to increased CO2 concentration (75.0 +/- 10.4 and 133.3 +/- 42.5 g dry wt. m(-2) at low and high CO2 concentrations, respectively) even though the massive filamentous algal growth decreased the light intensity. Both filamentous algae (in August) and L. uniflora showed lower tissue concentrations of N and P at high CO2 concentration. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Kataoka, KS; Manville, V; Nakajo, T; Urabe, A				Kataoka, Kyoko S.; Manville, Vern; Nakajo, Takeshi; Urabe, Atsushi			Impacts of explosive volcanism on distal alluvial sedimentation: Examples from the Pliocene-Holocene volcaniclastic successions of Japan	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY					17th International Sedimentological Congress	AUG 27-SEP 01, 2006	Fukuoka, JAPAN					Volcanic activities can create cataclysmic hazards to surrounding environments and human life not only during the eruption but also by hydrologic remobilisation (lahar) processes after the cessation of eruptive activity. Although there are many studies dealing with the assessment and mitigation of volcanic hazards, these are mostly concentrated on primary eruptive processes in areas proximal to active volcanoes. However, the influence of volcaniclastic resedimentation may surpass the impacts of primary eruptive activity in terms of both extent and persistence, and can ultimately result in severe hazards in downstream areas. Examination of the volcaniclastic successions of non-marine Pliocene-Holocene sedimentary basins in Japan has revealed hydrological volcaniclastic sedimentation in fluvial and lacustrine environments hundreds of kilometres from the inferred source volcano. Impacts on these distal and often spatially separated basins included drastic changes in depositional systems caused by sudden massive in fluxes of remobilised pyroclastic material. Typical volcaniclastic beds comprise centimetre-to decimetre-thick primary pyroclastic fall deposits overlain by metre- to 10s of metres-thick resedimented volcaniclastic deposits, intercalated in sedimentary successions of non-volcanic provenance. The relatively low component of primary pyroclastic fall deposits in the volcaniclastic beds suggests that: 1) potential volcanic hazards would be underestimated on the basis of primary pyroclastic fall events alone; and 2) the majority of resedimented material was likely derived from erosion of non-welded pyroclastic flow deposits in catchment areas rather than remobilisation of local fallout deposits from surrounding hillslopes. The nature, distribution and sequence of facies developed by distal volcaniclastic sediments reflect the influence of: 1) proximity to ignimbrite, but not directly with the distance to the eruptive centre; 2) ignimbrite nature (non-welded or welded) and volume; 3) temporal changes in sediment flux from the source area; 4) the physiography and drainage patterns of the source area and the receiving basin, and any intervening areas; and 5) the formation of ephemeral dam-lakes and intra-caldera lakes whose potential catastrophic failure can impact distal areas. Models of the styles and timing of distal volcaniclastic resedimentation are thus more complicated than those developed for proximal settings of stratovolcanoes and their volcaniclastic aprons and hence present different challenges for hazard assessment and mitigation.

Nitrogen was applied annually as split applications, once each in the spring and summer. Four groves consisted of grapefruit grafted on rough lemon rootstock; the remaining groves were sweet orange cultivars grafted on rough lemon. Data on tree loss to blight were recorded at Babson Park annually between 1975, 1977, and 1980; and between 1975 and 1981 at Lake Garfield all years except 1978 and 1979. Annual tree loss, averaged over all years, at Babson Park was 9.5% for the combination N treatment and 7.8% for the Ca(NO3)(2) treatment. The data were significant at a P level of 0.1186. Tree loss at Lake Garfield averaged 5.6% in the combination treatment and 4.3% in the Ca(NO3)(2) treatment, with a P level of 0.1125. Between 1977 and 1981 soil pH in the Ca(NO3)(2) treatments of all six groves increased to between 6.5 and 7.1, but did not increase in the combination N treatments, remaining between 6.3 and 6.6. Soil pH measured to a depth of 60 cm also differed significantly between treatments. For a grove ata third location near Ocoee, FL. total fungi and Fusaria propagules were measured in soil treatments that received NH4NO3 (7.9 kg N tree(-1)), urea (17.0 kg N tree(-1)), and a water-only control. Fusaria were affected by N treatments and, in the NH4NO3 treatment, increased significantly compared to the water-only control as soon as one week after fertilization. These experiments suggest that the ammonium form of N may be contributing to development of citrus blight. Its involvement with Fusaria, the cause of root rot symptoms on blight-diseased trees, may be as a source of N for toxin production.																			0096-4522						1995	54						60	65																WOS:A1995TZ80200014

IN IRISH LAKES	BIOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT-PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL IRISH ACADEMY												Reports of feeding on host fish by juvenile sea lamprey have been known from a number of Irish freshwater lakes since the 1950s.This review confirms the continued presence of juvenile feeding sea lamprey in some these lakes, with additional recent records from other waters. Juvenile sea lamprey out-migrating in winter (January) had a modal peak of 160mm. In-lake feeding fish were recorded in many months of the season, between January and September, and ranged in size from 140 to 410mm. The majority of records were compiled in the May June period during the brown trout 'mayfly' angling season. Feeding juvenile fish were also recorded attached to pike and bream. Information compiled indicated a low rate of attachment on host fish. No records of spawning by 'dwarf' sea lamprey in streams discharging to the host lakes have been recorded to date.																			0791-7945	2009-003X					2018	118B	2					113	120		10.3318/BIOE.2018.09	http://dx.doi.org/10.3318/BIOE.2018.09													WOS:000447818100004

Testing the spatial and temporal framework of speciation in an ancient lake species flock: the leech genus Dina (Hirudinea: Erpobdellidae) in Lake Ohrid	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Ancient Lake Ohrid on the Balkan Peninsula is considered to be the oldest ancient lake in Europe with a suggested Plio-/Pleistocene age. Its exact geological age, however, remains unknown. Therefore, molecular clock data of Lake Ohrid biota may serve as an independent constraint of available geological data, and may thus help to refine age estimates. Such evolutionary data may also help unravel potential biotic and abiotic factors that promote speciation events. Here, mitochondrial sequencing data of one of the largest groups of endemic taxa in the Ohrid watershed, the leech genus Dina, is used to test whether it represents an ancient lake species flock, to study the role of potential horizontal and vertical barriers in the watershed for evolutionary events, to estimate the onset of diversification in this group based on molecular clock analyses, and to compare this data with data from other endemic species for providing an approximate time frame for the origin of Lake Ohrid. Based on the criteria speciosity, monophyly and endemicity, it can be concluded that Dina spp. from the Ohrid watershed, indeed, represents an ancient lake species flock. Lineage sorting of its species, however, does not seem to be complete and/or hybridization may occur. Analyses of population structures of Dina spp. in the Ohrid watershed indicate a horizontal zonation of haplotypes from spring and lake populations, corroborating the role of lake-side springs, particularly the southern feeder springs, for evolutionary processes in endemic Ohrid taxa. Vertical differentiation of lake taxa, however, appears to be limited, though differences between populations from the littoral and the profundal are apparent. Molecular clock analyses indicate that the most recent common ancestor of extant species of this flock is approximately 1.99 +/- 0.83 million years (Ma) old, whereas the split of the Ohrid Dina flock from a potential sister taxon outside the lake is estimated at 8.30 +/- 3.60 Ma. Comparisons with other groups of endemic Ohrid species indicated that in all cases, diversification within the watershed started <= 2 Ma ago. Thus, this estimate may provide information on a minimum age for the origin of Lake Ohrid. Maximum ages are less consistent and generally less reliable. But cautiously, a maximum age of 3 Ma is suggested. Interestingly, this time frame of approximately 2-3 Ma ago for the origin of Lake Ohrid, generated based on genetic data, well fits the time frame most often used in the literature by geologists.					; Stadler, Tanja/J-4742-2013; Wilke, Thomas/G-1517-2012	Wilke, Thomas/0000-0001-8263-7758; Schultheiss, Roland/0009-0006-6930-2922; Stadler, Tanja/0000-0001-6431-535X; 													1726-4170	1726-4189					2010	7	11					3387	3402		10.5194/bg-7-3387-2010	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-7-3387-2010													WOS:000284756300001

Phylogenetic Diversities and Community Structure of Members of the Extremely Halophilic Archaea (Order Halobacteriales) in Multiple Saline Sediment Habitats	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												We investigated the phylogenetic diversity and community structure of members of the halophilic Archaea (order Halobacteriales) in five distinct sediment habitats that experience various levels of salinity and salinity fluctuations (sediments from Great Salt Plains and Zodletone Spring in Oklahoma, mangrove tree sediments in Puerto Rico, sediment underneath salt heaps in a salt-processing plant, and sediments from the Great Salt Lake northern arm) using Halobacteriales-specific 16S rRNA gene primers. Extremely diverse Halobacteriales communities were encountered in all habitats, with 27 (Zodletone) to 37 (mangrove) different genera identified per sample, out of the currently described 38 Halobacteriales genera. With the exception of Zodletone Spring, where the prevalent geochemical conditions are extremely inhospitable to Halobacteriales survival, habitats with fluctuating salinity levels were more diverse than permanently saline habitats. Sequences affiliated with the recently described genera Halogranum, Halo lamina, Haloplanus, Halosarcina, and Halorientalis, in addition to the genera Halorubrum, Haloferax, and Halobacterium, were among the most abundant and ubiquitous genera, suggesting a wide distribution of these poorly studied genera in saline sediments. The Halobacteriales sediment communities analyzed in this study were more diverse than and completely distinct from communities from typical hypersaline water bodies. Finally, sequences unaffiliated with currently described genera represented a small fraction of the total Halobacteriales communities, ranging between 2.5% (Zodletone) to 7.0% (mangrove and Great Salt Lake). However, these novel sequences were characterized by remarkably high levels of alpha and beta diversities, suggesting the presence of an enormous, yet-untapped supply of novel Halobacteriales genera within the rare biosphere of various saline ecosystems.

However, the kinetics of serum magnesium (Mg) ions has not been well documented. We, therefore, evaluated biochemical changes in healthy donors during plateletpheresis procedure. Ten healthy donors underwent plateletpheresis on continuous cell separator (CS3000, Baxter, Round Lake, IL, USA) and 10 on intermittent flow cell separator (MCS 3p, Hemonetics, Braintree, MA, USA). Serum levels of total and ionized calcium (tCa and iCa, respectively) and Mg (tMg and iMg, respectively) were measured before, during and after the procedures. Although, the fall in tCa (from 2.62 +/- 0.12 to 2.36 +/- 0.12 mmol L-1) and modest and not significant; drop in iCa (frorn 1.33 +/- 0.1 to 0.84 +/- 0.1 mmol L-1) and iMg (from 0.53 +/- 0.01 to 0.35 +/- 0.1 mmol L-1) was statistically significant (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences observed between the CS3000 and MCS 3p cell separators regarding the fall in Ca and Mg. None of the donors experienced any adverse reactions during the procedures. In the study, an acute ionized hypocalcaemia and hypomagnesaemia have been observed after the plateletpheresis; therefore, measurement of both the ions may be monitored. However, there is no justification for prophylactic supplementation of either of these elements.

J	ZIMMERMAN, BS; LARSON, PB				ZIMMERMAN, BS; LARSON, PB			EPITHERMAL GOLD MINERALIZATION IN A FOSSIL HOT-SPRING SYSTEM, RED-BUTTE, OREGON	ECONOMIC GEOLOGY AND THE BULLETIN OF THE SOCIETY OF ECONOMIC GEOLOGISTS												The Red Butte gold prospect is a well-preserved, sediment-hosted, fossil hot spring system located within the Lake Owyhee volcanic field of eastern Oregon, 10 km west of the Owyhee Reservoir. Its features include siliceous hot spring sinter, a blanket of intense argillic alteration produced by surficial steam-heated waters, and a 50-m-wide hydrothermal eruption crater filled with bedded breccia deposits. Mineralization is hosted by north- and northwest-striking faults in volcaniclastic sediments of the Miocene Deer Butte Formation. Red Butte is capped by 10 m of syngenetic fluvial sedimentary rocks consisting of a basal silicified mudstone overlain by arkosic sandstones and conglomerates interbedded with siliceous hot spring sinter. The sediments at this paleosurface horizon have been cemented by hydrothermal quartz and adularia and form the resistant cap of the butte. A blanketlike zone of pervasive argillic alteration occurs at the base of the fluvial sediments. Numerous hydrothermal veins and breccias located within the lacustrine sedimentary rocks beneath the argillic blanket contain a telescoped mineral assemblage related spatially to the paleosurface. Quartz and adularia are the most abundant hydrothermal minerals in this zone along with minor pyrite, marcasite, electrum, bladed calcite, stellerite (Ca-4(Al8Si28O72)28H(2)O), illite-smectite, and smectite clays. The veins and argillic blanket are cut by a 50-m-wide hydrothermal eruption crater filed with bedded breccia deposits. The delta(18)O(SMOW) values for hydrothermal quartz and adularia range from 5.3 to 8.3 and 0.1 to 2.4 per mil, respectively. The delta(18)O(SMOW) and delta(13)C(PDB) values for calcite range from -3.6 to 8.9 and 8.9 to -5.2 per mil, respectively. These values are consistent with those of minerals from meteoric hydrothermal systems. A plot of delta(18)O versus delta(13)C values for calcite shows that HCO3- was the dominant aqueous carbon species. INAA analyses of altered sedimentary rocks and hydrothermal vein and breccia samples reveal the presence of anomalous concentrations of Au, Ag, As, Sb, Hg, and Mo. Q-mode factor analysis indicates that much of the variation in the geochemical data set can be explained in terms of five end-member components (factors) which reflect the composition and evolution of the hydrothermal fluid and the initial composition of the host rock. Elemental associations for these factors are (1) Au, K2O, Ag, FeO, Hg; (2) CaO, Mo, Hg, As; (3) FeO, Na2O, Hg, Sb; (4) K2O, Zn, Na2O, As; and (5) As, Mo, Sb, Ag. The abundance of adularia and stability of stellerite at Red Butte suggests that fluids reaching the surface had experienced a high degree of vapor separation due to boiling. Au mineralization occurred at the peak of hydrothermal activity in response both to boiling and mixing of the boiling hydrothermal fluid with surficial steam-heated waters.																			0361-0128					DEC	1994	89	8					1983	2002		10.2113/gsecongeo.89.8.1983	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/gsecongeo.89.8.1983													WOS:A1994QK97300018

Timothy			Arcellacea (Testate Amoebae) as Bio-indicators of Road Salt Contamination in Lakes	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Winter deicing operations occur extensively in mid- to high-latitude metropolitan regions around the world and result in a significant reduction in road accidents. Deicing salts can, however, pose a major threat to water quality and aquatic organisms. In this paper, we examine the utility of Arcellacea (testate amoebae) for monitoring lakes that have become contaminated by winter deicing salts, particularly sodium chloride. We analysed 50 sediment samples and salt-related water property variables (chloride concentrations; conductivity) from 15 lakes in the Greater Toronto Area and adjacent areas of southern Ontario, Canada. The sampled lakes included lakes in proximity to major highways and suburban roads and control lakes in forested settings away from road influences. Samples from the most contaminated lakes, with chloride concentrations in excess of 400 mg/l and conductivities of > 800 mu S/cm, were dominated by species typically found in brackish and/or inhospitable lake environments and by lower faunal diversities (lowest Shannon diversity index values) than samples with lower readings. Q-R-mode cluster analysis and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) resulted in the recognition of four assemblage groupings. These reflect varying levels of salt contamination in the study lakes, along with other local influences, including nutrient loading. The response to nutrients can, however, be isolated if the planktic eutrophic indicator species Cucurbitella tricuspis is removed from the counts. The findings show that the group has considerable potential for biomonitoring in salt-contaminated lakes, and their presence in lake sediment cores may provide significant insights into long-term benthic community health, which is integral for remedial efforts.																			0095-3628	1432-184X				AUG	2014	68	2					299	313		10.1007/s00248-014-0408-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-014-0408-3								24728526					WOS:000339735300012

The pale pinkish purple strain contained bacteriochlorophyll a incorporated into light-harvesting I and reaction center complexes. Its inability to grow under anaerobic illuminated conditions prompted designation as a member of the functional group known as aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that it belonged to the Gammaproteobacteria, forming a distinct branch of phototrophs distantly related to most described aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs, quite marginally related (95.6%) both to the only other described gammaproteobacterial aerobic phototroph, Congregibacter litoralis, and also to nonphototrophs in the genus Haliea (95.1-96.1%). Physiological tests demonstrated tolerance profiles to salinity (0-18% NaCl), pH (7-12), and temperature (7-40A degrees C) consistent with survival in a shallow hypersaline stream on the exposed, vegetation-depleted salt playa of its native East German Creek.

We compared changes in walleye Sander vitreus trophic position (TP) derived from paired diet content and stable isotope analysis. Individual diet-derived TP estimates were dissimilar to stable isotope-derived TP estimates. However, cumulative diet-derived TP estimates integrated from May 2001 to May 2002 corresponded to May 2002 isotope-derived estimates of TP. Average walleye TP estimates from the spring season appear representative of feeding throughout the entire previous year.

The floodwaters flowing into nearshore areas of the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) were known to contain oils, metals, and a wide range of pathogens and enteric bacteria, and there was also concern about synthetic chemical contaminants from flooded businesses and homes. The Northwest Fisheries Science Center was asked to mount an immediate response, both to collect samples of fish and shrimp from the potentially affected area as well as providing a wide range of chemical and microbiological analyses. Consequently, we conducted several sampling cruises from a variety of research vessels and chartered fishing boats in the GoM over the course of the following 12 months. While we sampled many species, we focused our analyses on Atlantic croaker Micropogonias undulalus and white shrimp Litopenaeus setiferus. Sampling began on 13 September 2005, within 1 week after floodwater pumping was intitated, and continued through September 2006. More than 300 seafood, water, and sediment samples were analyzed for a suite of organic chemical contaminants, including organochlorines, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs). The samples were also tested for bacterial contamination, including fecal contaminants such as Escherichia coli and potentially pathogenic Vibrio spp. While a range of both chemical and microbiological substances were detected, none were present in edible tissues at levels that posed any appreciable risk to human consumers of seafood products from the GoM, assuming that normal seafood preparation practices were followed. Petroleum-derived PACs in whites shrimp from both Lake Borgne and Mississippi Sound increased over several sampling periods in the fall and early winter (p < 0.001). However, these levels were quite low and had declined considerably by April 2006. Other than the increases in petroleum-derived PACs. our findings suggested little evidence of increased levels of contaminants immediately following the hurricane; however, the lackk of prestorm data hampered that determination. A lack of standard protocols, as well as issues related to risk assessment methodologies, complicated the ability to provide a coordinated multiagency communication of the results. As a result of our experiences in responding to this unprecedented environmental emergency. we recommend a more unified national capability for assessing seafood safety in our nation's coastal waters.

During monitoring investigations in the Lower Lake (Rheinsee, Zeller See and Gnadensee), the calanoid copepod Eudiaptomus graciloides was recorded, with the first observations of this species made in Gnadensee in autumn of 2016. In the second half of the year 2017, the species made up a large portion of the copepod community. The abundance of Eudiaptomus gracilis, which used to be the dominant calanoid copepod formerly, decreased with the appearance of E. graciloides. We assume that changes in resident food web were responsible for this species shift.																			1863-9135					APR	2019	192	3					263	268		10.1127/fal/2019/1160	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/fal/2019/1160													WOS:000464978400007

Specimens of G. proterorhini were detected on body surface, fins, and gills of the fish studied. In 2006, the monkey goby was infected with the prevalence 41%, racer goby with the prevalence of 47%, at maximal intensity of 6 and 9 parasites per fish, (respectively). The infection level in relation to the fish size and sampling season was also discussed. The presented study supports the hypothesis of progressive introduction of the parasite with gobiids to the colonized areas.					; Dzika, Ewa/N-4146-2018; Mierzejewska, Katarzyna/HJI-9561-2023	Hliwa, Piotr/0000-0001-5205-608X; Kakareko, Tomasz/0000-0001-5054-7416; Dzika, Ewa/0000-0002-4319-5026; Mierzejewska, Katarzyna/0000-0002-2270-8400													0932-0113					MAY	2011	108	5					1147	1151		10.1007/s00436-010-2175-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-010-2175-5								21153840					WOS:000289564400009

We present held evidence that the in-lake P cycle may also be disrupted in atmospherically acidified watershed-lake ecosystems. Plesne Lake in the Bohemian Forest is an acidified forest lake with epilimnetic pH of 4.5-4.9, total P concentration of similar to 10 mu g L-1, and pronounced anoxia above the bottom during winter and summer stratification periods. The water chemistry of the anoxic zone develops in a predictable way: After depletion of dissolved oxygen, concentrations of nitrate and sulfate decrease while concentrations of ammonium, iron, alkalinity, and pH increase; the only exception to the general pattern is a permanently low concentration of dissolved reactive P (<1 mu g L-1) above the sediment. This in-lake P inactivation can be explained by the acidification of soils in the watershed and subsequent precipitation of Al in the lake. The suggested mechanism is as follows: atmospheric deposition of strong acids has resulted in strong acidification and nitrogen saturation of soils in the Plesne Lake watershed and, consequently, in high terrestrial losses of Al (0.78-1.04 mg L-1), SO42- (4.5-7.7 mg L-1), and NO3- (0.48-1.15 mg L-1 NO3-N) to the lake. Biological removal of NO3- and SO42- by both assimilatory and dissimilatory reduction contributes greatly to the total in-lake alkalinity generation and to the increase in water pH. Under higher pH, ionic Al species hydrolyze and form colloidal Al hydroxides (Al-part), which coagulate dissolved organic carbon and adsorb orthophosphate in the water column. The Al hydroxides settle and increase the P sorption capacity of the sediment. The elevated content of fresh Al oxyhydroxides in the surface sediment reduces P release to the water column after orthophosphate liberation from ferric oxyhydroxides during anoxia, because Al-part complexes are not sensitive to redox changes. The example of Plesne Lake shows that atmospheric acidification of a watershed-lake ecosystem may provide the natural conditions for in-lake P inactivation similar to the lake restoration technique based on the artificial addition of Al salt to the water column.					; Kopacek, Jiri/A-7373-2014; Porcal, Petr/A-7350-2014; Hejzlar, Josef/F-8526-2014; Borovec, Jakub/AAP-3377-2021	Borovec, Jakub/0000-0002-1259-8703; Kopacek, Jiri/0000-0002-4409-4032; Porcal, Petr/0000-0002-7787-4924; 													0024-3590					JAN	2000	45	1					212	225		10.4319/lo.2000.45.1.0212	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2000.45.1.0212													WOS:000084949600019

The total period of sampling was short enough to ensure that the seasonal effects were negligible. The mean lorica length and mean posterior spine length showed a positive relationship with lake altitude. This indicates that the lower temperatures at higher altitudes delay the normal summer diminution in size of the lorica and the posterior spine. The conductivity of the lake waters varied from 14-100 .mu.mho cm-1, 20.degree.

Metal scavenging by calcium carbonate at the Eyjafjallajokull volcano: A carbon capture and storage analogue	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												The reaction of CO2 and water with basaltic rock can release trace heavy metals, which pose a serious threat to the quality of surface waters. The pH of the carbonated water increases during dissolution of the host rock or dilution by pore fluids. This leads to precipitation of carbonate and other secondary minerals that often scavenge the released heavy metals. However, very little is known about uptake capacity of the precipitates in natural systems or how much divergence there could be, compared with behavior in laboratory experiments. The spring 2010 eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano, Iceland, provides a unique opportunity to study the mobility of heavy metals that are released during CO2 injection into shallow basaltic aquifers and the ensuing precipitation of carbonate minerals. Following the Eyjafjallajokull eruption, rapid and constant travertine formation was discovered in the Icelandic river, Hvanna, in the vicinity of the volcano. The river water emerged from under the lava flow and was heavily charged with cations and dissolved CO2. The concentration of the major dissolved constituents was: dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), 33.08 mM; calcium, 6.17 mM; magnesium, 4.27 mM; sodium, 2.78 mM and sulfur, 1.92 mM. Carbon dioxide degassing of the river water increased pH from 6.6 to 8.5 and travertine precipitated for hundreds of meters downstream, rendering the stream bed white with calcite. Rapid crystallization rate produced dendritic structures or sometimes very porous material. Boxwork textures were observed within the porous calcite that probably originated from transformation of a metastable phase such as ikaite (CaCO3 center dot 6 H2O). A gradual decrease of conductivity from 1.8 mS/cm at the river water outlet to 1.1 mS/cm downstream and a clear drop in dissolved metal concentration strongly correlated with the precipitated calcite. Considering the complexity of the natural system, the estimated partition coefficients for Ba, Cd, Co, Cu, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Sr and Zn are in good agreement with the values derived from laboratory experiments under rather ideal conditions. Other elements were also scavenged from the river water, including Al, Fe, K, P, S, Si, Ti, V and the rare earth elements (REE). Our thermodynamic modeling suggests that, in addition to calcite and ikaite, silica, clay minerals, ferrihydrite, gibbsite and amorphous Ca, Mg carbonate minerals were supersaturated as the spring water degassed its CO2. Our results provide a valuable base for assessing the environmental impact of volcanic eruptions in basaltic terrain and carbon capture and storage (CCS) in basaltic rock. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The Ciomadul magmatic structure, situated at the southern end of the Harghita Mts, includes the St. Ana Lake and several isolated domes, Puturosul and Balvanyos representing the easternmost outcropping volcanics. Traces of active post volcanic processes are widespread between Tusnad and Balvanyos localities, mostly represented by mineral groundwater springs (displaying a large variety of chemical characteristics) and moffeta (generated by gas emergences rich in CO2). The special interest in this post volcanic activities is given by the perspective of being used as a tool for economic development of the region, once famous for the curative properties of the mineralized groundwater resources and the abundant number of springs (naturally outcropping or tapped). The possibility to revive the great potential of this area is diminished by the small quantities of mineral groundwater offered by the springs nowadays still active and the unsuccessful wells drilled for mineral water exploitation during the last several decades. Benefiting of the specific low electric resistivity values of mineral groundwater in this post volcanic area (mostly ranging between 0.5 and 15 Omega m) it was recently considered that modern geophysical techniques, such as the Electric Resistivity Tomography (ERT), may contribute to locate underground aquifers bearing higher water resources. ERT survey lines were deployed in the Balvanyos, St. Ana Lake and Mohos Peat Bog areas trending N-S, E-W, NW-SE and NE-SW in an attempt to detect structural features involved in groundwater vertical displacement (faults, fractures, tectonic contacts) or its underground accumulations. The high variability of electric resistivity values illustrated in the ERT cross-sections may be interpreted in terms of groundwater quality, rarely here to be used for domestic consumption, but mostly for various medical treatments.

Annual precipitation, annual temperature, and July and January temperatures were reconstructed by comparing fossil pollen in lake sediment with pollen in surface samples, assuming that ancient climates were similar to modern climate near analogous surface samples. In the early Holocene, most of the parks experienced colder winters, warmer summers, and lower precipitation than today. An exception is Voyageurs National Park in northern Minnesota where, by 8000 years ago, January temperatures were higher than today. The combination of high mean annual temperature and lower precipitation at Voyageurs resulted in a dry period between 8000 and 5000 years ago, similar to the Prairie Period in regions to the south and west. A mid-Holocene warm-dry period also occurred at other northern and central parks but was much less strongly developed. In southern parks there was no clear evidence of a mid-Holocene warm-dry period. These differences suggest that global model predictions of a warm, dry climate in the northern Great Plains under doubled atmospheric CO2 may be more applicable to Voyageurs than to the other parks. The contrast in reconstructed temperatures at Voyageurs and Isle Royale indicates that the ameliorating effect of the Great Lakes on temperatures has been in effect throughout the Holocene and presumably will continue in the future, thus reducing the potential for species loss caused by future temperature extremes. Increased numbers of mesic trees at all of the parks in the late Holocene reflect increasing annual precipitation. This trend toward more mesic conditions began 6000 years ago in the south and 4000 years ago in the north and increased sharply in recent millennia at parks located today in lake-effect snow belts. This suggests that lake-effect snowfall is sensitive to continental-scale changes in climate and could be affected by future climate change. Plant and animal species sensitive to changes in the moisture regime could thus be endangered within the Great Lakes parks.																			0888-8892	1523-1739				AUG	2000	14	4					968	983		10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.99219.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.99219.x													WOS:000088442400009

Four replicate samples in moss microhabitats were collected over twelve months. Site B2 had a lower range and mean water temperature (10.8 degrees C) and higher concentration of calcium ions. The population sampled at this site showed continuous reproduction, very high densities and a cohort life span of 6-7 months. Site D5 showed higher summer temperatures (max. recorded: 21.0 degrees C), and the population at this site had a reproductive resting stage in September and October, a lower density and a cohort life span of 7-12 months. Growth of cohorts was faster during the colder period of the year at both sites, while higher summer temperatures at D5 inhibited growth. These results show that the proximate cause of the restricted distribution of the species is adaptation to relatively colder conditions with higher calcium content. The presented results provide a better understanding of the damming impact on the species and will contribute to the development of conservation plans to ensure its future survival.

However, isotope records from this region reflect the combined effects of multiple climatic factors, and make climatic interpretations difficult. The authors use multi-proxy records, generated from the same sediment core from Qinghai Lake, to disentangle these multiple effects in isotope records and to infer EASM variability during the late Holocene. Records of leaf wax (C-25) delta D lake carbonate delta O-18 and the Dunde ice core delta O-18 all indicate a, millennial-scale depletion of mean isotopic values at similar to 1500-1250 years before present. Compared with independent lake temperature and salinity records, the authors Suggest that this depletion of long-term mean isotopic values must have resulted from changes in moisture sources in this region. In contrast, the authors attribute high-frequency (centennial timescale) C-28 delta D and ice core delta O-18 variability dominantly to a temperature effect. The multiproxy records provide a coherent picture in that many aspects of this regional climate (temperature, dryness: and moisture source) are strongly linked to the EASM variability.

Recruitment of lake trout in Lake Champlain	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake trout were extirpated from Lake Champlain by 1900, and are currently the focus of intensive efforts to restore a self-sustaining population. Stocking of yearling lake trout since 1972 has re-established adult populations, spawning occurs at multiple sites lake-wide, and fry production at several sites is very high. However, little to no recruitment past age-0 has occurred, as evidenced by the absence of adults without hatchery fin clips in fall assessments; no regular sampling for juveniles is conducted. We began focused sampling for juvenile lake trout in fall, 2015, in the Main Lake using bottom trawling, and expanded sampling to sites in the north and south of the lake in 2016. In 2015 we collected 303 lake trout < 350 mm total length, of which 23.8% were unclipped. Based on non-overlapping length modes, these wild fish comprised at least three age classes (young-of-year, age-1, and age-2). In 2016, we collected 1215 lake trout < 350 mm, including a fourth wild year class (2016 young-of-year). Forty-nine percent of juvenile lake trout from the Main Lake were unclipped; however, only 20% from the north lake and 9% from the south lake were undipped. The absence of older unclipped fish indicates that recruitment of wild fish began recently. We discuss several hypotheses to explain this sudden, substantial recruitment success, and factors that may be affecting lake trout restoration in Lake Champlain and the Great Lakes.

J	Schmid, M; Busbridge, M; Wüest, A				Schmid, Martin; Busbridge, Myles; Wueest, Alfred			Double-diffusive convection in Lake Kivu	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Double-diffusive staircases with a total of 230-350 mixed layers and sharp interfaces were observed in nine microstructure temperature profiles measured during February 2004 in Lake Kivu. The presence of these staircases at depths. 120 m indicates that diapycnal turbulent mixing is weak and vertical diffusive transport is dominated by double diffusion. Contrary to previously investigated natural or laboratory double-diffusive systems, the dissolved gases CO(2) and CH(4) contribute significantly to the density stratification, thereby influencing the formation and the structure of the staircases. The density ratio (i.e., the ratio of the stabilizing effect of dissolved substances to the destabilizing effect of temperature) ranges between 2.0 and 4.5 in large sections of the deep waters, implying a high susceptibility to the formation of staircases. The mixed layers (average thickness 0.48 m) are shown to be in a state of active convection. The average thickness of the interfaces (0.18 m) is surprisingly constant and independent of the large-scale stratification. The vertical heat fluxes correlate well with the temperature steps across the interfaces. Lake Kivu receives inflows from subaquatic springs at several depths that maintain the large-scale structure of the density stratification and disturb the staircases. In comparison to earlier observations from 1972, the double-diffusive heat fluxes appear to have been reduced, leading to a heat accumulation in the deep waters. Conversely, the strengthening of the main chemocline indicates an increased discharge of the subaquatic springs that could be responsible for recent changes in the nutrient cycling and methane production in the lake.

J	Li, XY; Lu, RY; Wang, XD				Li, Xinyu; Lu, Riyu; Wang, Xidong			Effect of Large-Scale Circulation Anomalies on Summer Rainfall over the Yangtze River Basin: Tropical versus Extratropical	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												This study investigates the tropical and extratropical circulation anomalies that directly affect the summer rainfall over the Yangtze River basin (YRB). In the lower troposphere, the tropical circulation anomalies that enhance the YRB rainfall manifest as an anticyclonic anomaly over the tropical western North Pacific (WNP) and the extratropical circulation anomalies are characterized by northeasterly anomalies to the north of the YRB. It is found that the heavier the YRB rainfall, the more necessary the cooperation between the tropical WNP anticyclonic anomaly and the midlatitude northeasterly anomalies, and compared to the tropical WNP anticyclonic anomaly, the midlatitude northeasterly anomalies can more efficiently induce the YRB rainfall. Further results indicate that the tropical WNP anticyclonic anomaly exhibits notable quasi-biweekly feature and provides a favorable background for the enhanced YRB rainfall. By contrast, the northeasterly anomalies are dominated by synoptic variability. Furthermore, there are significant precursor signals for the lower-tropospheric northeasterly anomalies. These signals manifest as the eastward propagation of two wave trains in the upper troposphere: a midlatitude one and a high-latitude one, which tend to be independent. The midlatitude one originates around the Mediterranean Sea and propagates eastward along the Asian westerly jet. The high-latitude one propagates over the high-latitude Eurasian continent, from Europe eastward to Lake Baikal and then southeastward to East Asia.

The aerial mycelia of all of the isolates exhibited fragmentation during growth, and motile spores arranged in chains were produced within the mycelia. Sporangia were not observed. These isolates contained menaquinone MK-9(H-4), their DNA G+C contents were 69 to 70 mol%; they contained glutamic acid, glycine, alanine, and meso-diaminopimelic acid as cell wall amino acids, and arabinose and galactose were found in their whole-cell hydrolysates. These taxonomic characteristics are the same as those of Actinokineospora riparia. On the basis of morphological, physiological, and chemotaxonomic characteristics and DNA-DNA hybridization data, we propose the following four new species of the genus Actinokineospora for these strains: Actinokineospora inagensis for a single isolate, type strain YU4-1 (= IFO 15663); Actinokineospora globicatena for isolates YU5-1, YU6-1, YU6-2, YU7-1, and YU7-2 (type strain, YU6-1 [= IFO 15664]); Actinokineospora terrae for a single isolate, type strain YU6-3 (= IFO 15668); and Actinokineospora diospyrosa for a single isolate, type strain YU8-1 (= IFO 15665).

In this study, we investigate the composite 86.2-m long NH-T section of Dachangliang which was formed with an astronomically tuned age between ca. 1.66 and 0.78 Ma. Parameterized grain size end-member modelling analysis is applied for the first time in the Nihewan Basin to unravel the characteristics of sediment sources, transportation dynamics, and climatic signals in the region. The grain-size distributions of the NH-T sediment samples are attributed to a mixture of four distinct end members (EMs 1-4). EM 1 represents a global atmospheric fine silt component (mode at 7.9 mu m) which probably resulted from high-altitude westerly transport from distal sources. EM 2, a medium silt component (mode at 27.6 mu m) was probably transported by the low-level westerly winds during the spring from a relatively proximal source in comparison to EM 1. EM 3, a coarse silt component (mode at 59.9 mu m), represents short distance suspended materials that were blown out by N or NW winds of the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM). EM 4 is a fine sand component (mode at 221.1 mu m), probably representing fluvial deposits carried by overland flow. Therefore, the temporal fluctuations in the abundances of EMs 1-3 are used to infer the history of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) (EM 1), of dust-storm outbreaks during springtime (EM 2), and of the EAWM (EM 3). The NH-T climate record shows an overall increase in EM 3 peaks, accompanied by a decrease in EM 1 minima from ca. 1.45 to 0.82 Ma, indicating a long-term aridification and cooling trend in the Nihewan Basin. At ca. 1.25 Ma, the EM patterns transition from short-frequency to longer fluctuations, apparently coinciding with the onset of the Mid-Pleistocene transition (MPT). Periods of stronger EASM with more frequently warm and wet conditions probably occurred in the basin between ca. 1.66-1.62, 1.52-1.25 and after 0.82 Ma. Intensified EAWM conditions probably prevailed in the basin during the intervening periods from ca. 1.62-1.52 and the MPT 1.25-0.82 Ma. The inferred warmer and wetter conditions likely supported hominin activities in the Nihewan Basin, in contrast to mostly colder and drier conditions. Nevertheless, the higher number of discovered Palaeolithic sites and recorded lithic artifacts from the first half of the MPT apparently reflects the successful adaptability of hominins to the prevailing cold climate. The relatively consistent patterns observed between the variations of a median grain-size stack of the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP MD) and EM 3, and of the magnetic susceptibility stack of the CLP (CLP MS) and EM 1, indicate the climatic sensitivity of these EMs in response to the long-term glacial/interglacial oscillations previously inferred from the CLP. However, significant differences in the CLP MD and CLP MS on the one hand side and in the trends of the EMs 3 and 1 on the other suggest that regional climate conditions varied between the CLP and the Nihewan Basin. Further research is required to explore such regional climate differences and their possibly underlying factors in the Early Pleistocene.

In two study years, we received 2,495 reports, of which 2,248 (90.1%) passed our quality control checks. Snow was the most frequent phase (64.0%), followed by rain (21.0%) and mixed precipitation (15.0%). We compared these values to estimates from 14 common precipitation phase partitioning methods that use near-surface meteorology as well as to two remote sensing products from the Global Precipitation Measurement mission (GPM). We found the meteorology-based methods tended to underestimate snowfall on average (60.9%) with a sizable standard deviation of 18%. The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM level 3 probabilityLiquidPrecipitation product also underestimated snowfall (57.5%) relative to the crowdsourced data, while the Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar level 2A phaseNearSurface product had little spatiotemporal overlap with the observations. We also found slight differences in the rain-snow line elevations measured by a freezing-level radar versus those estimated from the crowdsourced data, with the former being 165 m lower than the latter on average. These findings underscore the importance of collecting ground-truth observations of precipitation phase in the rain-snow transition zone. We hope future studies will consider the use of crowdsourced data for improved insights into and better representation of hydrometeorological processes.

J	Work, K; Gophen, M				Work, K; Gophen, M			Environmental variability and the population dynamics of the exotic Daphnia lumholtzi and native zooplankton in Lake Texoma, USA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Daphnia lumholtzi has invaded the U.S. from its original distribution of Africa, southern Asia and Australia. We examined the factors that affected the abundance and distribution of D. lumholtzi during 1994-1995 in Lake Texoma, a large southern plains reservoir. Daphnia lumholtzi was most abundant during summer months when temperatures were highest. The population exhibited a distributional shift in mid July from the upstream, more riverine portion of the reservoir to the cooler area near the dam when epilimnion temperatures upreservoir exceeded 30 degrees C. The pattern of variation in distribution and abundance did not correspond to the spatio-temporal patterns of most other resident zooplankton, nor did it correspond to changes in the phytoplankton assemblage. We conclude that the ability of D. lumholtzi to withstand the physiological effects of high temperature on reproduction and survival have a strong influence on the distribution and abundance of this organism in Lake Texoma. Furthermore, because D. lumholtzi became abundant only in the summer, after the decline of many of the native zooplankton, we suggest that it probably has little competitive impact on the other members of the zooplankton assemblage.

Our results lead to estimates of the upper half tidal range during 6800-7000 cal yr BP of 1.7 m. The Holocene highstand took place at approximately 6400-6500 cal yr BP, and mean sea level reached an elevation of 1.9 m. However, the timing of this sea-level rise is earlier in the Lake Inba area than documented in previous studies, and it is suggested that the timing of the Holocene highstand may appear at least 1000 years earlier as a result of Holocene residual uplift. After this, sea-level fell abruptly around 4000 cal yr BP. We also recognized a sea-level fall corresponding to the Yayoi regression at about 2600 cal yr BP, during which the mean relative sea level may have been as low as -2.5 m after compensating for uplift, subsidence or geomorphologic effects in this area.

Pre-migratory life history stages of juvenile arctic birds: Costs, constraints, and trade-offs	ECOLOGY												Many young birds on the Arctic tundra are confronted by a challenging task: they must molt their feathers and accumulate fat stores for the autumn migration before climatic conditions deteriorate. Our understanding of the costs and constraints associated with these stages is extremely limited. We investigated post-juvenal molt and premigratory fattening in free-ranging juvenile White-crowned Sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii) on the Arctic tundra. We found evidence for trade- offs between premigratory fat accumulation and molt: heavily molting birds had significantly less fat. Birds increased the rate of fat accumulation as the season progressed, but we found no evidence of a similar increase in rate of molt. Using a controlled captive study to isolate the energetic costs of body feather replacement, we found no difference in fat or size-corrected mass of birds actively growing body feathers as compared to controls. Molting birds, however, consumed 17% more food than controls, suggesting a significant cost of body feather growth. Our results provide evidence of significant costs, constraints, and trade-offs associated with post- juvenal molt and premigratory fat accumulation in young Arctic birds.																			0012-9658	1939-9170				NOV	2007	88	11					2729	2735		10.1890/07-0696.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/07-0696.1								18051640					WOS:000251067900008
J	BURNS, CW; GILBERT, JJ				BURNS, CW; GILBERT, JJ			PREDATION ON CILIATES BY FRESH-WATER CALANOID COPEPODS - RATES OF PREDATION AND RELATIVE VULNERABILITIES OF PREY	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The susceptibility of ciliates in a mesotrophic lake to predation by Epischura lacustris, Diaptomus minutus and D. pygmaeus was assessed during summer. Oligotrichs, particularly Strobilidium velox (c. 43 mu m), were removed efficiently by adult copepods and contributed substantially to the diet of female D. minutus. The presence of approximately 1.6 adult Epischura 1(-1), or sixteen adult female Diaptomus 1(-1), could halt the growth of S. velox populations in summer. 2. Factors affecting the rate at which copepods prey on ciliates were examined in experiments with D. pygmaeus and cultured ciliates. Rate of predation on S. velox, the preferred species, became saturated at 5 S. velox ml(-1) (45 ng C ml(-1)) and did not change with a 10-fold increase in alternative algal food. 3. Behavioural differences among ciliates, and the presence of other ciliates, contributed to differences in ciliate susceptibility to predation and suggest reasons why rates of removal of ciliates are not related to ciliate size. 4. By feeding selectively, at high rates, calanoids may suppress populations of some ciliates and thereby influence microzooplankton community structure.																			0046-5070					DEC	1993	30	3					377	393		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1993.tb00822.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1993.tb00822.x													WOS:A1993MN34700005

Headwater Streams of Florida: Types, Distribution and a Framework for Conservation	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Using geographic information system and topographic maps, 5829 headwater streams in Florida were surveyed for several parameters including elevation, stream length, flow regime and surrounding geology, and vegetation. Each was assigned to one of four headwater types: wetland, seep, lake, and spring. Wetland headwaters were the most common and widespread followed by seeps, many displaying temporary flow, while springs were perennial and least numerous. Four groups of Florida rivers were identified through cluster analysis of drainage densities (number headwaters/km of river length). Group 1 consisted of six rivers with lowest drainage densities (0.30-1.39 streams/km main channel). All were coastal rivers of peninsular Florida and, with one exception, drain to the Gulf of Mexico. Seven of eight rivers (group 2) with intermediate drainage densities (1.77-3.04 streams/km main channel) were located in peninsular Florida. Only three of 12 rivers comprising the two groups (groups 3 and 4) with greatest drainage densities (5.16-9.37 and 15.49-16.96 streams/km main channel) were not located in the Florida panhandle. Stream conservation efforts should focus on both highly complex dendritic river networks of the panhandle and on the 7000km(2) area in central Florida mostly lacking headwaters that may become a significant dispersal bottleneck for aquatic biota seeking refugia farther north from projected climate change.

Little is known, however, about the distribution and applicability of bacterial and archaeal lipids on the Tibetan Plateau. We investigated nine different watersheds across the plateau by way of sediments from lakes and rivers, as well as the surrounding soils. Our transect study included a salinity gradient and focused on saline lakes, which are rarely examined. We analyzed archaeal isoprenoid (i) and bacterial branched (b) GDGTs, as well as archaeol to trace their sources and environmental factors, influencing their distributions. We could show that iGDGTs were produced in situ and bGDGTs were primarily soil-derived although we could not exclude in situ production of bGDGTs in the lakes. The most important environmental variables correlating with GDGT distributions were temperature and salinity. Bacterial GDGT distributions correlated mainly with salinity, while archaeal lipid distributions correlated with temperature. Based on the correlation of methylation (MBT) and cyclisation (CBT) indices of bGDGTs with pH and mean annual air temperature (MAAT), we established local calibrations for the Tibetan lakes. TEX86 could also be applied to reconstruct temperature, which was strongly biased towards measured summer lake water temperature, indicating enhanced production of iGDGTs in the summer months. Existing proxies show, therefore, potential for palaeoclimate reconstruction on the Tibetan Plateau if local calibrations are applied. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Materials and Methods: The performance characteristics of the prototype BD GGBP sensor after intradermal or subcutaneous placement were assessed, and its accuracy was compared with that of a glucose oxidase (GOx)-based sensor and a standard laboratory method (YSI STAT2300 analyzer, Yellow Springs Instrument, Yellow Springs, OH) under glucose clamp conditions and during an off-clamp meal challenge in 40 patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes in a 12-h feasibility study. Results: BD-ID and BD-SC sensors performed as well as or better than the GOx-based sensor (differences in median absolute percentage error 2-4 points in hyperglycemic and euglycemic regions, >= 10 points in the hypoglycemic region). For glucose values <= 100 mg/dL, the percentage of measurement values in consensus error plot Zone A was substantially higher with the GGBP sensors than the GOx-based sensor. Conclusions: The BD prototype sensor demonstrated competitive accuracy relative to a GOx-based sensor and a YSI blood standard with a single calibration and minimal warm-up. Current development work is focused on the design and manufacture of a commercially feasible device that will include marked enhancements to device robustness and longevity.					; Hompesch, Marcus/AAC-9858-2019	Hompesch, Marcus/0000-0001-5867-2131; 													1520-9156	1557-8593				MAR	2011	13	3					309	317		10.1089/dia.2010.0130	http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/dia.2010.0130								21299393					WOS:000287798200004

The Features of Heavy Metal Accumulation in Water, Bottom Sediments and Biota of the Cherkalov Sor Bay at Lake Baikal	CHEMISTRY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT												The seasonal dynamics of heavy metals (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Cr, Ni, Co, Cd, Pb) in water, bottom sediments is shown; their concentrations in the higher aquatic plants (Elodea canadensis) and in zoobenthos (mollusca bivalvia) from the Cherkalov Sor bay of Lake Baikal are analyzed. It was established that the maximum permissible concentrations for fishery water bodies are exceeded for Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu in water all year long, for Pb during spring tide. The concentrations of all these metals in bottom sediments in fractions <60 mm exceeds the background values by 20-50 %, accumulation of Cd is almost 3 times higher. It is shown that redistribution of Mn, Zn, Cu, Cd is substantially affected by aquatic plants and mollusca.

They are interpreted in relation to vertical gradients of temperature, dissolved O2 and irradiance, and to rates of photosynthesis and respiration measured as O2 exchange in long- and short-term exposures. The motile cells tended to aggregate at an intermediate depth in the epilimnion, associated with a relative irradiance level of .apprx. 10% or .apprx. 140 .mu. einsteins/m2 per s as measured with a horizontal PAR sensor. Higher irradiances, and conditions below the oxycline, were apparently unfavorable, but the intervening layer was severely compressed at the height of summer stratification, when concentrations of inorganic N were also minimal. The population apparently passed through a critical period, at which the cellular content of chlorophyll a was much reduced. The preferred irradiance level in the lake corresponded to that at which measured rates of net photosynthesis were maximal. Increased rates of O2 evolution were measured at higher irradiances in very short exposures. This behavior may be important in cells experiencing vertical movement in nature.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1979	9	5					413	428		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1979.tb01526.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1979.tb01526.x													WOS:A1979HM73000003

CASE STUDIES FANTANELE AND IZVORUL MUNTELUI RESERVOIRS (ROMANIA)	4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE WATER RESOURCES AND WETLANDS	Water Resources and Wetlands				4th International Conference on Water Resources and Wetlands	SEP 05-09, 2018	Tulcea, ROMANIA	Romanian Limnogeog Assoc				Studying evaporation, one of the key factors in the hydrological balance, is important for proper management of water resources stored in reservoirs. Therefore, the main objectives of this paper are: (i) to analyze the temporal variability of the evaporation and (ii) to estimate the impact of this process on the water balance by using the hydrological budget equation. Two reservoirs were considered in this study, located in different geographical regions in Romania - Fantanele reservoir (area of 3.25 km(2) and water volume of 31.7 mil. m(3)), located in the southwest of the country, in a plain region (102 m a.s.l. altitude), and Izvorul Muntelui reservoir (area of 31 km(2) and water volume of 1230 mil. m(3)) in the Eastern Carpathians, at 540 m a.s.l. altitude. The analysis is based on direct measurements of water evaporation and other climatic parameters (air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and precipitations) during 1961-2012. The analysis shows that the amount of water evaporated from the surface of Fantanele reservoir reaches 655 mm/year, with the maximum value in July (120 mm). For Izvorul Muntelui reservoir, the evaporation of 595 mm/year is lower, due to the mountainous climate, and the maximum evaporation doesn't exceed 100 mm/month in the summer months (July and August). In summer (June - August), the water lost by evaporation represents almost 40% of the total water volume for Fantanele reservoir and only 1% for Izvorul Muntelui reservoir. When analyzing the hydrological balance at the annually level, we can conclude that for the Fantanele reservoir, during the analyzing period, it was deficient, due to drainage or water demanded for crops irrigations (downstream of the dam), but also by the intense evaporation in summer. Meanwhile for the Izvorul Muntelui reservoir, the hydrological balance was excessive, due to the contribution of the tributary rivers and of the headrace, but also to the greater quantities of precipitation.

Lake Brienz is oligotrophic, Lake Thun is meso- to oligotrophic, and Lake Biel is still eutrophic. Sympatric coregonid populations live in all three lakes. Maximum length and growth rate of the slow- and fast-growing sympatric populations increases with increasing trophic state. Lengths at age of year-classes 1978 to 1991 show no significant overall trend in either of the three lakes. Relating these growth data with environmental factors of the lakes indicates that growth increments of the first year (Z1) of pooled data of all populations is positively correlated with phosphate concentrations in spring and with mean annual temperatures of the outflows, whereas growth increments of the second (Z2) and third year (Z3) are negatively correlated with these parameters. Within Lake Biel only Z1 of the fast-growing population increases with increasing phosphate concentrations, while Z1 of the slow-growing population decreases with increasing nutrients. The consequences of changes in growth characteristics are discussed with view to re-oligotrophication of the lakes and to long-term increases of temperatures.																			0071-1128		3-510-47047-8				1995	46						61	70																WOS:A1995BH14P00007

Study focus: A detailed analysis of available meteorological, physical and chemical data (mostly coming from a vertical profiler remotely collecting data every 3 h) was performed in order to understand and model the manganese cycle. A one-dimensional model to calculate manganese vertical velocities was also developed. New hydrological insights for the region: The soluble manganese concentration in the hypolimnion is dominantly dependent on the dissolved oxygen level, pH and redox potential, which determine the speed of the biogeochemical reactions between different manganese oxidation states. In contrast, the manganese level in the epilimnion is mainly affected by the transport processes from the hypolimnion and thus to the strength of the thermal stratification, with high concentrations recorded solely during the winter lake circulation and wind playing only a minor role. The value of the peak concentration was found to be proportional to the amount of manganese in the hypolimnion and to the temperature of the water column at the beginning of the circulation period. In case of partial circulation only, a very high peak is espected during the next full winter turnover. This issue will increase in the future due to global warming and increased number of years with partial circulations only. These findings provide water authorities with increased manganese predictive power and thus proactive water treatment management strategies. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Knox, JC				Knox, JC			Agricultural influence on landscape sensitivity in the Upper Mississippi River Valley	CATENA					Royal-Society-of-Edinburgh Conference on Landscape Sensitivity	SEP 02-03, 1999	UNIV STIRLING, STIRLING, SCOTLAND	Royal Soc Edinburgh, Royal Scottish Geograph Soc, Scottish Nat Heritage, Univ Stirling, Dept Environm Sci	UNIV STIRLING			Agricultural landscapes are more sensitive to climatic variability than natural landscapes because tillage and grazing typically reduce water infiltration and increase rates and magnitudes of surface runoff. This paper evaluates how agricultural land use influenced the relative responsive ness of floods, erosion, and sedimentation to extreme and nonextreme hydrologic activity occurring in watersheds of the Upper Mississippi Valley. Temporally overlapping stratigraphic and historical instrumental records from southwestern Wisconsin and northwestern Illinois show how agricultural modification of a natural prairie and forest land cover affected the behavior of floods and sedimentation during the last two centuries. For comparison, pre-agriculture Holocene alluvial sediments document the sensitivity of floods and alluvial activity to climate change prior to significant human influences on the natural land cover. High-resolution floodplain stratigraphy of the last two centuries shows that accelerated runoff associated with agricultural land use has increased the magnitudes of floods across a wide range of recurrence frequencies. The stratigraphic record also shows that large floods have been particularly important to the movement and storage of sediment in the floodplains of the Upper Mississippi Valley. Comparison of floodplain alluvial sequences in watersheds ranging in scale from headwater tributaries to the main valley Mississippi River demonstrates that land use changes triggered hydrologic responses that were transmitted nearly simultaneously to all watershed scales. In turn, flood-driven hydraulic adjustments in channel and floodplain morphologies contributed to feedback effects that caused scale-dependent long-term lag responses. There has been a general reduction in magnitudes of flooding, erosion, and sedimentation since the mid-20th century, largely in response to better land conservation practices. The reduction trend is most apparent on tributary watersheds of a few hundred square kilometers and smaller sizes. However, the main-channel Upper Mississippi River, with associated drainage areas between about 100,000-200,000 km(2), has experienced increased occurrences of large floods during the second half of the 20th century. Most of these large floods have been associated with snowmelt runoff which is occurring more rapidly and earlier in the season in response to a trend toward warmer winters and springs in the late 20th century. Modification of the natural drainage network through establishment of drainage riles and channelization has also continued during the late 20th century. Tiling and channelization have increased drainage efficiency and probably have contributed in part to the occurrence of large floods on the Mississippi River, but the magnitudes of their effects are unknown at present. In spite of reduced sediment loads since about 1950 on all watershed scales, the anomalous high frequency of large floods on the Upper Mississippi River continues the accelerated delivery of agriculturally-related sediment to floodplain and backwater environments. The results of this study indicate that agricultural land use has escalated landscape sensitivity to such a degree that modem process rates provide a very distorted representation of process rates that occurred in the geologic past prior to human disturbance.

Pronounced changes in frontal ablation in recent years have consequently changed ice dynamics. In this study, we reveal the inter-seasonal dynamics of the Kviarjokull ablation zone and proglacial zone using ArcticDEM and Sentinel-2 images acquired between 2011 and 2021 and intra-seasonal dynamics with repeated UAV surveys during summer 2021. Average glacier surface velocity in the ablation zone ranged from 51 m year-1 in 2015 up to 199 m year-1 in 2018, with maxima within the axial zone of the glacier and minima on the glacier edges. Coincidentally, and in accordance with glacier retreat/advance, the ice-marginal proglacial lake fluctuated in its area, and we interpret that it was also a key factor in the development of the glacier terminus morphology. A complex spatial pattern of glacier surface elevation changes, including thickening in the frontal true left margin of the terminus, is interpreted to be due to variable subglacial topography, relatively fast ice flow from the accumulation zone and an insulating effect of glacier surface debris cover. In contrast, the true right (southern) part of the glacier terminus experienced thinning and retreat/disintegration also during the 2021 summer season, which we attribute to enhanced frontal ablation connected to the intrusion of lake water into the crevassed glacier terminus. Overall, this study suggests that where glaciers are developing ice-marginal lakes complex patterns of glacier dynamics and mass loss can be expected, which will confound understanding of the short-term evolution of these environments. Interaction of ice-contact lake and a glacier terminus is described in a highly dynamic Icelandic glacier. We identified main factors controlling development of the glacier terminus: variable subglacial topography, fast ice flow and debris cover insulating effect. Complex pattern of glacier dynamics is also attributed to enhanced frontal ablation connected to the intrusion of lake water into the crevassed glacier terminus. image					Hanacek, Martin/NIS-7790-2025; Dagsson-Waldhauserova, Pavla/ABE-2214-2021; Holuša, Jakub/GOH-0712-2022; Kavan, Jan/ACU-4986-2022; Nyvlt, Daniel/J-6504-2019; Laska, Kamil/L-7875-2013; Roman, Matěj/AAN-4194-2020	Carrivick, Jonathan/0000-0002-9286-5348; Stringer, Christopher David/0000-0002-2902-9435; Roman, Matej/0000-0003-4741-5169; Kavan, Jan/0000-0003-4524-3009; 													0197-9337	1096-9837				APR	2024	49	5					1487	1502		10.1002/esp.5781	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/esp.5781		JAN 2024											WOS:001153604100001

The examined ages for the 11 layers of dune sands, based on the average sedimentary rate, are: 0 to 960, 1350-2240, 2470 to 3530, 4000 to 4180, 4290 to 4350, 4380 to 4760, 5040 to 5920, 6570 to 8270, 9020 to 9700, 9880 to 10160 and 10580 to 11080 a BP, respectively. The climatic events indicated by these dune sands are consistent with those records in the Huguangyan volcanic lake, Zoige peat bog, Hulu cave and Dunde ice core, particularly with the climatic fluctuations of the North Atlantic since 11 000 a BR Among them, patterns from 130 to 138 correspond to the peak values of OMD, 2D, 4D, 6D+8D+10D, 12D, 14D, 16D, 18D and 20D respectively. It might be caused by the North Atlantic ice age induced by the heat circulation, which strengthened the polar high pressure and Siberian-Mongolian high pressure and further led to the dominance of the winter monsoon over China's desert area.

Biomass-burning aerosol over northern Australia	AUSTRALIAN METEOROLOGICAL AND OCEANOGRAPHIC JOURNAL												Australia's two main continental aerosol types are mineral dust from the arid interior, and smoke from biomass burning in the tropical north. In this study we examine the seasonal cycle of aerosol optical properties from two sites in the Australian tropics: Lake Argyle and Jabiru. In each case we see a distinct seasonal cycle, with highest values of aerosol loading occurring during spring, the height of the savanna burning season. The seasonal cycle of Angstrom exponent, a simple but effective guide to particle size, shows that it is fine mode particles which dominate during this time, as expected of biomass burning aerosol. We have also examined size distribution retrievals, and found similar results. An examination of these distributions for successive days showed results consistent with the dual effects of advection, and particle growth expected of smoke aging.																			1836-716X					MAR	2012	62	1					25	33		10.22499/2.6201.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.22499/2.6201.003													WOS:000306297200003

The latter is a photomultiplier array registering air-Cherenkov light from air showers induced by cosmic-ray particles with initial energies of approximately 10(16)-10(18) eV. Tunka-Rex extends this detector with 25 antennas spread over an area of 1 km(2). It is triggered externally by Tunka-133, and detects the radio emission of the same air showers. The combination of an air-Cherenkov and a radio detector provides a facility for hybrid measurements and cross-calibration between the two techniques. The main goal of Tunka-Rex is to determine the precision of the reconstruction of air-shower parameters using the radio detection technique. It started operation in autumn 2012.

BP. Numerous subfossil palaeomeanders of different sizes have been discovered in the valley floor. Here, we present the first results of multiproxy research on the paleo-oxbow lake fill, one of the oldest in the region. The wide range of palaeoecological analyses resulted in reconstructions of vegetation history, climatic, hydrological and habitat changes. The studied oxbow was an aquatic ecosystem with diverse invertebrate fauna until the end of Younger Dryas when it transformed into a limno-telmatic habitat. The sediment composition indicates active denudation processes and several episodes of turbulent hydrological conditions. Such an increased river activity could have caused flooding, resulting in an allochthonous matter supply to the oxbow lake in Late Vistulian. Environmental changes were strictly related to the regional features of the catchment, the transformation of soils, and the hydrogeological conditions. The chironomid-and pollen-inferred climatic reconstructions indicate periods of high and low continentality. The chironomid record indicates relatively cool summer conditions in the Allerod, especially ca. 13,000 cal. BP, possibly related to the Gerzensee Oscillation. On the other hand, a distinct increase of summer temperatures in Younger Dryas (up to 16 degrees C) was recorded. Such a situation was also confirmed in some other studies from the region, suggesting that it might be the effect of some specific, local palaeoclimatic conditions.

Uranium delivery and uptake in a montane wetland, north-central Colorado, USA	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Comprehensive sampling of peat, underlying lakebed sediments, and coexisting waters of a naturally uraniferous montane wetland are combined with hydrologic measurements to define the important controls on uranium (U) supply and uptake. The major source of U to the wetland is groundwater flowing through locally fractured and faulted granite gneiss of Proterozoic age. Dissolved U concentrations in four springs and one seep ranged from 20 to 83 ppb (mu g/l). Maximum U concentrations are similar to 300 ppm (mg/kg) in lakebed sediments and >3000 ppm in peat. Uranium in lakebed sediments is primarily stratabound in the more organic-rich layers, but samples of similar organic content display variable U concentrations. Post-depositional modifications include variable addition's of U delivered by groundwater. Uranium distribution in peat is heterogeneous and primarily controlled by proximity to groundwater-fed springs and seeps that act as local point sources of U, and by proximity to groundwater directed along the peat/lakebeds contact. Uranium is initially sorbed on various organic components of peat as oxidized U(VI) present in groundwater. Selective extractions indicate that the majority of sorbed U remains as the oxidized species despite reducing conditions that should favor formation of U(IV). Possible explanations are kinetic hindrances related to strong complex formation between uranyl and humic substances, inhibition of anaerobic bacterial activity by low supply of dissolved iron and sulfate, and by cold temperatures.

We present a 24 000-year reconstruction of climate in the Polar Ural Mountains using n-alkanoic acid hydrogen isotopes from Lake Bolshoye Shchuchye. Major last deglaciation climate changes in the North Atlantic are present in this record, including transitions associated with the Bolling-Allerod, Younger Dryas and Holocene. However, the magnitude of the last deglaciation isotopic shifts at Bolshoye Shchuchye are small relative to the North Atlantic, and are dwarfed by a shift to H-2-enriched values starting at 10.5k cal a bp at this site that is not present in most other records. The last deglaciation changes may be due to variations in local temperature, sea ice cover in the Barents and Kara seas, and plant community shifts impacting transpiration. The enrichment starting at 10.5-k cal a bp probably records a shift towards modern climate conditions, caused by the loss of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet, increased locally sourced moisture from the Barents and Kara seas, and northward treeline migration causing enhanced transpiration. Future warming may increase summer precipitation in this region, with changes to local ecosystems and carbon cycling.

D12305	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Spring average air concentrations of hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), dieldrin, and two low-molecular-weight polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs) measured around the Great Lakes during the 1990s showed strong association with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Decadal air monitoring of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) around the Great Lakes revealed that air concentrations of the aforementioned compounds tend to increase in the positive mode of the NAO. During the same time period, western and northwestern North America experienced warmer-than-normal springs, enhancing volatilization of these compounds from reservoirs accumulated because of past and current use. Atmospheric flows associated with the NAO then transported these compounds from source regions to downwind locations such as the Great Lakes. Roughly reversed situations occurred during the negative mode of the NAO, which was linked to lower POP air concentrations observed around the Great Lakes. Interannual fluctuations of the air concentrations of these POPs significantly correlated with the 1000-500-hPa thickness of the atmospheric layer to the west of the Great Lakes and changes in zonal wind over the western United States. Results indicate that the NAO index may be a useful factor for forecasting interannual fluctuations of POP air concentrations in North America.																			2169-897X	2169-8996				JUN 26	2004	109	D12							D12305	10.1029/2003JD004435	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2003JD004435													WOS:000222776100001

A key challenge for impact assessment is disentangling the effects of restoration from climate variability. Trout Creek, near Lake Tahoe, California, was reengineered to reestablish hydrologic connectivity between the stream and its former floodplain. Gauges located above and below the site, along with groundwater well measurements, were used to analyze prerestoration and postrestoration hydrology. Results show that restoration has a seasonal impact with statistically significant increases in streamflow during the summer recession period and decreased groundwater table depths across a wide range of streamflow conditions. Paired gauges and statistical models that are robust to serial autocorrelation demonstrate a feasible approach for assessing hydrologic restoration in regions where climate patterns lead to substantial within- year and between- years variation in streamflow.

However, we have little knowledge about the mercury exposure and its risks for birds in Poyang Lake basin, China. Therefore, during 2020-2021, we investigated MeHg concentrations in breast feathers of wintering migratory birds (n = 430 from 43 species belonging to 9 orders) in Poyang Lake Nanji Wetland and Jiangxi Nanfengmian National Nature Reserve, China. MeHg concentrations in breast feathers varied greatly by species, foraging guilds and taxonomic orders, among which the highest concentration was detected in great egret (8849 +/- 5975 ng g(-1) dw). Comparing with studies worldwide, high MeHg concentrations in feathers of Ardeidae from Pelecaniformes were found in this area. Moreover, herons migrating between northern and southern China had lower MeHg concentration than residents in southern China related to habitat Hg. Considering the applicability and sensitivity of the equations for the transformation of MeHg concentrations in feathers to blood-equivalent total Hg (THg) values, method CJ that the equation based on songbirds was used for the transformation of the songbirds and the equation based on seabirds for the others performed better than other three for risk assessment of bird Hg in this study. 23.1% of birds from Poyang Lake were at risk of Hg exposure based on the method CJ. Carnivorous birds from Pelecaniformes had the highest risk levels, with 37.2% categorized as no risk (<= 200 ng g(-1) ww), 48.9% as low risk (200-1000 ng g(-1) ww), 11.1% as moderate risk (1000-3000 ng g(-1) ww), 1.1% as high risk (3000-4000 ng g(-1) ww), and 1.7% as severe risk (>4000 ng g(-1) ww). These risks suggest long-term monitoring and further advanced studies about freshwater waterbirds Hg exposure is necessary.																			0013-9351	1096-0953				NOV 15	2024	261								119641	10.1016/j.envres.2024.119641	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2024.119641		AUG 2024						39053757					WOS:001288121100001

Ground water levels in aquifer systems interact with inflows/outflows of the system i.e. ground water level oscillations strongly depend on boundary conditions of the aquifer system. Interaction of aquifer boundary conditions and ground water levels can be strong or weak, which points to importance i.e. the dominancy of a certain boundary condition and its impact on ground water level rise or fall. The strength of the relationship between boundary conditions and ground water levels can be determined using correlation analysis. Interaction between boundary conditions and ground water levels can also have functional dependence, which in turn enables prediction of ground water levels in aquifer, based solely on measurements of a certain boundary conditions. Functional relationship between boundary conditions and ground water levels can be determined using regression analysis. Likewise, interaction between boundary conditions and ground water levels can either be fast or slow, which in turn points to an impact of a certain boundary condition on ground water dynamics. In such an analysis, ground water pressure propagation can be determined using cross-correlation analysis. Aquifer boundary conditions like recharge from precipitation, recharge/drainage from rivers, lake or creeks, outflow from springs, pumping/injecting from or into the wells or inflow/outflow through aquifer outer boundaries, are designated as time series, just like ground water levels. Since processes in nature occur in cycles, which are in hydrogeology measured as one hydrologic year, time series generally contain several hundreds or even several thousands of measured data. Further, if we consider analysing national time series database, the number of data in time series can be significantly larger. In such cases we can speak about millions of measurements which need to be processed. Statistical analysis are therefore essential in studying processes in hydrogeology. Although the methods of correlation, regression and cross-correlation are well known and long present, Croatian terms related to those methods, primarily related to coefficients which numerically describe the results of correlation, regression and cross-correlation models, are often mixed. Therefore this paper also deals with Croatian statistical terms related to considered statistical method.

Basin contains 2,809 kt of Li carbonate equivalent (LCE). Geologic mapping, logging of drill core, and geochemistry analyses shed new light on the geologic setting, stratigraphy, clay sedimentology, Li mineralization, and potential origins of this small, deep depocenter within the eastern half of the bimodal Kaiser Spring volcanic field, which contains 12 high-silica rhyolite domes. Basin stratigraphy consists of two Li-rich clay units, the Upper Clay and Lower Clay, both in sharp contact and interbedded with tuffs, basalt lava flows, coarse volcanic and nonvolcanic alluvial conglomerates, and volcanic sinter. These rocks were deposited and subsided into a semicircular, synclinal basin-potentially a maar crater-lacking basin-bounding faults that would have controlled the formation of accommodation space. Stratigraphic correlations from mapped surface geology and drill core in the southeastern side of the basin suggest the depocenter is at least 300 m deep. Lithium ore principally occurs as continuous, stratified zones of magnesian smectite-group clays in both the Upper and Lower Clay. The Upper Clay contains averages of 778 to 983 ppm Li with a high-grade zone of >1,200 ppm Li, whereas the Lower Clay averages 690 ppm Li. The high-grade zone in the Upper Clay is coincident with anomalous molybdenum (Mo), with weighted average concentrations between 69 and 206 ppm, though Mo concentration is highly variable throughout the interval. Potential lithium sources include hydration of Li-rich high-silica rhyolite dome vitrophyre, dissolution of volcanic ash, and hydrothermal fluid circulation. The origin of the Li-rich clay remains unresolved but could include the neoformation of magnesian smectite at an alkaline lake bottom, hydrothermal fluid alteration of volcanic ash or smectite, and/or diagenesis of Li-rich volcanic ash deposits. Although Basin is the first volcano-sedimentary deposit described in a bimodal volcanic field and in a maar crater, it is analogous to many other volcano-sedimentary deposits-including those located at McDermitt caldera/Thacker Pass, Nevada; Rhyolite Ridge, Nevada; Sonora, Mexico; and Clayton Valley, Nevada; and the lesser-known Big Sandy, Arizona, and Lyles clay/Thompson Valley, Arizona-in that Li was mobilized from proximal or interbedded Li-rich rhyolitic tuffs and lavas, Li was concentrated in a closed-hydrologic basin, and Li is dominantly trapped in magnesian smectite-group clays.																			0361-0128	1554-0774				MAY	2025	120	3					663	688		10.5382/econgeo.5138	http://dx.doi.org/10.5382/econgeo.5138													WOS:001497918400008

Growth and voltinism in the aquatic insects of a regulated river subject to groundwater inflows	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS					10th International Symposium on Regulated Streams	AUG, 2006	Stirling, SCOTLAND					The water temperature and discharge of the Vassbygdelvi River, Aurland watershed, was altered after regulation due to transfer of cold water from the higher parts of the catchment. The lower part of the river receives a considerable amount of groundwater, which affected the water temperature due to reduced discharge. Compared to a closely situated reference station, the temperature increased by 9% on a yearly basis. The temperature differences were most pronounced during the winter when average January water temperature at the reference and the stretch influenced by groundwater was 0.8 and 3.3 degrees C, respectively. Studies of benthic insects in the two habitats showed that the temperature differences had little effect on the length of the life cycle. Although some species show significant differences in growth pattern during parts of the year, with more rapid development in the winter-warm locality, there was a trend for synchronous growth at both localities. Compared to the situation before regulation, two species of stoneflies became extinct and one mayfly species colonized the area, probably as a result of the increased number of annual degree-days.

The study was carried out on an eutrophic lake (Aydat, France). As REYNOLDS (1980, 1984) suggests, the seasonal periodicity of phytoplankton is an autogenic succession which may be perturbed by allogenic physical processes that change the initial direction of the succession. Thus, in this lake, only spring succession of phytoplankton can be considered as a true succession, consistent with the theory of ecological succession in that it was a directional and predictable phenomenon leading to an increasing complexity of community.																			0020-9309						1992	77	1					121	134		10.1002/iroh.19920770109	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19920770109													WOS:A1992HQ98300008

The reconstruction is performed using a novel ensemble method, Ensemble-LOC, designed to preserve low-frequency variability and minimize the influence of the "spurious correlation" between the proxy and instrumental data. The reconstruction is based on a set of 22 proxy records with annual resolution. We find clear evidences for a cold anomaly AD similar to 630 to 770 related to the Dark Age Cold Period, a warm anomaly similar to 950 to 1050 related to the Medieval Climate Anomaly, and a cold anomaly similar to 1200 to 1900 related to the Little Ice Age. The strong 20th century warming is also evident. There are 3 different and distinct warm periods occurring during the Little Ice Age: 1470-1510, 1550-1570, and 1750-1770. However, about half of the total input proxies are not used in the large majority of the reconstructions. We still need additional proxy records from the Arctic region with annual resolution and a strong response to local temperature to further verify the results of this study and in order to investigate possible spatial patterns of past Arctic temperature variability.

Structure and Functioning of Plankton Communities in the Rybinsk Reservoir under the Conditions of Climate Change	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												Based on the data of complex environmental studies, which have been regularly carried out at six standard stations of the Rybinsk Reservoir since the middle of the 20th century, the orientation of changes in the elements of the reservoir ecosystem associated with global climatic events has been analyzed. During the period of climate warming, which began in 1977 and continues into the 21st century, the air temperature in the warm season has increased by 0.9 degrees C, the water temperature by 1.4 degrees C, the average annual inflow by 7.5%, and the duration of the ice-free period by 2 weeks. An increase in electrical conductivity and color of water and a decrease in transparency are noted. With significant interannual variations in biological characteristics, in the 21st century, the number of bacterioplankton has increased 1.7 times and bacterial production has doubled. Chlorophyll content has increased 1.4 times and mean values >15 mu g/L reflecting the eutrophic state of the reservoir are observed more often. In the biomass of phytoplankton, the proportion of small cell forms has increased. The total abundance of phytoplankton has increased due to the development of cyanobacteria, which form a long summer maximum in the seasonal dynamics of the community. The increase in water mineralization promoted the progressive spread of alien brackish-water algae. The biomass of zooplankton has increased 2.5 times. An increase in the abundance of crustaceans (Cladocerans by 1.6 times and Copepods by 1.9 times) has caused a change in the structure of zooplankton and the formation of a strong late summer peak of biomass. The intensification of hydrobiological processes was clearly manifested after the abnormally hot 2010, the conditions of which not only stimulated the development of plankton communities, but also caused the formation of oxygen deficiency in the bottom layers. Warming has significantly transformed the ecosystem of the Rybinsk Reservoir, intensified eutrophication processes, and worsened water quality. Changes in hydrometeorological characteristics have gone beyond the mild scenario of climate warming.

Modeling reveals the role of coastal upwelling and hydrologic inputs on biologically distinct water exchanges in a Great Lakes estuary	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Freshwater estuaries everywhere are under stress from anthropogenic activities and climate change. Muskegon Lake Estuary (MLE) is a freshwater estuary along the eastern shore of Lake Michigan characterized by algal blooms and hypoxia during the summer and designated as an Area of Concern (AOC) by the EPA. We developed a 3-D hydrodynamic model using the Semi-implicit Cross-scale Hydroscience Integrated System Model (SCHISM) to study the hydrodynamics of MLE with a focus on the cold-water intrusions from Lake Michigan into MLE. Substantial water exchange process was validated by comparisons with observations in the near-shore region of Lake Michigan and in the navigation channel between Lake Michigan and MLE. The model found that the cold water intrusions from Lake Michigan to MLE occur during summer stratification, amounting to as much as 10% of MLE's total volume during one single episodic event. The intrusion was accompanied by a stronger surface outflow in the opposite direction, which may accelerate the delivery of MLE water to Lake Michigan. Through process-oriented model experiments, we examined the cold-water intrusion's responses to hydrological shift under climate change, and found that the increase in riverine input during upwelling weakens the intrusion. In addition, an increase of navigation channel width strengthens the cold-water intrusion, and that intrusion strength as well as intrusion period was directly related to wind speed. Our observation-modeling based findings would provide a good reference for the future study of biophysical interactions between coastal ocean and estuaries.

We compared the responses of nine wintering mammal species to forest edges in southern Quebec, Canada, using high-resolution spatial data from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and low-resolution photointerpretation. We defined edges of open areas as roads, lakes, rivers, or forest open areas. We geolocated mammal snow tracks along systematic transect lines between 2009 and 2018. We compared distances of snow tracks and reference points along transects to the nearest edge with linear models. LiDAR data revealed five species avoiding forest open area edges, whereas no avoidance was shown using photo-interpretation data. Weasels (Mustela sp.) were the only species showing a positive association with forest open area edges using photo-interpreted data. No significant response was detected for river or lake edges. Four species were positively associated with road edges. We conclude that avoidance of small forest open area edges is widespread in our study area, but it can only be detected with high-resolution spatial data.

Thermal and hydrologic suitability of Lake Erie and its major tributaries for spawning of Asian carps	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Bighead carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis, silver carp H. molitrix, and grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella (hereafter Asian carps) have expanded throughout the Mississippi River basin and threaten to invade Lakes Michigan and Erie. Adult bighead carp and grass carp have been captured in Lake Erie, but self-sustaining populations probably do not exist. We examined thermal conditions within Lake Erie to determine if Asian carps would mature, and to estimate time of year when fish would reach spawning condition. We also examined whether thermal and hydrologic conditions in the largest tributaries to western and central Lake Erie were suitable for spawning of Asian carps. We used length of undammed river, predicted summer temperatures, and predicted water velocity during flood events to determine whether sufficient lengths of river are available for spawning of Asian carps. Most rivers we examined have at least 100 km of passable river and summer temperatures suitable (>21 C) for rapid incubation of eggs of Asian carps. Predicted water velocity and temperature were sufficient to ensure that incubating eggs, which drift in the water column, would hatch before reaching Lake Erie for most flood events in most rivers if spawned far enough upstream. The Maumee, Sandusky, and Grand Rivers were predicted to be the most likely to support spawning of Asian carps. The Black, Huron, Portage, and Vermilion Rivers were predicted to be less suitable. The weight of the evidence suggests that the largest western and central Lake Erie tributaries are thermally and hydro-logically suitable to support spawning of Asian carps.

Avian-Driven Modification of Seasonal Carbon Cycling at a Tundra Pond in the Hudson Bay Lowlands (Northern Manitoba, Canada)	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												The past similar to 40 years have seen a geometric increase (5-7% per year) in the size of the lesser snow goose (LSG; Chen caerulescens caerulescens) population and marked spatial expansion of the area they inhabit within the coastal fen ecotype of Wapusk National Park (Hudson Bay Lowlands, northern Canada), raising concerns and uncertainty about the environmental effects of their activities (grubbing of vegetation, soil disturbance, deposition of feces) on the abundant shallow tundra ponds. In this study, we use conventional limnological measurements as well as water and carbon (C) isotope tracers to explore similarities and differences in seasonal patterns of hydrological, limnological, and biogeochemical conditions of 15 shallow coastal fen ponds that currently have minimal (if any) disturbance from the LSG population with one pond (WAP 20) that is subject to substantial LSG activity. Carbon isotope measurements reveal that C cycling at WAP 20 (LSG-disturbed site) is markedly different compared to the other ponds, whereas only small differences were observed in hydrological conditions and concentrations of major nutrients and chlorophyll a of pond water. A mid-summer decrease in C isotope composition of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) occurred at WAP 20, likely as a consequence of high pond-water pH and intense C demand by aquatic productivity. These conditions appear to have promoted "chemically enhanced CO2 invasion," which causes strong kinetic C isotope fractionation. High C demand at WAP 20 is also suggested by mid-summer C-13 enrichment in particulate organic matter. In contrast, the ponds with little to no LSG activity exhibited expected seasonal C isotope behavior (i.e., C-13 enrichment of DIC) under conditions of increasing productivity when C is in relatively low demand. Small differences in nutrient concentrations may be due to rapid uptake by the benthic mat at WAP 20. Data from the low disturbance ponds also provide baseline information for future studies assessing potential effects of LSG.

Such storms can produce heavy orographic snowfall, lake-effect snowbands, and even lightning. Unfortunately, precipitation forecast skill is lower over the Intermountain West than other regions of the country because of the complex topography, the lack or limited utility of upstream and in situ data, and insufficient understanding of storm and precipitation processes. The Intermountain Precipitation Experiment (IPEX) is a research program designed to improve the understanding, analysis, and prediction of precipitation over the complex topography of the Intermountain West. The field phase of this research program was held in northern Utah in February 2000. During this time, seven storms were observed, including the heaviest snowfall to strike the Wasatch Mountains in two years, a tornadic bow echo associated with a strong cold front, a mesoscale snowband in Tooele Valley, and three other storms with locally heavy orographic snowfall and complex mesoscale circulations. Some of these storms were electrified and produced lightning. This paper reviews the weather of the Intermountain West, describes the experimental setup and the outreach activities of IPEX, and presents preliminary results from the field phase. Finally, lessons learned in planning and executing this field program are discussed.

Latest Pleistocene to Holocene hydroclimates from Lake Elsinore, California	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The hydroclimate of the southwestern United States (US) region changed abruptly during the latest Pleistocene as the continental ice sheets over North America retreated from their most southerly extent. To investigate the nature of this change, we present a new record from Lake Elsinore, located 36 km inland from the Pacific Ocean in Southern California and evaluate it in the context of records across the coastal and interior southwest United States, including northwest Mexico. The sediment core recovered from Lake Elsinore provides a continuous sequence with multi-decadal resolution spanning 19-9 ka BP. Sedimentological and geochemical analyses reveal hydrologic variability. In particular, sand and carbonate components indicate abrupt changes at the Oldest Dryas (OD), Bolling-Allerod (BA), and Younger Dryas (YD) transitions, consistent with the timing in Greenland. Hydrogen isotope analyses of the C-28 n-alkanoic acids from plant leaf waxes (delta D-wax) reveal a long term trend toward less negative values across 19-9 ka BP. delta D-wax values during the OD suggest a North Pacific moisture source for precipitation, consistent with the dipping westerlies hypothesis. We find no isotopic evidence for the North American Monsoon reaching as far west as Lake Elsinore; therefore, we infer that wet/dry changes in the coastal southwest were expressed through winter-season precipitation, consistent with modern climatology. Comparing Lake Elsinore to other southwest records (notably Cave of Bells and Fort Stanton) we find coincident timing of the major transitions (OD to BA, BA to YD) and hydrologic responses during the OD and BA. The hydrologic response, however, varied during the YD consistent with a dipole between the coastal and interior southwest. The coherent pattern of hydrologic responses across the interior southwest US and northwest Mexico during the OD (wet), the BA (drier), and YD (wet) follows changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, presumably via its combined influence on North Pacific winter storm tracks and the extent/magnitude of the North American Monsoon. In contrast, Lake Elsinore and the coastal southwest experiences a deglacial drying trend punctuated-by abrupt change at the OD to BA and BA to YD transitions. This trend tracks rising greenhouse gases through the deglacial, with an apparent southward shift in westerly moisture sources adjusting to the retreating ice sheet. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, even the relatively poor south-eastern shores were exploited by some Palearctic warblers on spring passage. Numbers and weights of Willow and Garden Warbler were correlated with lakefly abundance. The occurrence of lakefly swarms may trigger the birds' departure to the breeding areas, as the superabundance of food allows For rapid premigratory fattening.																			0030-6525					MAR	2000	71	1-2					194	197		10.1080/00306525.2000.9639910	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00306525.2000.9639910													WOS:000088246100049

The greatest densities and biomasses of P. affinis occurred at 12 m (662 ind./m2 and 118.2 mg dw/m2, respectively) with values decreasing at the shallower and deeper regions. The life cycle of Pontoporeia was one year, with recruitment occurring in April, at which time the majority of the population consisted of individuals <2 mm. Overall the gut content of Pontoporeia was predominantly composed of detritus (97.6%) with algae accounting for 2.3%. Annual production was highest at 12 m (386.2 mg dw/m2) and lowest at 16 m (8.1). The highest production occurred during September, coinciding with the autumn Bacillariophyceae bloom.

To examine the glacial-interglacial hydrological changes in the region, we analyzed the geochemical parameters of a 31-kyr record from Lake Karakul and performed a set of experiments with climate models to interpret the results. delta D values of terrestrial biomarkers showed insolation-driven trends reflecting major shifts of water vapor sources. For aquatic biomarkers, positive delta D shifts driven by changes in precipitation seasonality were observed at ca. 31-30, 28-26, and 17-14 kyr BP. Multiproxy paleoecological data and modelling results suggest that increased water availability, induced by decreased summer evaporation, triggered higher lake levels during those episodes, possibly synchronous to northern hemispheric rapid climate events. We conclude that seasonal changes in precipitation-evaporation balance significantly influenced the hydrological state of a large waterbody such as Lake Karakul, while annual precipitation amount and inflows remained fairly constant.

Sport fish movement responses to a littoral zone coarse woody habitat addition	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												ObjectiveFish movements and distributions throughout an ecosystem are important for understanding ecological interactions, conservation, and management. Coarse woody habitat (CWH) additions are a popular habitat enhancement tool that can influence movements and distributions of fishes; however, behavioral responses in relation to CWH additions are understudied. The objectives of our study were to test for changes in habitat use and behavioral responses of Muskellunge Esox masquinongy, Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu, and Walleye Sander vitreus to CWH additions in a small inland northern lake over 3 years and to evaluate two common forms of fish tracking to estimate daily movement of these fishes.MethodsWe used passive integrated transponder tag data collected continuously at 10 littoral sites and radiotelemetry data collected biweekly during the summer-fall months prior (2017) and following (2018-2019) CWH addition to examine movement behaviors and estimate daily probability of movement for the three species among lake habitats using multistate models.ResultWalleye were the most likely to remain near CWH, followed by Smallmouth Bass and Muskellunge. All species were more likely to move away from the modified and unmodified littoral zones and were more likely to remain in the offshore zone. Increased movement of fish may be in response to CWH creating a refuge for forage fish and subsequent increases in prey search times.ConclusionOur results suggest that CWH additions may alter established species-specific annual movements, distributions, and habitat use to differing degrees in ecosystems, as our results differ from other CWH studies. Methodologically, radio-tagging was most effective for offshore tracking but most labor intensive. Novel passive integrated transponder arrays (less labor intensive once installed) worked well to monitor movement between habitat types in shallow littoral areas. Long-term monitoring of behavioral changes will be essential to assessing the stability changes caused by these habitat alterations. Radio-tagged and PIT-tagged Muskellunge, Smallmouth Bass, and Walleye increased movement among habitats after a littoral zone coarse woody habitat addition in a north temperate lake.Impact statement					Hrabik, Thomas/GYA-2566-2022	Smith, Quinnlan/0000-0001-6850-1504; Sass, Greg/0000-0002-9100-7421; Shaw, Stephanie/0000-0002-1776-1047													0275-5947	1548-8675				APR	2024	44	2					463	491		10.1002/nafm.10995	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10995		MAR 2024											WOS:001193987200001

Although impoundment of reservoirs has been shown to contribute to the net emission of greenhouse gases, reservoir age, geographical distribution, submerged soil type and artificial regulation also have a great impact on their emissions. To examine how large scale reservoir operation impact the water column CO2 and its air-water interface flux, a field study was conducted in 2010 to evaluate potential ecological processes that regulate the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) in the water column in the Pengxi River backwater area (PBA), a typical tributary in the Three Gorges Reservoir, China. Measurements of total alkalinity (TA), pH and water temperature were applied to compute the pCO(2). And this approach was also validated by calculation of pCO(2) from the dissolved inorganic carbon data of samples. Partial least squares (PLS) regression was used to determine how the dynamics of the water pCO(2) were related to the available variables. The estimated pCO(2) in our sample ranged from 26 to 4,087 mu atm in the surface water. During low water operation from July to early September, there was an obvious pCO(2) stratification, and pCO(2) in the surface was almost unsaturated. This phenomenon was also observed in the spring bloom during discharge period. Conversely, there was no significant pCO(2) stratification and the entire water column was supersaturated during high water operation from November to the following February. Significant correlation was observed between the magnitude of pCO(2), DOand chlorophyll a, suggesting that phytoplankton dynamics regulate pCO(2) in the PBA. The average areal rate of CO2 emissions from the Pengxi River ranged from 18.06 to 48.09 mmol m(-2) day(-1), with an estimated gross CO2 emission from the water surface of 14-37 t day(-1) in this area in 2010. Photosynthesis and respiration rates by phytoplankton might be the dominant processes that regulated pCO(2) in the water column. We conclude that pCO(2) values in the surface water of Pengxi River could be regarded as potential sources of CO2 to the atmosphere were smaller or similar to those that have been reported for many other reservoirs to date.

CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												In some littoral systems, abiotic heterogeneity results from the edge of vegetation towards the shore as macrophytes gradually impede mixing between pelagic and littoral water. During the summer of 1994, we investigated whether such abiotic heterogeneity influenced epiphytic midge larvae (Diptera:Chironomidae) inhabiting a stand of Scirpus americanus in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron. After macrophytes became well established, gradients in six parameters of water quality (turbidity, alkalinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, and chloride) formed horizontally from the macrophyte edge towards the shore. In outer portions of the stand where physico-chemical properties were influenced by the influx of pelagic surface waves? chironomid abundance increased to 1076 larvae.stem(-1). Diversity (H') in these areas remained constant over the summer with grazing and filter-feeding taxa equally represented. Further into the macrophyte bed where water quality indicated highly reduced mixing, midge abundance never exceeded 27 individuals.stem(-1) and larval biomass was reduced 2-4 fold. Loss of filter-feeding taxa resulted in a dramatic decline in diversity in these areas after formation of the abiotic gradients. This study suggests that pelagic-littoral water exchange may result in environmental heterogeneity that directly or indirectly influences epiphytic invertebrate community structure and function.					; Cardinale, Bradley/I-7076-2013	Cardinale, Bradley/0000-0002-5591-6206; Brady, Valerie/0000-0002-2575-1017													0706-652X	1205-7533				OCT	1997	54	10					2314	2322		10.1139/cjfas-54-10-2314	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-54-10-2314													WOS:000071517900009

The River Spree in Berlin, Germany, experiences recurrent low flow conditions in summer with seasonal flow reversals in certain sections of the river. This reverse flow leads to the transport of treated wastewater to upstream sections of River Spree and possibly to the introduction of treated wastewater into Lake M & uuml;ggelsee, which is located upstream of the city centre and important for drinking water production via bank filtration in Berlin. A better understanding of the flow and contaminant dynamics in River Spree is required, but field data on the reverse flow are still lacking. In 2022 and 2023, we collected surface water samples to quantify major ions and trace organic contaminants. Over a period of nine months in 2023, we also measured the specific electrical conductivity at six locations with a temporal resolution of five minutes. During summer, the specific electrical conductivity increased at the sampling locations in River Spree upstream of the mouth of the wastewater-impaired River Erpe. The specific electrical conductivity proved to be an indicative parameter for the seasonal dynamics of reverse flow periods. During reverse flow, we observed increased concentrations of wastewater-derived trace organic contaminants, many of which correlated positively with the specific electrical conductivity. Strong differences in the reverse flow intensity between 2022 and 2023 indicate that both precipitation and discharge of the River Spree upstream of Lake M & uuml;ggelsee have a strong influence on the reverse flow. This study demonstrates the applicability of easy-to-measure specific electrical conductivity as a proxy for hydrological conditions and chemical water quality.					; Lewandowski, Jörg/E-9028-2012; Goldhammer, Tobias/LOS-1231-2024; Spahr, Stephanie/AAF-1490-2019	Spahr, Stephanie/0000-0002-3004-3162; Putschew, Anke/0000-0003-0085-6928; 													0885-6087	1099-1085				FEB	2025	39	2							e70084	10.1002/hyp.70084	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.70084													WOS:001420078500001
J	Jiang, J; Yao, SX				Jiang, Jie; Yao, Suxiang			Winter Persistent Extreme Cold Events in Xinjiang Region and Their Associations with the Quasi-Biweekly Oscillation of the Polar Front Jet	ATMOSPHERE												Winter persistent extreme cold events (WPECEs) often cause great damage to the development of economies and people's lives. The sub-seasonal variation of the atmospheric circulation is regarded as one of important causes of extreme weather, and is key to propel the extended period prediction. In this paper, we mainly analyze the WPECEs in Xinjiang region and their relationship with the sub-seasonal variation of the East Asian polar front jet (PFJ). The results suggest the persistent extreme cold event (equal or greater than 7 days) occurs most frequently in Xinhe County of Xinjiang region, with obvious inter-annual and inter-decadal variations. Further analysis shows that the variation of the mean temperature in the key area has characteristics of intra-seasonal variation when the WPECE occurs. The result of composite analysis shows that this intra-seasonal variation is related to the sub-seasonal variation of atmospheric circulation, especially the PFJ anomalous activity near Lake Balkhash. By using the power spectrum analysis method, note that the PFJ activity has the characteristics of quasi-biweekly oscillation (QBWO) in WPECEs. On quasi-biweekly scale (10-20-day filtered), the weakening of PFJ, the intensification of the zonal easterly wind in the upper troposphere, the accumulation of the strong cold air, and the intensification of the meridional northerly wind in the lower troposphere enhance the occurrence of WPECEs in Xinjiang. Further investigation indicates that the quasi-biweekly PFJ mainly propagates eastward and southward before the WPECE occurs in Xinjiang, China.

Determinants of phosphorus levels in danish watercourses, lakes, coastal waters and oceans, 1989-2004	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 16TH IASTED INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON APPLIED SIMULATION AND MODELLING	IASTED International Conference on Modelling and Simulation				16th IASTED International Conference on Applied Simulation and Modelling	AUG 29-31, 2007	Palma de Mallorca, SPAIN	Int Assoc Sci & Technol Dev, IASTED TCMS				Excessive use of natural and artificial fertilizers can lead to phosphorus contamination of surface waters, with potential implications for human and animal health and for the environment. Although not implicated in damage to human health at typical availability, excessive levels of phosphorus can contribute to eutrophication in surface waters. This study provides an analysis of the determinants of phosphorus levels in Danish watercourses, lakes, coastal waters and ocean waters, and it examines the impact of Danish agricultural management policies on these phosphorus levels. Statistical modeling, using ordinary least squares, forms the framework for the analysis. The study has four main findings. First, the Danish Government has used a variety of measures to reduce phosphorus balance in agriculture, including reduced use of natural and man made fertilizers to meet the targeted reduction in phosphorus loadings of eighty percent or 8,050 tonnes P per year. Second, phosphorus balances or inputs have fallen from 15.0 kg/ha in 1989-1992, to 12.0 kg/ha in 1993-1996, to 10.5 kg/ha in 1997-2000 and to 9.5 kg/ha in 2001-2004. Third, phosphorus concentration levels in watercourses have fallen from 0.45 mg/l in 1989-1992, to 0.20 mg/l in 1993-1996, to 0.17 mg/l in 19972000 and to 0.16 mg/l in 2001 -2004 and in lakes have fallen from 0.11 mg/l in 1989-1992, to 0.088 mg/l in 1993-1996, to 0.078 mg/l in 1997-2000 and to 0.095 mg/l in 2001-2004. Fourth, agriculture net phosphorus balances in watercourses, lakes, coastal waters and ocean waters are significantly driven by phosphorus loadings in agricultural soil and by precipitation runoff.																			1021-8181		978-0-88986-687-4				2007							110	114																WOS:000251419200020

J	Livingstone, DM				Livingstone, DM			Ice break-up on southern Lake Baikal and its relationship to local and regional air temperatures in Siberia and to the North Atlantic Oscillation	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The calendar date of ice break-up on southern Lake Baikal has been recorded uninterruptedly since 1869. A strong trend to earlier thawing up to around 1920 (1 d per 3.3 yr) is followed by the lack of any significant trend thereafter. For the period 1931-1994, the timing of break-up is related to local surface air temperatures integrated over periods of 1-3 months. Although highest unimodal correlations an with the 3-month mean air temperature, a bimodal relationship between break-up and air temperature exists at shorter integration times, with break-up date being related not only to the air temperature prevailing during thawing (April) but also to that prevailing during the time of ice formation, when air temperatures are lowest (February). High-frequency (interannual) fluctuations in the timing of break-up appear to be influenced mainly by the air temperatures prevailing during thawing, and low-frequency (interdecadal) fluctuations by those prevailing during ice formation. Whereas correlations with April air temperatures are always significant, those with February air temperatures an only significant during the latter part of this century, i.e., after cessation of the tendency toward earlier thawing. The high correlation between break-up date and integrated air temperature is not merely local but extends over most of Siberia and parts of northern China. Because air temperatures in Siberia contain a strong winter NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation) signal, so does the Lake Baikal break-up date, with up to 14% of the variance in the observed date of break-up being explained by the seasonal NAO index from January to March. As in the case of the air temperature data, a significant NAO signal in the break-up date can be detected only during the latter part of this century, implying that the influence of the NAO on the thawing of Lake Baikal during the early part of this century was probably negligible.																			0024-3590					SEP	1999	44	6					1486	1497		10.4319/lo.1999.44.6.1486	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1999.44.6.1486													WOS:000082201900012

Ratios of community respiration to photosynthesis and rates of primary production in Lake Erie via oxygen isotope techniques	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												To evaluate levels of primary production and community metabolism in Lake Erie, we conducted incubations with O-18-labelled water and determined the ratio of respiration to primary production (R:P) during the summer and early fall of 2002. The epilimnion of Lake Erie was characterized by 6180 values less than 0.7 parts per thousand at all times that reflects a strong contribution of O-2 from primary production. High delta O-18 values (maximum of 6.6 parts per thousand) were common in the O-2 depleted waters of the hypolimnion as a consequence of isotope fractionation during respiration. Hypoxic conditions were evident in the central basin in August when the fractional abundance of O-2 reached a minimum value of 0.04. Rates of primary production variedfirom 0.23 to 1.76 mmol-O(2)(.)m(-3.)h(-1), decreased from west to east in August, and were at a minimum in the central basin in September. Ratios of respiration to photosynthesis (R:P) (determined from the abundance and isotopic composition of dissolved O-2) in the epilimnion as low as 0.45 in July were strong evidence of net autotrophy and preceded the development of hypoxia in August. Net heterotrophy prevailed in August and September. The absolute values of R:P ratios were not indicative of trophic state, however, the wide range of R:P ratios (0.45 to 20.40), fraction of O-2 saturation (0.04 to 1.36), and delta O-18-O-2 (-6.0 to 7.5 parts per thousand) values were all indicative of a eutrophic system. An average isotope fractionation factor for respiration of 7.9 parts per thousand was determined from samples in the hypolimnion in July and August. Based on unique fractionation factors for respiration in the water column (23.5 parts per thousand) and in sediments (3 parts per thousand) we calculate that 61% of hypolimnion O-2 respiration occurs within sediments and 39% occurs within the water column.

J	Eimers, MC; Dillon, PJ; Schiff, SL; Jeffries, DS				Eimers, MC; Dillon, PJ; Schiff, SL; Jeffries, DS			The effects of drying and re-wetting and increased temperature on sulphate release from upland and wetland material	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												In central Ontario, elevated SO4 concentrations and export have been measured in both upland and wetland-draming catchments following summer droughts, although the source of excess SO4 is unclear. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of drying and rewetting and temperature, respectively, on the release Of SO4 from the primary S pools in wetlands (Sphagnum and peat) and uplands (forest floor and mineral soil), using material collected from the PC I catchment in Haliburton County, and from catchment S50 in the Turkey Lakes Watershed. Peat exhibited the most marked response to drying of the four materials considered, and within 24 h of re-wetting dried peat from both catchments released 3-4 times more SO4 (50-67 mg kg(-1) S-SO4) than continuously moist peat (16 mg kg(-1) S-SO4), although temperature had only a marginal effect on SO4 concentrations. There was no immediate response of Sphagnum to either drying or temperature, although S-SO4 concentrations in Sphagnum tended to increase over the 30-day (d) incubation. There was a small but immediate increase in S-SO4 concentrations in forest floor material (LFH) front both catchments within the first 24 h of incubation, which was greatest in treatments that were dried and/or incubated at a higher temperature. In contrast, neither temperature nor drying appeared to affect SO4 release from mineral soil collected from either site. Results of laboratory incubations suggest that increases in SO4 concentration that have been reported in wetland-draining streams immediately following summer dry periods may be quantitatively explained by drying and rewetting of peat rather than increased mineralization in Sphagnum. Similarly, the higher SO4 concentrations that have been measured in upland streams following summer droughts may in part be due to enhanced SO4 release from the forest floor following drying and re-wetting. In contrast, while the mineral soil constitutes a large pool of total S, it does not appear to be responsive to changes in moisture or temperature in the short-term (<30 d) and therefore likely does not contribute to reported climate-related temporal variations in stream SO4.

Interannual Changes in the Quantitative Parameters and Structure of Invertebrates in the Littoral and Pelagic Zones of Lake Sevan (Armenia) with Fluctuations in Meteorological Conditions and Fish Biomass. I. Summer Zooplankton	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												Based on an analysis of interannual changes in the summer zooplankton of the littoral and pelagic zones in Lake Sevan, the relationship between the quantitative characteristics of the communities with the level regime, the amount of precipitation, the average monthly temperature from April to July, and ichthyomass is shown. Fluctuations in the water level are positively correlated with the amount of precipitation. The effect of dilution is detected upon an increasing water level, which indirectly indicates that the amount of accumulated nutrients in the lake exceeds that entering from the catchment area. The increase in the average monthly air temperature from April to July and the increase in the biomass of Prussian carp against the background of the decreasing biomass of whitefishes positively affect most zooplankton parameters. The richest zooplankton community is formed under conditions of low biomass of whitefish, maximum air temperature, and minimum rise in water level. However, the control from planktophages is the leading factor determining the zooplankton state in Lake Sevan. This is evidenced by a significant reduction in quantitative characteristics of plankton invertebrates due to crustaceans with an increase in the biomass of whitefish and a decrease in the biomass of Prussian carp in years with different temperature and level regimes.

Increasing turbulence caused upward fluxes through the thermocline to increase with lake size for nutrients that increased in concentration below the thermocline (soluble reactive Si, total inorganic N, and NO3-; but not total N or any form of P). Precipitation and terrestrial runoff were equally important sources of N and P in all but very small lakes (<100 ha), where precipitation supplied much more than runoff. Runoff was the only important source of Si, except in very large lakes (>100 000 ha) where mixing through the thermocline was important. N-2-fixation was unimportant except in intermediate-sized lakes (700-2000 ha). Si fluxes nearly equaled phytoplankton requirements, but N and P were below requirements, and recycling within the mixed layer must be the most important source of these nutrients. N and P deficits increased progressively with lake size, implying that the efficiency of nutrient recycling increased with take size; mixed layers in large lakes are more turbulent and thicker than in small lakes and these processes increase the probability of nutrient regeneration within the mixed layer.																			0706-652X					DEC	1994	51	12					2756	2768		10.1139/f94-276	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f94-276													WOS:A1994RD71800014

Recent increases in the large glacial-relict calanoid Limnocalanus macrurus in Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Since 2004, population density of the large hypolimnetic calanoid Limnocalanus macrurus Sars. has increased dramatically in Lake Michigan. The average summer biomass of this species between 2004 and 2006 was roughly three times that of the period 1984-2003, and at levels unprecedented in our 22-year dataset, making L. macrurus the dominant zooplankter in the lake in terms of biomass. These increases have been accentuated by coincident population declines of the main daphnid, Daphnia mendotae, in the lake with the result that in 2006, L. macrurus accounted for 75% and 50% of the large (>0.9 mm) crustacean biomass in the northern and southern basins of Lake Michigan, respectively. The increases in L. macrurus Populations have closely coincided with equally dramatic increases in summer water clarity. Recent extinction coefficients are among the lowest recorded for the lake, and deepening light penetration has permitted increases in the size of the deep chlorophyll layer. In addition, planktivorous fish Populations have declined coincidently with the increases in L. macrurus. It seems likely that all increase in sub-epilimnetic production has resulted in increased food resources for the deep-living L. macrurus, while low planktivore abundances have reduced predation loss, permitting L. macrurus to respond to these increases in sub-epilimnetic production.

This allows us to integrate such models with state of the art uncertainty estimation approaches such as Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout without sacrificing the physical consistency of our results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in ensuring better generalizability as well as physical consistency in MC estimates over data collected from Lake Mendota in Wisconsin and Falling Creek Reservoir in Virginia, even with limited training data. We further show that our MC estimates correctly match the distribution of ground-truth observations, thus making the PGA paradigm amenable to physically grounded uncertainty quantification.

Geology, mineralogy, and geochemistry of the Zarloukh Bentonite -Tuff deposit, Hemrin South Mountain, northern Iraq: implications for genesis and geotectonics	TURKISH JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The Quaternary Zarloukh Bentonite -Tuff (ZBT) deposit occurs within the Hemrin South Mountain, northern Iraq. The ZBT deposit occurs as depression-filling exposed on the erosional surface of the siliciclastic Pliocene Muqdadiya Formation and covered by an overburden of recent sediments. The thickness of the studied industrial bentonite bed is similar to 80-100 cm, occurring at the bottom of these depressions, covered by similar to 3-4 m thick bedded volcanic tuff, which also contains many 10-12 cm thick bentonite layers along its bedding planes. The volcanic ash at the bottom of lakes/swamps with shallow water content acted as basins for the deposition of falling volcanic ash, which immersed in water and devitrified to bentonite at a later stage by hydration and chemical interactions, meanwhile the continued fallen ash consolidated as tuff beds protecting the bentonite formed at the bottom of the depressions. The bentonite bed shows mini-scale trough crossbedding as a sign for its formation within a low energy, shallow agitated water in lakes/swamps. The bentonite and its precursor tuff show some differences in the concentration of Ca, Mg, Na, and K representing the exchangeable elements in smectite (montmorillonite), which is the predominant clay mineral in bentonite because of the probable gain of bentonite for these elements during the process of bentonitization of volcanic ash, which also formed the tuff. The ZBT has most probably the same origin as the Hemrin Basalt located NW of ZBT deposit. The chondrite-normalized REEs distribution pattern of ZBT and the Hemrin Basalt is similar, both showing enrichment and negative slope for the LREEs relative to the flat-lying HREEs. The Th vs. Co and the Th/Yb vs. Ta/Yb diagrams indicated that the ZBT and the Hemrin Basalt fall within the field of high-K calc-alkaline basalt and shoshonite and the andesitic basalt-andesite rocks reflecting their common origin.																			1300-0985						2021	30	7					973	989		10.3906/yer-2104-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.3906/yer-2104-3		NOV 2021											WOS:000720950800001

The ratio of the mean crowding to mean density (x*/x) and mean residence depth (MRD) was used to quantitatively evaluate the distribution patterns. The effects of wind velocity and water column temperature differences on the vertical distribution patterns of Microcystis aeruginosa, Aphanizomenonflos-aquae, and total phytoplankton were then investigated. Over 5 days (July 16-20, 2013), abundant of Microcystis aeruginosa (1.10 +/- A 0.40 x 10(9) cells/L), Aphanizomenonflos-aquae (5.11 +/- A 1.38 x 10(7) cells/L), and total phytoplankton (1.24 +/- A 0.40 x 10(9) cells/L, 239.63 +/- A 79.26 mu g/LChl-a, n = 64) were found throughout the water column. Values of x*/x and MRD showed that Microcystis aeruginosa aggregated on the water surface during the calm morning [wind velocity (WV) < 2 m/s], and distributed uniformly in the windy afternoon (WV > 2-3 m/s). Aphanizomenonflos-aquae tended to be randomly distributed for most of the time. Wind velocity was significantly correlated with the x*/x and MRD of Microcystis aeruginosa (P < 0.05), but not with those of Aphanizomenonflos-aquae. Meanwhile, the effects of thermal differentiation on the vertical distributions of all species were not significant. Therefore, the vertical distributions of Microcystis aeruginosa may be determined by wind velocity rather than thermal differentiation in Dianchi Lake.																			1866-6280	1866-6299				SEP	2015	74	5					3805	3814		10.1007/s12665-015-4279-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4279-9													WOS:000360401400012

Diurnal Course of Evaporation From the Dead Sea in Summer: A Distinct Double Peak Induced by Solar Radiation and Night Sea Breeze	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Partitioning between the relative effects of the radiative and aerodynamic components of the atmospheric forcing on evaporation is challenging since diurnal distributions of wind speed and solar radiation typically overlap. The Dead Sea is located about a 100 km off the Eastern Mediterranean coast, where and the Mediterranean Sea breeze front reaches it after sunset. Therefore, in the Dead Sea the peaks of solar radiation and wind speed diurnal cycles in the Dead Sea are distinctly separated in time, offering a unique opportunity to distinguish between their relative impacts on evaporation. We present mid-summer eddy covariance and meteorological measurements of evaporation rate and surface energy fluxes over the Dead Sea. The evaporation rate is characterized by a clear diurnal cycle with a daytime peak, few hours after solar radiation peak, and a nighttime peak coincident with wind speed peak. Evaporation rate is minimum during sunrise and sunset. Measurements of evaporation rate from two other water bodies that are closer to the Mediterranean coast, Eshkol Reservoir, and Lake Kinneret, present a single afternoon peak, synchronous with the sea breeze. The inland diurnal evaporation rate cycle varies with the distance from the Mediterranean coast, following the propagation of sea breeze front: near the coast, wind speed, and radiation peaks are close and consequently a single daily evaporation peak appears in the afternoon; at the Dead Sea, about a 100 km inland, the sea breeze front arrives at sunset, resulting in a diurnal evaporation cycle characterized by a distinct double peak.					; Lensky‬‏, Nadav/AAL-7950-2021; Lensky, Itamar/B-5285-2014	, Nadav/0000-0002-4726-1668; Lensky, Itamar/0000-0001-7594-5277													0043-1397	1944-7973				JAN	2018	54	1					150	160		10.1002/2017WR021536	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017WR021536													WOS:000428474000009

The input variables of Elman's RNN were selected by means of the canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and Chl_a concentration as output variable. Sequentially, the conceptual models for Elman's RNN were established and the Elman models were trained and validated on daily data set. The values of Chl_a concentration computed by the models were closely related to their respective values measured at the three sites. The correlation coefficient (R-2) between the predicted Chl_a concentrations by the model and the observed value were 0.86-0.92. The results show that the CCA can efficiently ascertain appropriate input variables for Elman's RNN and the Elman's RNN can precisely forecast the Chl_a concentration at three different sites in Gonghu Bay of Lake Taihu in summer.																			1951-6851		978-90-78677-77-2				2013	31						329	333																WOS:000327762300080

Here we studied the 2009 and 2010 summerautumn blooms of the toxic, cylindrospermopsin producer, Aphanizomenon ovalisporum (hereafter Aphanizomenon) in Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee), Israel. During the summer the total dissolved phosphate concentration in the lake is very low, close to the detection level, limiting the development of phytoplankton. Earlier we showed that Aphanizomenon blooms are associated with a large rise in alkaline phosphatase (Apase) activity in the water body and that cylindrospermopsin produced by Aphanizomenon induces the PHO regulon, including secretion of Apase, in other alga thereby improving its own phosphate supply. Aphanizomenon transcripts of PHO and AOA (involved in cylindrospermopsin biosynthesis) genes in Lake Kinneret appeared much earlier in 2010 than in 2009 suggesting that the phytoplankton became phosphate-limited already at the beginning of its summer bloom in 2010 but much later in 2009. Water inflow and lake water temperatures were significantly higher in 2010 but the incoming nutrients were consumed by the much larger phytoplankton biomass early in 2010 before the beginning of the Aphanizomenon bloom. An analysis of abiotic and biological parameters provides an explanation for the very different development of Aphanizomenon populations during 2009 and 2010.

Resulting changes in the fish community were compared with three control ponds. Large adult perch dominated communities in the control ponds, suggesting cannibalism was regulating these populations. In two. of the removal ponds, perch removal was largely successful, and a marked increase in the abundance of common bullies occurred. In the third removal pond high juvenile perch recruitment occurred, presumably because of the absence of cannibalistic adult fish. Physical removal appears to be an option for perch control in relatively small lentic habitats and where desirable non-target fish species are present. It is recommended that removals be conducted in autumn to reduce the risk of high juvenile recruitment.

Inner Mongolia was analyzed for species assemblages and shell chemistry of ostracodes to investigate changes in the hydrology and climate of the East Asian summer monsoon margin during the Holocene. Darwinula stevensoni was abundant, Ilyocypris spp. scarce, littoral ostracodes absent and Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca and delta O-18 were low 11,100 to 8300 yr ago, indicating high lake levels and cool/fresh waters. Darwinula stevensoni declined largely. Ilyocypris spp. throve, littoral ostracodes were rare and chemical indicators remained in low values 8300 to 6200 yr ago, suggesting that the lake continued high stands but water became warm. The lake then contracted and water became cool/brackish 6200 to 4300 yr ago. Littoral ostracodes flourished 4300 to 3350 yr ago, marking the lowest lake levels of the entire Holocene. The lake level recovered and water salinity decreased 3350 to 1900 yr ago. From 1900 to 500 yr ago, the lake maintained the preceding status albeit lowered stands and increased salinities 1100 to 800 yr ago. During the recent 500 yr, the lake expanded and water salinity decreased. The data imply that the East Asian summer monsoon did not intensify until 8300 yr ago and weakened dramatically 4300 to 3350 yr ago. (C) 2011 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc.

These englacial water bodies are associated with a dry relict surface basin and consistent with perennial drainage into an interconnected englacial drainage system, which may explain a large englacial outburst flood observed in satellite imagery in the early 2016/17 melt season. Our observations indicate the rarely-documented presence of an englacial hydrological system in Antarctica, with implications for the storage and routing of surface meltwater. Future work should ascertain the spatial prevalence of such systems around the Antarctic coastline, and identify the degree of surface runoff redistribution and storage in the near surface, to quantify their impact on surface mass balance.					; Cook, Sue/E-8390-2018; Schoof, Christian/A-8587-2013	Kulessa, Bernd/0000-0002-4830-4949; Schaap, Thomas/0000-0002-4189-3760; Peters, Leo/0000-0001-8608-9111													0022-1430	1727-5652				FEB	2020	66	255					166	174	PII S0022143019000923	10.1017/jog.2019.92	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jog.2019.92													WOS:000509742700014

The Influence of Legacy P on Lake Water Quality in a Midwestern Agricultural Watershed	ECOSYSTEMS												Decades of fertilizer and manure applications have led to a buildup of phosphorus (P) in agricultural soils and sediments, commonly referred to as legacy P. Legacy P can provide a long-term source of P to surface waters where it causes eutrophication. Using a suite of numerical models, we investigated the influence of legacy P on water quality in the Yahara Watershed of southern Wisconsin, USA. The suite included Agro-IBIS, a terrestrial ecosystem model; THMB, a hydrologic and nutrient routing model; and the Yahara Water Quality Model which estimates water quality indicators in the Yahara chain of lakes. Using five alternative scenarios of antecedent P storage (legacy P) in soils and channels under historical climate conditions, we simulated outcomes of P yield from the landscape, lake P loading, and three lake water quality indicators. Legacy P had a significant effect on lake loads and water quality. Across the five scenarios for Lake Mendota, the largest and most upstream lake, average P yield (kg ha(-1)) varied by -41 to +22%, P load (kg y(-1)) by -35 to +14%, summer total P (TP) concentration (mg l(-1)) by -25 to +12%, Secchi depth (m) by -7 to +3%, and the probability of hypereutrophy by -67 to +34%, relative to baseline conditions. The minimum storage scenario showed that a 35% reduction in present-day loads to Lake Mendota corresponded with a 25% reduction in summer TP and smaller reductions in the downstream lakes. Water quality was more vulnerable to heavy rainfall events at higher amounts of P storage and less so at lower amounts. Increases in heavy precipitation are expected with climate change; therefore, water quality could be protected by decreasing P reserves.

J	Wu, XH; Ferguson, IJ; Jones, AG				Wu, XH; Ferguson, IJ; Jones, AG			Magnetotelluric response and geoelectric structure of the Great Slave Lake shear zone	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												The Great Slave Lake shear zone (GSLsz) is a northeast-trending 25-km-wide dextral continental transform fault from the foothills of the Rocky Mountains in northeast British Columbia to the southeast side of Great Slave Lake. Based on its magnetic expression the GSLsz can be correlated for at least 1300 km, mostly in the subsurface. Magnetotelluric (MT) soundings were made at 60 sites in the southwest part of the Northwest Territories., Canada, along the LITHOPROBE Slave-Northern Cordillera Lithospheric Evolution (SNORCLE) Transect Corridors 1 and 1A, in the Summer and Autumn of 1996. Of these, 15 sites were along Corridor 1A which crossed the GSLsz, the Great Bear magmatic arc and Hay River terrane to the northwest of the shear zone, and the Buffalo Head terrane to the southeast. The primary objective of the Corridor 1A deployments was to image the structure of the GSLsz. Analysis of MT data indicates that along the Corridor 1A the resistivity structure is approximately 1D at shallow depth ( < 1km) corresponding to Phanerozoic sedimentary rocks, 2D in the upper to mid crust with a strike similar to N30degreesE, and approximately 2D in the lower crust to lithospheric mantle with a strike of similar to N60degreesE. The direction in the upper crust is interpreted to represent the local-scale ( < 50 km) horizontal strike of the GSLsz whereas the direction in the mantle is parallel to the larger-scale strike of the GSLsz. 2D inversions of the MT data reveal that the GSLsz forms a crustal-scale resistive zone ( > 5000 Omegam) that is spatially correlated with a magnetic low. The GSLsz comprises greenschist to granulite facies mylonites, Its high resistivity is interpreted to be due to the resistive nature of the granitic protolith of the mylonites and that mylonites are dominated by rocks deformed in the ductile regime. To the northwest of GSLsz the MT profile reveals crustal conductors beneath the Great Bear magmatic arc and Hay River terrane. The enhanced conductivity occurring beneath the Great Bear magmatic arc is interpreted to be caused by electronic conduction within deformed and metamorphosed rocks of the Hottah terrane or the Coronation Supergroup. The MT results also reveal a mantle conductor beneath the margin of the Hottah terrane and Great Bear magmatic arc that is interpreted to be associated with the subduction of oceanic lithosphere. A second mantle conductor to the southeast is truncated at the GSLsz suggesting an older source for the enhanced conductivity and that the GSLsz includes significant strike-slip motion of sub-crustal lithosphere.

Two of the dye tracing tests showed that groundwater flows in the Piora Aquifer from the Piora Valley to springs in the adjacent Santa Maria Valley, and even further east to the di Campo Valley considerably outside of the Piora Valley surface water divide. Lake Ritom located in the Piora Valley loses water only to the Canaria Valley outside of the lake's surface-water watershed at the lake's western margin when lake levels are above 1,835 m above sea level. Dye tracing tests show that a major sinkhole in the Piora Valley, Calderoni Sinkhole, is located precisely on the water divide where subsurface flow in the Piora Valley and surface water diverge and move in opposite directions. The dye tracing results also showed no hydraulic connection between surface water in the Piora Valley and the famous Pertusio Spring, located in the upper Santa Maria Valley. Only a small amount of dye from the two dye tracing tests done in 1993 and 1997 entered an exploratory gallery built to test the viability of the Alp-Transit tunnel, being built in competent rock under the Triassic Piora Aquifer, effectively perched above.																			1431-2174					APR	2003	11	2					228	239		10.1007/s10040-002-0237-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-002-0237-1													WOS:000183197800004

However, an inappropriate dredging time may contribute to rather than inhibit the formation of black blooms. To determine the optimum dredging time, four treatments were simulated with sediment samples collected from Lake Taihu: dredging in January 2014 (DW), April 2014 (DA), July 2014 (DS), and no dredging (UD). Results showed that typical characteristics associated with black blooms, such as high levels of nutrients (NH4 (+)-N and PO4 (3-)-P), Fe2+, aS(2-) ([HS-] + [S2-]), and volatile organic sulfur compounds (VOSCs), including dimethyl sulfide (DMS), dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), and dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS), were more effectively suppressed in the water column by DW treatment than by UD treatment and the other two dredging treatments. The highest concentrations of NH4 (+)-N and PO4 (3-)-P in the UD water column were 4.09 and 4.03 times, respectively, those in the DW water column. DMS levels in the UD and DS water columns were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those in the DW water column, but DMDS and DMTS levels were not significantly different between the treatments. After several months of dredging, surface sediments of the DW and DA treatments were well oxidized, and concentrations of Fe2+ and aS(2-) were lower than those in UD and DS treatments because of material circulation between sediments and the water column. Water content, which is important for the transport of matter to the overlying water, was lower in the dredged sediments than in the undredged sediments. These factors can suppress the release of Fe2+ and aS(2-) into the water column, thereby inhibiting the formation of black blooms. Black coloration occurred in the UD water column on the seventh day, 2 days later, and earlier, respectively, than the DW and DS water columns and almost on the same day as in the DA water column. This phenomenon is mainly attributed to the oxidation of the new sediment surface in the DW and DA water columns, suppressing the release of sulfur into the water column, because of a long incubation period. Thus, dredging in the winter can prevent the formation of black blooms, while dredging in summer may contribute to them.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				JUL	2016	23	14					14636	14645		10.1007/s11356-016-6627-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6627-z								27072029					WOS:000379553500092

Relationship between Water Withdrawals and Freshwater Ecosystem Water Scarcity Quantified at Multiple Scales for a Great Lakes Watershed	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												Even in relatively water-rich regions, withdrawal and consumption of water has the potential to create instream freshwater ecosystem water scarcity, especially at seasonal and local scales. Water resource policy must balance consumptive uses of water against corresponding ecosystem impacts of flow depletion. In this study, the concept of an adverse resource impact threshold, as established by the Michigan Water Withdrawal Assessment Process, is applied in conjunction with a water use database to identify the cause, location, and scale in space and time of instream freshwater ecosystem water scarcity caused by consumptive uses of water. The study results show that there is a strong multiscalar linear relationship between freshwater consumption, adverse resource impact ecological flow thresholds, and spatial scale. On average and at the whole-watershed scale, water scarcity does not exist in this watershed, but water scarcity does occur on a localized basis, especially in the summer and at small watershed scales of less than 300 km(2), because of a combination of irrigation withdrawals, concentrated urban withdrawals, and low ecological flow thresholds. The aggregated effects of localized flow depletion also affect 800-2,000 km(2) scale catchments. Management of water scarcity in water-rich areas should therefore focus on the spatio-temporal locations where the impacts occur and where an average pattern of water abundance yields to localized scarcity, in this case during late summer months in subwatersheds smaller than 300 km(2). This analysis informs integrated water resources management approaches, contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between scale and environmental impact as water is shared among competing uses, and sheds light on the use of adverse resource impact ecological flow thresholds to define water scarcity in relatively water-rich regions. These results may be generalized to inform the implementation of the Michigan Water Withdrawal Assessment Process and similar processes throughout the Great Lakes region and in water-rich locations around the world where water is generally abundant but localized water scarcity is becoming an increasingly important issue.

They turned to be smaller in comparison to those caused by clear-cuttings, which was demonstrated on the example of selected indices (SCP, SBO) and SCP/SBO model analysis. Increase in regression changes in carabid assemblages with the increase of the pressure from water-tourists was shown. It was demonstrated on the basis of reduction of the frequency of autumn species, increase of the number of small zoophages and replacement of the higrophilous species with mezophilous ones. Higher pressure resulted in higher standardised number of species as well. However, achieved results suggest that changes in the environment arc not so heavy, they are important for forest economy.																			0039-7660					AUG	2008	152	8					35	46																WOS:000261781000004

The outdoor painting is very easily to be affected by the natural environment and its color is easily to decay. In order to study the relationship between the painting decay and the physical environment, the two paintings on both east and west inner eaves of Jilan Pavilion beside the Kunming Lake in Summer Palace are taken as the research objects, because these two paintings are painted at the same period but their decay degrees are greatly different. Since 2013, the research group regularly monitors the color decay of these two paintings. Meanwhile, the physical environment around these two paintings has been monitored. Based on the analysis of the monitor data, it can be seen that the illumination is the major factor that causes the decay of the painting. Meanwhile, by using the ECOTECT software to stimulate the light environment around the Jilan Pavilion, it can be seen that it is the mirror reflection of the lake that causes the result that the illumination of the west eave (face east) is stronger than that of the east eave (face west).

This study focuses on Marguerite Bay, located in the south-central Antarctic Peninsula. We dated raised beaches to investigate relative sea-level changes using the cosmogenic surface exposure (10Be) 10 Be) method. Previous studies have provided valuable insights into the region's glacial history, but limitations in dating techniques and age estimates necessitate further investigation. By analysing raised shingle beaches in Gaul Cove of Horseshoe Island and the southern coast of Calmette Bay, this research aims to contribute relative sea-level change history for these areas. In Horseshoe Island's Gaul Cove, raised beaches clustered on prominent steps reveal a 15 m relative sea-level change over the last 3.31 ka. Differently, Calmette Bay exhibits a 36 m relative sea-level fall over the last 7.29 ka. These findings indicate significant and differential glacial-isostatic adjustments in both regions during the middle and late Holocene. Additionally, our data reveal accelerated sea-level fall periods corresponding to Holocene deglaciation and glacial advance events, indicating the shorelines' relative sea-level change sensitivity to climate change.					; YILDIRIM, Cengiz/K-8405-2018; Hidy, Alan/G-1862-2012; Ciner, Attila/K-7531-2018; Sarıkaya, Mehmet/ABA-9369-2020	Hidy, Alan/0000-0003-2916-1425; YILDIRIM, Cengiz/0000-0001-5253-028X; Ciner, Attila/0000-0002-6755-8426; 													0277-3791	1873-457X				NOV 15	2024	344								108995	10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108995	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108995		OCT 2024											WOS:001334002800001

Therefore, groundwater quality, seasonal variations and its suitability for drinking, irrigation and industrial usage were evaluated. In this study, 56 water samples were collected from springs, wells, and lake in dry and wet seasons. Ca-Mg-HCO3, Mg-Ca-HCO3, Na-CO3-Cl, and Na-HCO3-Cl water types are the dominant water types in the investigation area. Parameters, which are controlled to chemical variations of groundwater, were analyzed with R-mode factor and correlation analysis. According to R-mode factor analysis, total dissolved solids, Na, Cl, HCO3, and NH3 are the most important parameters. In addition, Water Quality Index (WQI) was applied to suitability for drinking purpose and to investigation of groundwater quality. Quality of groundwaters are suitable for drinkable both dry and wet season in study area. In terms of the irrigation and industrial usage, generally groundwater is suitable in dry season but is not suitable in wet season.

Project LEE documented, for the first time, the total lightning and electrical charge structures of lake-effect storms and the associated storm environment using a lightning mapping array (LMA), a mobile dual-polarization X-band radar, and balloon-based soundings that measured vertical profiles of temperature, humidity, wind, electric field, and hydrometeor types. LEE also observed abundant wind turbine-initiated lightning, which is climatologically more likely during the winter. The frequent occurrence of intense lake-effect storms and the proximity of a wind farm with nearly 300 turbines each more than 100 m tall to the lee of Lake Ontario provided an ideal laboratory for this study. The field project involved many undergraduate (>20) and graduate students. Some foreseen and unforeseen challenges included clearing the LMA solar panels of snow and continuous operation in low-sunlight conditions, large sonde balloons prematurely popping due to extremely cold conditions, sonde line breaking, recovering probes in deep snow in heavily forested areas, vehicles getting stuck in the snowpack, and an abnormally dry season for parts of the LEE domain. In spite of these difficulties, a dataset was collected in multiple lake-effect snowstorms (11 observation periods) and one extratropical cyclone snowstorm that clarifies the electrical structure of these systems. A key finding was the existence of a near-surface substantial positive charge layer (1 nC m-3) near the shoreline during lake-effect thunderstorms.

The total magnitude of these changes results from multiple interactions among these drivers. Field measurements can address the overall responses to different changing drivers, but are less capable of quantifying the interactions among them. Currently, a comprehensive assessment of the drivers of ecosystem changes, and the magnitude of their direct and indirect impacts on subarctic ecosystems, is missing. The Tornetrask area, in the Swedish subarctic, has an unrivalled history of environmental observation over 100 years, and is one of the most studied sites in the Arctic. In this study, we summarize and rank the drivers of ecosystem change in the Tornetrask area, and propose research priorities identified, by expert assessment, to improve predictions of ecosystem changes. The research priorities identified include understanding impacts on ecosystems brought on by altered frequency and intensity of winter warming events, evapotranspiration rates, rainfall, duration of snow cover and lake-ice, changed soil moisture, and droughts. This case study can help us understand the ongoing ecosystem changes occurring in the Tornetrask area, and contribute to improve predictions of future ecosystem changes at a larger scale. This understanding will provide the basis for the future mitigation and adaptation plans needed in a changing climate.

The cells of the novel isolate were Gram-positive, spore-forming, short rods. The bacterium grew chemolithoautotrophically on CO, producing equimolar quantities of H-2 and CO2 (according to the equation CO + H2O -> CO2 + H-2), and in the absence of CO, under N-2 in the gas phase, chemoorganolneterotrophically with yeast extract, sucrose or pyruvate. Growth was observed in the temperature range 50-70 degrees C, with an optimum at 60 degrees C, and in the pH range 6.2-8.0, with an optimum at pH 6.8. The micro-organism did not grow on solid media; it was able to grow only in semi-solid medium containing 0.5% agar. The generation time under optimal conditions for chemolithoautotrophic growth was 1 h. The G+C content of the DNA was 46.5 +/- 1 mol%. Growth was completely inhibited by penicillin, novobiocin, streptomycin, kanamycin and neomycin. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that the isolate should be assigned to the genus Carboxydocella. On the basis of the results of DNA-DNA hybridization and morphological and physiological analyses, strain KarT represents a novel species of the genus Carboxydocella, for which the name Carboxydocella sporoproducens sp. nov, is proposed. The type strain is Kar(T) (= DSM 16521(T) = VKM B-2358(T)).

J	Katz, A; Starinsky, A				Katz, Amitai; Starinsky, Abraham			Geochemical History of the Dead Sea	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The evolution of the Dead Sea basin (DSB) brines from their birth in a Pliocene lagoon to their accommodation in the Dead Sea is described and discussed. The history of the brines is divided into two periods, corresponding to the successive depositional environments that prevailed in the DSB, namely a marine lagoon and an inland saline lake. Ancient Mediterranean seawater, supplied into the DSB lagoon through an inland channel from the north, was concentrated by evaporation into the halite field. The resulting Mg-enriched solution dolomitized surrounding, upper Cretaceous limestone, losing most of its Mg2+ to the limestone in exchange for Ca2+. Cretaceous marine Sr2+, concurrently released from the limestone into the brine, lowered its (Pliocene time) Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios. Consequently, a Ca-chloridic solution with lowered Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios was formed. Frequently changing conditions along the active Dead Sea rift enabled back-flow of the Ca-chloridic brines to the DSB, where they mixed with fresh seawater, unloading into the mixture their limestone-Sr. This process is reflected by the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (0.7082-0.7087) in the lagoon's gypsum, dolomite, aragonite, and halite, which is intermediate between that of Pliocene seawater (0.709) and that in the upper Cretaceous limestone (0.7074-0.7077). Disconnection of the lagoon from the ancient Mediterranean brought about its end, and opened the (ongoing) lacustrine chapter of the DSB, without interrupting the reflux of Ca-chloride brine back into the basin. By that time, the chloridic brines processed by the lagoon became locked in a large, almost closed system reservoir in the DSB and vicinity. We propose that a Ca-chloridic lake, the DSB Lake, which was recharged by fresh runoff and by the returning brine, was born and existed in the DSB as of that time. Based on oxygen isotope data, the origin of the freshwater H2O was in Mediterranean rain. Geological evidence and theoretical calculations constrain the frequent fluctuations of the DSB Lake stand within a minimum of 430-450 and a maximum of 165 mbsl, and its corresponding salinity shifts to within 90 and 340 g l(-1), relating these extremes to specific points in time and in the rock sequence. Stratification of the water column, brought about by increase in the inflow/evaporation ratio of the DSB Lake, was a frequent and normal situation, and accounts for the abundant, fine aragonite-detritus lamination in large parts of the DSB section. It is shown that aragonite laminae thicker than 0.1-0.2 mm are not annual deposits but accumulated during several years. Dissolved bicarbonate accumulated in the upper part of the rising lake water column, and was used up for aragonite crystallization upon the subsequent lake decline. Detritus laminae were formed during the respective winter seasons. While remaining Ca-chloridic throughout, the DSB Lake's composition changed in time as a result of: (a) mixing with fresh waters; (b) removal of the SO42- and HCO3- imported into the lake in CaCO3 and CaSO4 minerals. A mass-balance model, explaining the change in the Mg/Ca ratio in the DSB Lake from its initial value (similar to 0.16) is proposed, and its results are compatible with the composition of the saline springs. It demonstrates that the change in the Mg/Ca ratio in the DSB Lake is mainly caused by removal of Ca from the lake, required to compensate for the Ca < (SO4 +HCO3) relationship in the inflow freshwaters. The Mg/Ca ratio in the Dead Sea fluctuated between 4.2 and 4.6 during the last 50 years or so. Insufficient resolution makes it impossible to determine whether the observed changes vary systematically in time. Saline spring waters flow into and mix with the lake, evaporating together, thereby contributing their salts and changing the Dead Sea's composition. The change is expressed in depletion of Ca, and in the enrichment of the lake in Mg, K, and Br, which do not form independent minerals therein. An attempt to predict the future of the Dead Sea is presented based on the chemical composition of brine in recent sinkholes developing along the Dead Sea coast, as well as on thermodynamic modeling of the Dead Sea brine evolution. The sinkhole brines are compatible with evaporative evolution of Dead Sea water and display salinities up to similar to 550 g l(-1), within the bischofite range. Thermodynamic simulation predicts as well, that under current conditions Dead Sea water may evaporate to a level of not much below 550 mbsl. Simulated evaporation of Dead Sea water to a concentration factor of 50 yielded a 90 m thick column of chloride minerals containing halite, carnallite, bischofite, tachyhydrite, and CaCl2 center dot 4H(2)O (by that order).																			1380-6165	1573-1421				FEB	2009	15	1-2					159	194		10.1007/s10498-008-9045-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10498-008-9045-0													WOS:000264831200007
J	Hui, PH; Fang, J				Hui Pinhong; Fang Juan			Comparison of the multi-scale features in two persistent heavy rainfall events in the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River	JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH												Two persistent heavy rainfall (PHR) events in the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River (MLYR) occurring in June 1982 and 1998 are studied in this paper. Though both events happened in the Meiyu season, their large-scale background and developing processes were quite different. During the PHR event in 1982, the Lake Baikal area was occupied by a strong westerly trough and the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) was stronger and more westward-extending than the normal years. Under such a condition, the cold-dry air and warm-moist air were continuously transported to the MLYR and favored the PHR there. For the event in 1998, the WPSH was similar to that in 1982, while the westerly trough in the Lake Baikal area was comparatively weak and a shortwave trough situating in East China contributed to advect cold-dry air to the MLYR. It is found that the high-latitude trough was closely related to the 10-30-day low-frequency oscillation while the anomaly of WPSH was linked with the combined effect of both 30-60- and 10-30-day low-frequency oscillations in the PHR event in 1982. By contrast, the 60-day low-pass perturbation demonstrated positive impact on the westward extension of WPSH and development of the Baikal trough while the 30-60-day oscillation played a role in strengthening the shortwave trough in East China and the WPSH in the case of 1998. Though the low-latitude 30-60-day oscillations contributed to the intensification and westward extension of the WPSH in both PHR events, their evolution exhibited evident differences. In the 1982 case, the 30-60-day anomalies originated from the western Indian Ocean were much more like the Madden-Julian Oscillation, while its counterpart in the 1998 case was much more similar to the first mode of the boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation.																			2095-6037	2198-0934				JUN	2016	30	4					528	546		10.1007/s13351-016-6028-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13351-016-6028-8													WOS:000382334400006

Postglacial relative sea level change at Fildes Peninsula, King George Island (West Antarctic)	LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW												Analysis and integration of data obtained in our field and laboratory investigations of 2008-2012 together with results of previous paleogeographic studies were conducted to reveal parameters and factors of the post-glacial changes in the relative sea-level on the Fildes Peninsula and the King George Island. Results of dating of organic material taken from cross-sections of Quaternary deposits, data on morphology of marine landforms as well as on bottom sediments in lakes were used to construct a curve of changes in the relative sea-level. Our research has shown that the rapid rise of relative sea level in the area (since the beginning of the Holocene) decelerated about 8000 years BP, achieving its maximum about 7000 years BP. This was followed by the fall of relative sea-level (the land elevation) by 18-20 m in total, and it was characterized by relatively high rate of fall during periods of 60005000 years BP, 4000-2500 years BP, and during the last 1500 years; the rate decreased in 5000-4000 years BP and 25001600 years BP. The changes in relative sea level in this region were determined by the following factors: the eustatic component of the global changes in sea-level and, possibly, oscillations in the global sea level of another nature; local parameters of the Last glacial maximum; a course of the Peninsula deglaciation; regional physical characteristics of the Earth's crust and the mantle substances; local tectonic processes, including the isostatic rebound. Since the beginning of the Holocene up to about 7000 years BP, the main contribution to changes of the relative sea-level in this area was made by the global eustatic factor. The subsequent fall of the relative sea-level (elevation of the Peninsula surface) proceeded under condition of reduced role of the eustatic factor and predominance of other factors.																			2076-6734	2412-3765					2016	56	1					93	102		10.15356/2076-6734-2016-1-93-102	http://dx.doi.org/10.15356/2076-6734-2016-1-93-102													WOS:000408235500009

Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the closest relatives of strain Chen16-4(T) were Sphingobium amiense YTT, Sphingobium yanoikuyae GIFU 9882(T) and Sphingobium scionense WP01(T), with sequence similarities of 97.6, 97.1 and 97.0%, respectively. A phylogenetic tree obtained with 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain Chen16-4(T) and these three closest relatives formed an independent phylogenetic clade within the genus Sphingobium. The polar lipid pattern, the presence of spermidine and ubiquinone Q-10, the predominance of C-18:1 omega 7c in the cellular fatty acid profile and the DNA G + C content also supported affiliation of the isolate to the genus Sphingobium. The DNA DNA relatedness of strain Chen16-4(T) with respect to recognized species of the genus Sphingobium was less than 70%. On the basis of the genotypic, chemotaxonomic and phenotypic data, strain Chen16-4(T) represents a novel species in the genus Sphingobium, for which the name Sphingobium fontiphilum sp. nov. is proposed.

J	Blass, A; Anselmetti, FS; Ariztegui, D				Blass, A; Anselmetti, FS; Ariztegui, D			60 years of glaciolacustrine sedimentation in Steinsee (Sustenpass, Switzerland) compared with historic events and instrumental meteorological data	ECLOGAE GEOLOGICAE HELVETIAE												The high-alpine Steinsee (1.930 m a.s.l.) is a proglacial lake located in front of an oscillating icefront since 1924. The existing well-documented glacial and climatic history of the area can be compared with the last 60 years of continuous sedimentation. This lake provides thus a unique opportunity to quantify erosional and depositional processes in proglacial lacustrine settings. High-resolution seismic profiles (3.5 kHz) pictured the architecture of the glaciolacustrine deposits in a quasi 3-D mode indicating that about 5 in of sediments have been accumulated in the central part of the basin in only 60 years of the lake's existence. A set of vibrocores allowed further quantification and description of the glaciolacustrine sediments. Partially layered deposits of sand and gravel at the bottom of the cores are interpreted as a mixture of allo-moraines and lacustrine sediments that are overlain by a about 0.5 in thick graded unit deposited during a catastrophic lake outburst. The uppermost halves of the cores are characterized by very fine laminae of sand to silty clay. Cs-137 dating of these deposits confirmed the annual character of the laminae that are, therefore, true glacial varves. However, these varves are not simply light-coloured coarse, and dark-coloured fine couplets, as known from other proglacial lakes. They are rather finely-laminated deposits with variable grain size and thickness that can be bundled in an annual package capped by a silty clay layer, deposited during the winter months below the ice. High sedimentation rates occurred when the glacier tongue directly entered the lake whereas they are comparatively lower when the glacier tongue retreated behind the delta. Strong summer rainfalls deliver large quantities of sediment suspension in the meltwater discharge triggering the formation of density currents in the lake along the delta front. The instrumental data combined with an accurate age model indicate that not every strong precipitation event has triggered the formation of a turbidite. Thus, other additional factors such as sediment availability are playing a critical role in causing turbidite deposits.

J	Górniak, A; Piekarski, K				Górniak, A; Piekarski, K			Seasonal and multiannual changes of water levels in lakes of northeastern Poland	POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES												Seasonal and multiannual hydrological changes were analysed in seven lakes of northeastern Poland on the basis of a 40-year series of everyday observations of the water level in the years 1961-2000. In the unmodified hydrological lakes occurs an unimodal cycle of variation in the water level with a spring maximum, whose magnitude depends on atmospheric precipitation in the form of snow in the period December-March. In lakes with hydrology transformed by man, seasonal water level changes depend on their economic function in the catchment. An anthropogenic increase in the amplitude of the varying water level in lakes is the factor intensifying the eutrophication of water bodies. Multiannual cycles of variation in lake levels take different spans of time depending on hydrological characters of the lakes.																			1230-1485						2002	11	4					349	354																WOS:000176505600009

The springs are highly acidic-sulphate waters with temperatures approaching boiling point, whereas gas chemistry is characterized by typical magmatic species, such as SO2, HF HCl, H-2, and CO. From February 1998 new fumarolic fields formed inside the southern part of the crater. They moved anticlockwise from the S to the NE inner walls of the crater, while those located in the southern part of the crater and close to the pyroelastic cone south of the crater lake diminished or disappeared altogether, during 1999 and 2000. This shift was also characterized by chemical variation of the magmatic gas species. In spite of the chemical changes of fumaroles, the composition of the lake changed little during this time. This fact, together with the chemical profile with depth of the lake, suggests that the lake is a very efficient condenser of magmatic fluids. An apparent chemical stratification of the lake suggests that dilution with meteoric water is not complete, due to the presence of liquid sulphur at the lake bottom and/or due to the continuous influx of new magmatic components.

J	Sun, WW; Liu, EF; Zhang, EL; Shen, J				Sun, Weiwei; Liu, Enfeng; Zhang, Enlou; Shen, Ji			Geochemistry of the holocene sediments of Lake Chenghai, SW China, and its implications for paleoenvironmental reconstruction	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Analysis of lake sediment geochemistry is valuable for understanding past hydroclimatic changes via the reconstruction of changes in catchment erosion, chemical weathering, redox processes and the intensity of evaporation. In this study, we analyzed the geochemical composition, magnetic susceptibility and carbonate content of the Holocene sediments of Lake Chenghai in the Jinsha River valley, southwest China. Our aims were to determine the influence of Holocene hydroclimate evolution and geo-hazards on lacustrine sedimentation. The results show that the hydroclimate was generally humid during 7.57-4.65 cal ka BP, and that subsequently it became relatively dry during 4.65-1.37 cal ka BP. Our results also reveal that the centennial scale variability of the lake level during the Holocene is forced by changes in solar activity and oceanic-atmospheric feedback. In addition, the interval of 3.31-1.95 cal ka BP was the driest, due to highly variable and intense El Nino events, and the southward migration of the intertropical convergence zone. Furthermore, three large landslide events occurred at 7.30, 6.36 and 0.76 cal ka BP around Lake Chenghai, which are correlated with unusually large floods during the period of weakened monsoon activity, and/or with earthquake events.					sun, weiwei/GQG-8925-2022														1040-6182	1873-4553				JUL 20	2019	523						80	88		10.1016/j.quaint.2019.06.028	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2019.06.028													WOS:000486450700009

Removal of microcystin-LR from water by ozonation	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING III					3rd Congress of Environmental Engineering	SEP 13-16, 2009	Lublin, POLAND					In temperate climates, cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) occur most frequently in summer, when the demand for recreational water is highest. Blue-green algae can produce toxins and are also responsible for the taste and odour of water, which significantly impairs its quality. Cyanotoxins are very dangerous substances which can intoxicate hepatocytes and the nervous system in humans and animals. To prevent such situations, it is very important to remove cyanotoxins from water effectively during the pretreatment process. In the present study, the ozonation of water containing microcystin-LR was tested. We performed this research at the laboratory scale as well as in a pretreatment plant near the Sulejow artificial lake during several seasons.

Late Holocene moisture balance variability in the southwest Yukon territory, Canada	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Analyses of sediment cores from Marcella Lake, a small, hydrologically closed lake in the semi-arid southwest Yukon, provides effective moisture information for the last similar to 4500 years at century-scale resolution. Water chemistry and oxygen isotope analyses from lakes and precipitation in the region indicate that Marcella Lake is currently enriched in O-18 by summer evaporation. Past lake water values are inferred from oxygen isotope analyses of sedimentary endogenic carbonate in the form of algal Charophyte stem encrustations. A record of the delta O-18 composition of mean annual precipitation at Jellybean Lake, a nearby evaporation-insensitive system, provides data of simultaneous delta O-18 variations related to decade-to-century scale shifts in Aleutian Low intensity/position. The difference between the two isotope records, Delta delta, represents O-18-enrichment in Marcella Lake water caused by summer effective moisture conditions. Results indicate increased effective moisture between similar to 3000 and 1200 cal BP and two marked shifts toward increased aridity at similar to 1200 and between 300 and 200 cal BP. These prominent late Holocene changes in effective moisture occurred simultaneously with changes in Aleutian Low circulation patterns over the Gulf of Alaska indicated by Jellybean Lake. The reconstructed climate patterns are consistent with the topographically controlled climatic heterogeneity observed in the coastal mountains and interior valleys of the region today.

J	JACOBSON, G; JANKOWSKI, J				JACOBSON, G; JANKOWSKI, J			GROUNDWATER-DISCHARGE PROCESSES AT A CENTRAL AUSTRALIAN PLAYA	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Water balance studies have been undertaken at a groundwater-discharge playa (Spring Lake) near Curtin Springs, in arid central Australia. Hydraulic calculations indicate that the groundwater inflow to the playa is about 2000 m3d-1. This is equivalent to evaporative discharge, integrated over the playa surface area (15 km2), of about 49 mm yr-1. As the mean annual rainfall is 226 mm the total evaporative discharge is about 275 mm yr-1. Measured water losses from the playa surface during a 3-month dry period, July-September 1985, ranged from 0.28 to 0.45 mm d-1. This is of the expected order of magnitude for the cooler half of the year. The rate of water loss is variable over the playa surface. The playa is surrounded by sand dunes. Monitoring of water level fluctuations indicates that annual rainfall events induce groundwater recharge in the playa-marginal zone where the water table is within 4 m of the ground surface. Evaporation from the playa has resulted in the development of highly saline brines, with density 1.20 or more and containing more than 250 g l-1 total dissolved solids. The brines are sodium chloride waters with appreciable magnesium and sulphate. At the playa margin, a transition zone has developed between saline regional groundwaters which underlie sand dunes, and the playa hypersaline brines. Salt may be diffusing downwards beneath the regional groundwaters. Gypsum is precipitating in the playa. The effects of seasonal and longer term drought are shown by the development of gypsum fields on the playa bed and playa-marginal gypsum terraces which are later colonized by halophytic plants. Long-term reduction in groundwater head results in the vegetation of playas which, no longer actively discharging groundwater, become susceptible to alluviation or aeolian sand drift. Thus playas migrate by a process, playa capture, analogous to river capture, but induced by groundwater head decay.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				FEB 28	1989	105	3-4					275	295		10.1016/0022-1694(89)90109-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-1694(89)90109-1													WOS:A1989T535700005

Jason			Direct evidence of ancient shock metamorphism at the site of the 1908 Tunguska event	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Shock metamorphism is rarely found at the surface of the Earth. The most used structures to identify shock metamorphism are "true Planar Deformation Features" (PDFs) in quartz, now accepted as diagnostic indicators of a meteorite impact. Here we present several lines of evidence for shock metamorphism and PDFs developed in quartz occurring on samples centered on a circular geological structure on Mount Stojkovic (60 degrees 54'06 '' N; 101 degrees 55'40 '' E), which lies within southern surface exposures of the Siberian Traps. The shock event appears to have occurred during the eruption of the surface Siberian Traps basalts that cover this region. Curiously, Mount Stojkovic lies within similar to 3 km of the tree fall epicenter of the 1908 Tunguska event. Based on current estimates of the Phanerozoic impact distribution, there is at most a I in similar to 17000 chance that the 1908 bolide would randomly fall on the site of a previous impact structure capable of creating shocked quartz. Just as improbable would be an airbust event, incapable of creating a small crater, that could have produced shock metamorphism. Our preferred least implausible hypothesis is that the shock-metamorphism here was associated with a terrestrial event, a hyperexplosive volcanic gas eruption called 'Verneshot'.

Evaluating the summer night sky brightness at a research field site on Lake Stechlin in northeastern Germany	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER					2nd International Meeting on Light Pollution Theory, Modeling and Measurements	MAY 26-28, 2015	Quebec, CANADA					We report luminance measurements of the summer night sky at a field site on a freshwater lake in northeastern Germany (Lake Stechlin) to evaluate the amount of artificial skyglow from nearby and distant towns in the context of a planned study on light pollution. The site is located about 70 km north of Berlin in a rural area possibly belonging to one of the darkest regions in Germany. Continuous monitoring of the zenith sky luminance between June and September 2015 was conducted utilizing a Sky Quality Meter. With this device, typical values for clear nights in the range of 21.5-21.7 mag(SQM)/arcsec(2) were measured, which is on the order of the natural sky brightness during starry nights. On overcast nights, values down to 22.84 mag(SQM)/arcsec(2) were obtained, which is about one third as bright as on clear nights. The luminance measured on clear nights as well as the darkening with the presence of clouds indicates that there is very little influence of artificial skyglow on the zenith sky brightness at this location. Furthermore, fish-eye lens sky imaging luminance photometry was performed with a digital single-lens reflex camera on a clear night in the absence of moonlight. The photographs unravel several distant towns as possible sources of light pollution on the horizon. However, the low level of artificial skyglow makes the field site at Lake Stechlin an excellent location to study the effects of skyglow on a lake ecosystem in a controlled fashion.

Structural controls on geothermal circulation in Surprise Valley, California: A re-evaluation of the Lake City fault zone	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Faults and fractures play an important role in the circulation of geothermal fluids in the crust, and the nature of that role varies according to structural setting and state of stress. As a result, detailed geologic and geophysical mapping that relates thermal springs to known structural features is essential to modeling geothermal systems. Published maps of Surprise Valley in northeastern California suggest that the "Lake City fault" or "Lake City fault zone" is a significant structural feature, cutting obliquely across the basin and connecting thermal springs across the valley. Newly acquired geophysical data (audio-magnetotelluric, gravity, and magnetic), combined with existing geochemical and geological data, suggest otherwise. We examine potential field profiles and resistivity models that cross the mapped Lake City fault zone. While there are numerous geophysical anomalies that suggest subsurface structures, they mostly do not coincide with the mapped traces of the Lake City fault zone, nor do they show a consistent signature in gravity, magnetics, or resistivities that would suggest a through-going fault that would promote connectivity through lateral fluid flow. Instead of a single, continuous fault, we propose the presence of a deformation zone associated with the growth of the range-front Surprise Valley fault. The implication for geothermal circulation is that this is a zone of enhanced porosity but lacks length-wise connectivity that could conduct fluids across the valley. Thermal fluid circulation is most likely controlled primarily by interactions between N-S-trending normal faults.					; Egger, Anne/OCL-3387-2025	McPhee, Darcy/0000-0002-5177-3068; Egger, Anne/0000-0001-5686-4375													0016-7606	1943-2674				MAR-APR	2014	126	3-4					523	531		10.1130/B30785.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B30785.1													WOS:000341192900016

Mean annual precipitation changes were quantified by applying pollen-climate transfer functions. Sparse vegetation cover dominated by herbs indicates relatively dry climate between 51 and 43 cal ka BP. Between 43 and 35 cal ka BP, a Pinus-dominated forest reached its maximum extent, implying that climate was wetter than today. Severe fire episodes during that period suggest warm temperatures. Between 35 and 32 cal ka BP, forest retreat and the expansion of dryland vegetation are indicative of drier climates. Slightly wetter conditions prevailed between 32 and 29 cal ka BP, as indicated by the expansion of ferns. Our results suggest that the climate conditions in the Nihewan Basin during middle and late MIS 3 were probably wetter than today. This may have been caused by intensification of Asian monsoon circulation in response to greater insolation in June at 30A degrees N. However, increases in summer temperatures and evaporation, triggered by peak summer insolation levels, may have led to a reduction in humidity around 35 cal ka BP.					; Ni, Jian/I-7067-2012	Herzschuh, Ulrike/0000-0003-0999-1261; Ni, Jian/0000-0001-5411-7050													0921-2728	1573-0417				FEB	2014	51	2			SI		211	221		10.1007/s10933-013-9716-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-013-9716-8													WOS:000330734400005

Salmon parr were sampled in autumn with small mesh gillnets in lakes, and by electrofishing in streams. In three northern Norwegian watercourses, lacustrine Atlantic salmon Salmo salar parr were larger in length and weight at age than fluvial parr. Back-calculated lengths indicated that lacustrine salmon parr were recruited from the fastest growing part of the populations and they had larger growth (length) increments between age intervals than fluvial parr. There was no consistent pattern in growth comparisons between parr from the inlet and outlet streams.

We present a pollen-based, well-dated, similar to 10 yr resolution quantitative precipitation reconstruction from an alpine lake in North China, which provides a detailed picture of EASM evolution during the past similar to 11,860 years. Based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method and spectral analysis, we have revealed the centennial to multidecadal scales variability of EASM precipitation and its possible driving mechanisms during the Holocene. Our results suggest that the mean annual precipitation (MAP) varied greatly during the Holocene, with the maximum precipitation (520 mm) occurring during 9500-5020 cal. yr BP, which was similar to 20 % higher than present. On the centennial scale, EASM precipitation exhibited similar to 500 yr, similar to 200 yr, similar to 130 yr, and similar to 105 yr cycles. The amplitude of the similar to 500 yr cycle varied greatly during the Holocene, being higher in the early and late Holocene and lower in the middle Holocene, which was possibly linked to changes in ocean circulation induced by freshwater influx to the North Atlantic. On the multidecadal scale, the EASM precipitation was dominated by a 70-90 yr cycle, which may be related to the solar activity cycle and ocean-atmosphere interactions at both high and low latitudes. Weaker (stronger) solar activity, combined with stronger El Ni & ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) during the warm phase of the Pacific Interdecadal Oscillation (PDO) and a negative phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), caused lower (higher) sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the Indo-West Pacific Warm Pool (IWPWP) region, resulted in weaker (stronger) EASM circulation and decreased (increased) precipitation in North China. Our findings provide significant enlightenment for distinguishing the contribution of natural factors to the changes in EASM precipitation under future global warming scenarios.

C.; Fang, Yihang; Lebrun, Noah; Yang, Yiping; Xu, Huifang			Co-precipitation of primary dolomite and Mg-rich clays in Deep Springs Lake, California	SEDIMENTOLOGY												In contrast to the prevalence of dolomite [CaMg(CO3)(2)] in the geological record, there are few instances of recent formation. This discrepancy occurs despite supersaturation with respect to dolomite in many modern marine and lacustrine environments. Additionally, laboratory experiments have struggled to precipitate dolomite at ambient temperatures (<40degree celsius) even under highly saturated conditions. However, recent work has found dissolved silica to be an effective catalyst for the direct precipitation of dolomite. To test this hypothesis, the hydrology and mineralogy of Deep Springs Lake, a playa setting with primary dolomite precipitation has been explored. In this study, the central playa sites with the highest sedimentation rates were found to have dissolved silica concentrations close to saturation. Rietveld refinement showed that bulk mineral assemblages of core samples contain 20 to 40% fine-grained, partially ordered dolomite along with a 10 to 20% poorly crystalline clay fraction, while transmission electron microscopy imaging found a co-precipitation relationship between the fine-grained dolomite and Mg-rich smectite clays, where the Mg-rich smectite clays act as a sink for the excess dissolved silica during evaporation. Transmission electron microscopy results indicate that the nanodolomite crystals formed through surface-induced nucleation and growth processes in the presence of dissolved silica as a catalyst. The broad coincidence of conditions for the direct precipitation of dolomite and Mg-rich smectite clays provides evidence that silica may be a key to the dolomite problem, as well as constraining palaeoenvironments such as the Pre-salt Barra Velha Formation.

During the summer of 1992, a perfluorocarbon tracer gas was released from the Mohave Power Project (MPP), a large coal-fired facility in southern Nevada. Three-dimensional atmospheric models, the Higher-Order Turbulence Model for Atmospheric Circulation-Random Puff Transport and Diffusion (HOTMAC-RAPTAD), were used to simulate the concentrations of tracer gas that were observed during a portion of the summer intensive period of Project MOHAVE. The study area extended from northwestern Arizona to southern Nevada and included Lake Mead, the Colorado River Valley, the Grand Canyon National Park, and MPP. The computational domain was 368 km in the east-west direction by 252 km in the north-south direction. Rawinsonde and radar wind profiler data were used to provide initial and boundary conditions to HOTMAC simulations. HOTMAC with a horizontal grid spacing of 4 km was able to simulate the diurnal variations of drainage and upslope flows along the Grand Canyon and Colorado River Valley. HOTMAC also captured the diurnal variations of turbulence, which played important roles for the transport and diffusion simulations by RAPTAD. The modeled tracer gas concentrations were compared with observations. The model's performance was evaluated statistically.																			0894-8763					MAR	2000	39	3					399	411		10.1175/1520-0450(2000)039<0399:NSOAAT>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0450(2000)039<0399:NSOAAT>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000086150600010
J	HORN, H; HORN, W				HORN, H; HORN, W			GROWTH OF BLUE-GREEN-ALGAE IN THE SAIDENBACH RESERVOIR AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO THE SILICON BUDGET	INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE												The phytoplankton succession during the summer in the mesotrophic reservoir Saidenbach since 1975 may well be explained by the resource ratio hypothesis. Until 1980, only phosphorus controlled the phytoplankton growth, and diatoms prevailed, because an excesses of silicon existed. From 1981 to 1986, the ratio Si:P often was smaller than 90, a value, critical for the development of the diatom Fragilaria crotonensis. Its reduced growth caused an increased occurrence of blue-greens (mostly Aphanothece clathrata) immediately after the diatom mass development. During these years at first silicon limited phytoplankton growth in summer, later on the growth again was limited by phosphorus. Because of increased Si and P load since 1987 a simultaneous limitation of both nutrients occurs. This leads now to parallel mass developments of diatoms and blue-greens. In order to maintain the positive effect of diatoms (phosphorus transport into the sediment), it is to guarantee a sufficiently high Si:P ratio. If a reduction of P load isn't possible, Si remobilization from the sediment could be increased by artificial changes of the water level.																			0020-9309						1990	75	4					461	474		10.1002/iroh.19900750404	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19900750404													WOS:A1990FR60200003

Patterns of bacterial diversity across a range of Antarctic terrestrial habitats	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Although soil-borne bacteria represent the world's greatest source of biological diversity, it is not well understood whether extreme environmental conditions, such as those found in Antarctic habitats, result in reduced soil-borne microbial diversity. To address this issue, patterns of bacterial diversity were studied in soils sampled along a > 3200 km southern polar transect spanning a gradient of increased climate severity over 27 degrees of latitude. Vegetated and fell-field plots were sampled at the Falkland (51 degrees S), South Georgia (54 degrees S), Signy (60 degrees S) and Anchorage Islands (67 degrees S), while bare frost-sorted soil polygons were examined at Fossil Bluff (71 degrees S), Mars Oasis (72 degrees S), Coal Nunatak (72 degrees S) and the Ellsworth Mountains (78 degrees S). Bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences were recovered subsequent to direct DNA extraction from soil, polymerase chain reaction amplification and cloning. Although bacterial diversity was observed to decline with increased latitude, habitat-specific patterns appeared to also be important. Namely, a negative relationship was found between bacterial diversity and latitude for fell-field soils, but no such pattern was observed for vegetated sites. The Mars Oasis site, previously identified as a biodiversity hotspot within this region, proved exceptional within the study transect, with unusually high bacterial diversity. In independent analyses, geographical distance and vegetation cover were found to significantly influence bacterial community composition. These results provide insight into the factors shaping the composition of bacterial communities in Antarctic terrestrial habitats and support the notion that bacterial diversity declines with increased climatic severity.					; Yergeau, Etienne/AAZ-6145-2020; Pearce, David/KLD-8369-2024; Newsham, Kevin/C-4192-2011; Kowalchuk, George/C-4298-2011	Yergeau, Etienne/0000-0002-7112-3425; Pearce, David/0000-0001-5292-4596; Kowalchuk, George/0000-0003-3866-0832; 													1462-2912	1462-2920				NOV	2007	9	11					2670	2682		10.1111/j.1462-2920.2007.01379.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2007.01379.x								17922752					WOS:000249990400003

J	van Dam, H; Mertens, A				van Dam, Herman; Mertens, Adrienne			A century of diatom monitoring in acidified and warmed Dutch moorland pools	LIMNOLOGICA												Diatoms are well-known indicators for acidification and recovery of lakes, as mainly with paleolimnological methods. However, from the last few decades, such studies are scarce, especially in Europe, and there is a poor insight into the interaction between the impact of the recovery from acidification and drought periods on diatoms. The surface water chemistry of Dutch moorland pools has shown strong signs of chemical recovery as a response to declines in sulphur and nitrogen deposition between 1978 and 2018. We expected that changes in water chemistry were associated with changes in diatom assemblages and that the diatom assemblages at the end of the monitoring period would be dissimilar to pre-acidification diatom assemblages due to the changed biogeochemical processes in the pools. To monitor the recovery from acidification, diatoms from plants and surficial sediments were sampled in 11 Dutch moorland pools from 1978 to 2018. As far as we know, this is the longest series of semi-annual diatom records in stagnant shallow waters recovering from acidification. Early 20th-century samples were retrieved from collections. Changes in the diatom assemblages were assessed by analyses of traits (including pH-preference) and ecological groups. Direct correspondence analysis revealed high correlations between the species composition and environmental variables (pH, sulphate, ammonium, dissolved organic carbon, calcium, and aluminium). Between 1916 and 1978, the greatest species composition changes occurred in pools with relatively flat banks exposed to the air in extremely dry summers. After the dry summer of 1921, the changes were insignificant, but after the extremely dry summer of 1976, the changes were dramatic due to acidification by oxidation of the reduced sulphur and nitrogen compounds stored in the moorland pool bottom. After 1980, the changes were consistent with chemical recovery from acidification. However, there was a significant interaction with climatic factors: drought episodes in the short term and temperature increase in the long term. Some species in the samples from the last decades indicate an acid, but eutrophic environment, due to internal eutrophication. The species composition did not return to the historical composition (1920 s), as the chemical dynamics due to the large stock of sulphur and nitrogen compounds are now entirely different from those a century ago.						van Dam, Herman/0000-0002-8778-5490													0075-9511	1873-5851				MAR	2023	99								126059	10.1016/j.limno.2023.126059	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2023.126059		JAN 2023											WOS:000926454400001
J	Wang, X; Cui, LL; Yang, SL; Zhai, JX; Ding, ZL				Wang, Xu; Cui, Linlin; Yang, Shiling; Zhai, Jixuan; Ding, Zhongli			Stable carbon isotope records of black carbon on Chinese Loess Plateau since last glacial maximum: An evaluation on their usefulness for paleorainfall and paleovegetation reconstruction	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Stable carbon isotope composition of soil organic matter (delta C-13(SOM)) has been widely used to infer past environmental or vegetation (C-3/C-4) changes. However, as a carbonaceous product of incomplete burning of biomass, the carbon isotope signature of black carbon (BC) has received little study and a limited usage on this purpose. Moreover, the environmental or vegetation indication of BC carbon isotope composition (delta C-13(BC)) in sedimentary records remains ambiguous although the delta C-13(BC) is supposed to reflect carbon isotope composition of vegetation being burnt. This deserves site-specific studies. Here we analyzed delta C-13(BC) and delta C-13(SOM) on loess-paleosol samples from Lijiayuan and Yangling sections on Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) spanning the last glacial maximum to decipher the environmental (or vegetation) meaning of delta C-13(SOM) at each study site. Opposite changing patterns were observed on the delta C-13(BC) values for the two sections. The delta C-13(BC) at Yangling (in southern part of the CLP) varied from - 19.18 parts per thousand to - 21.93 parts per thousand (mean: - 20.62 parts per thousand) with more positive values occurred during the middle Holocene than those during the LGM, demonstrating more C-4 plants occupied in the region during the warm-humid middle Holocene. This is consistent with the changing pattern widely-documented in delta C-13(SOM) records over the CLP during the same period. By contrast, the delta C-13(BC) at Lijiayuan (in northwestern part of the CLP) changed within the range of - 21.83 parts per thousand similar to -24.64 parts per thousand (mean: - 23.34 parts per thousand) and displayed more negative values during the early-middle Holocene with respect to the LGM period. The delta C-13(BC) at Lijiayuan were about 2.5 parts per thousand lower than those at Yangling, indicating a northward decrease of C-4 plants on the CLP. The anti-phased changes of delta C-13(BC) at Lijiayuan were considered to reflect variations in paleorainfall because the vegetation is dominated by C-3 plants at the study site and carbon isotope compositions of C-3 plants decrease as rainfall increases. Compared with delta C-13(SOM) record at the same profile, delta C-13(BC) seem biased against capturing C-4 signal during mid-Holocene possibly due to dominance of C-3 plants at the study site during fire seasons and a potentially extra source of BC from forest fires occurred on surrounding mountains. By contrast, delta C-13(BC) tend to exaggerate C-4 signal during the LGM attributed to a possible shift of fire season from spring to summer. These findings suggest that we probably underestimate the abundance of C-4 plants during mid-Holocene and overestimate C-4 biomass during the LGM using BC carbon isotope composition.

Diatom assemblages are dominated by Cyclotella rhomboideo-elliptica, Cyclostephanos dubius and small fragilarioid and periphytic taxa. These diatom taxa are interpreted to be sensitive to changes in trophic status and/or turbulence of the water column that are probably related to variations in precipitation and temperature induced through the Asian monsoon. High abundances of C. dubius, Staurosirella pinnata and periphytic taxa suggest higher trophic status (mesotrophic) and stronger turbulence in the water column in the middle Holocene (7.8-4.5 ka BP). During the period of 4.5-2.3 ka BP, a decline in C. dubius, S. pinnata and periphytic taxa, and an increase in C. rhomboideo-elliptica with the appearance of Cyclotella ocellata suggests a response to decreasing trophic level (more oligotrophic). After 2.3 ka BP, the persistent increases in C. rhomboideo-elliptica and the loss of Cyclotella ocellata mirrored a further decrease in trophic level (oligotrophic). The main changes in the diatom assemblages in the Lake Chenghai sediment core reflect direct and indirect climate forcing and in particular, the strength of monsoonal precipitation, which in turn corresponds to orbitally induced variability in Northern Hemisphere summer solar insolation since 7.8 ka BP.					; Xiao, Xiayun/G-1396-2012; Ji, ming/NDS-9964-2025; Zhang, Youchi/M-6989-2016	Zhang, Enlou/0000-0002-8057-7760; 													0300-9483	1502-3885				OCT	2015	44	4					785	793		10.1111/bor.12128	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bor.12128													WOS:000362769600011

Evaluation of three vegetation treatments in bioretention gardens in a semi-arid climate	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Bioretention is a well-established tool to reduce nutrient transport from impervious urban landscapes to sensitive riparian habitat in mesic climates. However, the effectiveness of bioretention is less tested in arid and semi-arid climates. Nutrient retention performance was evaluated in three 10 m(2) bioretention cells with different vegetation communities: (I) an irrigated wetland vegetation community, (2) an un-irrigated upland vegetation community, and (3) a no-vegetation control. Synthetic stormwater was added to each cell to simulate the average annual runoff of precipitation from a 220 m(2) impervious surface in Salt Lake City, UT. A significant amount of phosphate (approximate to 50%) was retained by all treatments during the 12-month study. However, total nitrogen (TN) retention was only achieved in the Wetland and Upland treatments (59% and 22%, respectively), and nitrate retention was only achieved in the Wetland treatment (38%). In contrast, the Upland and Control treatments exported 2 and 9 times more nitrate than was added in the simulated rainfall events. Improved nitrogen retention by the Wetland treatment came at the cost of over 12,000I (3200 gal) of irrigation to sustain the vegetation through the hot, dry summer. We hypothesize that plant uptake and soil microbial communities are driving nutrient retention in bioretention systems, and that increasing net primary production will increase nutrient retention. In water-limited climates, this can be sustainably achieved by either: increasing native upland vegetation densities above naturally expected densities, or, by using gray water instead of municipal water sources to irrigate wetland communities through dry summer periods.

Characterization of the carbon fluxes of a vegetated drained lake basin chronosequence on the Alaskan Arctic Coastal Plain	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Greenhouse gas fluxes from vegetated drained lake basins have been largely unstudied, although these land features constitute up to 47% of the land cover in the Arctic Coastal Plain in northern Alaska. To describe current and to better predict future sink/source activity of the Arctic tundra, it is important to assess these vegetated drained lake basins with respect to the patterns of and controls on gross primary production (GPP), net ecosystem exchange, and ecosystem respiration (ER). We measured CO(2) fluxes and key environmental variables during the 2007 growing season (June through August) in 12 vegetated drained lake basins representing three age classes (young, drained about 50 years ago; medium, drained between 50 and 300 years ago; and old, drained between 300 and 2000 years ago, as determined by Hinkel et al., 2003) in the Arctic Coastal Plain. Young vegetated drained lake basins had both the highest average GPP over the summer (11.4 gCO(2) m-2 day-1) and the highest average summer ER (7.3 gCO(2) m-2 day-1), while medium and old vegetated drained lake basins showed lower and similar GPP (7.9 and 7.2 gCO(2) m-2 day-1, respectively), and ER (5.2 and 4 gCO(2) m-2 day-1, respectively). Productivity decreases with age as nutrients are locked up in living plant material and dead organic matter. However, we showed that old vegetated drained lakes basins maintained relatively high productivity because of the increased development of ice-wedge polygons, the formation of ponds, and the re-establishment of very productive species. Comparison of the seasonal CO(2) fluxes and concomitant environmental factors over this chronosequence provides the basis for better understanding the patterns and controls on CO(2) flux across the coastal plain of the North Slope of Alaska and for more accurately estimating current and future contribution of the Arctic to the global carbon budget.

In Lake Sonderby (8 ha, mean depth 2.8 m), Fyn County, Denmark, this is especially true because there is no run-off of lake water during summer when high lake water P concentrations prevail. External P-loading was reduced in 1983 but still in 2001 total P reached 1.5 mg l(-1) during summer. In the present study, we determined the size of the potential mobile P-pool in the sediment by use of a sequential extraction procedure. The potentially mobile P-pool (P-Mobile): Loosely adsorbed inorganic o-P (P-Water), iron-bound o-P (P-BD), and labile organic P (Org-P-Labile) made up 14.6 g m(-2) and constituted 40% of the Tot-P in the upper 10 cm sediment. Then, we tested if molar binding ratios of 4:1 or 8:1 between aluminum (Al) and potential mobile P could reduce sediment P-release at suboxic conditions. An Al:P ratio of 4:1 was enough (p<0.05; n=5) to trap all P in the sediment during a 39 days experiment with undisturbed sediment cores. This dosage was then tested in enclosures in the lake during a 30 days summer experiment with 3 replicate enclosures (1.1 m(2), 2.1 m high) for each of the 2 treatments (Al addition, and control). o-P and Tot-P dropped from 1.28 mg l(-1) to <0.006 and 0.02 mg l(-1), respectively, in the Al treated enclosures but remained high in both control enclosures and in the lake water. Secchi depth increased from 0.8 m to the bottom upon Al treatment but declined to around 1.5 m after 4 days. By the end of the enclosure experiment, sediment analyses showed increased fractions of P-->NaOH in the surface sediment of Al treated enclosures. We conclude that Al addition was able to combat internal P-loading in the shallow lake when added in a molar ratio of 4:1 relative to the mobile P-pool in sediment and lake water. Meanwhile, temporary suppression of Daphnia grazing may be expected upon Al addition.

J	Larsson, P; Hansen, H; Helland, LKB				Larsson, Petter; Hansen, Heidi; Helland, Linda Kristin Bjornstad			Between-year variations in the development of crustacean zooplankton in the Norwegian subalpine lake, vre Heimdalsvatn	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Data from the International Biological Programme (IBP) and subsequent studies have been re-analysed to test the two hypotheses which previously have been suggested concerning the zooplankton in the mountain lake, vre Heimdalsvatn: (1) the average temperature in June, more than other summer months, is affecting the growth rate and population densities of zooplankton in the lake, (2) the invasion of the European minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus) has caused changes in the zooplankton community. The analyses have demonstrated that the June temperature strongly affects the growth rate of all the zooplankton species, but that there is no relationship with the population maxima. The species composition in the crustacean zooplankton has not changed between 1969 and 1999, and any direct impact of the minnows on the zooplankton community could not be detected. Indirectly, the minnows may have reduced the density of invertebrate predators, and thus caused an increase in juvenile survival and increased summer maximum density of Bosmina longispina. The variation in density of the copepod, Cyclops scutifer, was correlated with the density of Heterocope saliens, most likely the result of predator-prey interactions.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2010	642	1					61	70		10.1007/s10750-010-0159-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0159-1													WOS:000275782400006

Abundance and biomass of the microbial food web components as well as bacterial production and predation by protists were quantified at weekly intervals in the euphotic zone. Phytoplankton biomass showed a maximum under ice and in summer. Abundance of plastidic flagellates was correlated with chlorophyll-a (r = 0.48; p < 0.02). High abundance of nanociliates at the surface (ca. 1 x 10(5) ind.l-1), mainly Balanion planctonicum, were found to be important for the start of the clear-water phase. Mixotrophic ciliates were present under ice and during summer. Among them Pelagohalteria viridis reached abundances of up to 3 x 10(3) ind.l-1. Bacterivory exceeded bacterial production on several occasions although, on average, they were balanced. Aplasticid flagellates were the main controllers of bacterial production, ciliates had a very low impact (< 3.1% of water column cleared per day). Autotrophic picoplankton represented a significant alternative C pool for protists making up to 43% of total picoplankton biomass. During most time of the year the microbial food web (MFW) seems to act as a sink for carbon, except during the clear-water phase when cladocerans have a strong grazing impact on the whole MFW. Using a multiple regression model we found that 35% of the variability of bacterial production was explained by the abundance of bacteria and temperature. This value increased to 50% when the number of active (INT) bacteria was used instead of total bacteria. Bacterial abundances showed a low predictive value on aplastidic flagellate abundances, suggesting that trophic pathways in this lake are strongly fluctuating and that a coupling between both populations does not always exist.

Radiocarbon age-offsets in an arctic lake reveal the long-term response of permafrost carbon to climate change	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Continued warming of the Arctic may cause permafrost to thaw and speed the decomposition of large stores of soil organic carbon (OC), thereby accentuating global warming. However, it is unclear if recent warming has raised the current rates of permafrost OC release to anomalous levels or to what extent soil carbon release is sensitive to climate forcing. Here we use a time series of radiocarbon age-offsets (C-14) between the bulk lake sediment and plant macrofossils deposited in an arctic lake as an archive for soil and permafrost OC release over the last 14,500 years. The lake traps and archives OC imported from the watershed and allows us to test whether prior warming events stimulated old carbon release and heightened age-offsets. Today, the age-offset (2ka; thousand of calibrated years before A.D. 1950) and the depositional rate of ancient OC from the watershed into the lake are relatively low and similar to those during the Younger Dryas cold interval (occurring 12.9-11.7ka). In contrast, age-offsets were higher (3.0-5.0ka) when summer air temperatures were warmer than present during the Holocene Thermal Maximum (11.7-9.0ka) and BOlling-AllerOd periods (14.5-12.9ka). During these warm times, permafrost thaw contributed to ancient OC depositional rates that were similar to 10 times greater than today. Although permafrost OC was vulnerable to climate warming in the past, we suggest surface soil organic horizons and peat are presently limiting summer thaw and carbon release. As a result, the temperature threshold to trigger widespread permafrost OC release is higher than during previous warming events.

J	Myers, L; Kane, J				Myers, Lindsey; Kane, Jeffrey			The Impact of Summer Cattle Grazing on Surface Water Quality in High Elevation Mountain Meadows	WATER QUALITY EXPOSURE AND HEALTH												Surface waters were tested before and after the arrival of cattle to summer grazing allotments for pathogenic bacteria indicators E. coli, fecal coliform bacteria, and total coliform bacteria in the high elevation mountains of the Stanislaus National Forest, California, USA. Water samples were collected from one control/ungrazed stream site and at four grazed stream sites before cattle grazing began and during the time when livestock were present. All sample sites were higher than 1900 meters in elevation. Samples were transported within 6 hours to a water analysis laboratory, where they were analyzed following standardized lab methods. Results showed that individual and average concentrations of fecal coliform bacteria in surface waters were below regulatory thresholds at the ungrazed site and at the grazed sites before cattle arrived. Mean fecal coliform concentration increased from 9 to 350 CFU/100 mL, and mean E. coli increased from 8 to 240 CFU/100 mL, respectively, after grazing. The increase in mean concentration of fecal coliform at each grazed site was significant (p < 0.05). Total coliform bacteria and E. coli concentrations showed the same pattern. Cattle grazing in the sampled high elevation Sierra Nevada meadows resulted in a significant increase in indicator bacteria.																			1876-1658	1876-1666				JUN	2011	3	1					51	62		10.1007/s12403-011-0043-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12403-011-0043-x													WOS:000209141000005

However, the historical evolution of the ISM and its influence on civilization on a centennial scale remains unclear. Here, we employed high-resolution (similar to 19 yr) multi-indicator analysis (grain size, magnetic susceptibility, and loss on ignition) of Qionghai Lake core sediments to reconstruct the Holocene evolution history of the ISM climate and explore its potential driving mechanism, and further examine the influence of ISM variations on the development of human civilization. The results indicate three stages of ISM climate variations during the past 13.6 cal ka BP: strengthening ISM and increasingly humid climate before 8.0 cal ka BP; strong ISM and significantly humid climate between 8.0 and 3.0cal ka BP, corresponding to the Holocene Climatic Optimum (HCO); weakening ISM and dry climate after 3.0 cal ka BP. Furthermore, our results indicate that the Holocene ISM climate was regulated by sub-orbital cycles, with a dominant similar to 2000-year (yr) quasi-periodic oscillation, linked to solar activity, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and sea-surface temperature (SST) variations, and a significant similar to 500-yr quasiperiodic oscillation in the mid-Holocene, associated with fluctuations in the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). ISM variations have influenced the development of prehistoric cultures since the mid-Holocene. From 6.0 to 3.0 cal ka BP, the strengthening of the ISM contributed to the prosperity of human cultures through increased precipitation, expanded agriculture, growing population and human activities. After 3.0 cal ka BP, despite a weakening of ISM, human activities became the dominant factor influencing the development of civilization.

The prediction of impacts is a major goal for invasion ecologists, and is especially crucial in an industry often lacking knowledge about traded species. We focused on the predatory gastropod Anentome helena, a species originating in south-east Asia and traded around the world, but with taxonomic uncertainty. We first set out to determine where our study organism fell within the A. "helena" species complex, known to comprise at least four cryptic species, before assessing the effect of temperature on the number of prey, the pulmonate snail Physella acuta, killed per predator via functional response experiments at two temperatures. We used 22 degrees C as a recommended temperature for housing the species in captivity, and 18 degrees C as a representative summer lake temperature in temperate climates of Europe. We also assessed the role of predator group size (1x, 2x, 3x) on predation (total consumption and average per capita consumption) at the experimental temperatures with fixed densities of prey, as well as the effect of these temperatures on prey activity. Our organisms belonged to a cryptic species originating from Thailand (Anentome sp. A), matching the findings of aquarium trade samples in other continents. In the functional response experiments, we found maximum feeding rate to be significantly reduced at the lower temperature. A similar result ensued from group feeding, with total consumption significantly reduced and the reduction in average per capita consumption approaching significance at the lower temperature. There was no significant effect of group size on the average per capita consumption in the group trial, indicating neutral conspecific interactions. No significant effect of temperature on the activity of the prey species was found, suggesting decreased consumption was mainly driven by predator, rather than prey. These results suggest limited A. helena impacts in the short-term, but increasing temperatures with climate change may facilitate greater consequences from releases. We suggest future studies assess other potential predatory impacts and survival across relevant abiotic conditions, and encourage the use of similar methods to assess the impacts of other commonly traded species.

Present climate change scenarios predict a rise in summer temperature of 2.5-4.0 degrees C in Norway towards 2100, an increase in precipitation of 5-20% in the southwestern part of the country, and a general increase in the frequency of extreme rainfall events. Most of the glaciers will melt and sediment transport is likely to increase as a result of the melting. During the last decade, high summer temperatures and high precipitation have caused the highest volume of runoff and sediment load in the meltwater river flowing from the Nigardsbreen Glacier, since measurements began in 1968. A study of the subglacial morphology obtained from low frequency radio-echo soundings revealed that a number of depressions beneath the glaciers will form lakes when the glaciers disappear and act as sedimentation basins in the future rivers. The increased sediment delivery from the glaciers will thus not always increase the sediment input to downstream reaches. Changes in sediment delivery to hydropower stations will depend on the local conditions and the operation rules.																			0144-7815		978-1-907161-33-9				2012	356						210	218																WOS:000310722000026

Here, we investigated the grain-size data of a 63 cm core retrieved from Lake Chaonaqiu, western Chinese Loess Plateau, in order to build a long time-series of flood occurrence from sedimentology that extends the period of instrumental data. Our results indicate that three parameters (mean, standard deviation and grain-size ratio of 16-63/2-16 mu m) are sensitive to hydrodynamic changes in Lake Chaonaqiu, which are further linked to high-energy inflow associated with high-intensity rainfall or flood events. These three parameters' variations were well correlated with the precipitation records reconstructed from tree-rings and historical documents in neighboring regions and overlapped with 109 historical flood events from historical documents in counties around the lake for the past 300 years. Therefore, we propose that the grain size in the sediments of Lake Chaonaqiu is a reliable paleoflood proxy. The sensitivity of flood signals to grain size may be related to the precipitation and vegetation cover in the catchment of the lake, which are further linked to the strength of the East Asian summer monsoon.																				2073-4441				NOV	2024	16	21							3129	10.3390/w16213129	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16213129													WOS:001352075300001

We provide new data on deglaciation history and develop new relative sea-level (RSL) curves along an 80 km transect (from Skallen to Skarsvnes, Langhovde and the Ongul Islands) in Ltitzow Holm Bay, East Antarctica. The geological constraints were compared with output from two Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) models. The minimum radiocarbon age for regional deglaciation is c. 11,240 cal. yr BP on West Ongul Island with progressively younger deglaciation ages approaching the main regional ice outflow at Shirase Glacier. Marked regional differences in the magnitude and timing of RSL change were observed. More in particular, in Skarvsnes a minimum marine limit of 32.7 m was inferred, which is c. 12.7 m higher than previously published evidence, and at least 15 m higher than that reported in the other three ice-free areas. Current GIA model predictions slightly underestimate the rate of Late Holocene RSL fall at Skallen, Langhovde, and West Ongul, but provide a reasonable fit to the reconstructed minimum marine limit at these sites. GIA model predictions are unable to provide an explanation for the shape of the reconstructed RSL curve at Skarvsnes. We consider a range of possible explanations for the Skarvsnes RSL data and favour an interpretation where the anomalously high marine limit and rate of RSL fall is due to reactivation of a local fault.

Timothy			Intra-Lake Arcellinida (Testate Lobose Amoebae) Response to Winter De-icing Contamination in an Eastern Canada Road-Side "Salt Belt" Lake	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Salt contamination of lakes, due to the application of winter de-icing salts on roads, presents a significant environmental challenge in the "salt belt" region of eastern North America. The research reported here presents the first deployment of a previously published proxy tool based on Arcellinida (testate lobose amoebae) for monitoring road salt contamination. The research was conducted at Silver Lake in Eastern Ontario, a 4-km-long lake with the heavily traveled Trans-Canada Highway (HWY 7) transiting the entire southern shore. The lake showed elevated conductivity (297-310 mu S/cm) and sub-brackish conditions (0.14-0.15 ppt). Sodium levels were also elevated near the roadside (median Na = 1020 ppm). Cluster analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling results revealed four distinct Arcellinida assemblages: "Stressed Cool Water Assemblage (SCWA)," "Deep Cold Water Assemblage (DCWA)," both from below the 8-m thermocline, and the shallower water "Shallow Water Assemblage 1 (SWA-1)" and "Shallow Water Assemblage 2 (SWA-2)". Redundancy analysis showed a minor response of Arcellinida to road salt contamination in shallower areas of the lake, with confounding variables significantly impacting assemblage distribution, particularly beneath the thermocline (e.g., water temperature, water depth, sediment runoff from catchment [Ti], sediment geochemistry [Ca, S]). The results of this study indicate that the trophic structure of the lake has to date only been modestly impacted by the cumulative nature of road salt contamination. Nonetheless, the Silver Lake results should be considered of concern and warrant continued arcellinidan biomonitoring to gauge the ongoing and long-term effects of road salt on its ecosystem.

This was the first case of that kind, and since then, no other case of autoerotic submersion has been reported, nor other autoerotic fatality in open water. Here we report the case of a 25-year-old man, nude under a home-made plastic body suit, overdressed for the season with winter clothes and restrained by complex bondage. He was submersed, tied underwater to a boat and was using a home-made diving apparatus for air supply.

J.; Jones, Brian G.; Cendon, Dioni I.; Fink, David			The sedimentary record of palaeoenvironments and sea-level change in the Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia, through the last glacial cycle	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Environmental evolution of the Gulf of Carpentaria region, the world's largest tropical epicontinental seaway, through the last glacial cycle has been determined from a series of six sediment cores. These cores form the focus of a multi-disciplinary study to elucidate sea level, climate and environmental change in the region. The sedimentary record reveals a series of facies including open shallow marine marginal marine, estuarine, lacustrine and subaerial exposure, throughout the extent of the basin during this period. The partial or complete closure of the central basin from marine waters results from sea level falling below the height of one or both of the sills that border the Gulf-the Arafura Sill to the west (53 in below present sea level (bpsl)) and Torres Strait to the east (12 in bpsl). The extent and timing of these closures, and restriction of the shallow waterbody within, are intrinsic to local ocean circulation, available latent heat transport and the movement of people and animals between Australia and New Guinea. Whilst the occurrence of the palaeo-Lake Carpentaria has previously been identified, this study expands on the hydrological conditions of the lacustrine phases and extends the record through the Last Interglacial, detailing the previous sea-level highstand (MIS 5.5) and subsequent retreat. When sea levels were low during the MIS 6 glacial period, the Gulf was largely subaerially exposed and traversed by meandering rivers. The MIS 5 transgression (similar to 130 ka BP) led to marine then alternating marine/estuarine conditions through to MIS 4 (similar to 70ka BP) when a protracted lacustrine phase, of varying salinity and depth/area, and including periods of near desiccation, persisted until about 12.12cal ka BP. The lake expanded to near maximum size (similar to 190 000km(2)) following the intensification/restoration of the Australian monsoon at 14 ka BP. This lake-full phase was short-lived, as by 12.2cal ka BP, marine waters were entering the basin, coincident with the progressive sea-level rise. Fully marine conditions were restored by about 10.5 cal ka BP by westward connection to the Arafura Sea (Indian Ocean), whereas connections to the Pacific Ocean (Coral Sea) did not occur until about 8cal ka BP.

Monthly vertical concentration profiles in the lake showed an increase of glyphosate concentrations in the epilimnion from 15 ng/L in March to 145 ng/L in July, followed by a sharp decline to <5 ng/L in August. A similar pattern was observed for AMPA. Concentrations of glyphosate and AMPA in the two main tributaries generally were much higher than in the lake. Simulations using a numerical lake model indicated that a substantial amount of glyphosate and AMPA dissipated in the epilimnion, mainly in July and August, with half-lives of only approximate to 2-4 days which is >> 100 times faster than in the preceding months. Fast dissipation coincided with high water temperatures and phytoplankton densities, and low phosphate concentrations. This indicates that glyphosate might have been used as an alternative phosphorus source by bacterio- and phytoplankton. Metagenomic analysis of lake water revealed the presence of organisms known to be capable of degrading glyphosate and AMPA.

Phosphorus, nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon fluxes from sediments in freshwater rivermouths entering Green Bay (Lake Michigan; USA)	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Transitional areas between ecosystem types are often active biogeochemically due to resource limitation changes. Lotic-to-lentic transitions in freshwaters appear active biogeochemically, but few studies have directly measured nutrient processing rates to assess whether processing within the rivermouth is important for load estimates or the local communities. We measured oxic fluxes of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from sediments in two rivermouths of Green Bay (Lake Michigan, USA). Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) flux was positive in most cases (overall mean 1.74 mg SRP m(- 2) day(- 1)), as was ammonium (NH4) flux (40.6 mg NH4 m(- 2) day(- 1)). Partial least square regression (PLSR) indicated a latent variable associated with both sediment [loosely bound phosphorus (P), iron bound P, organic content] and water column properties [temperature, DOC:dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and DOC:SRP ratios (negatively)] that was moderately associated with variation in SRP flux. PLSR analysis also indicated several sediment characteristics were moderately related to NH4 flux, especially organic content, density (negative), and porosity. Flux of nitrates/nitrites (NOX) and DOC were positively associated with the water column concentrations of NOX and DOC and qualitative estimates of the labile, non-humic types of DOC. In early summer, water column NOX and DOC concentrations were high and labile DOC may have fueled denitrification, resulting in net flux into sediments of both NOX and DOC. By late summer, water column NOX and DOC were very low and both these constituents were fluxing out of sediments into the water column. Based on our estimates for the entire period from April through September, rivermouth sediments were a net source of SRP and DIN, with a DIN:SRP ratio of ~ 44 and a NH4:NOX > 1. We estimated that the sediments in the Fox rivermouth probably contributed a small proportion of the total Fox River load during the growing season 2016 (< 5%), but at times may have contributed as much as 14% of the daily load. Despite the small size of the Fox rivermouth (< 0.5% of the watershed area), these results indicate that at times sediments can contribute substantially to the overall delivery of nitrogen and phosphorus to the nearshore zone.					; Frost, Paul/AAT-6633-2021	Evans, Mary Anne/0000-0002-1627-7210; Larson, James/0000-0002-6414-9758; 													0168-2563	1573-515X				JAN	2020	147	2					179	197		10.1007/s10533-020-00635-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-020-00635-0													WOS:000511953100003

Based on geological surveys of proximal outcrops, the SUk has been divided into three tephras: the lowermost Ukinuno pumice fall deposit(Uk-pfa; normally regarded as the SUk tephra), the Midorigaoka pyroclastic flow deposit(Md-fl), and the uppermost Ukinuno ash fall deposit(Uk-fa). The Sakate tephra has been associated with the Md-fl. Moreover, previous studies have suggested that the refractive index of amphibole in the Md-fl(i.e., Sakate) samples is similar to that in the Uk-pfa samples, whereas those of the volcanic glass shards in the Md-fl samples are lower than those of the Uk-pfa samples. The petrographic properties of Uk-fa suggest that Uk-fa and Md-fl could be treated as a single tephra. However, the SiO2 contents of the Uk-pfa volcanic glasses are slightly higher than those of Md-fl. The FeO contents of the Uk-pfa volcanic glasses are higher than those of Md-fl. This suggests that the difference in the refractive index values of the volcanic glasses is due to the FeO contents rather than the SiO2 contents. A total of 58 elements distinguish the Md-fl volcanic glasses from Uk-pfa, particularly the light rare earth elements, although the trace element patterns are generally similar. This difference may result from fractional crystallization and/or varying magma inputs. In previous studies, the tephras correlated with the Md-fl/Uk-fa(i.e., Sakate)tephras were found to be widely distributed in the Chugoku and Kinki districts. However, those correlated with Uk-pfa were found in the southern Kinki district and immediately offshore, and at the eastern end of Shikoku Island. Uk-pfa and Md-fl/Uk-fa were erupted during the same eruptive sequence, but are clearly distinguishable from each other. The Uk-pfa and Md-fl/Uk-fa tephras can be more simply redefined as the SUk(lower)and(upper)tephras, respectively.

Delayed mixing of iron-laden tributaries in large boreal rivers: Implications for iron transport, water quality and monitoring	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Boreal river systems globally provide specialized habitats and conduits for the transfer of nutrients, iron and trace elements (TEs) from wetlands and groundwaters to lakes and oceans. Many large boreal rivers are also the site of controversy due to their dual purpose providing ecosystem services for Indigenous peoples and supporting industrial activity; however, water quality monitoring in these systems is more complex than realized. This work demonstrates the impacts of delayed tributary mixing in a typical large boreal river on the properties and transport of Fe-bearing colloids, and water quality monitoring, in two subsequent autumns. The forms and concentrations of Fe colloids were conserved through the mixing zone for more than 100 km, despite salinity changes. Delayed mixing for ca. 60-80 and more than 100 km led to TE concentration differences of more than five-fold across the river. Using traditional samples from the middle of the river, the coincidence of mixing zones with areas of potential industrial impact obscured the potential contributions of some TEs, and caused the erroneous attribution of other TEs to industry at concentrations that were double upstream values. Adequate water quality monitoring and source attribution in large boreal rivers thus requires high-resolution spatial sampling, both across the river and upstream-downstream of potential natural and industrial sources. Since mixing behavior and water quality in large boreal rivers are highly sensitive to hydrologic changes such as seasonal fluctuations, drought/floods, and climate change, fluctuations in water quality and associated mixing behaviours render traditional monitoring approaches unsuitable.

To reduce nutrient pollution and suppress harmful algal blooms (HABs), hard engineering and ecological remediation projects were implemented. A post-project investigation from 2013 to 2016 was carried out to evaluate the outcome of the remediation projects by monitoring the seasonal and spatial variations in water quality and the phytoplankton community. In the Tangxi River, the average total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in the four seasons were below 0.5 mg L-1, with the lowest concentration (0.29 +/- 0.12 mg L-1) found in autumn. Remediation measures including sediment dredging, riparian buffer zone creation, downstream wetland park construction, and water augmentation using reclaimed water and filtered lake water might combine to promote P source mitigation. Moreover, the percentage of bloom-forming cyanobacteria (i.e., Microcystis, Aphanizomenon, Anabaena, Osanatoria, Phormidium and Planktothrix) in the phytoplankton assemblage and the biomass of the dominant species indicated successful HAB control. In the Shiwuli River, water quality improvements and phytoplankton responses have been observed since 2015 after the upgrading of a local wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) with effluent that was used for flow augmentation. Nevertheless, there is still room for improvement via increasing the river self-purification ability (e.g., the creation of downstream wetlands and riparian buffer zones) and promoting water augmentation according to the experience gained in the remediation projects of the Tangxi River.					; Dai, Yanran/AAG-6735-2020; Zhong, Fei/AAG-1639-2019	Zhong, Fei/0000-0003-3313-0904; Cheng, Shuiping/0000-0003-3719-602X													0301-4797	1095-8630				OCT 15	2019	248								109276	10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.109276	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.109276								31325794					WOS:000485210300028

J	JONES, GB; COOKE, GD				JONES, GB; COOKE, GD			CONTROL OF NUISANCE AQUATIC PLANTS WITH BURLAP SCREEN	OHIO JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												Ten-ounce burlap was applied as a sediment cover in June 1982 to 2 plots on Lake Rockwell (Portage County, Ohio [USA]). The burlap at one of the plots was treated with a rot-retarding material, Netset. Plant biomass on treated plots was compared to adjacent plots. The application of burlap was effective for seasonal control of aquatic plant growth on a site where material could be tautly secured to the reservoir sediments. It was less effective at a site with highly unconsolidated sediments. Burlap would have to be applied annually since it rotted during the summer even with preservative treatment. The material cost of burlap is about 15-50% of commercial screening products.																			0030-0950						1984	84	5					248	251																WOS:A1984TY25800005

Temporal patterns of density, biomass and size were similar in both soft and rocky substrata in the lochs, although eels were consistently smaller in the latter habitat. In both substrata, average length and weight showed a non-significant inverse relationship with density, supporting the hypothesis of density-dependent regulation of the yellow eel population. Fyke net catches were size selective, catching no eels <30 cm long, and providing length-frequency information for silver eels. Fyke net catch per unit effort (CPUE) declined consistently each autumn but specific annual trends were different. When eel density increased, fyke net CPUE declined substantially.

J	Mihaljevic, M; Pfeiffer, TZ				Mihaljevic, Melita; Pfeiffer, Tanja Zuna			Colonization of periphyton algae in a temperate floodplain lake under a fluctuating spring hydrological regime	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												The colonization process of periphyton algae was studied in the Danubian floodplain (Lake Sakadas, Nature Park Kopacki Rit, Croatia) under variable spring hydrological conditions. We used an in situ experiment, with artificial substrata, to examine changes in the algal community composition during the early phase of periphyton formation. A few flood pulses characterized the hydrological conditions during the period of investigation (April-May, 2010) and altered the physical and chemical environment of the lake. The periphyton formation was initiated very early, on the first day of deployment, due to the rapid formation of bacterial biofilm. Total periphyton biomass continuously increased during the colonization period with changes in the trophic nature from the prevalence of organic matter to the prevalence of inorganic matter after day 15. The composition of periphyton algal assemblages and abundance changed gradually during the colonization period and the following sequences can be defined: the initial phase (days 1-9, dominated by planktonic cyanobacteria and horizontally positioned diatoms), the intermediate phase (days 12-18 characterised by stalk-forming diatoms (Gomphonema and Cymbella)) and the late phase (days 21-42 dominated by vertically positioned diatoms (Nitzschia)). This sequence of algal colonization is similar to that found in other freshwater habitats. Achnanthidium minutissimum was particularly abundant in the late phase of colonisation which was characterised by flooding and indicated natural disturbance.																			1863-9135					FEB	2012	180	1					13	25		10.1127/1863-9135/2012/0210	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1863-9135/2012/0210													WOS:000301430300002

This study employed machine learning approaches, including super-clustering of Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA), to elucidate the spatiotemporal patterns and assess ecological risks associated with HMs in the surface sediments of Gao-Bao-Shaobo Lake (GBSL) and Dongping Lake (DPL). We collected 184 surface sediments from 47 stations across the two important impounded lakes over four seasons. The results revealed higher HMs concentrations in the south-central GBSL and west-central DPL, with a notable increase in contamination in autumn. The comprehensive risk assessment, utilizing various indicators such as the Sediment Quality Guidelines (SQGs), Improved Potential Ecological Risk Index (IPERI), Geo-accumulation Index (Igeo), Contamination Factor (CF), and Enrichment Factor (EF), identified arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni), and chromium (Cr) as primary contaminants of concern. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model, coupled with Spearman analysis, attributed over 70 % of HMs pollution to anthropogenic activities. This research provides a nuanced understanding of HMs pollution in the context of large-scale water diversion projects and offers a scientific basis for targeted pollution mitigation strategies.

The empirical relationships between nutrient and chlorophyll a (Chia) level and Secchi depth (SD) are widely used as a theoretical basis for lake eutrophication management. However, these relationships are largely influenced by hydromorphological conditions and biogeochemical processes. Thus, there is a need to establish a type-specific understanding of these interactions. In the current study, lakes in the Chinese Eastern Plains ecoregion were subdivided into four lake types according to water retention time (LRT), water depth, and water area. Regression analyses indicated that the impacts of nutrient (total nitrogen, TN; total phosphorus, TP) concentrations on summer Chla were significantly reduced in lakes with high inorganic suspended solids (ISS) (P<0.05). Meanwhile, the decrease in SD in these lakes were found to relate mainly to non-algal turbidity. In lakes characterized by both short LRT and high ISS content, the Chla exhibited limited response to nutrients. In contrast, in lakes with low ISS content and long LRT, the observed slopes of both Chla=f(TP) and SD=f(Chla) were significantly steeper (P < 0.05). The factors limiting summer algal growth and the development of type-specific nutrient criteria (TN and TP) of all four investigated lake types in the Eastern Plains ecoregion are discussed in the context of specific nutrients. Based on these results, we establish type-specific eutrophication assessment equations of TN, TP, Chla, and SD in our study lakes. Our results may provide essential information for achieving the cost-effective eutrophication management of lakes both in the Eastern Plains ecoregion and elsewhere with similar climatic and hydromorphological conditions. Moreover, we believe that the subdivision of lakes to allow type-specific eutrophication management framework may prove valuable for other ecoregions where the interpretation of empirical nutrient-Chla and SD relationships suffer from similar serious limitations.					xu, hai/JEP-5422-2023; Zhang, Yunlin/N-5464-2014	Zhang, Yunlin/0000-0002-3382-4570; , Zou/0000-0001-9697-5168													0301-4797	1095-8630				APR 15	2020	260								109923	10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.109923	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.109923								32090794					WOS:000517661900033

Whole organism T4 levels were constant between the egg and pre-hatch embryo stages, but fell progressively during yolk absorption. T3 levels were low from egg to eye-pigment appearance, but then increased prior to hatch and fell again during the post-hatch yolk absorption period. When expressed as ng/tissue, T4 content of the body compartment rose progressively between days 67 and 87 post-fertilization, whilst T4 content of the yolk compartment fell progressively during the same period; the pattern was not evident for tissue T3 content. When expressed as ng/g dry weight of tissue, the inverse relationship was found for T4, and T3 content of the body and yolk compartments decreased progressively and increased progressively, respectively during the same period, suggesting that thyroid hormones were selectively retained in the yolk compartment. Intensely ''immunostained'' (using anti-human beta-TSH antibody) thyrotropic cells were present in small numbers in the pars distalis of the embryonic pituitary at the eye-pigment appearance stage, and the numbers increased markedly until the pre-hatch period. Administration of either bovine thyrotropic hormone (bTSH) or ovine growth hormone (oGH) had no effect on thyroid hormone content of larvae challenged during the yolk absorption period, suggesting that the thyroid tissue was not responsive to exogenous bTSH challenge at this time, and that oGH-sensitive 5'-monodeiodination was either not present or at levels that were too low to cause an elevation in total T3 content, or that the substrate levels were insufficient to permit a measureable increase in whole body T3 content.																			0920-1742					AUG	1993	12	2					149	159		10.1007/BF00004380	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00004380								24202694					WOS:A1993LZ11300008

A long-term trend due to nutrient loading dominates the series. Seasonality also is prominent, apparently controlled by direct physical factors unrelated to the trophic cascade. A 3-yr cycle has been detected and several possible mechanisms are considered. Irregular fluctuations also are present, caused in part by isolated events (a forest fire) and recurring but variable phenomena (spring mixing). Except possibly for the 3-yr cycle, the known sources of variability appear to operate 'bottom-up' through direct physical and chemical effects on the phytoplankton.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				OCT 30	1992	246	3					195	203		10.1007/BF00005697	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00005697													WOS:A1992KB85000002

However, its provenance remains controversial. In this study, the surface microtextures of grains from the QARE were observed, and compared with those of grains from the loess deposit on the Loess Plateau in northern China. The results show that the surface microtextures and morphologies of the quartz grains in the QARE are distinctly different from those in the northern loess, indicating that the deposits in the two regions have different provenances. The Gobi and deserts in inland northwestern China are not considered as the primary provenance for the QARE in southern China. It is suggested that the large areas of dry and bare river and lake beds and floodplains in the MRYR, which became exposed during glacial periods, provided the dominant source for materials in the QARE. We suggest that against the background of the middle-Pleistocene climate transition (MPT), regional aridification and a strengthened east Asian winter monsoon (driven by global cooling and the rapid uplift of the Tibetan Plateau) were primary drivers for the initiation of the QARE deposit in the MRYR region in southern China. The development of large areas of aeolian red earth deposit is direct evidence of environmental deterioration in the MRYR, indicating a cold and dry environment with frequent aeolian activity, in an area that now experiences a warm and humid subtropical monsoon climate. The results are also evidence of a regional response in the mid-subtropics of southern China to the MPT global cooling event around 1.2 Ma.					李, 岩/GRR-5804-2022; Feng, Xiaonan/OMN-2363-2025; wang, tao/AGJ-1581-2022; tao, wang/LQK-4781-2024	wang, tao/0000-0002-2892-1050; Li, Yan/0000-0001-9909-1675													1672-6316	1993-0321				AUG	2021	18	8					2048	2060		10.1007/s11629-020-6523-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-020-6523-3													WOS:000681747700006

Therefore, comprehending the climatic evolution history of this region is pivotal for elucidating early human civilization development. The research focuses on a fully enclosed crater lake located in the northern Chinese steppe by utilizing n-alkanes, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) in lake sediments, based on AMS-14C dating analysis, the climatic and environmental evolution history of this region from the last deglaciation to the middle Holocene has been reconstructed, and the impact of climate change on the evolution of early human civilization is elucidated. The findings indicate that the EASM driven by summer solar radiation, exerts control over the climate and hydrology in the steppe region of northern China. Since the last deglaciation, the gradual warming and humidification of the climate environment have significantly enhanced the animal and plant resources, thereby establishing a solid foundation for the transition of early human populations in northern Chinese steppe from high-mobility hunter-gatherers to settled communities. Additionally, this climatic shift has provided an optimal backdrop for the emergence of primitive agriculture. The changes of stone tool assemblages unearthed at related sites also confirm the above views. However, the climate model underwent rapid changes during the period of 7.2-6.4 cal kyr BP, leading to the occurrence of extreme arid climate events. Consequently, regional precipitation decreased, lake ecology became imbalanced, woody plants retreated in the basin, and vegetation coverage was greatly reduced. The aforementioned factor may have played a pivotal role in the disappearance of early populations within the region. Consequently, climate and environmental change not only serve as the primary driving force behind human civilization's development but also act as an inexorable catalyst for its decline.

Wagenitz, L. iconicum (Boiss. & Heldr.) Kuntze, and L. anatolicum Hedge] of Lake Tuz in central Anatolia, Turkey. Samples were collected between May and October from plants growing in their natural habitats. Soil samples also were taken from the plant root zone at the time of plant sampling. The results of pH, electrical conductivity (EC) values, and mineral composition in the soil showed seasonal changes. The highest EC and soil Na+ concentrations were found in the autumn. The seasonal changes in the osmolyte concentrations of plants were found to be dependent on soil properties such as EC, anions, and cations. The investigated plants exhibit different abilities to accumulate proline, inorganic ions, soluble carbohydrates, and quaternary ammonium compounds. Proline, ion, and carbohydrate concentrations were found to be negatively related to EC, Na+, and Cl(-)values of soil. These results show us that each species has its own adaptation mechanism to survive in saline soil.

The health of this wetland ecosystem is rapidly deteriorating due to eutrophication and water pollution and environmental management is urgently needed. To explore the connections among ecosystem health, prey density, and shorebird populations, we conducted surveys of both the benthic macroinvertebrates and shorebirds in the shorebird habitat of the wetland during the 2011 autumn migration season. The abundance of both shorebirds and benthic macroinvertebrates varied significantly in both space and time. Our data showed a clear association between shorebird populations and the density of benthic macroinvertebrates, which explained 53.63% of the variation in shorebird abundance. The prey density was strongly affected by environmental factors, including water and sediment quality. Chironomidae were mainly found at sites with higher total phosphorus, but with lower sediment concentrations of Cu. Lymnaeidae were mainly found at sites with a higher pH, lower salinity, and lower concentrations of total phosphorus and Cu. Habitats with very high concentrations of total phosphorus, heavy metals, or salinity were not suitable for benthic macroinvertebrates. Our findings suggest that the reductions of nutrient and heavy metal loadings are crucial in maintaining the ecological function of Wuliangsuhai as a stopover habitat for migratory shorebirds.

The timing and forcing mechanisms of climatic change in this region are still controversial, however. Aeolian sand and silt deposits, which are widely distributed in the NETP, can be readily dated by optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) techniques and reveal the sensitive response of the landscape to climatic change. In this study, aeolian sand and loess at six sites around Qinghai Lake were studied to reconstruct millennial-scale climatic changes during the Holocene. Multiproxy data along with 24 OSL age determinations show that low effective moisture and aeolian activity occurred at c. 13 ka, 10-9.1 ka, and 8.9-7.8 ka. Periods of greater effective moisture may have occurred at similar to 11 ka and 9 ka, and there is evidence for a previously undocumented wet climate at 4-3 ka. These results show that millennial-scale Holocene palaeoclimatic changes in the NETP cannot be explained simply as direct responses to changes in monsoon precipitation forced by summer insolation. We suggest that changes in effective moisture were determined by the balance between monsoon-induced rainfall and evaporation loss (mainly controlled by temperature). Thus, climatic change in the NETP may have been influenced by complex interactions between the monsoon circulation and local convection/ evaporation effects, in addition to large-scale change in the Asian monsoon and the westerlies.

Stationary and nonstationary spectral analyses are used to identify dominant frequencies. The horizontal distribution of data allows a map of the basin-scale wave energy to be determined. Three-layer normal mode modeling incorporating damping emulates the basin-scale behavior well. This provides estimates of velocity shear and hence the internal stability. The nonstationary frequency analysis identifies times of high-frequency internal wave activity (wave periods of similar to 2-10 min). This is definitely linked to the basin-scale wave-driven shear and hence, to deceases in stability. Estimates of dissipation for the thermocline and hypolimnion are 3 x 10(-8) and 6 x 10(-9) m(2) s(-3), respectively. The inferred variability in the hypolimnetic Value is demonstrated.

Geography and Host Identity Shape Intraseasonal Variation of Free-Living and Zooplankton Associated Microbial Communities in Alpine Lakes	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Microbes contribute to aquatic ecosystem function and the fitness of macroscopic organisms, including zooplankton. Many factors affect the taxonomic compositions of free-living (bacterioplankton) and zooplankton-associated microbial communities in lakes; yet how these communities vary seasonally and among lakes remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate how free-living bacterial communities and those associated with different crustacean zooplankton hosts change in response to fluctuations in their natural environment across time and space. We repeatedly sampled bacterioplankton, zooplankton communities, zooplankton microbiomes, and water chemistry parameters of six lakes in the eastern Sierra Nevada mountains of California across a summer season. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed clear differences in the community composition and relative abundance of bacterial taxa between bacterioplankton and zooplankton microbiomes, which was best explained by lake and host identity rather than intraseasonal sampling times. Bacterioplankton communities were highly conserved across the summer season and showed higher alpha diversity, but lower species turnover, than zooplankton microbiomes, which were more variable and largely partitioned by host taxa and phylogenetics (Copepoda vs. Cladocera). Spatial and local environmental context (drainage basin, home-lake habitat) interacted secondarily with community types (free-living, host-associated) and zooplankton host identity to shape bacterial community composition. These results show that deterministic processes related to host filtering, host taxonomy, and spatial/environmental variation among lakes drive changes in microbial communities more than temporal changes within lakes. Higher beta diversity among zooplankton-associated microbes suggests dispersal limitation and/or local selection play stronger roles for zooplankton microbiomes than for free-living bacterioplankton.					; Wall, Christopher/ACJ-0486-2022	Wall, Christopher/0000-0002-7164-3201; Demmel, Margaret/0000-0001-5754-7638													0962-1083	1365-294X				OCT	2025	34	19								10.1111/mec.70069	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.70069		AUG 2025						40797364					WOS:001548153500001

The initial seismic survey was conducted during the 2019-2020 Antarctic summer season, utilizing infrastructure from the Jang Bogo Station and the Korean inland route (K-Route). This survey confirmed the existence of a subglacial lake and provided comprehensive data for preliminary structural analysis. Based on these findings, a second seismic survey was conducted during the summer of 2021-2022. In this survey, we employed a methodology to address the environmental challenges of the Antarctic inland ice sheet and to enhance detection resolution for subglacial lake sedimentary structures. In the second survey, the explosive charge was increased from 400 g to 1,600 g, the number of rod-type receiver channels was expanded from 48 to 96 channels, and the fold number was increased from 1 to 4 or 8, improving data quality and clarity. In addition, 25-30 m hot-water drilling was used to position explosives within the boreholes, which were then allowed to freeze solidly to maximize energy transmission efficiency. These high-quality seismic data enabled precise delineation of the subglacial lake's size, structural features, and underlying sedimentary layers, thereby providing critical information for selecting optimal sites for further hot-water drilling. This dataset establishes foundational resources for Antarctic subglacial lake research and will support future studies on subglacial lake dynamics and structural analyses across Antarctica.																			1229-1064	2384-051X					2024	27	4					244	257		10.7582/GGE.2024.27.4.244	http://dx.doi.org/10.7582/GGE.2024.27.4.244													WOS:001380188000005

At the time of dispersal in autumn almost all the seeds were dormant. Pretreatment of 6-month-old seeds for only 2 wk at either constant or alternating temperatures ranging from 5-15 C under either light/dark or dark conditions significantly improved the germinability of seeds as compared with controls. Injury to the embryos of 6-wk-old seeds stimulated 98 and 88% of them to germinate in comparison to only 3% in intact seeds, suggesting the existence of an inhibitor in the embryos. Dry storage of seeds at room temperature did not significantly alter their germinability during the 1st 26 wk after seed collection. After 26 wk, germination percentage of the stored seeds increased significantly.																			0003-0031	1938-4238				JUL	1989	122	1					77	87		10.2307/2425685	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2425685													WOS:A1989AG90500009

This study aimed to find out if phosphorus (P) could be withdrawn from such lakes by utilizing the wintertime accumulation of P to the near-bottom water.Methods Data for water quality and sediment characteristics were collected from two eutrophic boreal lakes with tube samplers and sediment corers. Diffusion rates of P across the sediment-water interface (SWI) and within the active sediment layers, and potential export of P via wintertime withdrawal were calculated.Results In the stratifying Lake Kymij & auml;rvi, P concentration in the near-bottom water reached 66 mu g L-1 and P diffusion across SWI in the hypoxic area 5.4 mg m-2 d-1. In the shallow Lake Savij & auml;rvi, maximum P concentration was 78 mu g L-1 but P diffusion rate only 0.34 mg m-2 d-1. In Kymij & auml;rvi, the concentrations of Fe and Mn in the sediment were high relative to P. In Savij & auml;rvi, sediment P was bound to clay minerals and calcium carbonates, while Fe was bound in sulfides.Conclusion In Kymij & auml;rvi, a theoretical14.3% reduction in epilimnetic TP concentration could be achieved in 20 years with 20 L s-1 winter withdrawal. In Savij & auml;rvi, 10 L s-1 withdrawal could theoretically cause a 5.8% reduction in TP concentration in 5 years, but the low P diffusion rate across SWI, and the low discharge of the lake may limit P removal. In Kymij & auml;rvi, where summertime withdrawal is already applied, additional winter withdrawal could accelerate lake recovery.					; Jilbert, Tom/AAL-2273-2021	Niemisto, Juha/0000-0003-3516-5596; Silvonen, Soila/0000-0002-0924-7187													1439-0108	1614-7480				2024 JUN 12	2024										10.1007/s11368-024-03838-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-024-03838-2		JUN 2024											WOS:001245932500001

Potential expansion of aridity in the region will increase dust sources and threaten the densely populated east. Predicting regional hydroclimate changes in a warming climate, therefore, is invaluable for stakeholders. However, our understanding of the sensitivity of regional hydroclimate to temperature changes is limited, in part due to a lack of historical records. In this study, we reconstruct hydroclimate changes in the transition zone over the past millennium, based on the sediment organic contents and its stable carbon isotopes, from the Xiligou Lake in the northeastern QTP. We find that the lake basin was humid during part of the previous cold and warm anomaly, namely, the Little Ice Age and the Medieval Warm Period. This "bimodal pattern" was likely due to an alternation of the ASM and Westerlies as moisture suppliers. Subsequently, we find that the lake basin experienced a short-lived high stand event during the 1920s, superimposed on a wetting trend since 1850 AD. The event was likely caused by meltwater input and its demise can be partially attributed to the excess water demand from human activities. Our finding suggests that the configuration of circulations is likely to play an important role in directing the hydroclimate changes in the ASM-Westerlies transition zone, and additional evaluation should be made on the impact from increasing human activities.

J	Straile, D; Hälbich, A				Straile, D; Hälbich, A			Life history and multiple antipredator defenses of an invertebrate pelagic predator, Bythotrephes longimanus	ECOLOGY												Multiple antipredator defense strategies and their interactions were examined in a field study of the predatory planktonic waterflea Bythotrephes longimanus in Lake Constance, at the northern fringe of the European Alps. Because of its large body size and conspicuousness, Bythotrephes is a preferred prey of freshwater fish. We observed seasonal changes in life history and morphology and diel vertical migration, all best understood as a response to fish predation. Bythotrephes population dynamics were characterized by pronounced population growth in late spring, maximum abundances in June, and a steady decline toward the end of the season. In late spring, high population growth rates were achieved by means of large clutches, low investment in individual offspring, and small size at first reproduction. While the population was still increasing, a marked life history shift occurred. The reproductive strategy of females switched toward high per-offspring allocation at the expense of clutch size. This change in reproductive behavior resulted in an increase in the size of neonates and was accompanied by an increase in the size at first reproduction. Such a life history shift is typically observed in the presence of gape-limited predators, which points to the importance of juvenile fish as the principal vertebrate planktivores in Lake Constance. The length of Bythotrephes defensive spina increased throughout the season, reflecting increasing predation pressure, probably owing to seasonally increasing mouth gape size of juvenile fish. In contrast to the predictions of the predator-avoidance theory, the migration amplitude of large and conspicuous Bythotrephes was small as compared to other zooplankton species. We argue that theory and data can be reconciled ii: the migration behavior of Bythotrephes is considered as a result of an interaction of predator defenses in the presence of predominantly juvenile, gape-limited fish. As Bythotrephes achieved protection because of its life history and spina, the costs of large diel migrations may outweigh the benefits.

Climatology of Lake-Effect Precipitation Events over Lake Tahoe and Pyramid Lake	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												The frequency, timing, and environmental conditions of lake-effect (LE) precipitation over Lake Tahoe and Pyramid Lake in northern California and western Nevada were examined for the 14 winters (September-March) from 1996/97 through 2009/10. Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) data from Reno, Nevada (KRGX), were used to identify 62 LE events. LE precipitation occurred as single bands extending downwind from overlake areas, and as isolated regions of overlake precipitation with little or no extension over land. Mesoscale vortices were also identified during both Lake Tahoe and Pyramid Lake LE events. An average of 4.4 LE events occurred each winter in the Lake Tahoe and Pyramid Lake region, with events occurring most frequently in October. LE events had an average duration of 6.3 h, approximately half the duration of LE events observed over Lake Champlain, the New York State Finger Lakes, or the Great Salt Lake. The observed conditions during LE events in the Lake Tahoe and Pyramid Lake region typically had 1) mean surface air temperatures below freezing, 2) mean surface wind speeds of <2.0 m s(-1) (notably weaker than during lake effect in other areas), 3) a mean lake-air temperature difference of 11.5 degrees C, and 4) a mean lake-700-hPa temperature difference of 20.9 degrees C.																			1558-8424	1558-8432				FEB	2016	55	2					297	312		10.1175/JAMC-D-14-0230.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-14-0230.1													WOS:000370418300003

Relative Sea-Level Changes and Ice Sheet History in Finderup Land, North Greenland	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												Rising global sea level caused by melting ice sheets poses a major challenge in a persistently warming climate. The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is among the main contributors, and in order to make accurate predictions of future ice retreat and sea level rise, it is imperative to understand how the ice sheet responded to global warming in the past. Reconstructions of relative sea level (RSL) are a key constraint in models of past ice sheet fluctuations, however, high-precision data has until now been sparse in North Greenland. In this study, we present a RSL reconstruction for Finderup Land, North Greenland based on five isolation lakes located between 19.6 and 81.2 m a.s.l. The transition between marine and lacustrine sediments has been identified using XRF, lithological interpretation, and foraminiferal analysis. Age constraints are based on C-14 dating of foraminifera and paleomagnetic age correlation. Our results show that Finderup Land was ice free by 10.8 +/- 0.2 cal ka BP with a subsequent rapid RSL fall occurring from 9.5 +/- 0.2 to 8.0 cal ka BP, at which point the RSL started to approach present level. Furthermore, we establish the marine limit to be minimum at 81.2 m a.s.l. We compare our data to modeled RSL predictions for the area and our results indicate a faster RSL fall, which in turn reflects that the ice retreat was more rapid than estimated and possibly, that the ice sheet in North and Northeast Greenland was larger than previous estimates suggest.

A horticultural program reported to overcome citrus juvenility was tested at the Florida Citrus Research Foundation Whitmore Farm (Lake County), using replicated Hirado Buntan x Clementine seedlings and standard cultivars all propagated onto US-812 rootstock. Due to cold-winters, influence of treatments on cold-injury was evaluated and damage was too great to assess juvenility reduction uncompromised by this injury. Treatments compared on each genotype were: 1) non-trained control, 2) training to a single upright shoot (TSUS), 3) TSUS with trunk-scoring in December, 4) TSUS with soil paclobutrazol in December, 5) TSUS with weekly thorn removal, and 6) TSUS with weekly thorn removal and scoring in December (complete juvenility reduction program). Trunk diameter increased faster on non-trained vs. TSUS trees. In Jan 2010, there were 23 hours < -4.4 degrees C and 1 hour < -6.7 degrees C. Trees were assessed for cold damage: 26% of non-trained trees vs. 100% of TSUS trees displayed damage ranging from nearly complete defoliation to death. In control trees 11% were killed. TSUS trees of treatments 2, 4, and 5 had mortality of 9% to 17%, while trunk-scored trees (treatments 3 and 6) had higher mortality at 23% to 34%. Even though a cold protection tarp system was installed and used on surviving trees during the period of coldest weather in early December, further damage occurred following freezing conditions in Dec. 2010 with 17 hours < -4.4 degrees C and 1 hour < -6.7 degrees C. TSUS trees again showed much more damage than non-trained trees with a cumulative 66% to 83% mortality vs. only 17% for non-trained controls. These techniques increase risk of serious winter-injury, and require more elaborate cold protection to be implemented in colder areas such as Lake County.																			0886-7283						2011	124						95	100																WOS:000692113200023

It merges information related to the fieldwork analysis and subaquatic observations together with the study of historical sources. This methodology duality allows providing unpublished data from the lakes bottom and allows contrasting the repercussions that the land usage of the slopes has had on them. The methodology has been applied to the Laguna Conceja, one of the most emblematic from the Lagunas de Ruidera. However, despite of having been the subject research from various scientific perspectives, it is still necessary to know the recent evolution experienced by its surroundings, the status of the vegetation covers located on slopes and banks and the landscape of its bottom. As a result, the morphology of the lacustrine basin, the presence of submerged tuffaceous ledges, the lutitic nature of the bottom sediments, the location of subaquatic springs and the identification of hydrophilic elements not mentioned up to the present have been determined. Finally, the aggressions suffered during the last centuries by the vegetation covers have seldom left any important accumulations of terrigenous that could threaten the filling and the future functionality of the precipitation processes in this tufa lake.

Cyanobacterial blooms in the central basin of Lake Erie: Potentials for cyanotoxins and environmental drivers	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake Erie western basin (WB) cyanobacterial blooms are a yearly summer occurrence; however, blooms have also been reported in the offshore waters of the central basin (CB), and very little is known about what drives these blooms or their potential for cyanobacterial toxins. Cyanobacteria Index was quantified using MODIS and MERIS data for the CB between 2003 and 2017, and water samples were collected between 2013 and 2017. The goals were to 1) quantify cyanobacteria, 2) determine environmental drivers of CB blooms, and 3) determine the potential for cyanobacterial toxins in the CB. Dolichospermum (Anabaena) occurred in the CB during July before the onset of the WB bloom, and then in August and September, the cyanobacteria community shifted towards Microcystis. The largest Dolichospermum blooms (2003, 2012, 2013, and 2015) were associated with reduced water clarity (Secchi disk depth < 4 m), whereas large CB Microcystis blooms (2011 and 2015) were associated with large WB blooms. Dolichospermum blooms occurred in high nitrate concentrations (>20 mu mol/L) and high nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratios (>100), which indicate nutrient concentrations or ratios did not select for Dolichospermum. Additionally, the sxtA gene, but not mcyE or microcystins, were detected in the CB during July 2016 and 2017. The mcyE gene and microcystins were detected in the CB during August 2016 and 2017. The results indicate the CB's potential for cyanotoxins shifts from saxitoxins to microcystins throughout the summer. Continued monitoring of cyanobacteria and multiple cyanobacterial toxins is recommended to ensure safe drinking water for CB coastal communities.

A three-dimensional stratigraphic model for the Messinian crisis in the Pannonian Basin, eastern Hungary	BASIN RESEARCH												A three-dimensional quantitative stratigraphic forward model is employed to investigate the controls leading to the Messinian events in the lacustrine Pannonian Basin of Central Paratethys, and the link between the Messinian salinity crisis in the Mediterranean and the late Miocene-Pliocene stratigraphy of the Pannonian Basin. Subsurface geological data show that a prominent unconformity surface formed during Messinian time in the Pannonian Basin associated with a sudden forced regression, abrupt basinward shift of facies and a subsequent, prolonged lowstand normal regression. The lowstand prograding series filled up the shallow basin fast, while, at the same time, the marginal areas of the basin were subject to tectonic inversion. The Dionisos program used in this research is built on a nonlinear water-driven sediment diffusion process, and it employs multiple sediment classes, basin flexure and compaction. Four different scenarios were built in the experiments to test possible basin histories with different rates and timing of tectonic inversion. Each scenario was modelled in two versions: including and not including a lake-level fall in the Messinian. The results confirm that the Pannonian Basin in the study area has undergone a tectonic inversion since the Messinian, although the exact rates of uplift at different locations remain uncertain. The unconformity and the observed stratigraphic architecture and facies pattern could be modelled adequately only in the versions that applied a Messinian lake-level fall. Our research concludes that the Messinian unconformity in the Pannonian Basin was caused by an absolute lake-level drop, likely linked to the desiccation of the Mediterranean, followed by subsidence and normal regression in the basin centre and concomitant tectonic inversion and uplift along the basin margins.

J	Newell, JC; Quinn, TP				Newell, JC; Quinn, TP			Behavioral thermoregulation by maturing adult sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) in a stratified lake prior to spawning	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Adult sockeye salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka (Walbaum in Artedi, 1792), return to Lake Washington several months prior to spawning, spending the warmest months of the year in the lake. We proposed that the fish selected a temperature range ideal for final sexual maturation and energy conservation prior to swimming upstream to spawn. The temperature preferences of the adult sockeye salmon in Lake Washington are attributable to physiological factors, as they are not avoiding predators or seeking prey and are not limited by dissolved oxygen. At the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks, 257 sockeye salmon were tagged with temperature loggers in the summer of 2003, and 38 taus with readable data were recovered. The fish spent an average of 6 days swimming through the ship canal's warm water (ca. 18 degrees C) and then experienced a drop to temperatures of 13 degrees C or lower when they entered the lake and descended below the thermocline. Fish remained in the lake for an average of 83 days before migrating upstream to spawn, as indicated by a sudden increase in recorded temperature. Approximately 92% of temperature records in the lake were 9-11 degrees C, corresponding to depths of 18-30 m. The salmon rarely occupied the cooler and warmer waters available to them. Finally, the apparent thermal preference decreased over the summer, perhaps as a function of sexual maturation.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				SEP	2005	83	9					1232	1239		10.1139/Z05-113	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/Z05-113													WOS:000233303800009
J	Kenney, BC				Kenney, BC			Physical limnological processes under ice	HYDROBIOLOGIA					1st International Lake Ladoga Symposium on Ecological Problems of Lake Ladoga	NOV 22-26, 1993	ST PETERSBURG, RUSSIA	Univ Joensuu, Finland, Russian Acad Sci, Inst Limnol				Penetration of solar radiation through ice and snow covering northern lakes produces a gravity current between regions with varying depths. This baroclinic current is a dominant physical process in winter because ice cover insulates lakes from the usual turbulence sources such as breaking surface waves and near-surface shear produced by the wind. The current forms a directed circulation from the littoral zone to the centre of the lake that is an important distribution mechanism for nutrients and other chemical and biological constituents. Heat transported by the current degrades the ice cover and makes surface travel hazardous. The thinning of the ice cover is most severe at the inlet to isolated bays with mean depths that differ significantly from the lake. At the mouth of a bay, the gravity current takes the form of a two-layer flow with inflow to the bay occurring near the surface. The lower layer has the largest temperature gradients and is dominated by a succession of progressive internal bores which decrease in amplitude overnight and with increasing cloud cover. The repetition of the bores occurs very close to the period of the uninodal barotropic seiche which suggests that the internal bores are forced by the surface seiche.																			0018-8158					APR 12	1996	322	1-3					85	90		10.1007/BF00031810	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00031810													WOS:A1996UT84700014
C	Jakobsen, B		Hong, Y; Mazzolani, FM; Gao, F		Jakobsen, Bernt			Design of the Submerged Floating Tunnel operating under various conditions	ISAB-2010 - FIRST INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ARCHIMEDES BRIDGE	Procedia Engineering				1st International Symposium on Archimedes Bridge (ISAB-2010)	OCT 17-20, 2010	Qiandao Lake, PEOPLES R CHINA					In Norway there has been identified several crossings with a variety of different conditions under which a Submerged Floating Tunnel, SFT or Archimedes Bridge, may be used. In the Hogsfjord project whose feasibility was well documented before the project was stopped for local political reasons the length was some 1400 m, the water depth about 150 m and the site was well protected from large sea waves. However, swell, vortex shedding and slowly varying internal waves due to layers of different salinity presented a hazard of significant dynamic oscillations. In the wake of the Hogsfjord project feasibility studies have been undertaken in Norway for sites at the very inlet of a fiord directly exposed to the big North Sea waves, in an inland lake with ice infested waters, in fiords threatened by large waves induced by huge, falling rock masses, and most recently the largest fiord in the country, the Sognefjorden which at the identified crossing site is 3700 m wide and 1250 m deep. In addition to the challenge of these various conditions some common accidental situations have to be solved for all applications including fire, sinking ships, falling anchors as well as sudden massive water ingress into the tube. The paper discusses the design challenges presented by the various conditions and pros and cons for alternative technical solutions for these various applications and summarizes some of the experiences learned by the Norwegian studies.

Environmental Refuges during Summertime Heat and Elevated Ozone Levels: A Preliminary Case Study of an Urban "Cool Zone" Building	BUILDINGS												The combination of extreme heat waves and ozone pollution is a major health hazard for urban populations in the summertime, particularly for the most sensitive groups such as children, the elderly, the unsheltered, and those with pre-existing health conditions. The "Cool Zone Program", operated by the Salt Lake County Aging and Adult Services, identifies areas in the county and Salt Lake City facilities where members of the public can escape the summer heat, hydrate, and learn about available programs. We measured indoor and outdoor temperature and ozone for a pilot study at a designated Cool Zone location during the 22 August-6 September 2019 period and found that the building provided substantial heat relief and protection from more than 75% of the outdoor ozone. We observed a nearly 35 min delay for the outdoor ozone to be reflected on the indoor readings, providing an action window for ventilation scheduling changes to protect against the highest ozone levels during the day. Our findings show that it is critical to re-think and formulate action plans to protect vulnerable populations from excessive heat and pollution events during the summer.

In the last decades, the ACP landscape experienced extreme climate events and increased lake water withdrawal (LWW) for infrastructure construction, primarily ice roads and industrial operations. However, their potential (combined) effects on streamflow are relatively underexplored. Here, we applied the process-based, spatially distributed hydrological and thermal Water Balance Simulation Model (10 m spatial resolution) to the 30 km(2) Crea Creek watershed located on the ACP. The impacts of documented seasonal climate extremes and LWW were evaluated on seasonal runoff (May-August), including minimum 7-day mean flow (MQ7), the recovery time of MQ7 to pre-perturbation conditions, and the duration of streamflow conditions that prevents fish passage. Low-rainfall scenarios (21% of normal, one to three summers in a row) caused a larger reduction in MQ7 (-56% to -69%) than LWW alone (-44% to -58%). Decadal-long consecutive LWW under average climate conditions resulted in a new equilibrium in low flow and seasonal runoff after 3 years that included a disconnected stream network, a reduced watershed contributing area (54% of total watershed area), and limited fish passage of 20 days (vs. 6 days under control conditions) throughout summer. Our results highlight that, even under current average climatic conditions, LWW is not offset by same-year snowmelt as currently assumed in land management regulations. Effective land management would therefore benefit from considering the combined impact of climate change and industrial LWWs.					; Gädeke, Anne/ABG-9630-2021; alexeev, vladimir/B-2234-2010	Arp, Christopher/0000-0002-6485-6225; Liljedahl, Anna/0000-0001-7114-6443; Jones, Benjamin/0000-0002-1517-4711; Wipfli, Mark/0000-0002-4856-6068; Gadeke, Anne/0000-0003-0514-2908													0043-1397	1944-7973				AUG	2022	58	8							e2022WR032119	10.1029/2022WR032119	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022WR032119													WOS:000837517100001

In particular, the transitional periods before ice formation and after ice thawing present a rare combination of low water temperature and high light (LT-HL), which may cause photo-inhibition (light-induced reduction in photosystem II [PSII] efficiency). To examine the seasonal photosynthetic responses of marimo, we conducted assessments under both field and controlled laboratory conditions, focusing on transitional periods. Using continuous monitoring of water temperature and underwater light intensity photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), in combination with chlorophyll fluorescence measurements, we evaluated photosynthetic activity and photoprotective capacity in marimo collected across five seasonal stages: (i) summer, pre-freezing (late December; before surface ice formed above the marimo colony), (ii) ice-covered (March; under continuous ice and snow cover), (iii) immediately post-thawing (early April); (iv) after ice had melted above the marimo colony, and (v) post-thawing (early May) periods. Our results showed that marimo maintained high PSII efficiency (F-v/F-m >0.6) in both summer and ice-covered periods, whereas marked photoinhibition occurred in the immediate post-thawing period (F-v/F-m < 0.3 on sun-exposed surfaces). Although PSII repair under low light was rapid, it plateaued after 30 min of exposure. Full recovery of F-v/F-m and nonphotochemical quenching occurred within 20 to 30 days under natural conditions. These findings suggest the physiological vulnerability of marimo during seasonal transitions and emphasize the need for conservation strategies that address habitat degradation and light-induced stress events driven by climate variability.																			1322-0829	1440-1835				2025 SEP 28	2025										10.1111/pre.70013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pre.70013		SEP 2025											WOS:001583573700001

This study addresses these gaps by investigating cloud properties and precipitation patterns utilizing the Fengyun-4 Satellite Quantitative Precipitation Estimation Product (FY4A-QPE) and ERA5 datasets. We specifically focus on Lanzhou, a pivotal city within the LP, and Xining, which epitomizes the HV. Our findings reveal that diurnal variations in precipitation are significantly less pronounced in the eastern regions compared to northeastern TP. This discrepancy is attributed to marked diurnal fluctuations in convective available potential energy (CAPE) and wind shear between 200 and 500 hPa. While both cities share similar wind shear patterns and moisture transport directions, Xining benefits from enhanced snowmelt and effective water retention in surrounding mountains, resulting in higher precipitation levels. Conversely, Lanzhou suffers from moisture deficits, with dry, hot winds exacerbating the situation. Notably, precipitation in Xining is strongly correlated with CAPE, influenced by diurnal variability, and intensified by valley and lake-land breezes, which drive afternoon convection. In contrast, Lanzhou's precipitation exhibits a weak relationship with CAPE, as even elevated values fail to generate significant cloud formation due to insufficient moisture. The ongoing trends of warming and humidification may lead to improved precipitation patterns, especially in the HV, with potential ecological benefits. However, concentrated rainfall during summer afternoons and midnights raises concerns regarding extreme weather events, highlighting the susceptibility of the HV to geological hazards. This research underscores the need to further explore the uncertainties inherent in precipitation dynamics in these regions.

J	Miri, A; Maleki, S; Middleton, N				Miri, Abbas; Maleki, Saeideh; Middleton, Nick			An investigation into climatic and terrestrial drivers of dust storms in the Sistan region of Iran in the early twenty-first century	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Dust storms cause a wide range of impacts on environment, economy and human health in the Sistan region of southeastern Iran. This paper investigates long-term variability of dust activity over 23 years (1997-2019) using the Dust Storm Index (DSI) and the frequency of dust-storm days (DSD, visibility <1000 m) and assesses the associated importance of various terrestrial and climatic drivers. A dust storm corridor was identified, based on the prevailing wind direction at Zabol, including parts of the Hamoun lakes and surrounding desert in order to study the effects of vegetation cover and lake water levels on dust activity. The results show maximum intensity of dust storms occurred at 10:30 a.m. and in the summer, consistent with the highest wind speeds - associated with the regionally important Levar wind - and highest air temperatures and lowest precipitation and relative humidity. Strong positive correlations were demonstrated between DSI and wind speed, particularly in summer. The 2000-2004 period saw severe dust-raising activity with a DSI of 530.6. Mean wind speeds were greater and precipitation, humidity, vegetation and water coverage were lower during this severe dust-activity period than in other periods. Comparing 2000-2004 with 1997-1999, DSI was five times higher and DSD eight times higher. The dust storms with the longest duration occurred in July 2001 and June 2008 (114 h and 78 h respectively). The July 2001 event, in which wind speed peaked at 25 m/s and visibility dropped to 100 m on several occasions, may be the longest continuous dust storm on record. The key role of water and vegetation cover in the Harnouns was highlighted, indicating the importance of protecting the Hamoun ecosystems and sustainably managing their water resources in efforts to mitigate dust storm hazards in the Sistan region.

Assessment of phytoplankton distribution in the nearshore zone using continuous in situ fluorometry	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The Lake Ontario Nearshore Nutrient Survey (LONNS) was conducted in the summer of 2008 to evaluate the effect of the dreissenid invasion. Cladophora, and hydrologic forces on nutrient cycling and phytoplankton dynamics in three nearshore areas of Lake Ontario. These three areas (Oak Orchard, Rochester, and Mexico Bay) differed significantly in terms of their watershed character and riverine inputs. A flow-through system composed of commercial sensors was deployed to continuously monitor these three areas and to map water quality parameters and phytoplankton distribution in high spatial resolution. This system was highly redundant, with multiple sensors to measure algal biomass based on chlorophyll and phycocyanin fluorescence. During the summer, pigment concentrations were generally low (<2 mu g/L for chlorophyll, <1 mu g/L for phycocyanin). Continuous measurements provided a higher resolution than discrete stations and detected slightly higher chlorophyll concentrations associated with the thermal front at Oak Orchard (May) and the river plumes at Oak Orchard (August) and Rochester (June/August). Changes in specific conductance suggest these river plumes stayed close to shore, which led to elevated biomass within the nearshore region. The deployment of the flow-through system enabled the detection and analysis of these fine-scale changes in both phytoplankton and water quality measurements.

BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												This study examines the background seismic noise in the southern Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) using broadband seismic records from Canadian Rockies and Alberta Network (CRANE) and Canadian National Seismograph Network (CNSN). The cross-correlations of vertical-component data reveal highly asymmetric Rayleigh wave signals in the frequency range of 0.02-0.2 Hz. Travel-time and waveform source migration calculations jointly suggest a persistent noise source near Lesser Slave Lake (LSL), a large ice-covered lake in Alberta, Canada, during winter months. The source origin remains unclear, though the gravity current and turbulence induced by laterally varying luminosity, ice thickness, lake depth, and lake-bottom topography could contribute to the observed microseismic signal. Seasonal variations in regional wind energy, ground attenuation, and local industrial and/or recreational activities may also affect the clarity and asymmetry of noise-correlation functions.

Seasonal Variations of Zinc in a Eutrophic Lake	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Depth profiles of dissolved zinc were measured monthly over one year in Lake Greifen, a eutrophic lake. The concentrations are in the range 10-40 nM and show systematic variations over time and depth. Due to the increased binding to particles and subsequent settling, concentrations of zinc in the epilimnion decrease during summer stagnation. Clear correlations between Zn and major nutrients (P, Si) are, however, not observed in the water column. No accumulation of Zn occurs in the anoxic hypolimnion. The Zn sedimentation is related to the sedimentation of algae and of manganese oxide. A mass-balance calculation shows that 87% of the Zn input is retained in the sediments of Lake Greifen.

It remains in close relation to water temperature. The article presents results of DO and water temperature measurements performed for five stratified lakes in Poland in the years 2007-2014. The measurements were performed with monthly frequency in the summer half-year (May-October) in the deepest place of each of the lakes. The compared data show the complex character of the course of both of the parameters. The analysis of depth profiles revealed the prevalence of a decreasing tendency, or no tendency was recorded - both in the case of DO and water temperature. Due to the incoherent character of the water in the case of stratified lakes, a more detailed comparison was performed, referring to changes occurring in zones developed during summer stratification. It was determined that the temperature of the epilimnion was directly dependent on air temperature, and in all cases it showed an increasing tendency. Simultaneously, along with an increase in temperature, in the majority of cases, DO concentration in the zone decreased. In reference to the waters of the hypolimnion, increasing, decreasing, and no tendencies were recorded. The above distribution is determined by individual factors of the lakes morphometry, trophic status, groundwater alimentation, etc. Several years of measurements of DO and water temperature in depth profiles of several lakes in Poland constitute valuable information on the current transformations of the environment of this part of Europe. In the future, the information can provide the basis for long-term analyses over the next decades, enriching global knowledge on those parameters of key importance for water ecosystems.					; Nowak, Bogumil/L-6393-2018; Ptak, Mariusz/O-3217-2015	Ptak, Mariusz/0000-0003-1225-1686; Nowak, Bogumil/0000-0002-6963-770X; 													1898-6196					DEC	2016	23	4					639	650		10.1515/eces-2016-0045	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/eces-2016-0045													WOS:000392814800008

Canada resulted in the production of a large tonnage of arsenic trioxide sludge. Disposal of this material is a significant environmental problem as it is both highly soluble and highly toxic. A pressure oxidation process has been developed to convert this material to insoluble ferric arsenate and to recover the contained gold values. The material is blended with roaster calcine waste and with arsenical gold flotation concentrate to produce an Fe:As molar ratio of about 1.2:1. Under pressure oxidation conditions the iron and arsenic precipitate from solution as insoluble ferric arsenate. During the process. the gold locked in the feed materials is liberated and can be extracted by cyanidation. During the summer of 1990 several pilot plant runs at Lakefield Research demonstrated the feasibility of this process. The results indicated that the final solids were within environmental guidelines for general waste disposal and that gold extraction from the treated product was in excess of 90%. The process parameters were confirmed in a second pilot plant program in the summer of 1991, using column flotation concentrate produced on-site at the Con Mine.																			0304-386X					JUN	1992	30	1-3					29	44		10.1016/0304-386X(92)90075-B	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-386X(92)90075-B													WOS:A1992HY40300002

The strains were as follows: HS-1 (CIS001), HS-7 (CIS007), HS-8 (RDB001), HS-9 (RDB002), HS-13 (RDB006), HS-18 (PAN005), UI-56 (6_Ag7air) and UI-57 (9_Ag9air) strains. The eight strains were isolated from three (3) hot springs in West Java (Ciseeng, Rawa Danau Banten, and Pancar Mountain) and one (1) small lake in Universitas Indonesia (Agathis). The water temperature of habitats were ranges at 36-43 degrees C (Ciseeng), 35-50 degrees C (Rawa Danau Banten), 46-69 degrees C (Pancar Mountain), and 27-29 degrees C (Agathis small lake). Incubation temperature were 23 +/- 1 degrees C (A), 30 +/- 1 degrees C (B), 35 degrees C (C), and 50 degrees C (D), while the observed parameters were cell density during growing and chlorophyll content. Observations were conducted over a period of 42 days. The results showed that all of Synechococcus strains experienced growth phases, i.e. the adaptation (lag) phase, exponential (log) phase, stationary phase, and death phase. The average of cell density of Synechococcus strains decreased at T0-T1 and started to increase at T2 and T3. The highest cell density on the growth curve was found at around 14 days (T14) days for the temperatures of 20 degrees C, 30 degrees C, and 35 degrees C, while it was found at around 35 days (T35) for the temperature of the 50 degrees C. The highest chlorophyll content acquired during studies was differed from each strain. Overall the highest chlorophyll content occurred at the treatment temperature of 20 degrees C, 30 degrees C and 35 degrees C, and the lowest occurred at the treatment temperature of 50 degrees C. However, exception was observed on HS-1 (CIS001) strain grown at a temperature of 50 degrees C which experienced the highest levels of chlorophyll content at T42. The maximum growth temperature of Synechococcus strains were observed at temperatures between 30 degrees C and 35 degrees C.

Geosmin-producing Species of Coelosphaerium (Synechococcales, Cyanobacteria) in Lake Shinji, Japan	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												In Lake Shinji, Japan, periodic outbreaks of musty odour have occurred since mid-May 2007. Although the substance responsible for the odour was identified as geosmin, the odour-producing organism was unknown. We cultivated an axenic unialgal strain and determined that a species of Coelosphaerium (Synechococcales) was responsible for the production of geosmin in Lake Shinji. Our analysis was conducted using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry to determine the odorous compound. To determine the algae species, it was observed by optical microscopy to describe its morphological characteristics and the polymerase chain reaction was used to characterise the nucleotide sequence of the 16S rRNA gene and the 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer region. In addition, we explored the relationship between the number of cells of the Coelosphaerium sp. and the concentration of geosmin. In conclusion, geosmin, the cause of the musty odour in Lake Shinji in autumn 2009, was produced by Coelosphaerium sp., and to our knowledge, this is the first report of a geosmin-producing species in the family Coelosphaeriaceae.

J	STAUFFER, RE				STAUFFER, RE			CHEMISTRY OF SOFT-WATER SEEPAGE LAKES IN THE UPPER MIDWEST - LACUSTRINE ALKALINITY PRODUCTION IN SUMMER	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												A total of 26 soft-water, seepage lakes in the Northern Highlands (NH) of Wisconsin (N = 16) and the Upper Peninsula (UP) of Michigan (N = 10) were sampled four times between early May and mid October 1984 as part of the 'PIRLA' Project (Paleolimnological Investiptions of Recent Lake Acidification). Because of low antecedent recharge of the local water-table, this 'summer' interval likely featured minimal groundwater inputs (< 2 cm over lake surface) to most of these seepage lakes. Based on this hydrogeologic relationship, and on regional deposition data, I evaluated short-term net epilimnetic (June-August) and whole-lake (May-October) sediment-water exchange of ANC, base cations, acid oxy-anions, Al, DOC and silicic acid in these lakes using a simplified mass balance algorithm. Silica, nitrate and ammonium were all efficiently retained in these seepage lakes. The assimilation of NO3- (19 +/- 4 meq m-2) slightly exceeded assimilation of NH4+ (16 +/- 4), resulting in a net internal ANC production of only +3 meq m-2 over 161 d between early May and mid October 1984. Over this same interval ANC production resulting from lacustrine S retention averaged +35 +/- 8 meq m-2 in the NH, but was too variable to be statistically significant (+21 +/- 21 meq m-2) in the UP. Epilimnetic S retentions in mid summer were more comparable (21 +/- 4 in NH; 14 +/- 5 meq m-2 in UP). McNearney Lake (UP) illustrates how high sulfate, linked to low alkalinity, high Al, low P, and low productivity, can become a negative correlate of lacustrine S retention. Temporal changes in base cations in the 26 lakes were generally small and erratic compared with uncertainties in deposition inputs and analytical errors, rendering estimates of related ANC production inconclusive. Even small analytical biases can be critical when designing and interpreting lake monitoring studies.																			0049-6979					NOV	1993	71	1-2					1	12		10.1007/BF00475508	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00475508													WOS:A1993MH47700001
J	Xu, ZA; Li, T; Bi, J; Wang, C				Xu, Zhaoan; Li, Tao; Bi, Jun; Wang, Ce			Spatiotemporal heterogeneity of antibiotic pollution and ecological risk assessment in Taihu Lake Basin, China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Natural lakes play a vital role as receiving system of a cocktail of antibiotics (ABs) which have triggered a major health concern. The comparisons of ABs concentrations have been substantially implemented throughout the worldwide range. However, from lake management, the questions are not yet adequately solved: "when and where does the overall pollution level of ABs present more serious, and what AB species dominate". In this study, we detected 22 ABs in water column and sediment bottom in Taihu Lake Basin in January, April, July and October in 2017. Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS) was applied to characterize spatiotemporal dissimilarity of ABs concentrations. Combined with a method of summed standardized concentrations, analysis of variance was applied to evaluate the overall pollution level of ABs at different sites and time periods, instead of, traditionally, a comparison of concentration. The results showed that 90% CI of Macrolides, Sulfonamides, Tetracyclines and Quinolones were 0.020-5.646, 0.040-7.887, 0.100-13.308 and 0.130-9.631 ng/L in water column, respectively; and 0.005-1.532, 0.002-0.120, 0.010-0.902 and 0.006-3.972 mu g/kg in sediment, respectively. ABs concentrations approximately presented spatial homogeneity in the whole basin which included all main inflow rivers, outflow rivers and the lake body itself. Species composition was seasonally distinct and the overall pollution level was significantly lower in autumn. A critical body residue analysis showed that ABs concentrations presented a neglectable cumulative risk for fish species. This research added to the body of knowledge to develop pollution management strategies on point and non-point source loads for Taihu Lake Basin, and also the methodology provided reference for spatiotemporal characterization of dissolved pollutant in other water bodies.

J	Erickson, TB; Cheema, N				Erickson, Timothy B.; Cheema, Navneet			Arthropod Envenomation in North America	EMERGENCY MEDICINE CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA												Arthropods (phylum Arthopoda) account for a higher percentage of morbidity and mortality to humans than do mammalian bites, snake bites, or marine envenomation. They are ubiquitous in domestic dwellings, caves, and campsites and in wilderness settings such as deserts, forests, and lakes. Although arthropods are most intrusive during warmer months, many are active throughout the winter, particularly indoors. Arthropods are also nocturnal and often bite unsuspecting victims while they are sleeping. Encounters with humans are generally defensive, accidental, or reactive. An individual stung by an insect or bitten by an arachnid may experience pain and local swelling, an anaphylactic reaction, or life-threatening toxicity. This review discusses the clinical presentation and latest treatment recommendations for bites and stings from spiders, scorpions, bees, ants, ticks and centipedes of North America.																			0733-8627	1558-0539				MAY	2017	35	2					355	+		10.1016/j.emc.2017.01.001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.emc.2017.01.001								28411932					WOS:000401397800010

They were also lacking in the upper reaches of the Semliki, having never been observed along this river beyond the Semliki rapids and the confluence of the Semliki with the Lusilube and Butahu rivers. The rapids themselves, and the presence of a thick rain forest along their steep banks, were considered as the two major factors preventing the colonization of the upper Semliki and the former Lake Edward by the crocodiles. There was no obvious difference either in the temperature or the acidity of the Semliki waters, above and below the falls. Crocodiles suddenly made their appearance in 1986 near Ishango, at the outlet of the former Lake Edward, approximately 100 km upstream from the Semliki falls. They are now 40 to 45 of them in this area, as well as a few others near the Mweya Peninsula, further east across the Uganda border. These crocodiles are of a small size (less than 2.5 m long), and the population has remained stable during the last two years. The potential origin of these immigrants is discussed.																			0249-7395					OCT-DEC	1989	44	4					387	397																WOS:A1989AY00600005

This integrative data analysis framework can be applied to evaluate and karstic aquifer systems globally. The accurate delineation of ground water recharge areas in developing aquifer systems with sparse hydrogeologic data is essential for their effective long-term development and management. We illustrate the use of this approach in the Cuatrocienegas Basin (CCB) of Mexico. Aquifers are characterized using geographic information systems for ground water catchment delineation, an analytical model for interbasin flow evaluation, a chloride balance approach for recharge estimation, and a water budget for mapping contributing catchments over a large region. The test study area includes the CCB of Coahuila, Mexico, a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve containing more than 500 springs that support ground water-dependent ecosystems with more than 70 endemic organisms and irrigated agriculture. We define recharge areas that contribute local and regional ground water discharge to springs and the regional flow system. Results show that the regional aquifer system follows a topographic gradient that during past pluvial periods may have linked the Rio Nazas and the Rio Aguanaval of the Sierra Madre Occidental to the Rio Grande via the CCB and other large, currently dry, upgradient lakes.

J	Staubwasser, M; Weiss, H				Staubwasser, Michael; Weiss, Harvey			Holocene climate and cultural evolution in late prehistoric-early historic West Asia - Introduction	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												The precipitation climatology and the underlying climate mechanisms of the eastern Mediterranean, West Asia, and the Indian subcontinent are reviewed, with emphasis on upper and middle tropospheric flow in the subtropics and its steering of precipitation. Holocene climate change of the region is summarized from proxy records. The Indian monsoon weakened during the Holocene over its northernmost region, the Ganges and Indus catchments and the western Arabian Sea. Southern regions, the Indian Peninsula, do not show a reduction, but an increase of summer monsoon rain across the Holocene. The long-term trend towards drier conditions in the eastern Mediterranean can be linked to a regionally complex monsoon evolution. Abrupt climate change events, such as the widespread droughts around 8200, 5200 and 4200 cal yr BP, are suggested to be the result of altered subtropical upper-level flow over the eastern Mediterranean and Asia. The abrupt climate change events of the Holocene radically altered precipitation, fundamental for cereal agriculture, across the expanse of late prehistoric-early historic cultures known from the archaeological record in these regions. Social adaptations to reduced agro-production, in both dry-farming and irrigation agriculture regions, are visible in the archaeological record during each abrupt climate change event in West Asia. Chronological refinement, in both the paleoclimate and archaeological records, and transfer functions for both precipitation and agro-production are needed to understand precisely the evident causal linkages.

J	Liu, B				Liu, Bing			The diatom genus Ulnaria (Bacillariophyta) in China	PHYTOKEYS												This study deals with Ulnaria species found and described from two regions of China with large climate differences during the period of 2014-2022. The first region, located in the Wuling Mountains and Hunan province, has a subtropical climate and the second in Qinghai, a northwest province of China, has a highland continental climate which is char- acterized by a cold and long winter and warm, short summer. Previously there were nine new Ulnaria species published from the first region. This study describes 14 additional new Ulnaria taxa, nine of which were found in the first region and five of which were found in the second region. A key to the Ulnaria species that have been described from China is provided. The main morphological characteristics for 63 Ulnaria taxa are summarized in Appendices which allow the division of these Ulnaria taxa into three groups: the seven members of group one all possess both uniseriate striae and valve marginal spines, the 42 members of group two all possess uniseriate or mostly uniseriate striae but without the valve marginal spines, and the 14 members of group three all possess mostly bise- riate striae and without valve marginal spines. To summarize the morphological characters of the published Ulnaria taxa and 14 taxa described in this study several conclusions for the characterization of Ulnaria are drawn: 1) each cell has two valve-appressed, long plate-like plastids; 2) living cells of many Ulnaria species often lie in girdle view on a slide because they have deep mantles and some copulae associated with either the epivalve or the hypovalve so that the cell depth is often larger than the valve width; 3) the basic structures forming a valve include sternum, virgae, and vimines/viminules; 4) the valvo- copula is a closed hoop which has a similar ultrastructure in all Ulnaria taxa but differs from the other copulae in structure; 5) the configuration of girdle bands is a common condition; 6) the life history of Ulnaria can be divided into the four series of successive stages: auxospore, initial cell, pre-normal vegetative cell, and normal vegetative cell, which is very similar to the life history of Hannaea inaequidentata (Lagerstedt) Genkal and Kharitonov; 7) the closed valvocopula is proposed as a definition character for the genus Ulnaria because demonstrating all girdle bands closed is impracticable.

THE SYSTEMATICS OF A NEW UPPER ORDOVICIAN EDRIOASTEROID PAVEMENT FROM NORTHERN KENTUCKY	JOURNAL OF PALEONTOLOGY												A large, edrioasteroid-bearing hardground surface from the base of the Bellevue Member of the Grant Lake Formation near Maysville, Mason County, Kentucky is described. Four species are represented including Streptaster vorticellatus (Hall), Carneyella ulrichi Bassler and Shideler, Carneyella pilea (Hall), and Curvitriordo stecki n. sp. Specimens of S. vorticellatus and C. pilea add little to the known morphologies of these species. However, prior to this study C ulrichi was known from the unique holotype, and Curvitriordo stecki n. sp. adds greatly to out understanding of Curvitriordo which was previously known from two species comprising three poorly preserved specimens. Curvitriordo stecki shows a bimodal size frequency distribution suggesting seasonal breeding whereas Carneyella ulrichi shows a left skewed size frequency suggesting low juvenile mortality. Streptaster vorticellatus shows a tight unimodal size frequency distribution suggestive of a single spat fall accumulation.																			0022-3360	1937-2337				SEP	2010	84	5					783	794		10.1666/09-178.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1666/09-178.1													WOS:000282116200001

Coupling hydrodynamics and buoyancy regulation in Microcystis aeruginosa for its vertical distribution in lakes	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												In this research we introduce a coupled column model to simulate the vertical migration of Microcystis aeruginosa in natural lakes. M. aeruginosa is a unicellular cyanobacteria that form colonies. They produce toxins and therefore become a potential threat to water quality and human health. Understanding the distribution of this species in space and time is important for improving water management strategies. The model we propose includes both hydrodynamics and physiological responses including explicitly buoyancy regulation in Microcystis cells. Our model applies the Langevin-Fokker-Planck approach to simulate the total colony number concentration along the water column. This approach allows the description of sinking and rising velocities of colonies of different sizes and compositions subjected to turbulent mixing. The model is first applied to the 30 m deep Lake Vlietland in the Netherlands for the summer of 2009. During this summer, the lake showed high blooms of Microcystis which eventually led to scum formation along the shore. The simulations show the preferential distribution of M. aeruginosa through the water column and their strong dependency on colony size. On a daily cycle, small colonies (50-200 mu m) do not remain near the surface but are highly concentrated in the middle of the epilimnion, whereas large colonies (>= 800 mu m) are able to migrate to greater depths and concentrate only temporarily near the surface. For comparing our computer model with available measurements of Microcystis concentration distributions we applied it to lakes Ijsselmeer and Vinkeveen. The results show a good agreement with the observations of diurnal changes in buoyancy status. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Latour, D; Giraudet, H				Latour, D; Giraudet, H			Factors influencing the spatio-temporal distribution of benthic Microcystis aeruginosa colonies (Cyanobacteria) in the hypertrophic Grangent Reservoir (Loire, France)	COMPTES RENDUS BIOLOGIES												The spatio-temporal distribution of benthic colonies of Microcystis aeruginosa in Grangent Reservoir (France) in 2000 was not homogeneous and appeared to be controlled by many external factors: lake depth, station morphometry, substratum and hydraulic regime (lacustrine or fluvial). A most important concentration of benthic colonies was found at deep sites with fine sediment or at sites where the sediment was rich in organic matter. In spite of a stable water level and a minimum flow during summer, the number of benthic colonies showed great variation in the lacustrine downstream part of the reservoir. These variations may be explained by the dynamics of planktonic cyanobacteria. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier SAS on behalf of Academie des sciences.

The lower delta C-13 values, TOC/TN ratio, and magnetic susceptibility (chi(lf)) from similar to 11.4 to 9.5 ka BP suggest enhanced ISM intensity, which is well correlated with other available ISM records from both terrestrial as well as marine archives. A gradual stepwise expansion of C-4 plants during similar to 8.1 and 6.3 ka BP, similar to 6.3 to 4.7 ka BP, and similar to 3.0 to 2.0 ka BP suggests a gradual weakening of ISM. The highest delta C-13 values (-18.7 parts per thousand) recorded at similar to 2.0 ka BP indicate the dominance of C-4 plants suggesting the weakest phase of ISM in the study area. The expansion of C-3 plants from similar to 2.0 to 1.6 ka BP indicates a sudden increase in ISM intensity. Subsequently, three stages of enhanced ISM have been recorded between similar to 1.6 and 0.93 ka BP, similar to 0.76 and 0.42 ka BP, and similar to 0.28 ka BP to present.

The Onset and Rate of Holocene Neoglacial Cooling in the Arctic	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The middle to late Holocene (8,200years ago to present) in the Arctic is characterized by cooling temperatures and the regrowth and advance of glaciers. Whether this Neoglaciation was a threshold response to linear cooling, or was driven by a regional or Arctic-wide acceleration of cooling, is unknown. Here we examine the largest-yet-compiled multiproxy database of Arctic Holocene temperature change, along with model simulations, to investigate regional and Arctic-wide increases in cooling rate, the synchronicity of Neoglacial onset, and the observed and simulated rates of temperature change. We find little support for an Arctic-wide onset of Neoglacial cooling but do find intervals when regions experienced rapid increases in long-term cooling rate, both in the observations and in climate model simulations. In the model experiments, Neoglacial cooling is associated with indirectly forced millennial-scale variability in meridional heat transport superposed on the long-term decline of summer insolation. Plain Language Summary Arctic summer temperatures have decreased for the past 8,000years, before rapidly warming over the past century. As temperatures cooled, glaciers that had melted began to regrow throughout the Arctic, a phenomenon and a time interval known as Neoglaciation. This study seeks to understand the nature of this cooling and whether or not this indicates a tipping point in the climate system. Specifically, we use a large database of records from ice cores, lakes, ocean sediment, and more paleoclimate archives to detect patterns of cooling. We investigate these patterns, and climate model simulations, to determine what parts of the Arctic experienced Neoglaciation at the same time, how rapidly it cooled, and what climate models indicate about the causes of cooling. We find that the Arctic did not cool simultaneously, but different regions cooled at different times and that the climate models perform well when simulating both the timing and amount of Arctic cooling.

This study focused on determining the intensity and main contributors of cyanobacteria blooms, and identifying the cyanobacteria-environment based recovery potential of impaired urban lakes. Based on physicochemical parameters, nutrient-rich (especially excess of nitrogen and phosphorus) conditions were recognized in the majority of lakes. In summer Cyanobacteria formed biomass on average from 2.5 to 88.8 mg L-1. The WHO-designed low risk threshold (summer average > 2 mg L-1) for cyanobacterial blooms was significantly exceeded in all lakes, while the WHO-designed moderate risk threshold (> 10 mg L-1) was exceeded in five lakes. In two lakes, cyanobacterial biomass exceeded even the WHO high risk threshold specified for surface scums or the newly-proposed very high risk threshold of 40 mg L-1 connected with possibly high potential toxin risk. Cyanobacteria assemblages were then dominated by potentially toxic species, mainly from the genera Microcystis, Cuspidothrix (Aphanizomenon), Dolichospermum (Anabaena), Limnothrix and Planktothrix, which considerably restricted the recreational use of these lakes. The response of cyanobacteria and dominant species to environmental variables (especially Microcystis), positively correlated with N and P enrichment, should also be very useful to determine the main water management targets for urban lakes.					; Dunalska, Julita/I-3290-2018; Augustyniak, Renata/AAY-3672-2021; Napiorkowska-Krzebietke, Agnieszka/I-3874-2018	Dunalska, Julita/0000-0001-6089-9140; Lopata, Michal/0000-0002-1993-3287; Grochowska, Jolanta/0000-0001-7319-4174; Augustyniak-Tunowska, Renata/0000-0003-0098-0427; Napiorkowska-Krzebietke, Agnieszka/0000-0001-8361-0290													1842-4090	1844-489X				MAY	2015	10	2					123	132																WOS:000355385400011

FRESHWATER BIOLOGY					Workshop on Ecological Effects of Reduced Nutrient Loading (Oligotrophication) on Lakes	JAN, 2003	Silkeborg, DENMARK					1. In view of the paucity of data on the response of warm shallow lakes to reductions in nutrient loading, this paper presents a long-term limnological data set to document changes in the food-web of a shallow Mediterranean lake (Lake Albufera, Valencia, Spain) that has experienced reductions in phosphorus (P) (77%) and nitrogen (N) (24%) loading following sewage diversion. 2. Nine years after sewage diversion, P concentration in the lake was reduced by 30% but remained high (TP = 0.34 mg L-1), although the mean water retention time in the lake was only 0.1 years. Nitrate concentrations did not significantly change, probably because the lake continued to receive untreated effluents from ricefields. 3. Chlorophyll a concentration was reduced by half (annual mean of 180 mu g L-1). Cyanobacteria abundance remained high but its composition changed towards smaller species, both filamentous and chroococcal forms. 4. Cladocera abundance increased and reached peaks twice a year (December to March and July to September). After nutrient reduction, short-term clear-water phases (up to 5 weeks) occurred during February to March in several years, concomitant with annual flushing of the lake and lower fish densities. The abundance of Cladocera in winter contrasted with the spring peaks observed in northern restored shallow lakes. The zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio remained lower than in northern temperate shallow lakes, probably because of fish predation on zooplankton. 5. Improvement of the water quality of Lake Albufera remained insufficient to counteract littoral reed regression or improve underwater light allowing submerged plants re-colonise the lake. 6. Sewage diversion from Lake Albufera impacted the food web through the plankton, but higher trophic levels, such as fish and waterfowl, were affected to a lesser degree. Although the fish species present in the lake are mainly omnivorous, long-term data on commercial fish captures indicated that fish communities changed in response to nutrient level and trophic structure as has been observed in restored shallow lakes at northern latitudes. 7. Phosphorus concentrations produced similar phytoplankton biomass in Lake Albufera as in more northern shallow lakes with abundant planktivorous fish and small zooplankton. However, in Lake Albufera, high average concentrations were maintained throughout the year. Overall, results suggest that nutrient control may be a greater priority in eutrophicated warm shallow lakes than in similar lakes at higher latitudes.					; Soria, Juan/M-1699-2014; Miracle, Maria/G-3482-2016	Vicente-Pedros, Eduardo/0000-0002-8814-9912; Soria, Juan/0000-0001-5249-8590; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				OCT	2005	50	10					1706	1717		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01432.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01432.x													WOS:000231860600010

Lipid Biomarkers From Microbial Mats on the McMurdo Ice Shelf, Antarctica: Signatures for Life in the Cryosphere	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Persistent cold temperatures, a paucity of nutrients, freeze-thaw cycles, and the strongly seasonal light regime make Antarctica one of Earth's least hospitable surface environments for complex life. Cyanobacteria, however, are well-adapted to such conditions and are often the dominant primary producers in Antarctic inland water environments. In particular, the network of meltwater ponds on the 'dirty ice' of the McMurdo Ice Shelf is an ecosystem with extensive cyanobacteria-dominated microbial mat accumulations. This study investigated intact polar lipids (IPLs), heterocyte glycolipids (HGs), and bacteriohopanepolyols (BHPs) in combination with 16S and 18S rRNA gene diversity in microbial mats of twelve ponds in this unique polar ecosystem. To constrain the effects of nutrient availability, temperature and freeze-thaw cycles on the lipid membrane composition, lipids were compared to stromatolite-forming cyanobacterial mats from ice-covered lakes in the McMurdo Dry Valleys as well as from (sub)tropical regions and hot springs. The 16S rRNA gene compositions of the McMurdo Ice Shelf mats confirm the dominance of Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria while the 18S rRNA gene composition indicates the presence of Ochrophyta, Chlorophyta, Ciliophora, and other microfauna. IPL analyses revealed a predominantly bacterial community in the meltwater ponds, with archaeal lipids being barely detectable. IPLs are dominated by glycolipids and phospholipids, followed by aminolipids. The high abundance of sugar-bound lipids accords with a predominance of cyanobacterial primary producers. The phosphate-limited samples from the (sub)tropical, hot spring, and Lake Vanda sites revealed a higher abundance of aminolipids compared to those of the nitrogen-limited meltwater ponds, affirming the direct affects that N and P availability have on IPL compositions. The high abundance of polyunsaturated IPLs in the Antarctic microbial mats suggests that these lipids provide an important mechanism to maintain membrane fluidity in cold environments. High abundances of HG keto-ols and HG keto-diols, produced by heterocytous cyanobacteria, further support these findings and reveal a unique distribution compared to those from warmer climates.

J	Bhat, NA; Wanganeo, A; Raina, R				Bhat, Najeeb Ahmad; Wanganeo, Ashwani; Raina, Rajni			Seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton community in a tropical wetland	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Phytoplankton species composition and seasonal changes were investigated in the Bhoj wetland Bhopal. Taxonomic composition, diversity, and abundance of phytoplankton were studied at nine stations from March 2008 to February 2010, in relation to various physico-chemical factors. Total phytoplankton species composition in the Bhoj wetland was represented by 360 species. Among phytoplankton, diversity belonged to seven groups. Chlorophyceae was the dominant group (48 %) followed by Bacillariophyceae (26 %), Cyanophyceae (15 %), and Euglenophyceae (9 %), while Pyrophyceae, Chrysophyceae, and Xanthophyceae contributed 2 % of the population. Phytoplankton on the basis of seasonal studies recorded 1651 units l(-1) during summer season which was contributed mainly by Chlorophyceae (39.3 %), with Spirogyra sp. (14.2 %) and Closteriopsis sp. (9.1 %) contributing maximum to the total group in the first year, while during the second year of summer period, a total of 2095 units l-1 was recorded which was contributed mainly by group Pyrophyceae (51 %) with the main dominant species represented by Ceratium hirundinella (98.46 %). The highest Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H') value (4.27) was recorded. Simpson values are approaching 1, signifying that sites have high relative diversity due to its supporting surrounding components. The trend of variation in evenness values was more or less the same as Shannon diversity index. Thus, the highest diversity indices recoded at all the stations in the present study justify the diverse nature of species inhabiting the different ecological niches in the ecosystem. The very high phosphate and nitrate concentrations in the wetland are indicators of pollution which may be due to the discharge of agricultural and sewage wastes enriched with nutrients as well as the human activities there. Our recommendation is to avoid as far as possible the discharge of sewage and agriculture wastes into the Bhoj wetland. The effects of various physicochemical water quality parameters on the seasonal distribution and succession of the above mentioned phytoplankton population as well as the interaction and eutrophication are discussed.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				JAN	2015	187	1							4136	10.1007/s10661-014-4136-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-014-4136-4								25412890					WOS:000345368800051

It is located about 34 degrees 58'-35 degrees 31'N; 135 degrees 52'-136 degrees 17'E in the Shiga Prefecture at the center of the Japanese archipelago. Beginning in the 1960s, the lake began to show signs of eutrophication and oxygen depletion in the hypolimnion before winter vertical mixing (NAKA 1973). Over the past 30 years the average air temperature of Shiga Prefecture has increased by about 1-1.2 degrees C, and Lake Biwa bottom water temperature has increased by 1.4 degrees C (HAYAMI & FUJIWARA 1999); mean annual precipitation (mainly winter snow) over the same area has decreased since 1980 (KUMAGAI et al. 2006). These climatic changes have likely contributed to the weakening of winter vertical mixing and dissolved oxygen (DO) depletion at the bottom of the lake. Lake Biwa is the source of drinking water for 14 million people in the Kansai area; therefore, preserving the quality of the lake water quality and its ecosystem is a serious concern. With the help of a highly specialized research vessel and underwater robots as well as the implementation of a routine monitoring program, an advanced monitoring system of the lake has been developed (KUMAGAI et al. 2002). Because monitoring changes in the deeper (80-90 m depth) areas of the lake is difficult, an underwater robot has recently been used because it can maintain a constant distance from the lake bottom (URA 2002, FONG & STACEY 2003). In this study, high-resolution digital images and environmental sensors of the underwater robot were used to evaluate DO depletion at the bottom of the lake and its environmental effects.																			0368-0770		978-3-510-54080-8				2010	30		9				1405	+																WOS:000312418900021
J	Shibata, S; Hasegawa, T				Shibata, Shohei; Hasegawa, Takeshi			Evolution of a large-scale phreatoplinian eruption: Constraints from the 40 ka caldera-forming eruption of Kutcharo volcano, eastern Hokkaido, Japan	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												"Phreatoplinian " is an explosive phreatomagmatic eruption style that is defined by the fragmentation of magma and widespread dispersal of the resulting fine ash and accretionary lapilli. These eruptions pose significant future risks at caldera volcanoes that host lakes and abundant groundwater. There have been no direct observations of a phreatoplinian eruption, therefore, constraining the detailed mechanisms and sequences of such events relies on studying the deposits of previous eruptions. In order to advance our understanding of these hazardous phenomena we conducted a case study of the 40 ka caldera-forming eruption (Kp I) from Kutcharo volcano in eastern Hokkaido, Japan. We subdivided Kp I eruption deposits into 7 units (Units 1 to 7 in ascending order). Units 1 to 6 are air fall deposits consisting of alternating thin pumice and thick silty ash layers with abundant spherical accretionary lapilli. Stratigraphically higher ash fall units are thicker, finer in grain -size, and more widely distributed. The maximum eruption column height and mass -discharge rate were calculated to be 40 km and 1.4 x 10 9 kg/s, respectively. Unit 7 is a climactic ignimbrite (76 km 3 ), which is distributed widely over the area north of Kutcharo caldera. Unit 6 is the largest air fall unit and can be considered to have been deposited by a phreatoplinian eruption, given its abundant accretionary lapilli, wide dispersion, and high degree of fragmentation. Unit 6 had the highest mass discharge rate (1.4 x 10 9 kg/s), suggesting the interaction between magma and external water was most intense, and it is thought that a large eruption column covered eastern Hokkaido. In addition, Kp I eruption deposits commonly contain glass shards derived from fragmentation via both magma degassing and Molten Fuel Coolant Interaction (MFCI). To account for this observation, we infer that the conduit penetrated a large aquifer, and the margin of the ascending magma came into contact with this external water source. Due to repeated caldera-forming eruptions, intra-caldera filled deposits (hosting a large aquifer) likely played a key role in supplying external caldera lake water to a level near the fragmentation depth of H 2 O-saturated felsic magma. The occurrence of these intra-caldera conduit and caldera-lake systems may provide the required conditions for phreatoplinian eruptions at continental arc caldera volcanoes in Japan and globally.

To study the effect of recent climate change on such a lake in the Arctic environment, we measured water chemistry and temperature from 2005 to 2010 in Kongressvatn, a crenogenic meromictic lake in Spitsbergen (Svalbard). In addition, we monitored water column temperatures during two consecutive years and compared them to regional air temperature data and physicochemical lake data from 1962 and 1968, two relatively cold years. Summer surface water temperature was highly correlated to air temperature, and both have increased by approximately 2A degrees C since 1962. Temperature monitoring during 2 years showed that the warm summer of 2007 resulted in increased water temperatures even in the stratified, denser hypolimnion. Our water chemistry measurements showed that the chemocline position in 2005-2010 was ca 12 m deeper than in 1962-1968, and a second, weaker, chemocline appeared at metalimnetic depths of 7-15 m. During the study period, the water level decreased by 4 m, and this change accelerated between 2008 and 2010. Our data support the hypothesis that water temperatures and stratification patterns are changing rapidly with air temperature, but changes in the catchment, such as glacial retreat and permafrost melting, may have an even stronger impact on lake properties.

In high-altitude lakes, located above the treeline, most of the carbon pool is of indigenous origin. However, little is known about the influence of lake and watershed characteristics on carbon transfer pathways and their variability over an annual cycle. We analyzed simultaneously carbon stable isotopic composition (delta 13C) and C/N ratio of organic matter from pelagic (POM, zooplankton) and benthic components (benthic invertebrates, sediments) in eight high-altitude lakes and hypothesized that the origin of the carbon used and the composition of organic matter in the pelagic and benthic compartments vary according to the lake's characteristics. The results showed that most of the organic matter composing the sediments is of autochthonous origin, regardless of the lake's characteristics. We observed a common tendency of seasonal shift in the source of carbon used, from a C-CO2 respired or a C-CH4-derived in early summer to a C-CO2 dissolved in late summer. However, the origin of the carbon used and the contribution of pelagic and benthic primary producers to the carbon transfers varied according to the lakes' depth, lithology, and food web structure. These findings highlight that the complexity of high-altitude lakes and how the balance between benthic and pelagic food webs will be important in future ecological trajectory predictions.

It provides high-quality and high-resolution severe weather and precipitation products for meteorology, hydrology, and aviation applications. Among processing modules, the radar data quality control (QC) plays a critical role in effectively identifying and removing various nonhydrometeor radar echoes for accurate quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE). Since its initial implementation in 2014, the radar QC has undergone continuous refinements and enhancements to ensure its robust performance across seasons and all regions in the continental United States and southern Canada. These updates include 1) improved melting-layer delineation, 2) clearance of wind farm contamination, 3) mitigation of corrupt data impacts due to hardware issues, 4) mitigation of sun spikes, and 5) mitigation of residual ground/lake/sea clutter due to sidelobe effects and anomalous propagation. This paper provides an overview of the MRMS radar data QC enhancements since 2014.

Performance of PAC/PDM composite coagulants for removal of algae from Lake Taihu waters in summer	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The enhanced coagulation of algae-rich raw water from Lake Taihu in summer was studied by use of composite coagulants. The composite coagulants were composed of polyaluminum chloride (PAC) and polydimethyldiallylammonium chloride (PDM) with various intrinsic viscosity values (0.55-3.99 dL/g) and different mass percentages (5-20%) in the formulation. For raw water with temperature of 28-29 degrees C and algae content of 3.60 x 10(4)-3.70 x 10(4) cells/ml, the algae-removal rates of 89.0% and 89.3-93.1% could be realized by using PAC and PAC/PDM (0.55/5%-3.99/20%) with dosages of 8.37 mg/L and 5.93-3.58 mg/L, respectively, when 2 NTU residual turbidity of treated water after sedimentation was required. Compared with using PAC only, the removal rate of CODMn using PAC/PDM increased at least 4.4% when the dosage was 8 mg/L, and increased at least 5.0% when the dosage was 10 mg/L. The composite coagulants could still function well when raw water quality deteriorated and algae content reached 8.00 x 10(4) cells/ml. The enhanced coagulation efficiency of PAC/PDM (0.55/5%) could be better than that of PAC combined with prechlorination process when the same dosages are used.					zhang, yue/GQP-5565-2022														0273-1223	1996-9732					2010	62	2					330	339		10.2166/wst.2010.292	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2010.292								20651437					WOS:000280586400013

However, to date little is known of how such transfer might vary across species and lakes. We gathered data from 87 lakes to determine how widespread this phenomenon might be and to de. ne boundaries for its likely magnitude. Carbon stable isotope values of chironomid larvae varied greatly between taxa. Very marked C-13-depletion was evident only in certain taxa, especially Chironomus plumosus, C. anthracinus, and C. tenuistylus, all characteristic of eutrophic or dystrophic lakes and known to be tolerant of low oxygen conditions. Furthermore, marked C-13-depletion was only found in larvae from lakes in which late-summer hypolimnetic oxygen depletion near the sediment surface was below an apparent threshold concentration of 2-4 mg O-2/L. Similarly, application of a two-source mixing model suggested that methanotrophic bacteria made the greatest contribution to profundal chironomid growth ( 0 - 70% of larval carbon) when the late-summer oxygen concentration dropped below similar to 2 mg O-2/L. Our study demonstrates that methane-derived carbon is an important, but often neglected, contribution to the flux of carbon through the food webs of many productive or dystrophic lakes.

Fluvial stratigraphy of valley fills at Aeolis Dorsa, Mars: Evidence for base-level fluctuations controlled by a downstream water body	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Aeolis Dorsa, a large sedimentary basin on Mars, contains an array of fluvially dominated sedimentary deposits. These deposits preserve a record of fluvial erosion and deposition during early Martian history. We present evidence that some of these fluvial deposits represent incised valleys carved and filled during falls and rises in base level, which were likely controlled by changes in water-surface elevation of a large lake or sea. The valley stratigraphy consists of three low-albedo, channelized corridors, each several tens of kilometers long in the streamwise direction. Deposits composing the basal valley fills are characterized by laterally amalgamated point-bar strata confined between valley walls that preserve scoop-shaped segments cut by the erosive outer banks of meandering river bends. Both the point-bar deposits and valley walls were produced by a net-erosional river system. Subsequent valley-filling deposits are defined by both channels and associated overbank strata. The stacked channel-filling deposits are sinuous in form, but unlike the basal strata, they preserve no evidence of river migration. Within each valley, there are multiple sinuous ridges ranging from a few meters to several tens of meters thick, which we interpret as channel-belt deposits that have been topographically inverted via differential erosion. Evidence for channel avulsions and reoccupations, the overall cutting and filling patterns, and consistent up-section decreases in recorded channel migration support the interpretation of the low-albedo corridors as valley stratigraphy cut and filled in the presence of a migrating backwater zone. Crosscutting valleys require at least two episodes of base-level fall and rise at >50 m per episode. These base-level cycles are consistent with the presence of an ancient large lake, sea, or ocean and its fluctuating water-surface elevation. Additionally, channel bend asymmetry preserved in channel-belt deposits indicates a southeastern flow direction.					; Mohrig, David/O-1758-2013; Cardenas, Benjamin/HHC-7929-2022	Mohrig, David/0000-0003-1828-4526; Cardenas, Benjamin/0000-0001-7246-219X; Goudge, Timothy/0000-0003-4297-9838													0016-7606	1943-2674				MAR-APR	2018	130	3-4					484	498		10.1130/B31567.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B31567.1													WOS:000427362500007
J	Fairley, JP; Nicholson, KN				Fairley, JP; Nicholson, KN			Imaging lateral groundwater flow in the shallow subsurface using stochastic temperature fields	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Although temperature has often been used as an indication of vertical groundwater movement, its usefulness for identifying horizontal fluid flow has been limited by the difficulty of obtaining sufficient data to draw defensible conclusions. Here we use stochastic simulation to develop a high-resolution image of fluid temperatures in the shallow subsurface at Borax Lake, Oregon. The temperature field inferred from the geostatistical simulations clearly shows geothermal fluids discharging from a group of fault-controlled hydrothermal springs, moving laterally through the subsurface, and mixing with shallow subsurface flow originating from nearby Borax Lake. This interpretation of the data is supported by independent geochemical and isotopic evidence, which show a simple mixing trend between Borax Lake water and discharge from the thermal springs. It is generally agreed that stochastic simulation can be a useful tool for extracting information from complex and/or noisy data and, although not appropriate in all situations, geostatistical analysis may provide good definition of flow paths in the shallow subsurface. Although stochastic imaging techniques are well known in problems involving transport of species, e.g. delineation of contaminant plumes from soil gas survey data, we are unaware of previous applications to the transport of thermal energy for the purpose of inferring shallow groundwater flow.

Interannual variability of circulation under spring ice in a boreal lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A small range (similar to 1 degrees C) of under-ice water temperature is shown to result in remarkably different circulation regimes under spring ice in a deep, oligotrophic boreal lake. With the water column at < 4 degrees C, melting of snow led to deepening vertical convection before ice break and a final depth of convection inversely correlated with earlier deep-water temperature. We attribute that to the nonlinear dependence of water density on temperature, albeit further affected by stochastic weather factors. In four of nine study years, convection led to complete under-ice overturn of the lake, indicating that this may not be uncommon in similar lakes with steep topography. River inflow and more intensive warming of water in the littoral zone also created a horizontal density differential, convection that involved flow down the sloping bottom and a lateral intrusion of this sinking water at a depth between the vertical convection and the quiescent deep-water layers. The vertical and horizontal convection together produced a profile of temperature slightly increasing from the surface to the bottom of the convection layer. The contribution of horizontal convection to under-ice mixing was interannually variable, and in one of the study years it eventually dominated under-ice mixing. A thermal bar circulation regime developed occasionally and only in the open water between ice and shoreline. We identified five different under-ice mixing regimes that form an interannually variable continuum of behavior during the ice melting period. The dependence on a narrow temperature range likely makes the circulation regime sensitive to a warming climate.

Part V: The Detection and Role of the Dominant Modes of Convectively Coupled Equatorial Rossby Waves	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												This study is the last in a series of papers addressing the dynamics of the West African summer monsoon at intraseasonal time scales between 10 and 90 days. The signals of convectively coupled equatorial Rossby (ER) waves within the summer African monsoon have been investigated after filtering NOAA outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) data within a box delineated by the dispersion curves of the theoretical ER waves. Two families of waves have been detected in the 10-100-day periodicity band by performing a singular spectrum analysis on a regional index of ER-filtered OLR. For each family the first EOF mode has been retained to focus on the main convective variability signal. Within the periodicity band of 30-100 days, an ER wave pattern with an approximate wavelength of 13 500 km has been depicted. This ER wave links the MJO mode in the Indian monsoon sector with the main mode of convective variability over West and central Africa. This confirms the investigations carried out in previous studies. Within the 10-30-day periodicity band, a separate ER wave pattern has been highlighted in the African monsoon system with an approximate wavelength of 7500 km, a phase speed of 6 m s(-1), and a period of 15 days. The combined OLR and atmospheric circulation pattern looks like a combination of ER wave solutions with meridional wavenumbers of 1 and 2. Its vertical baroclinic profile suggests that this wave is forced by the deep convective heating. Its initiation in terms of OLR modulation is detected north of Lake Victoria, extending northward and then propagating westward along the Sahel latitudes. The Sahel mode identified in previous studies corresponds to the second main mode of convective variability within the 10-30-day periodicity band, and this has also been examined. Its pattern and evolution look like the first-mode ER wave pattern and they are temporally correlated with a coefficient of +0.6. About one-third of the Sahel mode events are concomitant with an ER wave occurrence. The main difference between these two signals consists of a stronger OLR and circulation modulation of the Sahel mode over East and central Africa. Thus, the Sahel mode occurrence and its westward propagation could be explained in part by atmospheric dynamics associated with the ER waves and in part by land surface interactions, as shown in other studies.

J	Anfinogenova, Y; Anfinogenov, J				Anfinogenova, Yana; Anfinogenov, John			Challenges of identifying putative planetary-origin meteorites of non-igneous material	GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS												This paper summarizes the challenges of identifying planetary-origin meteorites of non-igneous composition - particularly those of sedimentary origin. Evidence for putative sedimentary-origin (sed-type) meteorites and their potential parent bodies is reviewed, suggesting that the list of candidate parent bodies for sed-type meteorites includes, but is not limited to, Mars, Enceladus, Ganymede, Europa, Ceres, Vesta, and other hypothetical planets that existed between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter in the past. The extraterrestrial origin and probable parent body for sed-type meteorites should be assessed based on multiple lines of evidence, and not solely limited to tests of oxygen and noble gas isotopes, whose signatures may undergo terrestrial contamination and which may exhibit significant heterogeneity within both the Solar System and parent cosmic bodies. The observed fall of a cosmic body, evidence of hypervelocity fall, signs of impact, presence of fusion crust, melting, and/or shock deformation features in impactor fragments should be considered as priority signs of meteoritic origin.

This study measured a suite of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in water samples collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 8 around the Denver, Colorado, metropolitan area. The results showed that 109 of 144 analyzed pharmaceutical compounds, 42 of 55 analyzed waste-indicator compounds (e.g., flame retardants, hormones, and personal care products), and 39 of 72 analyzed pesticides were detected in the water samples collected monthly between April and November in both 2014 and 2015. Pharmaceutical compounds were most abundant in the surface waters and their median concentrations were measured up to a few hundred nanograms per liter. The CEC concentrations varied depending on sampling locations and seasons. The primary source of CECs was speculated to be wastewater effluent. The CEC concentrations were correlated to streamflow volume and showed significant seasonal effects. The CECs were less persistent during spring runoff season compared with baseflow season at most sampling sites. These results are useful for providing baseline data for surface CEC monitoring and assessing the environmental risks and potential human exposure to CECs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Sato, E				Sato, Eiichi			Kusatsu-Shirane volcano eruption on January 23, 2018, observed using JMA operational weather radars	EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE												A phreatic eruption suddenly occurred at Motoshirane (Kusatsu-Shirane volcano, Japan) at 10:02 JST on January 23, 2018. A member of the Japan Self-Defense Force was killed by volcanic blocks during training in Motoshirane, and 11 people were injured by volcanic blocks or fragments of broken glass. According to a field survey, ash fall was confirmed in Minakami, about 40 km east-northeast from Motoshirane. Although the eruption was not captured by a distant camera, the eruption plume/cloud was captured by three of the Japan Meteorological Agency's operational weather radars. These radars observed the echo propagated to the northeast in the lower troposphere, and to the east in the middle troposphere. This is generally consistent with the observed ash fall distribution. Using the modified probabilistic estimation method, the maximum plume height was estimated to be about 5580506 m (1 sigma) above sea level. Estimates of the erupted mass based on the range of plume heights from radar observations and the duration of volcanic tremor during the eruption (about 8 min) do not match that obtained from a field survey (3.0-5.0x10(7) kg). This discrepancy confirms that estimates of erupted mass based on plume heights must account for eruption style parametrically, which can only be constrained by case studies of varied eruption styles.

Extraordinary Biomass-Burning Episode and Impact Winter Triggered by the Younger Dryas Cosmic Impact ≈12,800 Years Ago. 2. Lake, Marine, and Terrestrial Sediments	JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY												Part 1 of this study investigated evidence of biomass burning in global ice records, and here we continue to test the hypothesis that an impact event at the Younger Dryas boundary (YDB) caused an anomalously intense episode of biomass burning at approximate to 12.8 ka on a multicontinental scale (North and South America, Europe, and Asia). Quantitative analyses of charcoal and soot records from 152 lakes, marine cores, and terrestrial sequences reveal a major peak in biomass burning at the Younger Dryas (YD) onset that appears to be the highest during the latest Quaternary. For the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (K-Pg) impact event, concentrations of soot were previously utilized to estimate the global amount of biomass burned, and similar measurements suggest that wildfires at the YD onset rapidly consumed approximate to 10 million km(2) of Earth's surface, or approximate to 9% of Earth's biomass, considerably more than for the K-Pg impact. Bayesian analyses and age regressions demonstrate that ages for YDB peaks in charcoal and soot across four continents are synchronous with the ages of an abundance peak in platinum in the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2) ice core and of the YDB impact event (12,835-12,735 cal BP). Thus, existing evidence indicates that the YDB impact event caused an anomalously large episode of biomass burning, resulting in extensive atmospheric soot/dust loading that triggered an impact winter. This, in turn, triggered abrupt YD cooling and other climate changes, reinforced by climatic feedback mechanisms, including Arctic sea ice expansion, rerouting of North American continental runoff, and subsequent ocean circulation changes.

J	BOYER, JN; STANLEY, DW; CHRISTIAN, RR				BOYER, JN; STANLEY, DW; CHRISTIAN, RR			DYNAMICS OF NH4+ AND NO3- UPTAKE IN THE WATER COLUMN OF THE NEUSE RIVER ESTUARY, NORTH-CAROLINA	ESTUARIES												In an attempt to more fully understand the dissolved inorganic nitrogen dynamics of the Neuse River estuary, (NH4+)-N-15 and (NO3-)-N-15 uptake races were measured and daily depth-integrated rates calculated for seven stations distributed along the salinity gradient. Measurements were made at 2-3-wk intervals from March 1985 to February 1989. Significant dark NH,I uptake occurred and varied both spatially and seasonally, accounting for as much as 95% of light uptake with the median being 33%. Apparent NH4+ uptake ranged from 0.001 mu mol N l(-1) h(-1) to 4.2 mu mol N l(-1) h(-1), with highest rates occurring during late summer-fall in the oligohaline estuary. Apparent NH4+ uptake was significantly related to NH4+ concentration (p < 0.01); however, the repression explained <3% of the variation. Daily-integrated NH4+ uptake ranged from 0.1 mmol N m(-2) d(-1) to 133 mmol N m(-2) d(-1) and followed the trend of apparent uptake. Annual NH4+ uptake of the estuary was significantly lower in 1988 than for any other year. Dark uptake of NO3- was only 14% of maximum light uptake. Apparent NO3- uptake rates ranged from 0.001 mu mol N l(-1) h(-1) to 1.84 mu mol N l(-1) h(-1) with highest rates occurring in the oligohaline estuary. Apparent NO3- uptake was significantly related to NO3- concentration (p < 0.01); however, the regression explained <5% of the variation. In general, NO3- uptake was only 20% of total dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) uptake. Daily-integrated NO3- uptake ranged from 0.1 mmol N m(-2) d(-1) to 53 mmol N m(-2) d(-1) and followed similar patterns of apparent uptake. Annual NH4+ uptake was 11.39 mol N m(-2) yr(-1), 10.28 mol N m(-2) yr(-1), 10.93 mol N m(-2) yr(-1), and 7.38 mol N m(-2)) yr(-1), with the 4-yr mean being 10.0. Annual NO3- uptake was 3.12 mol N m(-2) yr(-1), 3.40 mol N m(-2) yr(-1), 1.96 mol N m(-2) yr(-1), and 1.84 mol N m(-2) yr(-1), with the 4-yr mean being 2.6. The total annual DIN uptake was more than twice published estimates of phytoplankton DIN demand, indicating that there is an important heterotrophic component of DIN uptake occurring in the water column. The extrapolation of nitrogen demand from primary productivity results in serious underestimates of estuarine nitrogen demand for the Neuse River estuary and may be true for other estuaries as well.																			0160-8347					JUN	1994	17	2					361	371		10.2307/1352669	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1352669													WOS:A1994PK14200005

Utilizing Insects as Bioindicators: An Approximation for Conservation in Urban Lentic Ecosystems in Central Chile	INSECTS												This study considered using insect families as bioindicators to establish the health status of an ecosystem of lentic bodies. The water quality in urban lentic bodies in the Metropolitan Region, Chile, was evaluated from aquatic insect family assemblages and physicochemical variables for conserving aquatic life. Evaluations were carried out in parallel at four sampling stations of three water bodies (Batuco Wetland, Car & eacute;n Lagoon, and Chada Reservoir) in a 2-3-year series, spring (2015, 2017, and 2018) and fall (2016 and 2018), with three replicates. Families were randomly sampled and aquatic insects were identified; abundance and richness differences were compared with non-parametric tests. Physicochemical variables were measured using portable multiparametric and laboratory chemical analyses to determine the water quality. A Canonical Correspondence Analysis was applied for insect families and the physical-chemical variable. In order to categorize the health of these water bodies based on aquatic insect composition and abundance, the Family Biotic Index (FBI), British Biological Monitoring Work Party (BMWP), and Stream Invertebrate Grade Number-Average Level (SIGNAL), adapted for Chile by Figueroa et al. (2007), were calculated. The eudominant insect families were Corixidae and Chironomidae in Batuco, Chironomidae and Corixidae in Car & eacute;n, and Corixidae in Chada. Baetidae was dominant in Car & eacute;n and Chada. The water bodies were classified in descending order of water quality by Chilean physicochemical standards: Chada > Car & eacute;n > Batuco. The TSS (total suspended solids), phosphorus, and electrical conductivity were strongly positively correlated and negatively associated with dissolved oxygen. The TSS level was the most significant influential factor. The BMWP value and the SIGNAL differed from the FBI, but the first was more restrictive, contributing to the conservation of these ecosystems. Based on the nitrogen and phosphorus levels in the water bodies, all of them were eutrophic. Given the ecosystem diversity and complexity, studies should delve deeper into wetlands to establish methods that contribute to determining water quality, using insect families as bioindicators and physicochemical variables.

J	Zhang, MW; Liu, XQ; Yu, ZT; Wang, Y				Zhang, Mengwei; Liu, Xingqi; Yu, Zhitong; Wang, Yong			Paleolake evolution in response to climate change since middle MIS 3 inferred from Jilantai Salt Lake in the marginal regions of the ASM domain	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Little attention has been paid to climate change in the marginal regions of the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) domain since Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 (60-27 cal kyr BP). Here, based on the mineralogy and grain size of a 24-m-long sediment core retrieved from Jilantai Salt Lake, we provide a paleolake evolution record from a marginal region of the ASM domain over the past 47 kyr. Our results indicate that the lake was a brackish or saline lake and that the region was relatively humid during 47-43 cal kyr BP. From 43 to 27.5 cal kyr BP, the lake salinity increased and the climate began to deteriorate. From 27.5 to 11.8 cal kyr BP, aeolian activity intensified and the climate was arid. From 11.8 to 5.6 cal kyr BP, the lake salinity continuously increased, and the climate was persistently arid. After 5.6 cal kyr BP, the lake salinity dramatically increased, the lake became a salt lake, and the climate was extremely arid. In general, the climate was semihumid in mid-late MIS 3, arid in MIS 2 (27-11.7 cal kyr BP), and hyperarid in the Holocene. This climate change pattern is apparently different from that in the regions influenced by the Asian monsoon and westerlies, indicating that the enhanced Asian monsoon or westerlies were not the main forcing mechanism driving climate change in the marginal regions of the ASM domain. Enhanced ice-albedo feedback caused by the expanded Northern Hemisphere ice volume during MIS 3 would have resulted in less net incoming solar radiation and relatively low temperatures in the mid-high latitudes. The relatively low temperatures might have weakened the evaporation capacity of Jilantai Basin and increased south-north temperature gradients, resulting in an increase in local precipitation. Therefore, the climate was semihumid in mid-late MIS 3. The lowest Northern Hemisphere summer insolation (NHSI) combined with significantly increased ice-albedo feedback associated with the largest Northern Hemisphere ice volume would have led to a remarkable reduction in temperature, resulting in the reorganization of major atmospheric and hydrological systems in the Northern Hemisphere and an arid climate in MIS 2. Subsequently, the Northern Hemisphere ice volume nearly vanished, and the rising NHSI enhanced evaporation, thereby generating a hyperarid climate in the Holocene.					; YU, ZHITONG/NVL-8771-2025	Zhang, Mengwei/0000-0001-7394-8343; 													1040-6182	1873-4553				JAN 10	2022	607						48	57		10.1016/j.quaint.2021.06.017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2021.06.017		NOV 2021											WOS:000718038100005

Reported photosynthetic characteristics and respiratory coefficients of various mat types were used to develop a net primary production (NPP) model. Recorded sunlight regimes in Taylor Valley, Antarctica, adjusted for transmission through lake ice where necessary, were used to drive this model for lake and stream ecosystems. In initial simulations, annual NPP for lake mats was consistently negative; stream mats avoid this paradox because they are frozen during the dark, winter months. There seem to be two reasons why simulated lake mat production was negative: sunlight intensities seldom exceed 5% ambient intensity beneath lake ice and respiratory rates are high relative to photosynthesis. Thus, winter respiration exceeded net production at other times. Additional simulations were able to maintain lake mats when respiratory rates were reduced during periods of darkness and photosynthetic responses were adjusted for spectral differences between ambient and incident radiation. Stream mats maintain positive annual NPP, with production limited by the saturation of photosynthesis at low light intensities (ca. 20 to 50 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)), regardless of location.																					90-5410-925-4				1997							181	196																WOS:000072809000017

The impact of rapid sea level changes on recent Azerbaijan beach ridges	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												A ground-penetrating radar survey of a newly formed series of beach ridges along the southern Azerbaijan coast, Caspian Sea, illustrates rapid coastal response to the most recent sea level fall of 0.8 m in the Caspian Sea between 1995 and 1999. Effects of seasonal sea level fluctuations as well as individual storm occurrences can be linked to depositional beds on the ground-penetrating radar profiles. The beach ridge system is swash built and formed primarily under fair weather conditions. Ridge and swale topography can be related to seasonal sea level change. The rapid sea level change in the Caspian Sea combined with surface and subsurface data on coastal beach ridges provides a unique opportunity to observe and reconstruct coastal evolution at a resolution not possible along other oceanic coasts.					; Storms, Joep/HHS-4936-2022; Kroonenberg, Salomon/GQI-4402-2022	Storms, Joep/0000-0002-8902-8493; Kroonenberg, Salomon Bernard/0000-0001-7240-8425; 													0749-0208					MAR	2007	23	2					521	527		10.2112/05-0622.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2112/05-0622.1													WOS:000245191700022
J	HAMPTON, AM				HAMPTON, AM			ALTITUDINAL RANGE AND HABITAT OF TRICLADS IN STREAMS OF THE LAKE TAHOE BASIN	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												The distribution of freshwater triclads in streams, springs and seeps and the Lake Tahoe Basin was studied. Twenty-one streams were investigated from source to mouth in an elevation range from 1902 to 2792 m (6235 to 9160 ft), and collecting sites were established approximately every 400 m (quarter mile). Species of Polycelis were found at the highest elevations and were the most abundant and widely distributed of the stream triclads. They were in 81% of the streams and in many springs and seeps. In several cases, triclads of the genus Polycelis were most abundant in headwaters, decreasing in density downstream. There was no evidence of their being replaced by other triclads at lower elevations within the Lake Tahoe Basin. Phagocata crenophila was found with species of Polycelis in a few locations, and two other triclads were collected: Dugesia dorotocephala in two streams and Phagocata morgani morgani in one. In searches outside of the Basin down into the Carson Valley in an elevation range from 1706 to 1437 m (5597 to 4715 ft), the genus Polycelis was supplanted by Dugesia. This survey substantiates other studies indicating that the dominant triclad fauna of the Sierra Nevada Mountains is boreal.																			0003-0031	1938-4238				OCT	1988	120	2					302	312		10.2307/2426002	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2426002													WOS:A1988T314600009

Fungal diversity present in snow sampled in summer in the north-west Antarctic Peninsula and the South Shetland Islands, Maritime Antarctica, assessed using metabarcoding	EXTREMOPHILES												We assessed the fungal diversity present in snow sampled during summer in the north-west Antarctic Peninsula and the South Shetland Islands, maritime Antarctica using a metabarcoding approach. A total of 586,693 fungal DNA reads were obtained and assigned to 203 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). The dominant phylum was Ascomycota, followed by Basidiomycota, Mortierellomycota, Chytridiomycota and Mucoromycota. Penicillium sp., Pseudogymnoascus pannorum, Coniochaeta sp., Aspergillus sp., Antarctomyces sp., Phenoliferia sp., Cryolevonia sp., Camptobasidiaceae sp., Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and Bannozyma yamatoana were assessed as abundant taxa. The snow fungal diversity indices were high but varied across the different locations sampled. Of the fungal ASVs detected, only 28 were present all sampling locations. The 116 fungal genera detected in the snow were dominated by saprotrophic taxa, followed by symbiotrophic and pathotrophic. Our data indicate that, despite the low temperature and oligotrophic conditions, snow can host a richer mycobiome than previously reported through traditional culturing studies. The snow mycobiome includes a complex diversity dominated by cosmopolitan, cold-adapted, psychrophilic and endemic taxa. While saprophytes dominate this community, a range of other functional groups are present.

The first mode of the interannual variation of EHT frequency over the YRB obtained by empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis shows a uniform pattern. A strong connection is found between the EHT frequency over the YRB and the North Atlantic Dipole (NAD) mode, which exhibits opposite SSTAs variation over the subtropical and midlatitude North Atlantic. Concurrently, this NAD mode can stimulate the Davis Strait-Ural Mountains-Lake Baikal-Yangtze River basin (DUBY) atmospheric teleconnection. During positive NAD years, the DUBY pattern displays negative-positive-negative-positive geopotential height anomalies around the Davis Strait-Ural Mountains-Lake Baikal-YRB, and vice versa. The results of statistical analyses and numerical experiments suggest that the positive (negative) NAD mode can affect the EHT frequency over the YRB by generating anomalous anticyclonic (cyclonic) circulation through the DUBY pattern. The findings of our study offer a new perspective on understanding EHT events over the YRB.

Features of the Karst Water Regime in the Skelskaya Cave (Ai-Petri Massif, the Mountain Crimea) and Their Hydrogeological Interpretation	WATER RESOURCES												The data of long-term monitoring (2012-2023) of hydrological (levels) and physicochemical (temperature, specific conductance) characteristics of karst water of the Skelskaya Cave are analyzed. Parallel observations in opposite parts of the cave (Western and Eastern lakes) revealed synchronous level variations but different dynamics of the temperature, specific conductance, and isotopic composition of water. The difference between the physicochemical parameters can be most clearly seen in flood events, which indicates the input into the cave of two karst water flows from different catchments. These were identified to be the Karadagskii and Tarpanbairskii recharge areas, which lie at different elevation levels and carry their waters along the Karadagskii fault towards Western and Eastern lakes of the cave, respectively. The comparison of water level variations in the cave with the discharge dynamics of the Skelskii spring, as well as the physicochemical and isotope characteristics during floods revealed a strong correlation between them. Therefore, the Skelskii spring is the main discharge site (drain) of the karst aquifer system of the Skelskaya Cave.

J	Skvarca, P; Stuefer, M; Rott, H				Skvarca, P; Stuefer, M; Rott, H			Temporal changes of Glaciar Mayo and Laguna Escondida, southern Patagonia, detected by remote sensing data	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE					International Symposium on Glaciers of the Southern Hemisphere	JUL 07-09, 1997	MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA	Int Commiss Snow & Ice				Glaciar Mayo, covering an area of 43 km(2), is an eastern outlet glacier of the Southern Patagonian Icefield at its narrowest part. Aerial photographs from 1970, an optical satellite image of 1986 and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of the SIR-C/X-SAR, acquired in 1994, were used to investigate changes of the glacier terminus and of an ice-dammed lake, and to derive the surface velocity in the ablation area. In 1970, the glacier was damming a lake, Laguna Escondida, covering 8.6 km2. The analysis of the 1986 image reveals a 56% decrease in the area of the lake, the size in the SAR images from 1994 is similar. The western front of Glaciar Mayo advanced slightly between 1970 and 1986 and then retreated by about the same amount until 1994, whereas the eastern front retreated during both periods. The retreat of Glaciar Mayo is in accordance with the general glacier recession observed during the last three decades for almost all glaciers of the Patagonian icefields. Striking features in the images are two major debris bands across the terminus, the first originating from rock fall before 1959, the second from rock fall between 1970 and 1986. The second band was displaced between 1986 and 1994 with an average velocity of 288 m/year (79 cm/day). For the same trajectory, a motion of 80 cm was derived for a 24 h period in October 1994 with L-Band SIR-C data by means of interferometry. The agreement of the velocities derived by the two methods indicates little seasonal and interannual variability of ice motion, as observed also on the neighbouring Glaciar Perito Moreno.

The seasonal evolution of albedo across glaciers and the surrounding landscape of Taylor Valley, Antarctica	CRYOSPHERE												The McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDVs) of Antarctica are a polar desert ecosystem consisting of alpine glaciers, ice-covered lakes, streams, and expanses of vegetation-free rocky soil. Because average summer temperatures are close to 0 degrees C, the MDV ecosystem in general, and glacier melt dynamics in particular, are both closely linked to the energy balance. A slight increase in incoming radiation or change in albedo can have large effects on the timing and volume of meltwater. However, the seasonal evolution or spatial variability of albedo in the valleys has yet to fully characterized. In this study, we aim to understand the drivers of landscape albedo change within and across seasons. To do so, a box with a camera, GPS, and shortwave radiometer was hung from a helicopter that flew transects four to five times a season along Taylor Valley. Measurements were repeated over three seasons. These data were coupled with incoming radiation measured at six meteorological stations distributed along the valley to calculate the distribution of albedo across individual glaciers, lakes, and soil surfaces. We hypothesized that albedo would decrease throughout the austral summer with ablation of snow patches and increasing sediment exposure on the glacier and lake surfaces. However, small snow events (< 6 mm water equivalent) coupled with ice whitening caused spatial and temporal variability of albedo across the entire landscape. Glaciers frequently followed a pattern of increasing albedo with increasing elevation, as well as increasing albedo moving from east to west laterally across the ablation zone. We suggest that spatial patterns of albedo are a function of landscape morphology trapping snow and sediment, longitudinal gradients in snowfall magnitude, and wind-driven snow redistribution from east to west along the valley. We also compare our albedo measurements to the MODIS albedo product and found that overall the data have reasonable agreement. The mismatch in spatial scale between these two datasets results in variability, which is reduced after a snow event due to albedo following valley-scale gradients of snowfall magnitude. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the spatial and temporal variability in albedo and the close coupling of climate and landscape response. This new understanding of landscape albedo can constrain landscape energy budgets, better predict meltwater generation on from MDV glaciers, and how these ecosystems will respond to changing climate at the landscape scale.

Excessive diversion of water would, however, dramatically alter the local flow fields, which are not conducive to the growth of aquatic plants and the stability of ecosystems. The current "Diverting Water from the Yangtze River to Tai Lake (DWYRTL)" project uses a single water source, the Wangyu River, for diversion, a model that may significantly affect the nearby flow rate or uniformity of the lake and is not conducive to the long-term stability of the aquatic ecosystem in the Tai Lake district of the eastern part of the lake. In order to simulate the different situations of single- and dual-source water diversions (Wangyu-Xinmeng Rivers) in Tai Lake, we based this study on a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model coupled with the Euler method, which can accurately calculate the water exchange rates in the different districts of Tai Lake. The results show that (1) it is recommended that the total annual diversion of water should not exceed 20 x 10(8) m(3); (2) the wind field is the most important factor determining the distribution of spatial water exchange; (3) under wind-free conditions, the flow rate of a single-source diversion of water is approximately 50% higher than that of dual-source diversion; and (4) water diversion under the prevailing conditions of the northwest wind in winter will reduce the semiexchange period of the eastern part of the lake area from 50 to 30 days, significantly changing the nearby district's uniformity, leading to ecological risks. Therefore, it is recommended that the dual-source water diversion mode be used in winter and windless season, and single-source water diversion mode be used in other seasons.

The samples covered a relatively short time interval (from 1997 to 2000) and a seasonal detail breakdown was possible. A probable seasonal trend was observed only for gamma-HCH, a pesticide currently used in some European countries. For all other chemicals, a seasonal trend was not evident, and this supports the hypothesis of the prevailing role of long-range transport in comparison with local emissions for POP pollution ill high mountains. The role of temperature on air-snow exchange has also been highlighted. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

J	Haase, M				Haase, Martin			The radiation of hydrobiid gastropods in New Zealand: a revision including the description of new species based on morphology and mtDNA sequence information	SYSTEMATICS AND BIODIVERSITY												A revision of New Zealand hydrobiid gastropods resulted in the description of 46 new species out of a total of 64, which belong to 15 genera, nine of them new. This revision is based on morphological data as welt as sequence information of two mtDNA fragments. The majority of species occur in seepages, springs and the ground-water and many have very narrow ranges. The morphological diversification appears to be [inked to these habitats. Their common feature is the absence of predators. The genetics of three morphologically distinct species found in springs and streamlets suggest they have only recently split from the common, widespread Potamopyrgus antipodarum. Predator pressure, on the other hand, may have stabilised shell shape of three genetically distinct but otherwise cryptic species of Potamopyrgus, which occur in rivers, lakes and estuaries. Many species occur sympatrically. In one case of sympatry P. antipodarum appeared to displace another, slightly smaller species into crevices and other microhabitats not accessible for the former. Phylogenetic relationships were reconstructed based on the concatenated mtDNA sequences using Bayesian analyses, maximum likelihood and minimum evolution (LogDet distances). The three reconstruction methods gave very similar results suggesting that heterogeneous base frequencies were not a confounding factor. Analyses of character evolution revealed convergence in the digestive system as well as in the female and male genitalia. Radular features suggested a relationship of New Caledonian and New Zealand hydrobiids.

J	McGlone, MS; Wilmshurst, JM				McGlone, MS; Wilmshurst, JM			Dating initial Maori environmental impact in New Zealand	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Over the last decade there has been an intense debate as to whether New Zealand prehistory is 'long' ( > 1500 yr),'short' (< 600 yr) or 'intermediate' (c.1000 yr). Pollen and charcoal analyses have played a key role in this debate by pinpointing the transition from relatively undisturbed environments to those deforested by anthropogenic fires. We review pollen and stratigraphic studies carried out on a variety of sites, including peat bogs, swamps, estuaries and lakes, and contribute new results. Different sedimentary environments show varying susceptibilities to contamination and have resulted in a wide spread of ages for initial Maori impact. Feat and macrofossils from bogs are the least susceptible to contamination by old or young carbon, whereas lakes and swamps are subject to inwash of old carbon and hard water effects. Silty sediments appear to be particularly vulnerable to contamination. Analysis of C-14 dates for the start of Maori deforestation show that ages falling ill the 'long' prehistory period are exclusively derived from lakes and swamps. In contrast, the bulk of the ages falling in the 'short prehistory period are from bogs. We conclude the first evidence of Maori environmental impact dates to 1200-1400 AD (750-550 calendar years BP). Finer age resolution is limited by the uncertainty associated with identifying the first signs of human impact and variability of the C-14 calibration curve. (C) 1999 INQUA/Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Virkutyte, J; Sillanpää, M				Virkutyte, J; Sillanpää, M			Chemical evaluation of potable water in Eastern Qinghai Province, China: Human health aspects	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL												Electric conductivity, pH, CODMn, nutrient concentration, chloride and sulfate concentrations, total dissolved sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, manganese, iron, cadmium, copper, arsenic, nickel, zinc, chromium and lead were evaluated to clarify concerns about the quality and safety of water used for drinking purposes in Qinghai Province, China. For this purpose, 12 water samples were collected from different villages, Qinghai (Koko Nor) Lake and medicinal springs close to the Town of Pingang during a study visit to China in 2003. The results showed that National Chinese and WHO drinking water standards were exceeded for nutrient concentration (3.2 mg l(-1) of TOT-N and 0.2 mg l(-1) of TOT-P) from Qinghai Lake. The presence of elevated electric conductivity (550 mS m(-1)) in mineral water resort samples should be a matter of a public concern. Also, samples from medicinal springs showed high concentrations of Fe (up to 1.9 mg l(-1)), As (up to 0.1 mg l(-1)) and Ni (0.05 mg l(-1)), which may be detrimental for human health if the water is consumed on a daily basis. The concentrations of Cu, Cd, Cr and Pb did not exceed the National Chinese and WHO drinking water standards, and therefore, water from the sampling area does not pose any significant threat to the consumers' health regarding these metals.

Patterns of pronounced increases or decreases in the strongest backscatter between two winter seasons often indicate large changes in glacier crevassing, which we treat here as a sign of surge-type activity. Validations against velocity time series, terminus advances and crevassing found in optical satellite images confirm the robustness of this approach. We find 115 surge-type events globally between 2017 and 2022, around 100 of which on glaciers already know as surge-type. Our data reveal a pronounced spatial clustering in three regions, (i) Karakoram, Pamirs and Western Kunlun Shan (similar to 50 surges), (ii) Svalbard (similar to 25) and (iii) Yukon/Alaska (similar to 9), with only a few other scattered surges elsewhere. This spatial clustering is significantly more pronounced than the overall global clustering of known surge-type glaciers. The 2017-22 clustering may point to climatic forcing of surge initiation.

The quantity and depth distribution of heat stored during the summer varied markedly. The reservoir functioned as a heat trap; heat was readily dissipated from the lake. Salinity increased more in the lower layer of the lake. Throughout the summer, nutrient-rich water was discharged from the reservoir; nutrient-poor water was discharged from the lake. Phytoplankton standing crops were greater in the lake and were dominated by flagellates and diatoms. In the reservoir, blue-green algae were predominant. Rates of primary production and respiration were higher in the lake, but estimated algal turnover times were faster in the reservoir. It was concluded that depth of outflow has a direct and predictable effect on certain physical and chemical conditions within these two bodies of water; but effects of discharge depth on phytoplankton were secondary and thus difficult to ascertain.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1978	8	1					33	42		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1978.tb01423.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1978.tb01423.x													WOS:A1978EL63300004

The roles of orbitally driven summer cooling, volcanism, and human impact as triggers of local environmental changes in the Holocene of Iceland remain debated. While there are indications that human impact may have reduced environmental resilience during late Holocene summer cooling, it is still difficult to resolve to what extent human and natural factors affected Iceland's late Holocene landscape instability. Here, we present a continuous Holocene fire record of northeastern Iceland from proxies archived in St & oacute;ra Vi & eth;arvatn sediment. We use pyrogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pyroPAHs) to trace shifts in fire regimes, paired with continuous biomarker and bulk geochemical records of soil erosion, lake productivity, and human presence. The molecular composition of pyroPAHs and a wind pattern reconstruction indicate a naturally driven fire signal that is mostly regional. Generally low fire frequency during most of the Holocene significantly increased at 3 ka and again after 1.5 ka BP before known human settlement in Iceland. We propose that shifts in vegetation type caused by cooling summers over the past 3 kyr, in addition to changes in atmospheric circulation, such as shifts in North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) regime, led to increased aridity and biomass flammability. Our results show no evidence of faecal biomarkers associated with human activity during or after human colonisation in the 9th century CE. Instead, faecal biomarkers follow the pattern described by erosional proxies, pointing toward a negligible human presence and/or a diluted signal in the lake's catchment. However, low post-colonisation levels of pyroPAHs, in contrast to an increasing flux of erosional bulk proxies, suggest that farming and animal husbandry may have suppressed fire frequency by reducing the spread and flammability of fire-prone vegetation (e.g. heathlands).Overall, our results describe a fire frequency heavily influenced by long-term changes in climate through the Holocene. They also suggest that human colonisation had contrasting effects on the local environment by lowering its resilience to soil erosion while increasing its resilience to fire.					; Thordarson, Thorvaldur/M-2422-2015; Geirsdottir, Aslaug/L-3267-2015; Geirsdóttir, Áslaug/L-3267-2015	Harning, David/0000-0002-2648-1346; Raberg, Jonathan/0000-0003-2959-3631; Thordarson, Thorvaldur/0000-0003-4011-7185; Geirsdottir, Aslaug/0000-0003-3125-0195; Miller, G H/0000-0002-8225-2740													1814-9324	1814-9332				MAY 2	2024	20	4					1087	1123		10.5194/cp-20-1087-2024	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-20-1087-2024													WOS:001225912000001
J	Olsén, KH; Bonow, M				Olsen, K. Hakan; Bonow, Madeleine			Crucian carp (Carassius carassius (L.)), an anonymous fish with great skills	ICHTHYOLOGICAL RESEARCH												The crucian carp (Carassius carassius) is a cyprinid fish with its natural distribution in Europe and the western part of Asia. Due to its hardiness and unique ability to survive winter anoxia, it has been translocated to small lakes and ponds, and in Northern Europe since medieval times has been used as a food source. Crucian carp was the only fish in the pond that survived anoxia. Small lakes and ponds with winter anoxia result in dense populations of stunted and slender fish. In lakes with other fish species present, the crucians' numbers and densities are low and they grow to large sizes. In the presence of piscivores such as pike, crucians are deep bodied. The presence of pike-eating crucians, or the pike odors, induce a change in the body form of crucians. The change in body form makes it more difficult for pikes to swallow crucians and the handling time increases. Closely related invasive Carassius species have become a serious threat to crucian carp populations in Central-Eastern Europe and South-Eastern England through competition for space and food resources and hybridization. The crucian carp's close relationship to goldfish (Carassius auratus), the most studied species concerning sex pheromones, has made it possible to demonstrate that sex pheromones are also present in a wild Carassius species and in their natural environment. The results indicate that two species use the same sex hormonal pheromone system. The crucian carp has become an important model for laboratory studies of olfaction and taste.

Although the direct effects of food shortages on consumers have been well studied, the cascading effects on interspecific interactions remain poorly understood. Targeted research is required to improve our understanding of the impacts of food shortage on animals and to facilitate the development of conservation plans. Here, we used DNA metabarcoding and field observations of goose foraging behaviour to assess the cascading effects of collapse of tubers of Vallisneria spp., the dominant submerged macrophytes at Poyang Lake, China, on the diet of the swan goose (Anser cygnoides) and on the interspecific competition among goose species, the swan goose, the bean goose (Anser fabalis), and the greater white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons). The metabarcoding analyses were carried out on faecal samples collected in winter 2016/17 and 2018/19, and behavioural observations were conducted in winter 2021/22. Our study elucidated the dietary compositions of the three goose species in greater detail than previously known. When Vallisneria tubers became rare, swan geese switched their foraging focus to Carex spp. and other grassland plants. When tuber abundance rebounded, swan geese resumed tuber foraging, suggesting the superiority of tubers as food for swan geese. Swan geese foraging on Carex, the major foods of bean geese and greater white-fronted geese, potentially increased interspecific competition among goose species. Swan geese increased their pecking rates while bean geese increased time spent foraging apparently to cope with interspecific competition. Given the severe impacts of tuber collapses on waterbirds and the important role of Poyang Lake in waterbird protection, we advocate restoring submerged macrophytes to provide high quality foods for tuber-foraging waterbirds. Our study emphasises that, in addition to directly influencing consumers, food collapses may also influence other species through changes in interspecific interactions. Our study also illustrates the importance of behavioural plasticity to cope with interspecific competition and to respond to environment change.

J	Uri, ND				Uri, ND			A note on soil erosion and its environmental consequences in the United States	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Soil erosion has both on-farm and off-farm impacts. Reduction of soil depth can impair the land's productivity, and the transport of sediments can degrade streams, lakes, and estuaries. Since 1933, soil conservation policies have existed in the United States. Originally they focused on the on-farm benefits of keeping soil on the land and increasing net farm income. Beginning in the 1980s, however, policy goals increasingly included reductions in off-site impacts of erosion. As a consequence of conservation efforts associated with explicit U.S. government policies, total soil erosion between 1982 and 1992 was reduced by 32% and the sheet and rill erosion rate fell from an average of 4.1 tons per acre per year in 1982 to 3.1 tons per acre in 1992. Wind erosion rate fell from an average of 3.3 tons per acre per year to 2.4 tons per acre per year over the same period. Still, soil erosion is imposing substantial social costs. These costs are estimated to be about $37.6 billion annually. To further reduce soil erosion and thereby mitigate its social costs, there are a number of policy options available to induce farmers to adopt conservation practices including education and technical assistance, financial assistance, research and development, land retirement, and regulation and taxes.																			0049-6979					JUL	2001	129	1-4					181	197		10.1023/A:1010335031525	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1010335031525													WOS:000169334400013

The result exhibits that in winter, due to a relatively higher rate of snowfall, 33.14% of the total snow-covered area within the glacier is covered by fresh snow whereas it is 10.28% during the post-monsoon season. South Lhonak glacier, surrounded and connected by other highly elevated snow-covered areas may lead to snow avalanche and subsequent potentially damaging glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF).

Long-Term Fire Trends in Hispaniola and Puerto Rico from Sedimentary Charcoal: A Comparison of Three Records	PROFESSIONAL GEOGRAPHER												Charcoal preserved in lake sediments is commonly used to reconstruct past trends in fire occurrence. However, interpretation of the charcoal record is often complicated, as changes in charcoal influx could represent natural shifts in fire regimes associated with changes in climate, changes in vegetation, or changes in patterns of anthropogenic burning. Here we examine sedimentary charcoal records from three lakes on the Caribbean islands of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico: Laguna Saladilla in the Dominican Republic, Lake Miragoane in Haiti, and Laguna Tortuguero in Puerto Rico. All records are based on microscopic charcoal fragments quantified from pollen slides and cover the last 7,000 or more years of the Holocene. We compare charcoal influx values to archeological and palynological evidence of human activity and explore the role of increasing winter insolation over the Holocene in driving increased charcoal deposition beginning ca. 6,000-5,000 cal yr BP. An increase in charcoal influx at Laguna Tortuguero at ca. 5,200 cal yr BP, previously interpreted as a signal of human settlement predating archeological evidence, may instead reflect insolation-driven shifts in winter drying that led to more frequent and possibly more intense natural fires. Decreased charcoal influx around 3,200 cal yr BP may signal human modification of the environment that altered fire frequency and/or intensity. Comparing the records from these three lowland Caribbean sites highlights possible intervals of synchronous, climate-driven burning as distinct from more localized anthropogenic burning.					; Horn, Sally/B-1918-2013	CAFFREY, MARIA/0000-0003-1635-5853; Horn, Sally/0000-0002-0575-3664													0033-0124	1467-9272				APR 3	2015	67	2					229	241		10.1080/00330124.2014.922017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00330124.2014.922017													WOS:000352302000009
J	Cheng, JR; Xu, HF				Cheng, Jianru; Xu, Huifang			Extreme Hydroclimate Events Between Early-1100s and Mid-1200s Recorded in Deep Springs Lake, California	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Previous studies reported megadroughts in southwestern North America during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and subsequent periods. However, previous local records challenge traditional tree-ring based indices. Through mineralogical analyses of Deep Springs Lake sediments in California, we examined carbonate mineral assemblages as novel hydroclimate proxies. Our investigation revealed a primary magnesite-rich layer (similar to 70% Ca-bearing magnesite, similar to 30% dolomite) beneath a layer dominated by aragonite and calcite, implying a transition from an extreme drought to pluvial conditions. Since magnesite precipitates only at the highest Mg:Ca ratios, followed by dolomite and calcite/aragonite, we developed the quantitative Carbonate Dryness Index (CDI) by weighting these minerals. The CDI curve highlights a drought and a following pluvial with unparalleled magnitudes in the past millennium during 1090-1150 CE, aligning with nearby local climate proxies but not regional tree-ring records. Additionally, DSL sediments recorded similar to 500-year wet/dry cycles driven by solar and El Ni & ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) activities.																			0094-8276	1944-8007				APR 28	2025	52	8							e2024GL114377	10.1029/2024GL114377	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024GL114377													WOS:001477026200001

To determine the environmental factors that influence the growth and physiological characteristics of M. densa, we investigated the variations in physicochemical factors and M. densa cell density from 2007 to 2017. The results showed that the urea-N concentration increased significantly (from 0.02 +/- 0.00-0.20 +/- 0.01 mg N l(-1)), whereas other factors did not vary significantly. NO3-N and urea-N concentrations were higher than the NH4+-N concentration during the M. densa bloom. The nitrogen composition changed, and urea-N and NO3-N became a major nitrogen sources in the reservoir. Water temperature and increased urea-N concentrations were the primary factors that influenced variations in M. densa cell density (45.5%, p < 0.05). Laboratory experiments demonstrated that M. densa cultured with urea-N exhibited a higher maximum cell density (9.8 +/- 0.5 x 10(8) cells l(-1)), more cellular pigments for photosynthesis (chlorophyll a and phycocyanin) and photoprotection (carotenoid), and more proteins than those cultured with NH4+-N and NO3--N. These results suggested that M. densa cultured with urea-N exhibited preferable growth and physiological conditions. Moreover, M. densa exhibited an increased maximum specific uptake rate (0.93 pg N cell(-1) h(-1)) and reduced half-saturation constant (0.03 mg N l(-1)) for urea-N compared with NH4+-N and NO3--N, suggesting that M. densa preferred urea-N as its major nitrogen source. These results collectively indicated that the increasing urea-N concentration was beneficial for the growth and physiological conditions of M. densa. This study provided ten years of field data and detailed physiological information supporting the critical effect of urea-N on the growth of a novel bloom species M. densa. These findings helped to reveal the mechanism of M. densa bloom formation from the perspective of dissolved organic nitrogen.																			0147-6513	1090-2414				JAN 15	2021	208								111713	10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111713	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111713								33396044					WOS:000604137700008

Implications of Spring Water Levels on the Production of American White Pelicans Nesting at Marsh Lake, Minnesota	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Weinvestigated the relationship between spring water levels and production of American white pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) nesting colonially at Marsh Lake in southwest Minnesota during 2003-2012. We obtained estimates of pelican nest and chick numbers from aerial photographs to determine population levels. We used historical streamflow data to characterize April water conditions, a period when nest-site selection typically occurs. Pelicans used 4 islands and 1 peninsula for nesting, ranging from relatively high-elevation sites connected to or near the mainland to more distant low-elevation sites in the middle of the lake. The number and proportion of nests on high-elevation sites are positively related to discharge in the Upper Minnesota River during April. In years when high water inundates low-elevation sites during pelican nest-site selection, pelican nests were located on the high-elevation locations near or connected to the mainland. Over 90% of the variation in the number of nests on high-elevation sites is related to the mean daily discharge in the Upper Minnesota River during April. In addition, the proportion of nests on high-elevation sites also increases as mean daily discharge during April increases. However, chick production was negatively related to discharge during April. More than 84% of the variation in the number of near-fledged chicks produced per nest was related to mean daily discharge during April. Although high-elevation sites in close proximity to the mainland offered nesting pelicans refuge from high water levels, they also expose American white pelican nests to greater predator risk. Nest camera monitoring indicated that high-elevation sites exhibited significantly higher predator activity than low-elevation sites, and experienced lower nest success (i.e., probability that at least 1 egg from the nest hatched). Proposed changes in the management of Marsh Lake call for the installation of a water control structure at the Marsh Lake dam that will allow for active management of lake levels. Our study provides managers with models for predicting impacts of water levels on American white pelican production. (C) 2015 The Wildlife Society.

J	Longmore, ME				Longmore, ME			Quaternary palynological records from perched lake sediments, Fraser Island, Queensland, Australia: Rainforest, forest history and climatic control	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Pollen, carbonised particle and chemical analysis of a 6 m core from the Old Lake Coomboo Depression, a perched lake basin situated in one of the oldest dune systems on Fraser Island, demonstrates vegetation and hydrological change through a series of glacial cycles. The pollen assemblage shifts from predominantly rainforest with Araucaria sp. (Juss.) surrounding a deep water lake at c. 600 ka, to a dryer rainforest with Podocarpus sp. (L'Herit) and an intermediate lake after c. 350 ka, to a more sclerophyllous forest until before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). During the Last Interglacial (c. 120 ka) and before (c. 22 ka) the LGM, Araucaria sp. pollen frequencies increase before falling dramatically, open forest appears to shift to the robust association of myrtaceous shrubs characteristic of the older dune systems to the west of the island, and lake levels fall probably below the lake floor. After the LGM, open forest returns, but Araucaria sp. pollen frequencies never recover and the lake becomes an ephemeral system with a fluctuating water-table in the Holocene. The record is interpreted as reflecting retrogressive vegetation succession driven primarily by an overall decrease in effective precipitation over, at least, the last 350 ka. The inferred long-term changes in climate have major implications for the survival of relict rainforest.																			0067-1924						1997	45	3					507	526		10.1071/BT96109	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/BT96109													WOS:A1997XZ74800010

However, there can be significant offsets between the estimated temperatures based on brGDGT distributions in globally-distributed individual surface soils and the corresponding instrumental temperatures suggesting that additional environmental and/or biological controls could influence these distributions. We investigated the influences of seasonality and vegetation type on the brGDGT distributions by collecting surface soils beneath sub-alpine forest and grassland in September (warm month) and January (cold month), within an identical climatic background, in southern China. The absence of apparent seasonal changes in the soil brGDGT distributions between the warm and cold months indicates an annual or longer turnover time of soil brGDGTs at our study site. However, there are differences in the surface soil brGDGT distributions expressed as MBT'5ME (the methylation index that is related to mean annual temperature, i.e., MAT) between forest and grassland. Specifically, the forest surface soil MBT'5ME values were generally lower than those of grassland surface soils, which is consistent with the relatively higher summer grassland surface soil temperatures. This reveals a seasonal (summer) bias in the brGDGT distributions, and the dominant influence of temperature and secondary/indirect influence of vegetation type on brGDGT distributions. Finally, for brGDGT distributions in the 288 globally-distributed surface soils with known vegetation types, the root mean square error (RMSE) between calculated and measured MAT is slightly decreased when the vegetation types are taken into account, which further indicates a possible secondary/indirect influence of vegetation type on surface soil brGDGT distributions.

Areas of sediment transport and deposition on an older river bottom are delineated by seismic reflectors and are related to inundation and incision caused by late Quaternary rising and falling of sea level. Older substrates have been identified as the Alter do Chao Formation (Cretaceous) and the Barreiras Formation (Tertiary). The initial AMS-radiocarbon dates yielded late Pleistocene to Holocene ages, and indicate a high sedimentation rate (0.6 cm/yr) for the last 800 yr. Three stages in the late Quaternary evolution of the Amazon mouth system can be distinguished: (i) relative sea-level fall: probably related to the Last Glacial Maximum with channel incision; (ii) deposition and consolidation of mud found near Afua during relative sea-level rise between late Pleistocene and middle Holocene, corresponding to the "freshwater lake" or the evolution of large floodplain areas in Amazonia; and (iii) stable sea-level conditions since 6000 yr BP resulting in the modern pattern of deposition and erosion, controlled by complex interactions of fluvial and oceanic processes.

J	Specziár, A; Turcsányi, B				Specziar, Andras; Turcsanyi, Bela			Management of pikeperch stocking in Lake Balaton: effect of season, area, fish size and method of release on the rate and distribution of recaptures	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												Pikeperch Sander lucioperca is an economically important fish which depleted populations need intensive management and supplemental stocking. We aimed to assess the relative influence of various pikeperch stocking strategies in Lake Balaton, Hungary, and tested 60 stocking set-ups (two seasons x three lake areas x shore vs. offshore release x five size groups) by releasing 3000 tagged yearlings. Anglers reported data of 522 recaptures within four years after stocking. Recapture rate was highest in stocking of the most productive lake area, increased with fish size, was higher in shore than offshore releases, but did not differed between stocking seasons. Fish stocked to oligotrophic areas travelled longer distances and dispersed more than those stocked to the mesotrophic area. Fish size had little effect, whereas season and method of stocking had no effect on dispersal of fish. To conclude, in pikeperch, autumn stocking with large yearlings released directly from the shore is recommended over other set-ups. Stocking quotas may be concentrated in space in low productivity areas, but should be dispersed between multiple sites in food rich areas to attain complete dispersal. This study provides a framework for testing fisheries management alternatives and behaviour of stocked fish in intensively utilized habitats.					; Specziár, András/N-5656-2019	Specziar, Andras/0000-0001-6341-636X; 													1961-9502					NOV 10	2017		418							52	10.1051/kmae/2017047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/kmae/2017047													WOS:000415044400001

Quantitative palaeoclimatic records show that the most recent time in the geological history with comparable warming rates was during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition (PHT) about 14,000 to 11,000 years ago. To better understand the biotic response to rapid temperature change, we explore the community turnover rates during the PHT by focusing on the Baltic region in the southeastern sector of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet, where an exceptionally dense network on microfossil and macrofossil data that reflect the biotic community history are available. We further use a composite chironomid-based summer temperature reconstruction compiled specifically for our study region to calculate the rate of temperature change during the PHT. The fastest biotic turnover in the terrestrial and aquatic communities occurred during the Younger Dryas-Holocene shift at 11,700 years ago. This general shift in species composition was accompanied by regional extinctions, including disappearance of mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) and reindeer (Ranger tarandus) and many arctic-alpine plant taxa, such as Dryas octopetala, Salix polaris and Saxifraga aizoides, from the region. This rapid biotic turnover rate occurred when the rate of warming was 0.17 degrees C/decade, thus slightly lower than the current Northern Hemisphere warming of 0.2 degrees C/decade. We therefore conclude that the Younger Dryas-Holocene shift with its rapid turnover rates and associated regional extinctions represents an important palaeoanalogue to the current high latitude warming and gives insights about the probable future turnover rates and patterns of the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem change.

This study investigates the characteristics of summer extreme precipitation in the Poyang Lake City Group (PLCG) from 1971 to 2022, utilizing the China Daily Precipitation Dataset and NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data. Nine extreme precipitation indices were examined through linear trend analysis, Mann-Kendall tests, wavelet transforms, and correlation methods to quantify trends, periodicity, and atmospheric drivers. The key findings include: (1) All indices exhibited increasing trends, with RX1Day and R95p exhibiting significant rises (p < 0.05). PRCPTOT, R20, and SDII also increased, indicating heightened precipitation intensity and frequency. (2) R50, RX1Day, and SDII demonstrated east-high-to-west-low spatial gradients, whereas PRCPTOT and R20 peaked in the eastern and western PLCG. More than over 88% of stations recorded rising trends in PRCPTOT and R95p. (3) Abrupt changes occurred during 1993-2009 for PRCPTOT, R50, and SDII. Wavelet analysis revealed dominant periodicities of 26-39 years, linked to atmospheric oscillations. (4) Strong subtropical highs, moisture convergence, and negative OLR anomalies were closely associated with extreme precipitation. Warmer SSTs in the eastern equatorial Pacific amplified precipitation in preceding seasons. This study provides a scientific basis for flood prevention and climate adaptation in the PLCG and highlighting the region's vulnerability to monsoonal shifts under global warming.

Formation of Water Chemistry of Small Rivers of the Volga Basin in the Tver Region during the Summer Low-Water Season	WATER RESOURCES												-Studies of natural processes of river water chemistry formation and the effect of anthropogenic factors on it remain a topical task of hydrochemistry. In July 2021, water quality was assessed based on hydrochemical indicators of the upper reaches of 29 small rivers in the Volga River basin within the Tver region. The location of most of the gages was selected, if possible, in homogeneous landscape conditions of catchments, minimally affected by economic activity. The obtained characteristics can be considered as close as possible to natural background indicators for the summer low-water period. The analysis of spatial differentiation of natural factors was carried out on the basis of landscape maps, geochemical and hydrogeological cartographic materials of different years of publication. The set of hydrochemical characteristics was processed using the method of hierarchical cluster analysis. Significant spatial differentiation of the chemical composition of waters was revealed, and landscape diversity was not found to play a clear determining role. The chemical composition of water in small rivers is mainly influenced by two factors. The high degree of swampiness of the catchment area leads to an increase in the concentrations of Fe, organic matter by COD and PO, phenols and color index in surface waters. The presence of channel lakes levels out this factor to some extent, which is most noticeably manifested in the association of river waters of the Volga and Selizharovka. The second factor is the recharge by deep groundwaters, which increase the TDS of river waters, the content of the main ions, F, Sr, and P, and the leaching of silicates from bedrock.

Phototrophic bacteria reach large populations in this lake and the PHA concentration changed seasonally according to their biomass. During summer stratification of the lake, phototrophic bacteria formed a metalimnetic peak. Bacterial counts were maximal at a depth of 1.5-2.0 m, whereas the PHA specific content reached a maximal value at 3.0-3.5 m. Since the limiting factor in this ecosystem is light availability, we assume that cells beneath the dense metalimnetic peak have unbalanced growth conditions and thus accumulate large amounts of PHA.

Calcite accumulation and its isotopic composition are controlled by a complex set of interrelated factors, including temperature, primary productivity, and the abundance of pico-cyanobacteria during the stratified period. Calcite precipitation is highly correlated to lake temperature, because physical and biological factors interact to produce conditions favorable for whitings during warm years when the lake stratifies early in the seasonal cycle. Carbonate stratigraphies in multiple cores from eastern Lake Ontario revealed similar patterns of historical variation in percent carbonate. An exponential rise in carbonate accumulation occurred in nine cores after 1930, culminating in peak values in the early 1980s. This rise was related to historic increases in primary productivity resulting from increased phosphorus loading to Lake Ontario. Superimposed upon this rise were four peaks (centered on 1940-1942, 1957-1961, 1971-1977, and 1983) that correlate with maxima in summer air-temperature anomalies from the Great Lakes region and with strong El Nino events. These peaks are also associated with maxima in delta(13)C values and minima in delta(18)O values of carbonate, lending support to our model that more calcite is precipitated with higher delta(13)C values during warm years when thermal stratification occurs early in the seasonal cycle. Beginning in the mid-1980s, calcite accumulation and its delta(13)C ratio began to decrease, suggesting a reduction in primary productivity in surface waters, probably related to lower phosphate concentrations in epilimnetic waters of Lake Ontario during the stratified period. Reduced summer P loading may be explained either by a lagged response to P abatement measures that began in the late 1970s or by decreased P loading from upstream Lake Erie beginning in the late 1980s as a result of the establishment of filter-feeding zebra mussels.

J	Farrow, DE				Farrow, Duncan E.			A model for the evolution of the thermal bar system	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS												A new framework for modelling the evolution of the thermal bar system in a lake is presented. The model assumes that the thermal bar is located between two regions: the deeper region, where spring warming leads to overturning of the entire water column, and the near shore shallower region, where a stable surface layer is established. In this model the thermal bar moves out slightly more quickly than predicted by a simple thermal balance. Also, the horizontal extent of the thermal bar region increases as it moves out from the shore.

SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF ARSENIC, BORON, FLUORIDE, AND LEAD IN SURFACE AND GROUNDWATER IN ARUMERU DISTRICT, NORTHERN TANZANIA	FLUORIDE												This study was carried out in Arumeru district, to provide the critically missing information that could aid in the improvement of water quality policies, management practices, and public health protection. The physico-chemical parameters and the fluoride concentration for springs, rivers, lakes, boreholes, and dug wells were determined on 101 samples while the arsenic, boron, and lead concentrations were determined on 90 samples. All data were subjected to cluster analysis and principal components analysis (PCA). Fluoride (F) was found to be high, above the recommended standard, in all the water sources with a median F value of 3 mg/L. The abundance pattern for F was similar to the total dissolved solids (TDS) pattern, of alkaline lakes>dug wells>boreholes>streams>fresh water lakes>springs. The lowest fluoride and TDS values were observed in springs (median F=1.3 mg/l, TDS=145 mg/L) and were attributed to a short water-rock interaction time and to the geology. Some lakes and dug wells were found to have low dissolved oxygen (DO) owing to high organic matter inputs and poor aeration. The highest median F value was found in leeward alkaline lakes (median=260 mg/L) and lowest in windward springs (median=1 mg/L). The fluoride and high TDS values in the water sources were found to be controlled by the geological materials, water-rock interaction time (short in mountainous areas due to a high hydraulic gradient in a slightly fractured formation), and the precipitation levels and evaporation rates which also control the formation and dissolution of salts. Arsenic and lead, which were present in water sources above the recommended standard in 14% of the analysed samples (As: median=0.3 mg/L, Pb: median=0.1 mg/L), were found to have a similar concentration profile. Boron was high and above the recommended standard in one sample only (1.65 mg/L in Lake Big Momella, 1% of the samples). The samples were clustered into 9 groups with the first four clusters characterized by high TDS and fluoride. PCA indicated that TDS, fluoride, boron, arsenic, lead, and pH were the major loading components accounting for 86.9% of the total variance. Spatially, fluoride and boron were associated with lahars, ash, and pyroclastic materials whereas arsenic and lead were associated with pyroclastics and nephelinitic to phonolitic lava. Communities in areas with high levels of these heavy metals are further exposed to health risks, in addition to those of fluoride, when such water is used for drinking. This finding, which has not been previously reported, calls for a detailed assessment to be made of the heavy metals in water used for consumption. Due to the toxicity of arsenic and lead, water sources with a high concentration of these, beyond the recommended standards, should either be treated, before being supplied as drinking water, or completely abandoned.

Here, slackwater paleoflood sediments of the Nalinggele River, the largest river in the Qaidam Basin, were studied with optically stimulated luminescence dating and grain size analysis to reconstruct flood events, mechanisms and their climatic implications. Seven slackwater deposit layers which show a weak hydrodynamic sedimentary environment, were dated to three main flood stages at ca. 3.6-3.4 ka, 2.2 ka and 1.0 ka. These stages correspond to similar millennial-scale flood activities in the basin bordering Kunlun Mountains, millennial-scale humid intervals in the eastern Qaidam Basin, glacial melting events on the Tibetan Plateau, and as well warm intervals between cold ice-rafted debris events in the North Atlantic, which may triggered by and the intensified solar activities. These flood stages were attributed to increased precipitation from the enhanced Asian Summer Monsoon and increased glacial meltwater delivery during the late Holocene. The findings suggest that a climate on the northeastern Tibtean Plateau that was fluctuant and with humid periods during the late Holocene, and not undergoing a constant drying trend as previously understood.					yu, lupeng/AAX-5883-2021; Yang, Xiaoyun/KIG-8148-2024; Lai, Zhongping/KVB-7935-2024	Lai, Zhongping/0000-0002-0139-9346; Yu, LuPeng/0000-0002-3014-705X													1040-6182	1873-4553				NOV 10	2022	637						32	43		10.1016/j.quaint.2022.06.011	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2022.06.011		SEP 2022											WOS:000862821000004

Cyanobacterial blooms: Statistical models describing risk factors for national-scale lake assessment and lake management	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Cyanobacterial toxins constitute one of the most high risk categories of waterborne toxic biological substances. For this reason there is a clear need to know which freshwater environments are most susceptible to the development of large populations of cyanobacteria. Phytoplankton data from 134 UK lakes were used to develop a series of Generalised Additive Models and Generalised Additive Mixed Models to describe which kinds of lakes may be susceptible to cyanobacterial blooms using widely available explanatory variables. Models were developed for log cyanobacterial biovolume. Water colour and alkalinity are significant explanatory variables and retention time and TP borderline significant (R-2-adj = 21.9%). Surprisingly, the models developed reveal that nutrient concentrations are not the primary explanatory variable; water colour and alkalinity were more important. However, given suitable environments (low colour, neutral-alkaline waters), cyanobacteria do increase with both increasing retention time and increasing TP concentrations, supporting the observations that cyanobacteria are one of the most visible symptoms of eutrophication, particularly in warm, dry summers. The models can contribute to the assessment of risks to public health, at a regional- to national level, helping target lake monitoring and management more cost-effectively at those lakes at the highest risk of breaching World Health Organisation guideline levels for cyanobacteria in recreational waters. The models also inform restoration options available for reducing cyanobacterial blooms, indicating that, in the highest risk lakes (alkaline, low colour lakes), risks can generally be lessened through management aimed at reducing nutrient loads and increasing flushing during summer.

J	Yoshimura, M; Isobe, Y; Oishi, T				Yoshimura, Mayumi; Isobe, Yu; Oishi, Tadashi			Comparison of egg period, hatching rate, and first-instar nymphs among three species of stonefly	LIMNOLOGY												Egg period was compared among several temperature conditions (11 degrees C, 16 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 23 degrees C) in Sweltsa sp., Stavsolus japonicus, and Isoperla aizuana (Plecoptera). The shortest mean egg incubation period was 27.8 days at 20 degrees C in Sweltsa sp., 118.1 days at 16 degrees C in Stavsolus japonicus, and 162.0 days at 20 degrees C in Isoperla aizuana on average. Egg hatching rate was also the highest at the water temperature that provided the shortest egg incubation period. Based on laboratory data, eggs of Sweltsa sp. were considered to be deposited in May and hatched in June in the field. Thus, they must have spent the summer as nymphs in the field. Eggs of Stavsolus japonicus and Isoperla aizuana were considered to be deposited in April to May and hatched in September to October in the field. Visible eyes of Stavsolus japonicus and Isoperla aizuana appeared in August. It is likely that the long egg period of Stavsolus japonicus and Isoperla aizuana reflects that these two species spend the summer as dormant eggs in the field.																			1439-8621					AUG	2006	7	2					117	121		10.1007/s10201-006-0171-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-006-0171-3													WOS:000239754000006

Within a given lake, overwinter survival of larvae varied markedly from year to year. Overwinter survival of larvae was excellent in Lake II; in spring 1981, densities were 800-1000 .cntdot. ha-1. In 1982, no larvae overwintered in Lake II, and none overwintered in Lake I in either 1981 or 1982. In May 1981, larvae were large (mean weight of 150 g) and their biomass of 150 kg .cntdot. ha-1 was nearly as large as the maximum biomass of 160 kg .cntdot. ha-1 in late July of larvae from the year''s cohort. This was in contrast with 1982 in Lake II and with both 1981 and 1982 in Lake I when there was an extremely low biomass in the spring, composed of many small larvae. The large larvae that overwintered in Lake II in 1981 did not prey on young-of-the-year larvae; their high densities may have actually reduced invertebrate predation on salamander larvae; in July, larval salamander densities of 5000 .cntdot. ha-1 were the highest measured.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				APR	1988	45	4					691	697		10.1139/f88-083	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f88-083													WOS:A1988N150300014

Variability of protistan and bacterial communities in two Arctic fjords (Spitsbergen)	POLAR BIOLOGY												Krossfjorden and Kongsfjorden are Arctic fjords on the western side of Spitsbergen. These fjords share a common mouth to the open sea, and both are influenced by the input of sediment-rich glacial meltwater leading to decreased surface salinity, increased turbidity and decreased light penetration during summer. Earlier classical taxonomic studies had described the pelagic protistan composition of the Kongsfjorden during summer, revealing the dominance of flagellates of often unresolved taxonomic origin. Only little information existed on microbial eukaryote composition of the Krossfjorden as well as the bacterial composition of both fjords. The aim of the present study was to analyze and compare surface summertime protistan and bacterial communities in both fjords, using molecular approaches (16S and 18S rRNA DGGE, sequencing). Samples were collected three times a week from the central Kongsfjorden over a 1-month period. Additionally, 10 marine and 2 freshwater sites were sampled within a 1-week period in both Kongsfjorden and Krossfjorden. The central Kongsfjorden revealed a relatively stable protistan community over time with dinoflagellates, chlorophytes and small heterotrophs dominating. In contrast, the bacterial community varied over time and appeared to be correlated with the inflow of glacial meltwater. The Kongsfjorden and Krossfjorden were found to harbor distinctive bacterial and eukaryotic communities. We speculate that differences in glacial meltwater composition and fjord bathymetry affect the surface water properties and therefore the observed spatial variability in the community fingerprints.					; Buma, Anita/E-8372-2015; Scheepens, J.F./AAF-7440-2021; Bolhuis, Henk/M-6677-2019; Bolhuis, Henk/H-8535-2014	Scheepens, J.F./0000-0003-1650-2008; Bolhuis, Henk/0000-0002-4772-1898													0722-4060	1432-2056				NOV	2010	33	11					1521	1536		10.1007/s00300-010-0841-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00300-010-0841-9													WOS:000284545700005
J	Prokopkin, IG; Gubanov, VG; Gladyshev, MI				Prokopkin, IG; Gubanov, VG; Gladyshev, MI			Modelling the effect of planktivorous fish removal in a reservoir on the biomass of cyanobacteria	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												In 2002, a "top-down" biomanipulation (reduction of biomass of planktivorous fish Carassius auratus) had been successfully carried out in a small reservoir of the river Bugach (Krasnoyarsk, Russia), after which the cyanobacterial blooming ceased. However, the reservoir ecosystem was absolutely free of Daphnia-the main link of trophic cascade. As supposed, the reduction of blooming was the result of suppression of a direct stimulation effect of planktivorous fish on cyanobacteria, revealed earlier in laboratory experiments. The question arose as to whether the effect of stimulation of cyanobacteria revealed in laboratory may lead to the changes in biomass of cyanobacteria in the reservoir, observed after the biomanipulation. To test this supposition, a mathematical model describing growth of cyanobacteria in the reservoir was developed. The modelling results and field data on biomass of cyanobacteria in summer closely coincided. Modelling calculations showed that direct influence of planktivorous fish could cause the second summer peak of water blooming by Microcystis. On the contrary, removal of crucian carp from the reservoir will not affect the level of water blooming caused by cyanobacteria Anabaena, as this species' growth is not stimulated by fish.

J	Churchill, CJ				Churchill, Christopher John			Spatio-temporal spawning and larval dynamics of a zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) population in a North Texas Reservoir: implications for invasions in the southern United States	AQUATIC INVASIONS												Zebra mussels were first observed in Texas in 2009 in a reservoir (Lake Texoma) on the Texas-Oklahoma border. In 2012, an established population was found in a near-by reservoir, Ray Roberts Lake, and in June 2013, settled mussels were detected in a third north Texas reservoir, Lake Lewisville. An established population was detected in Belton Lake in September 2013. With the exception of Louisiana, these occurrences in Texas mark the current southern extent of the range of this species in the United States. Previous studies indicate that zebra mussel populations could be affected by environmental conditions, especially increased temperatures and extreme droughts, which are characteristic of surface waters of the southern and southwestern United States. Data collected during the first three years (2010-12) of a long-term monitoring program were analyzed to determine if spatio-temporal zebra mussel spawning and larval dynamics were related to physicochemical water properties in Lake Texoma. Reproductive output of the local population was significantly related to water temperature and lake elevation. Estimated mean date of first spawn in Lake Texoma was approximately 1.5 months earlier and peak veliger densities were observed two months earlier than in Lake Erie. Annual maximum veliger density declined significantly during the study period (p < 0.0001). A population crash occurred as a result of thermal stress and variability of lake elevation. In summer 2011, water temperatures peaked at 34.3 degrees C and lake elevation declined to the lowest level recorded during the previous 18 years, which resulted in desiccation of substantial numbers of settled mussels in littoral zones. Veliger spatial distributions were associated with physicochemical stratification characteristics. Veligers were observed in the deepest oxygenated water after lake stratification, which occurred in late spring. Results of this study indicate environmental conditions can influence variability of population sizes and spatial distributions of zebra mussels along the current southern frontier of their geographic range. Although the future population size trajectory and geographic range are uncertain, increased temperatures and intermittent, extreme droughts likely will affect spatio-temporal dynamics of established populations if zebra mussels spread farther into the southern and southwestern United States.																			1798-6540	1818-5487				DEC	2013	8	4					389	406		10.3391/ai.2013.8.4.03	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/ai.2013.8.4.03													WOS:000329280000003
J	Chen, GS; Notaro, M; Liu, ZY; Liu, YQ				Chen, Guang-Shan; Notaro, Michael; Liu, Zhengyu; Liu, Yongqiang			Simulated Local and Remote Biophysical Effects of Afforestation over the Southeast United States in Boreal Summer	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Afforestation has been proposed as a climate change mitigation strategy by sequestrating atmospheric carbon dioxide. With the goal of increasing carbon sequestration, a Congressional project has been planned to afforest about 18 million acres by 2020 in the Southeast United States (SEUS), the Great Lake states, and the Corn Belt states. However, biophysical feedbacks of afforestation have the potential to counter the beneficial climatic consequences of carbon sequestration. To assess the potential biophysical effects of afforestation over the SEUS, the authors designed a set of initial value ensemble experiments and long-term quasi-equilibrium experiments in a fully coupled Community Climate System Model, version 3.5 (CCSM3.5). Model results show that afforestation over the SEUS not only has a local cooling effect in boreal summer [June-August (JJA)] at short and long time scales but also induces remote warming over adjacent regions of the SEUS at long time scales. Precipitation, in response to afforestation, increases over the SEUS (local effect) and decreases over adjacent regions (remote effect) in JJA. The local surface cooling and increase in precipitation over SEUS in JJA are hydrologically driven by the changes in evapotranspiration and latent heat flux. The remote surface warming and decrease in precipitation over adjacent regions are adiabatically induced by anomalous subsidence. Our results suggest that the planned afforestation efforts should be developed carefully by taking account of short-term (local) and long-term (remote) biophysical effects of afforestation.

The taxonomic importance of the apical disc for the discrimination of both taxa was confirmed. The apical disc of E. crassum is rectangular, possessing two deep grooves above the bothriae and 2-16 additional indentations. In E. salvelini, the apical disc is bilobed and bilaterally symmetric. We found new and significant interspecific differences in the length and width of the scolex, the diameter of the apical disc, and the width of the neck, with all measurements being larger in E. crassum. The two species differ in the number and size of the testes (fewer and larger in E. salvelini), the length of the cirrus sac (longer in E. crassum), and the size of vitelline follicles (larger in E. salvelini). Vitelline follicles of E. crassum are always cortical and sometimes enter into the outermost muscle fibres, whereas follicles of E. salvelini are situated largely medullary with few follicles entering between the innermost bundles of muscles. The eggs and the oncospheres of E. salvelini are larger. The embryonic hooks of E. crassum measure 14-18 mum whilst those of E. salvelini are 18-26 mum. For both taxa, the intraspecific variability in morphometric characters was fairly low. The prevalence and intensity of infection of E. crassum and E. salvelini in their respective fish hosts were very high (prevalence 90-94%; mean intensity 36.3 and 6.6, maximums of 172 and 63 tapeworms per fish, respectively). E. salvelini eggs were spontaneously released throughout the year except for winter months: E. crassum laid eggs only in Summer (June-August). Natural infection of copepods with Eubothrium procercoids was very low (prevalence 0.002%).

Studied water parameters were normal except ammonia and dissolved oxygen was higher and lower than the standard value. Sixty-two bacterial isolates were recovered from moribund fish and identified as 31 Vibrio fluvialis, 23 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 8 Staphylococcus aureus isolates. The calculated LD50 of V. fluvialis, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus for D. labrax fingerlings were 4.67 x 10(7), 2.37 x 10(6) and 1.38 x 10(7), respectively. There was a direct correlation between water temperature and mortality rate of fish challenged with V. fluvialis as the mortality rate was 44.44, 50, 66.66, and 83.33% for fish maintained at 27, 30, 33, and 36 degrees C. Plasma cortisol, superoxide dismutase, catalase and malondialdehyde significantly increased when the water temperature exceeded 30 degrees C. The experimentally infected fish showed similar clinical signs and postmortem lesions of naturally diseased fish with no boundary between different pathogens. Antibiogram test indicated that florfenicol was the most effective antibiotic against all the recovered bacterial isolates while all isolates resisted sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. Massive degenerative changes observed in the hepatopancreas, posterior kidney and gill tissues of experimentally infected fish.					; Ali, Nadia/HCI-1712-2022	Ali, Nadia/0000-0003-0970-0014; Salam, Asma/0000-0002-7869-5186														2296-7745				DEC 6	2021	8								717360	10.3389/fmars.2021.717360	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.717360													WOS:000733632100001
J	Orr, PJ				Orr, PJ			Ecospace utilization in early Phanerozoic deep-marine environments: deep bioturbation in the Blakely Sandstone (Middle Ordovician), Arkansas, USA	LETHAIA												Ichnofabric analysis of alternating light and dark-coloured mudstone layers in the Blakely Sandstone (Middle Ordovician) at Crystal Springs Landing, Lake Ouachita (west of Hot Springs, western Arkansas, USA) reveals two equilibrium palaeoichnocoenoses. The first was emplaced under variable, but low, oxygen levels during deposition of the dark-coloured layers; small diameter transition layer burrows overprint a mixed layer ichnofabric. The transition layer infauna was tiered with abundant Chondrites representing the deeper of two shallow tiers. Light-coloured layers accumulated during prolonged intervals in which the sediments were oxygenated to a greater extent and depth. Preservation of a mixed layer ichnofabric within them is the result of limited, but deep (up to at least 400 mm), reworking subsequently in the transition layer by an equilibrium community. These transition layer trace fossils are not tiered. If representative of oxygenated sediment columns in Ordovician deep-marine environments, an extensive volume of infaunal ecospace was colonized (in this case by deposit feeders); its more efficient use subsequently, including vertical partitioning of the infaunal community into specific environmental niches (tiering), could have accommodated increases in diversity and community complexity. Changes over time in the maximum depth to which sediments were bioturbated, alone, would therefore be a poor measure of the extent of ecospace utilization.

J	Liu, HY; Xu, LH; Cui, HT				Liu, HY; Xu, LH; Cui, HT			Holocene history of desertification along the woodland-steppe border in northern China	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												The woodland-steppe ecotone of the southeastern Inner Mongolian Plateau in northern China is located at the northwestern limit of the Pacific monsoon influence, where the landscape may have been a sensitive recorder of past climatic changes. Physical, chemical, and biological analyses of AMS C-14-dated sediment sequences from two lakes of this region were used to reconstruct the Holocene vegetation and desertification history and distinguish four periods: (1) a cold and humid period from 10000 to 8000 C-14 yr B.P., (2) a warm and humid period from 8000 to 5900 C-14 yr B.P., (3) a warm and dry period from 5900 to 2900 C-14 yr B.P., and (4) a cool and dry period from 2900 C-14 yr B.P. to the present. The increased aridity during the middle Holocene was likely caused by increased winter temperatures and enhanced winter evaporation. The transition from a humid to an and climate after similar to5900 C-14 yr B.P. coincided with enhanced aeolian activity, and deciduous woodlands were replaced by pine woodlands and then by steppes in response to the climatic deterioration. These transitions led to the present desertification. The records suggest that a simple association of thermal and moisture conditions, such as warm/wet or cold/dry, may be misleading.

We applied the beach-ridge thickness technique (BTT) and the longshore-bar thickness technique (LTT) to reconstruct the Early Cretaceous palaeowind velocities based on depositional records of Tanan Depression in Northeast Asia. The thickness of beach ridges and nearshore bars is the most important parameter for applying the BTT and the LTT methods. We identified 22 beach ridges and 23 nearshore bars based on drilling cores and wireline-log data in the Tanan Depression. Palaeowind velocities calculated by using the LTT method ranged from 10.84 to 13.66 m/s, showing a narrower range than those calculated by using the BTT method (7.58-15.93 m/s). We further analyzed the underlying factors causing the difference between the results derived from these two methods based on the sedimentary process of the beach ridge and the nearshore bar. The reconstructed wind regime was assumed to be the summer monsoon originating from the Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean before it had been completely enclosed, which provides valuable insight into the understanding of the atmospheric circulation in Northeast Asia during the Early Cretaceous.					; Xue, Xinyu/N-7444-2014	Xue, Xinyu/0000-0001-6882-8144; 													2096-5508	2523-3521				JAN	2025	43	1					41	56		10.1007/s00343-024-3184-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-024-3184-z		JUL 2024											WOS:001280283800003

In freshwater systems, the buoyancy of relatively warm groundwater during the winter months allows for the surface identification of groundwater discharge or thermal pollution using TIR imaging. However, information regarding the performance of TIR for resolving this warm groundwater upwelling is limited, particularly at fine spatial scales and variable discharge rates. In order to evaluate the suitability of TIR to trace warm groundwater upwelling at the water surface of lakes, ponds and reservoirs (e.g. lacustrine groundwater discharge (LGD) in shallow near-shore zones) we conducted a mesocosm experiment with a TIR camera situated 4 m above the water surface to capture thermal patterns in response to different groundwater discharge rates, weather conditions and the diurnal cycle. A fiber optic distributed temperature sensing system (FO-DTS) installed at 2 cm below the water surface was used to ground-truth spatial patterns observed in TIR images. Results show the impacts of both the diurnal cycle of net radiation and prevailing weather conditions on the accuracy of TIR imaging for resolving warm groundwater discharge. Most reliable results were obtained under overcast weather conditions and during the night. The results of our study provide guidance for those looking to use TIR for conducting thermal tracing of LGD at the surface of freshwater bodies during winter.

J	Körner, S; Dugdale, T				Körner, S; Dugdale, T			Is roach herbivory preventing re-colonization of submerged macrophytes in a shallow lake?	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Conference on Limnology of Shallow Lakes	MAY 25-30, 2002	BALATONFURED, HUNGARY	Veszprem Univ, Acad Sci & Dept Limnol, Balaton Linmol Inst Hungarian				Re-establishing a stable submerged vegetation is considered an important tool to restore shallow eutrophic lakes. Enhanced turbidity and sediment re-suspension as well as grazing by waterfowl and rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus L.) have been described to hamper this process in temperate lakes. Lake Muggelsee lost its submerged vegetation following increasing eutrophication in 1970. Re-colonization, mainly with Potamogeton pectinatus L., started in 1990 after reduction of external nutrient loads. Ten years later, plant biomass and colonization depth remained low. Exclosure experiments revealed that fishes contributed to the reduction of P. pectinatus biomass, although rudd were not abundant. Underwater videos showed that the abundant species perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) and roach (Rutilus rutilus L.) plucked on the plants approximately 2 and I times per hour and that bream (Abramis brama L.) mechanically stressed the plants by sucking the surrounding sediment. In laboratory experiments 1+ roach consumed P. pectinatus at a maximum rate of 1.4 mg dw plant g(-1) fw fish d(-1) when discontinuously fed or not fed with zooplankton. When continuously fed with zooplankton, plant biomass was not significantly reduced, independently of the amount fed. Plant material, however, was not found to be a major food item in the guts of roach in the lake. These findings suggest that young roach and perch did not feed on the plants but started plucking leaves during their search for benthic invertebrates during periods of low zooplankton biomass. This prevented P pectinatus from growing to the surface to survive periods with low light availability in summer. The results imply that young roach and perch contribute to a delay in the re-establishment of submerged macrophytes, at least when plants are not growing at an optimum rate due to shading by periphyton and summer cyanobacteria blooms. In this case, biomanipulation of zooplanktivorous fish abundance will not only improve conditions for macrophyte re-colonization due to enhancement of grazing zooplankton but also due to reduced plant plucking.

Islands of water in a sea of dry land: hydrological regime predicts genetic diversity and dispersal in a widespread fish from Australia's arid zone, the golden perch (Macquaria ambigua)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Rivers provide an excellent system to study interactions between patterns of biodiversity structure and ecological processes. In these environments, gene flow is restricted by the spatial hierarchy and temporal variation of connectivity within the drainage network. In the Australian arid zone, this variability is high and rivers often exist as isolated waterholes connected during unpredictable floods. These conditions cause boom/bust cycles in the population dynamics of taxa, but their influence on spatial genetic diversity is largely unknown. We used a landscape genetics approach to assess the effect of hydrological variability on gene flow, spatial population structure and genetic diversity in an Australian freshwater fish, Macquaria ambigua. Our analysis is based on microsatellite data of 590 samples from 26 locations across the species range. Despite temporal isolation of populations, the species showed surprisingly high rates of dispersal, with population genetic structure only evident among major drainage basins. Within drainages, hydrological variability was a strong predictor of genetic diversity, being positively correlated with spring-time flow volume. We propose that increases in flow volume during spring stimulate recruitment booms and dispersal, boosting population size and genetic diversity. Although it is uncertain how the hydrological regime in arid Australia may change under future climate scenarios, management strategies for arid-zone fishes should mitigate barriers to dispersal and alterations to the natural flow regime to maintain connectivity and the species' evolutionary potential. This study contributes to our understanding of the influence of spatial and temporal heterogeneity on population and landscape processes.

In the basins of Lake Banyoles, located in the northeast of Spain, water enters mainly through subterranean springs, and associated fluctuations in the vertical migration of sediment distribution (fluidization events) present episodic behavior as a result of episodic rainfall in the area. The initiation of the fluidization events takes place when the monthly rainfall is similar to 2.7 times greater than the mean monthly rainfall of the rainiest months in the area, especially in spring (April and May), October, and December. The duration of these events is found to be well correlated with the accumulated rainfall of the preceding 10 months before the process initiation. The rainfall, in turn, is mainly associated with six atmospheric circulation patterns among the 19 fundamental circulations that emerged in an earlier study focused on significant rainfall days in Mediterranean Spain. Among them, accentuated surface lows over the northeast of Spain, general northeasterly winds by low pressure centered to the east of Balearic Islands and short baroclinic waves over the Iberian Peninsula, with easterly flows over the northeastern coast of Spain, are found the most relevant atmospheric circulations that drive heavy rainfall events.					; Colomer, Jordi/Y-5386-2018; Serra, Teresa/L-9279-2014	Colomer, Jordi/0000-0002-9330-0269; Soler, Marianna/0000-0001-8422-1609; Romero, Romualdo/0000-0002-9091-8688; Serra, Teresa/0000-0002-6075-5849													0043-1397	1944-7973				JAN 9	2007	43	1							W01404	10.1029/2005WR004810	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2005WR004810													WOS:000243532500002

Analysis of the salt precipitation, geochemical and isotope facies of the water indicates that the water source of Umm Al Heesh is the Paleocene aquifer groundwater, that naturally seeps to the surface through fractures and forms permanent spring lakes. Because of the topography of the dunes, some water from the spring lakes flows out as surface runoff, creating a large temporary puddle lake. The different groundwater flow between these lakes is reflected in their salinity as well as isotope composition (delta 18O and delta 2H). The present study shows that the hydrological configuration with respect to groundwater flow is the predominant factor determining the hydrochemical processes shaping lakes water quality. The continuous interaction between Paleocene aquifer groundwater and lake water is critical to the life and protection of Umm Al Heesh and is determined by a combination of geological, geomorphological, hydrogeological and climatological factors.																			2045-2322					OCT 7	2025	15	1							34850	10.1038/s41598-025-17984-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-17984-1								41057391					WOS:001589752300016

However, detecting key water quality parameters (WQPs) using satellite imagery in small water bodies remains challenging. This study aims to (1) develop regression models for estimating arsenic (As), ammonium (NH4 +), chemical oxygen demand (COD), water hardness expressed as calcium oxide equivalent (CaOeq), and total suspended solids (TSS) using Sentinel-2 imagery and in situ measurements from 2019 to 2021 in Vadkert Lake, Hungary; and (2) assess the spatial and seasonal dynamics of these WQPs by applying the models to Sentinel-2 images from four key dates in 2024. The modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) was applied to isolate water pixels, retaining bands B2 to B8a for their high spatial resolution and relevance. Mean reflectance values around 20 sampling sites were extracted and correlated with measured concentrations of the five WQPs. Stepwise multilinear regression models were developed for As, NH4 +, and COD, which exhibited the strongest correlations with band reflectance (R 2 = 0.91-0.99). These models were applied to four seasonal Sentinel-2 images from 2024 to map the spatial and temporal distribution of the WQPs. Results revealed that As levels peaked in summer (76.8 +/- 20.7 mu g/L) and were spatially uniform, while NH4 + and COD also peaked in summer (0.2 +/- 0.3 mg/L and 7.3 +/- 2.01 mg/L, respectively), with elevated values at the southern and eastern lake margins. These findings show that satellite-based seasonal water quality assessment is feasible in small lakes and supports cost-effective environmental management.

S.; Kalantari, Zahra			Investigating the Impact of Large Lakes on Local Precipitation: Case Study of Lake Urmia, Iran	WATER												Large lakes face considerable challenges due to human activities and climate change, impacting local weather conditions and ecosystem sustainability. Lake Urmia, Iran's largest lake and the world's second-largest saltwater lake, has undergone a substantial reduction in water levels, primarily due to drought, climate change, and excessive irrigation. This study focuses on the potential repercussions on local climate conditions, particularly investigating the impact of moisture sources, evaporation from lake surfaces, and evapotranspiration from agricultural activities, on local convection rainfall. The prevailing westerly winds in the basin suggest a hypothesis that this moisture is transported eastward within the basin, potentially leading to local precipitation as it ascends to higher altitudes near the eastern basin border. To validate this hypothesis, climate data from 1986 to 2017 from the Sarab meteorological station (east of the lake basin, influenced by local precipitation) and Saqez meteorological station (south of the basin, unaffected by local precipitation) were analyzed. The impact of lake water level reduction was assessed by categorizing data into periods of normal lake conditions (1986-1995) and water level reduction (1996-2017). Additionally, the MSWEP global precipitation product was used to examine the precipitation distribution in the entire basin over the entire period and sub-periods. The findings indicate Lake Urmia's significant influence on convective rainfall in the eastern basin, especially during the summer. Despite decreasing lake levels from 1996 to 2017, convective rainfall in the eastern basin increased during the summer, suggesting intensified agricultural irrigation, particularly in hot seasons.

Methods: Water samples from the same source were collected over a period of 3 months (December 2013 to February 2014), and their physicochemical characteristics were determined. The DNA of the samples were extracted and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR products were sequenced by Miseq PE300 pyro sequencing platform. The results for 16S rDNA were analysed using visualization software Gephi, and the 16S rDNA gene pool of known pathogenic bacteria was established. Results: A total of 144,292 16S rDNA gene sequences were obtained and ranked by RDP classifier. The average length of the sequences was 395.66 bp. They revealed 580 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) classified into 16 phyla. A full length of 16S rDNA gene database of common pathogenic bacteria was established. After blasting, 17 species of pathogenic bacteria were found. The most abundant potential human pathogenic bacteria were affiliated to B. tribocorum. Most environmental factors had significant impact on pathogenic bacteria. Conclusion: These results indicate that NGS can be used for the simultaneous detection of most recognized water-borne pathogenic bacteria. Variations in microorganisms in water source at different periods in winter can provide insight into the diversity of microorganisms in the water.																			1596-5996					JUL	2017	16	7					1503	1512		10.4314/tjpr.v16i7.7	http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/tjpr.v16i7.7													WOS:000406948600007
J	STEFAN, HG; FANG, X				STEFAN, HG; FANG, X			MODEL SIMULATIONS OF DISSOLVED-OXYGEN CHARACTERISTICS OF MINNESOTA LAKES - PAST AND FUTURE	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												A deterministic, one-dimensional, unsteady numerical model has been developed, tested, and applied to simulate mean daily dissolved oxygen (DO) characteristics in 27 lake classes in the state of Minnesota. Reaeration and photosynthesis are the oxygen sources, while respiration, sedimentary, and biochemical water column oxygen demand are the sinks of oxygen in the model. The lake classes are differentiated by surface area (A(s)), maximum depth (H(max)), and trophic status expressed as Secchi depth (Z(s)). Because lake stratification is most important to lake oxygen dynamics, simulated DO characteristics are plotted in terms of a stratification parameter A(s)/H(max)0.25 and Secchi depth Z(s). Simulations provide DO profiles on a daily time scale. Specific DO characteristics of ecological and environmental interest are epilimnetic DO, hypolimnetic DO, DO gradient from surface to bottom, and DO minima and maxima. Specific results are as follows: Simulated mean daily and weekly DO values in the epilimnion of all lakes for both past and future climate scenarios are near saturation over the summer season. Hypolimnetic DO values depend strongly on lake morphometry, trophic status, and time throughout the summer season. Future climate conditions are specified as the historical records from 1955 to 1979, adjusted (monthly) by the 2 x CO2 GISS model output to account for doubling of atmospheric CO2. With this climate change, weekly averaged epilimnetic DO is projected to drop by less than 2 mg/liter, and will remain above 7 mg/liter throughout the open water season. The hypolimnetic DO reductions after climate change are on the order of 2-8 mg/liter. Periods of anoxia are longer by as much as 80 days. Those changes would alter water quality dynamics in lakes and have a profound effect on lake ecoystems including indigenous fishes. The results presented are useful for evaluating environmental management options.																			0364-152X					JAN-FEB	1994	18	1					73	92		10.1007/BF02393751	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02393751													WOS:A1994MJ10900007

Long-term field observations have suggested asynchronous shifts in phenology with warming, whereas experimental studies have not been conclusive. Using proxy-based modeling of three trophic levels (algae, herbivores, and fish), we show that asynchronous changes in phenology only occur if warming is seasonally heterogeneous, but not if warming is constant throughout the year. If warming is seasonally heterogeneous, the degree and even direction of asynchrony depends on the specific seasonality of the warming. Conclusions about phenological mismatches in food web interactions may therefore produce controversial results if the analyses do not distinguish between seasonally constant and seasonal specific warming. Furthermore, our results suggest that predicting asynchrony between interacting species requires reliable warming predictions that resolve sub-seasonal time scales.					; Straile, Dietmar/A-4065-2008; Kerimoglu, Onur/E-4953-2013	Kerimoglu, Onur/0000-0003-4289-4404; Straile, Dietmar/0000-0002-7441-8552; 													0012-9658	1939-9170				OCT	2015	96	10					2794	2805		10.1890/14-0839.1.sm	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/14-0839.1.sm								26649399					WOS:000362853600022
J	ROSSI, G; PREMAZZI, G; MARENGO, G				ROSSI, G; PREMAZZI, G; MARENGO, G			CORRELATION OF A LAKE EUTROPHICATION MODEL TO FIELD EXPERIMENTS	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												A vertical box interaction model is applied to a bay of the highly eutrophic Lake Lugano on the Italian-Swiss border, in order to interpret the experimental framework developed by sampling activity and field research during 1981. This bay receives the greatest part of the effluent put into Lake Lugano, after passing through a waste water treamtent plant and being discharged into the bay through one of its tributaries. Particular attention is devoted to the phosphorus cycle in the epilimnion during summer stratification, and to the role played by the organic phosphorus components (dissolved and particulate) in the regeneration process. In fact the operation of the waste water treatment plant has increased the concentration significance of the organic dissolved phosphorus form in the bay, raising the problem of its biological availability. The procedure consists of assessing the transfer coefficients among the various phosphorus forms by means of comparisons between calculated evolution and measured average summer value of the related epilimnetic concentrations. The proposed correlation allows an evaluation of the mean residence time of phosphorus in the various compartments and the total phosphorus turnover time in the ecosystem. A predictive use of the model simulating a reduction of phosphorus loading is also presented.																			0304-3800	1872-7026				DEC	1986	34	3-4					167	189		10.1016/0304-3800(86)90002-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3800(86)90002-5													WOS:A1986G150900002

However, there is a lack of research on the structure of phytoplankton communities and their influencing factors in shallow lakes in Southeast Hubei. In this study, four typical lakes were selected in the summer of 2019, and the phytoplankton community structure and its drivers were investigated for each lake. The results showed that the number of phytoplankton species, dominant species, biomass, and abundance varied among lakes. A comprehensive trophic level index (TLI) assessment showed that Lake Xiandao was oligotrophic, Lake Baoan was light eutrophic, and Lake Wang and Lake Ci were moderate eutrophic. The Shannon-Wiener, Margalef, and Pielou indices showed that the phytoplankton communities of Lake Wang and Lake Ci are less stable, and the water bodies are more severely contaminated. In contrast, the communities of the Lake Baoan and Lake Xiandao are more stable and have superior water quality. A redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that the primary variables influencing phytoplankton community structures were pH and water temperature (WT) (Lake Ci); permanganate index (CODMn) and pH (Lake Xiandao); WT and total nitrogen (TN) (Lake Wang); and WT and total phosphorus (TP) (Lake Baoan).

Six bays of Lake Taupo were sampled in late winter of 1975 and 1976. The profundal fauna comprised Potamopyrgus antipodarum (32.5%), oligochaete worms (26.4%), Chironomus zealandicus (23.1%), other chironomids (0.4%), Pisidium sp. (16.9%), turbellarians (0.6%) and nematodes (0.1%). Differences in percentage species composition between the profundal zone and the transects were due to depth preferences of some species, although the nature of the sediment appeared to influence the distribution of others. The annual mean standing crop of macroinvertebrates in the profundal zone was less than that of the bays.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1981	15	1					41	46		10.1080/00288330.1981.9515895	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1981.9515895													WOS:A1981LQ06500005

Multiple species, including Hydrilla verticillata, Vallisneria natans, Myriophyllum spicatum and Ceratophyllum oryzetorum, were artificially restored in two enclosures that differed in water depth. The multiple species community existed less than a year, but the colonization of Vallisneria natans was successful and reached a biomass of 430.6 g m(-2) in the shallow enclosure after one year of succession. Redundancy analysis indicated that plant biomass was most closely correlated with total nitrogen (TN) concentration of the water column, which is the limiting factor for the trophic state of West Lake. Plant biomass was correlated with water depth, though water transparency reached the bottom. The growth of Potamogeton crispus, a species that spontaneously germinated in the wintering stage, was promoted by the macrophyte species that grew before winter. The microbial community characterized by fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) showed that the proportion of aerobic microbes and fungi in sediment was closely related with macrophyte biomass, which might be a response of the microbial community to the nutrient demand of macrophyte growth. The results implied that restoration of sub-merged macrophytes could be enhanced by artificially supported colonization which further modified the microbial community in the sediment. Although the presence of multiple vegetation species could not be sustained at this time, Vallisneria natans is a suitable pioneer species for large-scale ecological engineering in West Lake.

Interviews of Mongolian herders and high resolution precipitation data reveal an increase in short heavy rains and thunderstorm activity in semi-arid Mongolia	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Increases in extreme record-breaking daily precipitation events have accompanied warming temperatures causing increased flooding in many areas of the World, but are not well documented for arid and semi-arid regions. In semi-arid Mongolia where warming has been over 2(o) C from 1940 to 2008, nomadic herders described their concerns over an increase in the number of hot days and a shift from multi-day gentle rains to heavy rains lasting less than one hour that damage their pastures, animals, gers and people, suggesting a transition from stratiform rains to convective storms. The brief intense rains are not seen in daily precipitation data typically reported by meteorological stations, and here the correlation between fine-scale rainfall readings and thunderstorm activity were used to hind cast brief heavy rains. From 2008 to 2012, an automated weather station in Dalbay Valley at Lake Hovsgol, Mongolia, recording at 5-min intervals, detected at least 40 heavy sub-daily summer rains each lasting less than 40 min. Heavy rains in Dalbay were correlated with thunderstorm activity and were 2.5 times more likely to occur when thunderstorms were reported within the previous 24 h at the Hatgal meteorological station (80 km to the southwest of Dalbay) than when no thunderstorms were reported. Daily thunderstorm frequency, recorded at nearby meteorological stations from 1960 to 2012, has increased and thus supports herders' perceptions that the frequency of the short heavy rains have increased. Without high temporal resolution data for precipitation, such as those we report in this study, it is impossible detect shifts in summer rain types, which have many implications in theory and practice.

Criteria for diagnosis of asthma, EIB and AHR for athletes: lessons from the Olympic Games	DIAGNOSIS, PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF EXERCISE-RELATED ASTHMA, RESPIRATORY AND ALLERGIC DISORDERS IN SPORTS	European Respiratory Monograph											A history of symptoms of asthma in an elite athlete is not a reliable indicator of the need for treatment with a beta(2)-agonist. Requesting an athlete to demonstrate either a response to a bronchodilator or an exercise test that reproduced the reason for use of a beta(2)-agonist seemed the best approach to approve the use of a beta(2)-agonist. For the Winter Games in Salt Lake City (UT, USA), laboratory-based tests were also suggested by the independent panel of the International Olympic Committee Medical Commission and included exercise, eucapnic voluntary hyperpnoea and methacholine challenge, and for Athens (Greece), hypertonic saline. Selecting realistic cut-off points to physical and pharmacological challenges, whilst permitting both types of test to be used, aimed at a high specificity for the diagnosis of asthma or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. This approach meant the athlete could have confidence that asthma treatment was either appropriate or insufficient. Many athletes had only a past history (not current) of asthma. There was no evidence that athletes being treated with asthma drugs not requiring approval (inhaled corticosteroids, cromoglycate, nedocromil sodium, leukotriene antagonist), but whose application to use a beta(2)-agonist was rejected, had any difficulties at either Salt Lake City or Athens. The submissions did not suggest that the athletes were at risk of inadequate management of asthma. Simplifying the challenges to a single cut-off point of a 12% fall in forced expiratory volume in one second for all the tests would have advantages and disadvantages. The major disadvantage is that procedures and guidelines for asthma are built on years of practice and data collection, and to move away from them is not advisable. More importantly, it would be a disadvantage to those who have exercise-related changes in lung function, which is the most important indication to seek approval to use a beta(2)-agonist before a sporting event. In contrast, an increase >12% of either baseline or predicted seems appropriate to define a positive bronchodilator response in athletes.																			2075-6674		978-1-904097-87-7				2005		33					48	66																WOS:000292955000007
J	Li, Y; Peng, SM; Hao, L; Zhou, XR; Li, HY				Li, Yu; Peng, Simin; Hao, Lu; Zhou, Xueru; Li, Haiye			Interactions of the Westerlies and Asian Summer Monsoon Since the Last Deglaciation in the Northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau	PALEOCEANOGRAPHY AND PALEOCLIMATOLOGY												The Asian summer monsoon (ASM), controlled by tropical ocean-atmosphere systems, and the westerlies, directly linked to high-latitude climates, interact in mid-latitude East Asia. Located at a climate junction, the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) is a sensitive zone for the interaction of the westerlies and ASM. In the current work, we present a new loess data set from the northeastern QTP since the last deglaciation, including grain size, stable isotope (delta C-13(org) and delta O-18(carb)), total organic carbon, total nitrogen, magnetic susceptibility, and mineral composition. The PMIP3-CMIP5 multi-model ensemble and TraCE-21ka transient simulation are used synthetically to analyze climate mechanisms. All proxies suggest instable glacial climate and stable interglacial climate in the northeastern QTP. The coarser grain size during the last deglaciation compared with the Holocene reflects intensified westerlies controlled by the weakening of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and existing ice sheets. More positive delta O-18(carb) values during abrupt cooling events [Heinrich event 1 (H1) and the Younger Dryas (YD)] indicate the effect of a weakened monsoon triggered by the low-latitude solar insolation and sea surface temperature. Therefore, the anti-phase pattern between the ASM and westerlies is the primary reason for differences in climate stability. Moreover, low temperature favors the predomination of C-3 plants and the development of permafrost, leading to more negative delta C-13(org) values and fine grain size during the H1 and YD. Taken together, the anti-phase relationship between the westerlies and ASM emphasizes the complicated dynamic characteristics of atmospheric systems in the mid-latitudes and the challenges for future predictions.

From an analysis of the lithology and pollen assemblages, combined with radiocarbon dating of extracted pollen and OSL dating of extracted quartz, we concluded the following: JLT(d) was continuously occupied by lakes since 85 ka; however, DK(u), the neighboring sub-uplift, was covered by lakes during 80-74 ka, 50-44 ka, 32.5-27.5 ka and < 13 ka, and covered by sand during 44-32.5 ka and 27.5-13 ka. The evidence from lithology and dating results supports the occurrence of lakes on DK(u) during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3. Evidence from shorelines, previously published cores, and the sedimentary and chronological evidence presented in this paper indicate the occurrence of a sub-humid environment, characterized by the occurrence of lakes separated by dunes, in the Jilantai Basin during MIS 3. However, further work is needed to understand the environmental significance of the co-existence of lakes and dunes during MIS 3, although a sub-humid climate background during MIS 3 is supported by well-dated geological archives along the western front of the present-day Asian Summer Monsoon domain and its eastern extensional area.						, Yuxin/0000-0003-2005-4236; Huang, Xiaozhong/0000-0002-2127-0451													1367-9120	1878-5786				OCT 1	2017	147						178	192		10.1016/j.jseaes.2017.07.012	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jseaes.2017.07.012													WOS:000413125600014

The organic phase was separated, the excess of iodine was extracted into an aqueous iodide solution as triiodide and the absorbance of the liberated triiodide was measured at 350 nm. The calibration plot obtained for thiosulfate did not form a linear graph and was not affected by a change in the volume of 10 to 27 cm(3) of the sample solution. The proposed method could be applied to the determination of thiosulfate in the concentration ranges 5x10(-7)-3.4x10(-5) moldm(-3) (0.056-3.81 ppm) for a 10 cm(3) thiosulfate solution and 1.9x10(-7)-1.36x10(-5) moldm(-3) (0.021-1.52 ppm) for a 25 cm(3) thiosulfate solution. Good recoveries of thiosulfate from hot-spring and lake-water samples, to which various known amounts of thiosulfate had been added, was achieved and the relative standard deviation was 0.86% at the 5.42x10(-6) moldm(-3) (0.608 ppm) thiosulfate level when applied to a hot-spring sample.																			0009-2673					JAN	1994	67	1					119	124		10.1246/bcsj.67.119	http://dx.doi.org/10.1246/bcsj.67.119													WOS:A1994MV90800020
J	Burnette, MC; Genereux, DP; Birgand, F				Burnette, Matthew C.; Genereux, David P.; Birgand, Francois			In-situ falling-head test for hydraulic conductivity: Evaluation in layered sediments of an analysis derived for homogenous sediments	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The hydraulic conductivity (K) of streambeds is a critical variable controlling interaction of groundwater and surface water. The Hvorslev analysis for estimating K from falling-head test data has been widely used since the 1950s, but its performance in layered sandy sediments common in streams and lakes has not previously been examined. Our numerical simulations and laboratory experiments show that the Hvorslev analysis yields accurate K values in both homogenous sediment (for which the analysis was originally derived) and layered deposits with low-K sand over high-K sand. K from the Hvorslev analysis deviated significantly from true K only when two conditions were present together: (1) high K sand was present over low-K sand, and (2) the bottom of the permeameter in which K was measured was at or very near the interface between high-K and low-K. When this combination of conditions exists, simulation and laboratory sand tank results show that in-situ Hvorslev K underestimates the true K of the sediment within a permeameter, because the falling-head test is affected by low-IC sediment outside of (below the bottom of) the permeameter. In simulation results, the maximum underestimation (occurring when the bottom of the permeameter was at the interface of high K over low K) was by a factor of 0.91, 0.59, and 0.12 when the high-K to low-K ratio was 2, 10, and 100, respectively. In laboratory sand tank experiments, the underestimation was by a factor of about 0.83 when the high-K to low-IC ratio was 2.3. Also, this underestimation of K by the Hvorslev analysis was about the same whether the underlying low-K layer was 2 cm or 174 cm thick (1% or 87% of the domain thickness). Numerical model simulations were useful in the interpretation of in-situ field K profiles at streambed sites with layering; specifically, scaling the model results to the maximum measured K at the top of the field K profiles helped constrain the likely ratio of high K to low K at field locations with layered heterogeneity. Vertical K values are important in field studies of groundwater-surface water interaction, and the Hvorslev analysis can be a useful tool, even in layered media, when applied carefully.

Additionally, biological response was modeled in the eutrophic Lake Ringsjon. The results are compared with similar studies on other catchments. All scenarios gave similar impact on water quality but varied in quantities. However, one scenario resulted in a different transport pattern due to less-pronounced seasonal variations in the hydrology. On average, the study shows that, in a future climate, we might expect: i) increased concentrations of nitrogen in the arable root zone (+50%) and in the river (+13%); ii) increased annual load of nitrogen from land to sea (+22%) due to more pronounced winter high flow; moreover, remote areas in the catchment may start to contribute to the outlet load; iii) radical changes in lake biochemistry with increased concentrations of total phosphorus (+50%), total nitrogen (+20%), and planktonic algae such as cyanobacteria (+80%).

J	Brown, PJ; Josephson, DC; Krueger, CC				Brown, PJ; Josephson, DC; Krueger, CC			Summer habitat use by introduced smallmouth bass in an oligotrophic Adirondack lake	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Non-native smallmouth bass became established in 1951 in Little Moose Lake, an oligotrophic Adirondack lake. Salmonids dominated the littoral zone at the time. Snorkel surveys, from late June through early August 1997, were used to determine the distribution and abundance of fish in the littoral zone. Transects were established on four habitat types: sand, wood (submerged trees), rock covered by silt (particles <2 mm), and clean cobble (particles >64 mm). Non-native smallmouth bass were the most common fish species observed over the transects. Counts of adult smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) were greater than pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) and salmonids. Average lengths of bass were different between habitat types indicating size class segregation among the habitats in the littoral zone. Adult bass (>50 mm) were only observed on wood and cobble habitats. Nearly all bass >300 mm were observed on wood habitats. Young-of-year bass (<50 mm) were only observed on sand and silted rock. Only two brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and three rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were observed; however, water temperature (range 21 degrees C to 24 degrees C) may have limited their presence. We conclude that non-native smallmouth bass dominate the littoral zone of this Adirondack lake during the summer.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				JUN	2000	15	2					135	144		10.1080/02705060.2000.9663731	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2000.9663731													WOS:000086998700001

This study aims to understand the characteristics of Ranu Klakah surface sediments through rock magnetism and geochemical analyses. Tests were conducted on 16 sample points derived from surface sediments in the lake and springs around the lake. The results of rock magnetism analysis in Ranu Klakah surface sedi-ments showed the presence of magnetite and titanomagnetite minerals. This is supported by XRD (X-Ray Diffraction) analysis, where the minerals magnetite, albite, and illite were found in sediments from inside the lake and springs around the lake. From the combined results of these two methods, it was concluded that the surface sediments in Ranu Klakah have pseudo-single-domain magnetite minerals type that originated from the weathering of rocks around the lake and there has been no diagenesis of the surface sediments in the lake due to the absence of results showing mineral changes in the samples tested					Bijaksana, Satria/I-4683-2013														0353-4529	1849-0409					2025	40	4					31	43		10.17794/rgn.2025.4.3	http://dx.doi.org/10.17794/rgn.2025.4.3													WOS:001569302300003

In order to know the degree of its quality, the identification of polluting sources has been performed, which in turn will enable the necessary steps to be taken by the management of RWC `Gjakova' for their isolation. Also, to complete the study, research was done on heavy metals and other nutrients, in all sampling sites, and especially where there are significant sources of surface water pollution, as a result of human activity and discharge of untreated urban waters. So, the focus or purpose of the research is to reflect the situation as realistically as possible and this was done by determining the bacteria by the membrane filter method by counting the colonies in Petri dishes with VRB-agar, M-Endo Agar Less, CCA.

A thermal bar is a narrow zone in a lake where the water, which has a maximum density, sinks from the surface to the bottom. Numerical modeling of the dynamics of plankton ecosystems is implemented using the nutrient - phytoplankton - zooplankton - detritus model of Parker (1991). The hydrodynamic model, which takes into account an effect of the Coriolis force, is written in the Boussinesq approximation with the continuity, momentum, energy, and salinity equations. The data obtained in numerical experiments show a good agreement with that of Holland et al. (2003). Simulation results demonstrate that the maximum concentrations of phytoplankton are in the thermoactive (the inshore side of a thermal bar) region of the lake. Calculations under variable temperature conditions of the Thompson River show that the warm river waters facilitate a rapid growth of the phytoplankton and leads to a significant reduction of the nutrient in this area. However, these thermal boundary conditions have a little impact on the changes in zooplankton and detritus biomass.

Disking alone caused an initial reduction of greater than 75% torpedograss in rhizome biomass, and rhizome biomass remained reduced after 1 year by 26% and 44% in 1990 and 1991, respectively. Glyphosate application rates of 1.13, 2.26, and 4.52 kg/ha provided the same level of control regardless of when it was applied or whether the chemical treatment followed disking. Following burning and disking, shoot biomass increased continuously over the 750-day study period. After an initial decrease in rhizome biomass following burning and disking (greater reduction in disked rhizomes), a slight recovery occurred to 20% of the original biomass and then remained constant. The amount of nonstructural carbohydrate in rhizomes increased in the fall suggesting that later herbicide applications might have increased efficacy. Based on these data a single application of glyphosate would provide the best control if applied in the late-fall prior to cold temperatures.																			0146-6623					JAN	1993	31						199	202																WOS:A1993MU07900044

Growth of the pre-formed shoot that emerges from the tuber is remarkably tolerant to anoxia, with elongation of the stem occurring faster when oxygen is absent. This response, which allows the shoot to reach oxygenated waters, occurs despite a 69-81% reduction in the rate of ATP production, and it is underpinned by several physiological and metabolic adaptations that contribute to efficient energy usage. First, extension of the pre-formed shoot is the result of cell expansion, without the accumulation of new cellular material. Secondly, after over-wintering, the tuber and pre-formed shoot have the enzymes necessary for a rapid fermentative response at the onset of growth under anoxia. Thirdly, the incorporation of [S-35] methionine into protein is greatly reduced under anoxia. The majority of the anoxically synthesized proteins differ from those in aerobically grown tissue, implying an extensive redirection of protein synthesis under anoxia. Finally, anoxia-induced cytoplasmic acidosis is prevented to an unprecedented degree. The adaptations of this anoxia-tolerant plant tissue emphasize the importance of the mechanisms that balance ATP production and consumption in the absence of oxygen.

These values were similar to levels observed in other limed and circumneutral Adirondack lakes, which collectively support a limited range of biomass (10-20 kg .cntdot. ha-1) and production (7-16 kg .cntdot. ha-1) compared with more fertile waters in other regions. The estimated level of food consumption required to maintain initial production rates observed in the two lakes was 80-100 kg .cntdot. ha-1. This level of predation was sufficient to significantly after the size structure and composition of the invertebrate prey community within a few months after stocking. However, mean production efficiency in these populations remained at levels of 20-25% and the development of adverse water quality conditions in the first year after liming appeared to be of greater significance than food limitation in regulating production and biomass of these stocked brook trout populations. Reacidification of one lake 5 mo after liming resulted in rapid declines in biomass and production as a result of both increased mortality and reduced growth.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				FEB	1989	46	2					333	341		10.1139/f89-044	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f89-044													WOS:A1989T286700021

We discuss biological production and sources, the transition from marine to brackish and lacustrine environments in the lakes, paleoenvironmental changes, transition ages, and relative sea level (RSL) falls (or subsidence) from glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) in the Soya Coast region. The ages of the Maruwanminami-ike (MwS4C-01, length 147 cm) and Maruwan-oike sediment cores (Mw4C-01, length 226 cm) were 1.4 (5.8 cm core depth)-4.9 and 2.3-5.7 cal ker BP, respectively. The local reservoir effects of the Rundv & aring;gshetta lakes were very high, possibly because of the influence of dead carbon in the glacially eroded marine sediments and bed rock. The coastal marine environments of Lakes Maruwanminami-ike (4.9-2.6 cal ker BP) and Maruwan-oike (5.7-3.3 cal ker BP) were characterized by low biological production. A transition period marked by a stratified brackish lake environment in Lakes Maruwanminami-ike (2.6-2.4 cal ker BP) and Maruwan-oike (3.3-2.9 cal ker BP) was characterized by stratified conditions with an anoxic layer at the bottom of the photic zone. The freshwater lake environment of Lake Maruwanminami-ike [(65.6-0 cm, 2.4-1.4 (5.8 cm core depth) cal kyr BP)] was characterized by high biological (cyanobacteria and green algae) production, while that of Lake Maruwan-oike (2.9-2.3 cal ker BP) was characterized by low biological production due to the influence of glacial clay. Around 7.2-3.0 cal ka BP in the Holocene was probably a warm period, and progressive glacial retreat with RSL fall occurred during the warm periods in the Soya Coast region. The RSL falls of all raised beaches and isolated basins in the Soya Coast region ranged from 0.36 f 0.03-4.4 f 0.5 mm/yr with an average 2.1 f 0.2 mm/yr (standard deviation, SD). They were similar to GNSS-based GIA-induced uplift with an average of 2.4 f 1.5 mm/yr (SD) at Soya Coast region.

Two contentious issues are the timing of colonization of the Bering Land Bridge and origin of Clovis, which at 13,000 calendar years ago is the earliest unequivocal complex of archaeological sites in temperate North America, known by its specialized fluted spear points. One hypothesis is that fluting technology emerged in Beringia and from there was carried southbound, with fluted points becoming the diagnostic "calling card" of early Paleoindians spreading across the Western Hemisphere. Fluted points have long been known from Alaska, yet until now they have never been found in a datable geologic context, making their relationship to Clovis a mystery. Here we show that a new archaeological site at Serpentine Hot Springs, Bering Land Bridge National Preserve, Alaska, contains fluted points in a stratified geologic deposit dating to no earlier than 12,400 calendar years ago. Our results suggest that Alaska's fluted-point complex is too young to be ancestral to Clovis, and that it instead represents either a south-to-north dispersal of early Americans or transmission of fluting technology from temperate North America. These results suggest that the peopling of the Americas and development of Paleoindian technology were much more complex than traditional models predict. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The HgT concentration shows a significant fluctuation while the levels of the three bio-essential elements remain almost constant. The rise and fall of the HgT concentration in the seal hairs are found to be closely coincided with ancient activities of gold and silver mining using Hg-amalgamation process around the world, especially in the Southern Hemisphere. Briefly, HgT levels are high during five episodes of extensive gold and silver mining activities-Rome Empire and China Han Dynasty (similar to 18-300 A.D.), Maya period and China Tang (750-900 A.D.), Incas civilization and Christian Kingdom (1200-1500 A.D.), New world (1650-1800 A.D.), and modem industry period (1840 A.D.-present); they are low during four time periods of reduced gold and silver mining activities-the China Han and Rome fall (since 300 A.D.), Maya fall and War-time period in China (1050-1250 A.D.), Pizarro coming (ca. 1532 A.D.) and Independence War of South America (1800-1830 A.D.). Two profiles of HgT in other two lake cores, one affected by seal excrements and the other by penguin droppings, from the same region are similar to the one in seal hairs. The Hg concentration profile in the seal hairs is significantly correlated with the one in a peat bog of Southern Chile near King George Island. Since Hg is existent mainly at the form of methyl-mercury in seal hairs, this correlation supports a relationship and link between atmospheric mercury concentration and methyl-mercury production. Comparing with samples from American and European continents, the Antarctic seal hairs provide an archive of total mercury concentration in surface seawater of the South Ocean less affected by regional human activities, and this archive may provide a good reference for assessing the global Hg emissions, depositions and recycling in the past thousand years.

J	Uri, ND				Uri, ND			Agriculture and the environment - The problem of soil erosion	JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE												Soil erosion has both on-farm and off-farm impacts. Reduction of soil depth can impair the land's productivity, and the transport of sediments can degrade streams, lakes, and estuaries. Since 1933, soil conservation policies have existed in the United States. Originally they focused on the on-farm benefits of keeping soil on the land and increasing net farm income. Beginning in the 1980s, however, policy goals increasingly included reductions in off-site impacts of erosion. As a consequence of conservation efforts associated with explicit U.S. government policies, total soil erosion between 1982 and 1992 was reduced by 32 percent and the sheet and rill erosion rate fell from an average of 4.1 tons per acre per year in 1982 to 3.1 tons per acre in 1992 while the wind erosion rate fell from an average of 3.3 tons per acre per year to 2.4 tons per acre per year over the same period. Still, soil erosion is imposing substantial social costs. These costs are estimated to be about $37.6 billion annually. To further reduce soil erosion and thereby mitigate its social costs, there are a number of policy options available to induce farmers to adopt conservation practices including education and technical assistance, financial assistance, research and development, land retirement, and regulation and taxes.																			1044-0046						2000	16	4					71	94		10.1300/J064v16n04_07	http://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J064v16n04_07													WOS:000089174300006
J	Bai, Y; Gao, JH; Zhang, Y				Bai, Yu; Gao, Jinhua; Zhang, Ying			Research on wind-induced nutrient release in Yangshapao Reservoir, China	WATER SUPPLY												Nutrient (total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP)) are considered the major indicators to be impacted by wind speed in shallow lakes and reservoirs. As a reservoir situated in Jilin Province, China, Yangshapao Reservoir has been employed for irrigation and urban water use. After 2 years' observation carried out on water quality and wind speed, it was found that the TN, NH4 and TP are significantly correlated with the bottom shear stress attributed to wind, whereas the dissolved phosphorus (DP) is not. Bottom shear stress is also noticeably associated with dissolved oxygen (DO), thus promoting nutrient release into the water body. In winter, ice can effectively inhibit the wind-induced shear stress, and the TP concentration is evidently lower than in the other seasons. This scenario should be considered in the management of the water quality of the lake and similar lakes.																			1606-9749	1607-0798				MAR	2020	20	2					469	477		10.2166/ws.2019.180	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/ws.2019.180													WOS:000538126000010

Knowledge of the occurrence of major ions and trace metals in the snow in the megacity of Istanbul is very limited. This manuscript attempts to understand the origin of major soluble ions (fluoride, acetate, formate, chlorite, chloride, nitrite, chlorate, bromide, nitrate, sulfate, phosphate, and perchlorate) and some trace metals (Fe, Mn, Cd, Co, Ni, Pb, Zn, Cu) in winter surface snow, collected in Istanbul, Turkey. The sampling of the surface snow was conducted after each precipitation during the winter of 2015-2016 at three sites in the city. Besides the statistical evaluation of the major ions, and some trace metal concentrations, the chemical variations along with atmospheric circulations, which are important modification mechanisms that influence the concentrations, were investigated in the study. At examined locations and times, 12 major anions were investigated and in these anions fluoride, chlorite, chlorate, bromide, and perchlorate in the snow samples were below the detection limit; only SO42-, NO3-, and CI- were found to be in the range of 1.11-17.90, 0.75-4.52, and 0.19-3.01 mg/L. Also, according to the trace element determination, the concentration was found to be 29.2-53.7, 2.0-16.1, 1.0-2.2, 50.1-71.1, 24.2-35.2, ND-7.9, 43.2-106.6, and 3.0-17.7 mu g/L for Fe, Mn, Cd, Co, Ni, Pb, Zn, and Cu, respectively. The major anions and investigated trace elements here originated mainly from anthropogenic and atmospheric circulation and mainly influenced by northerly and southerly circulation patterns.

The high-elevated northeastern Tibetan Plateau, located in between, is likely influenced by the interactions of both circulation systems. Here, we attempt to use biomarkers, n-alkanes and alkenones, to reconstruct Holocene lake-level changes at Lake Gahai in the Qaidam Basin. We choose a sediment core drilled at the lake shore, where biomarkers would be sensitive to lake-level changes. The n-alkane records show high average chain length (ACL), high carbon preference index (CPI), and low proportion of aquatic macrophyte (P-aq) values at 7-2 kyr (thousand calibrated years ago) with peaked values around 6 kyr, whereas low ACL, low CPI, and high P-aq values occurred after 2 kyr and before 7 kyr. No alkenones were detected at 7-2 kyr, suggesting that lake level at this period was incapable of constantly reaching to the coring site. Therefore, combined results provide unambiguous evidence of relatively low lake level at 7-2 kyr, probably lowest at similar to 6 kyr. Holocene lake-level changes in this marginal region thus display a different pattern from either of the core regions dominated by the westerlies (anti-phase) and the Asian summer monsoon (out-of-phase). We suggest that in the arid marginal region, temperature-induced evaporation could significantly affect regional hydrological balance, resulting in the discrepancy with the Holocene long-term precipitation decreasing trend in Asian monsoon-dominated regions.

The study sites ranged across several community types. G. maritima was found in all sites but varied as to its ecological importance in these communities. Sixteen soil factors were measured relative to the stands studied. Cover of G. maritima correlated with parts per million Na and total soluble salts in the soil. No other factors correlated significantly with the cover of G. maritima. G. maritima occupied only those sites with high levels of moisture throughout the growing season. The high moisture levels came from springs, seeps, elevated water tables, and early seasonal inundation. High levels of G. maritima cover corresponded to low numbers of species in the habitat.																			0017-3614						1984	44	2					299	309																WOS:A1984TA27300011
J	CIEPIELEWSKI, W				CIEPIELEWSKI, W			POPULATION OF PIKE (ESOX-LUCIUS L) IN POND TYPE LAKE WARNIAK IN 1969-1978	EKOLOGIA POLSKA-POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												In 1969-1978 observations were carried out on an intensively exploited pike population in the shallow Lake Warniak (a natural pond). A special seine net was constructed. The catches were made 3 times in the autumn of each year. The numbers of fish caught and their mean weights are given. The data show that a catastrophic reduction of the pike population took place in 1977 and 1978. Pike mainly of the size class 34-42 cm were caught and were usually 2-3 yr old. Detailed numbers of each age group, obtained in autumn catches, were used to estimate minimal numbers (NmT) of particular annuals occuring in the lake before the autumn catches and to estimate the virtual populations. The numbers of virtual populations (VT) were obtained. These estimations do not include age group I. The year classes differed over 4 times in numbers. Biomass [B], production [P], and P:.hivin.B were calculated. Biomass .hivin.B of pike in Lake Warniak fluctuated from 10.0-40.6 kg ha-1 yr-1. P in years, when 2-3 yr old fish dominated in the caught population, was high and even exceeded the mean biomass. P:.hivin.B was the lowest in years when populations consisted of few numerous year classes (e.g., 1975 - P:.hivin.B = 0.47). The sex ratio in dominant age groups of the population (II, III, IV) was estimated as 1:1. In older, non-numerous age groups, the females prevailed. In 1969-1976 pike populations in Lake Warniak had on the average 66,000-206,000 eggs/ha. Not many individuals survive to the age of 2 yr. During the period examined this age was attained by 0.019-1.3.permill. of the numbers of eggs in a given class. The change of living conditions of the pike, caused by the disappearance of submerged vegetation, was probably the main reason for the catastrophic decrease in population numbers. It seems that even without exploitation, population numbers of pike would be reduced. Young classes lacking sufficient vegetation in the shallow littoral would be subject to greater pressure of predators. Intense exploitation only accelerated the process of pike disappearance. In lakes of a natural pond type with a bottom overgrown with submerged vegetation the intensively caught pike populations were sufficiently numerous for the appearance, under favorable conditions, of a strong year class from the egg deposits. The present decrease in catches of pike all over Poland cannot be explained only by the increasing intensity of catches of this predator. The worsening of reproduction conditions and the advancing eutrophication of small water bodies are probably the main causes for the decrease of pike population in Poland. Intense stocking of small lakes with phytophagous fish and carp, as is the case of Lake Warniak, may cause changes in the lake biocenosis and the disappearance of pike and other autochthonous species (tench and crucian carp). These phenomena can be controlled.																			0070-9557						1981	29	1					35	51																WOS:A1981PH85800002

Origins and transformations of dissolved organic matter in large Arctic rivers	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Arctic river watersheds are important components of the global climate system and show an amplified response to climate change. Here, we characterize origins and transformations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in five major Arctic rivers (Kolyma, Lena, Yenisei, Ob, Mackenzie) over 3 years with seasonal sampling periods using measurements of carbohydrates, amino acids, bacterial biomarkers (D-amino acids), and plant protein biomarkers (hydroxyproline). A strong seasonal cycle of bioavailable DOM export was observed that correlated with discharge, vegetation, river morphology and water residence time. The chemical composition of bioavailable DOM was different among rivers reflecting unique characteristics of Arctic river watersheds. Trends in specific bacterial biomarkers were synchronous to changes in bacterial community compositions demonstrating that bacterial communities responded to the seasonal shifts in organic matter quality and chemical composition. Extensive heterotrophic processing of plant and soil-derived DOM resulted in major inputs of bacterial detritus, and bacterial organic matter accounted for 21-42% of DOC in all watersheds. Dissolved organic nitrogen sources were dominated by bacterially-derived nitrogen and important contributions of soluble plant protein during the Spring freshet. Overall, our results demonstrated the importance of watershed characteristics and bacterial metabolism in regulating DOM composition, reactivity and carbon fluxes in Arctic river watersheds.

To test this assumption, we investigated the vertical and temporal distribution of microbial heterotrophs and of autotrophic picoplankton throughout the water column of the meromictic coastal lake Faro (Sicily, Italy), in the summer of 2004, coinciding with a bloom of brown-colored green sulfur bacteria. We also assessed the grazing impact of ciliated and flagellated protozoa within the sulfur bacteria plate using a modification of the fluorescently labeled bacteria uptake approach, attempting to minimize the biases intrinsic to the technique and to preserve the in situ anoxic conditions. Significant correlations were observed between ciliate biomass and bacteriochlorophyll e concentration, and between heterotrophic nanoflagellate biomass and chlorophyll a concentration in the water column. The major predators of anaerobic picoplankton were pleuronematine ciliates and cryptomonad flagellates, with clearances of 26.6 and 9.5 nL per cell h(-1), respectively, and a cumulative impact on the picoplankton gross growth rate ranging between 36% and 72%. We concluded that protozoan grazing channels a large proportion of anaerobic picoplankton production to higher trophic levels without restraining photosynthetic bacteria productivity.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC AND EVOLUTIONARY MICROBIOLOGY												A novel sulfur-oxidizing bacterium designated strain mst6(T) was isolated from spring water of Masutomi hot spring in Japan. The cells were rod-shaped (1.2-4.0 x 0.5-0.7 mm) and Gram-stain-negative. The G+C content of genomic DNA was around 52.6 mol%. The isolate possessed summed feature 3 (C-16 : 1 omega 7c and/or C-16 : 1 omega 6c), C-16 : 0 and C-12 : 0 as major cellular fatty acids. Strain mst6(T) grew by inorganic carbon fixation and oxidation of inorganic sulfur compounds with oxygen as an electron acceptor. The isolate grew over a temperature range of 5-34 degrees C, a NaCl concentration range of 0-110 mM and a pH range of 4.6-8.1. Optimum growth occurred at 32 degrees C, in the absence of NaCl and at pH 5.9-6.2. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain mst6(T) belongs to the family Sulfuricellaceae in the class Betaproteobacteria. The closest cultured relative was Sulfuriferula multivorans TTNT with a 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 97.0 %. On the basis of the data obtained in this study, strain mst6(T) represents a novel species of the genus Sulfuriferula, for which the name Sulfuriferula thiophila sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is mst6(T) (=NBRC 111150(T) =DSM 101871(T)).

Nitrate reduction mechanisms and rates in an unconfined eogenetic karst aquifer in two sites with different redox potential	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												This study integrates push-pull tracer tests (PPTT) with microbial characterization of extracted water via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and reverse transcriptase qPCR (RT-qPCR) of selected functional N transformation genes to quantify nitrate reduction mechanisms and rates in sites with different redox potential in a karst aquifer. PPTT treatments with nitrate (AN) and nitrate-fumarate (ANC) were executed in two wells representing anoxic and oxic geochemical end-members. Oxic aquifer zero-order nitrate loss rates (mmolL(-1)h(-1)) were similar for AN and ANC treatment, ranging from 0.030.01 to 0.050.01. Anoxic aquifer zero-order nitrate loss rates ranged from 0.030.02 (AN) to 0.130.02 (ANC). Microbial characterization indicates mechanisms influencing these rates were dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) at the anoxic site with AN treatment, assimilatory reduction of nitrate to ammonium (ANRA) with ANC treatment in the water column at both sites, and additional documented nitrate reduction that occurred in unsampled biofilms. With carbon treatment, total numbers of microbes (16S rRNA genes) significantly increased (fourteenfold to thirtyfold), supporting stimulated growth with resulting ANRA. Decreased DNRA gene concentrations (nrfA DNA) and increased DNRA activity ratio (nrfA-cDNA/DNA) supported the assertion that DNRA occurred in the anoxic zone with AN and ANC treatment. Furthermore, decreased DNRA gene copy numbers at the anoxic site with ANC treatment suggests that DNRA microbes in the anoxic site are chemolithoautotrophic. Increased RT-qPCR denitrification gene expression (nirK and nirS) was not observed in water samples, supporting that any observed NO3-N loss due to denitrification may be occurring in unsampled microbial biofilms. Plain Language Summary Nitrate is an abundant contaminant in many freshwater aquifers, such as the Upper Floridan Aquifer (UFA). The UFA covers approximately 260,000km(2) and provides municipal, industrial, and agricultural water supply for a population of 17.9 million people in Florida alone. Nitrate concentrations in North Florida springs have been increasing. Increased nitrate presents a potential human health hazard and may be linked to ecological shifts that increase algae in springs and downgradient water bodies such as streams, lakes, and estuaries. Increased understanding of what conditions reduce nitrate in the natural environment helps water managers evaluate how to best mitigate contamination. However, direct estimates of nitrate reduction rates and mechanisms in aquifers are limited. This work revealed that nitrate reduction pathways are more diverse than previously reported and nitrate reduction may be occurring where conditions are presumed to be unfavorable. Microbial communities in the aquifer may be converting mobile nitrate into immobile ammonium to retain nitrogen for their growth. This has significant implications for managing nitrate contamination in the UFA, assessing aquifer vulnerability to contamination, and protection of sensitive freshwater spring ecosystems.					; Henson, Wesley/D-4083-2016	Graham, Wendy/0000-0002-6814-2959; Henson, Wesley/0000-0003-4962-5565													2169-8953	2169-8961				MAY	2017	122	5					1062	1077		10.1002/2016JG003463	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016JG003463													WOS:000403487600005

The charr originated from a nearby lake inhabiting predatory brown trout Salmo trutta. The cohort of stocked charr was investigated for three years. The Arctic charr started to exploit the pelagic habitat in their first summer at a size of 7-9 cm in contrast to about 15 cm in the donor lake. In the next two summers, the pelagic fraction of the cohort increased. The main fraction lived in epibenthic areas, utilizing the same prey as pelagic charr. Water temperature moderated the habitat use of juveniles such that they avoided warm (>16 degrees C) waters and resided in cool, deep areas. The result was consistent with the hypothesis of a tradeoff between feeding benefit and the predation risk producing spatial segregation of Arctic charr and demonstrated that the fish can facultatively respond to predation risk and adjust the size at which they migrate to the pelagic zone to feed on zooplankton.

The lake was uplifted from marine inundation similar to 7600 cal BP. After a millennium of rapid sediment accumulation, which coincided with the Holocene Thermal Maximum in the region, accumulation rates decreased over the past 6000 years as the Arctic became colder. This resulted in the deposition of very fine laminae that were interpreted as varves. The uppermost laminated sediments provided a similar to 1600 year history of annual sediment transport and deposition into the lake. During periods of warmer temperatures, such as between 6000 and 7500 cal BP and during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (similar to 950-1300 CE; CE, Christian Era), hydroclimatic and permafrost slope processes increased sedimentation rates into the basin.					; Gajewski, Konrad/L-5128-2017; Mustaphi, Colin/B-6547-2013	Courtney Mustaphi, Colin/0000-0002-4439-2590; 													0008-4077	1480-3313				MAY	2013	50	5					564	575		10.1139/cjes-2012-0143	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjes-2012-0143													WOS:000319056500006

We report abundances of three MTB morphotypes from nine sites collected and measured every month over a two-year period from a natural pond near Munich, Germany. Morphotype populations underwent coherent temporal trends among the nine sitesespecially at proximal sites with similar water depths. MTB populations varied independently of bottom water oxygen concentrations or temperature over the two-year period, except for spirilla, which flourished during the summer at some sites. Magnetic properties of the sediments did not reflect living MTB abundances, but instead varied with water depth. Deeper sites, which were also lower in organic carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen concentrations than shallower sites, had higher saturation magnetizations and were richer in single-domain particles.					; Egli, Ramon/B-1389-2016; Gilder, Stuart/B-1871-2016; Egli, Ramon/AAQ-3767-2020	He, Kuang/0000-0002-5129-7540; Egli, Ramon/0000-0001-6825-4742; Gilder, Stuart/0000-0001-8724-7812; Mayr, Christoph/0000-0001-9002-9963													0094-8276	1944-8007				MAR 16	2018	45	5					2294	2302		10.1002/2018GL077213	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2018GL077213													WOS:000428402400020
J	PHILLIPS, VE				PHILLIPS, VE			POCHARD AYTHYA-FERINA USE OF CHIRONOMID-RICH FEEDING HABITAT IN WINTER	BIRD STUDY												The feeding distribution of Pochard on two flooded gravel pits was studied at the ARC Wildfowl Centre in January/February 1989, when peak wintering numbers were present. On the deeper lake (mean depth 2.3 m) 99% of feeding occurred in the shallowest 10% of the lake, where depth averaged 1.6 m. In the other shallower lake (mean depth 1.5 m) favoured feeding areas averaged 0.9 m deep. At this lake only 15% of the available habitat at this depth was used by feeding Pochard, much shallow water being ignored. Benthic sampling produced no submerged macrophytes and revealed that only oligochaete worms and chironomid larvae were numerous in the sediments. Oligochaetes were similarly distributed in both feeding and non-feeding areas. Chironomid larvae were present in significantly higher numbers and biomass/m2 in feeding areas. Hence it would appear that Pochard prefer to feed in shallow water and can select prey-rich areas, thus maximizing their food intake whilst minimizing their energy expenditure. Two out of 3 Pochard shot at the site in December 1989 which had food present in their upper digestive tracts contained only (large) chironomid larvae. The Pochard's ability to exploit patches rich in chironomid larvae is discussed in relation to the relatively low nutrient status of flooded gravel pits.																			0006-3657					JUL	1991	38		2				118	122		10.1080/00063659109477078	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00063659109477078													WOS:A1991FU97000008

Phosphorous Supply to a Eutrophic Artificial Lake: Sedimentary versus Groundwater Sources	WATER												The eutrophic Lake Eichbaumsee, a similar to 1 km long and 280 m wide (maximum water depth 16 m) dredging lake southeast of Hamburg (Germany), has been treated for water quality improvements using various techniques (i.e., aeration plants, removal of dissolved phosphorous by aluminum phosphorous precipitation, and by Bentophos (R) (Phoslock Environmental Technologies, Sydney, Australia), adsorption) during the past similar to 15 years. Despite these treatments, no long-term improvement of the water quality has been observed and the lake water phosphorous content has continued to increase by e.g., similar to 670 kg phosphorous between autumn 2014 and autumn 2019. As no creeks or rivers drain into the lake and hydrological groundwater models do not suggest any major groundwater discharge into the lake, sources of phosphorous (and other nutrients) are unknown. We investigated the phosphorous fluxes from sediment pore water and from groundwater in the water body of the lake. Sediment pore water was extracted from sediment cores recovered by divers in August 2018 and February 2019. Diffusive phosphorous fluxes from pore water were calculated based on phosphorus gradients. Stable water isotopes (delta H-2, delta O-18) were measured in the lake water, in interstitial waters in the banks surrounding the lake, in the Elbe River, and in three groundwater wells close to the lake. Stable isotope (delta H-2, delta O-18) water mass balance models were used to compute water inflow/outflow to/from the lake. Our results revealed pore-water borne phosphorous fluxes between 0.2 mg/m(2)/d and 1.9 mg/m(2)/d. Assuming that the measured phosphorous fluxes are temporarily and spatially representative for the whole lake, about 11 kg/a to 110 kg/a of phosphorous is released from sediments. This amount is lower than the observed lake water phosphorous increase of similar to 344 kg between April 2018 and November 2018. Water stable isotope (delta H-2, delta O-18) compositions indicate a water exchange between an aquifer and the lake water. Based on stable isotope mass balances we estimated an inflow of phosphorous from the aquifer to the lake of between similar to 150 kg/a and similar to 390 kg/a. This result suggests that groundwater-borne phosphorous is a significant phosphorous source for the Eichbaumsee and highlights the importance of groundwater for lake water phosphorous balances.

Modelling the influence of temperature increase on soil respiration and organic carbon content in arable soils under different managements	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Based on field measurements in two agricultural ecosystems, soil respiration and long-term response of soil organic carbon content (SOC) was modelled. The model predicts the influence of temperature increase as well as the effects of land-use over a period of thirty years in a northern German glacial moraine landscape. One of the fields carried a maize monoculture treated with cattle slurry in addition to mineral fertilizer (''maize monoculture''), the other was managed by crop rotation and received organic manure (''crop rotation''). The soils of both fields were classified as cambic Arenosols. The soil respiration was measured in the fields by means of the open dynamic inverted-box method and an infrared gas analyser. The mean annual soil respiration rates were 268 (maize monoculture) and 287 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) (crop rotation). Factors controlling soil respiration were soil temperature, soil moisture, root respiration and carbon input into the soil. Q(10)-values of soil respiration were generally higher in winter than in summer. This trend is interpreted as an adaptive response of the soil microbial communities. In the model a novel mathematical approach with variable Q(10)-values as a result of temperature and moisture adjustment is proposed. With the calibrated model soil respiration and SOC were calculated for both fields and simulations over a period of thirty years were established. Simulations were based on (1) local climatic data, 1961 until 1990, and (2) a regional climate scenario for northern Germany with an average temperature increase of 2.1 K. Over the thirty years period with present climate conditions, the SOC pool under ''crop rotation'' was nearly stable due to the higher carbon inputs, whereas about 16 t C ha(-1) were lost under ''maize monoculture''. Under global warming the mean annual soil respiration for both fields increased and SOC decreased by ca. 10 t C ha(-1) under ''crop rotation'' and by more than 20 t C ha(-1) under ''maize monoculture''. It was shown that overestimation of carbon losses in long-term prognoses can be avoided by including a Q(10)-adjustment in soil respiration models.

Here we present a continuous 7.4 ka sediment record from the high-altitude Shireet Naiman Nuur (Nuur = lake) in the central Mongolian Khangai Mountains. We extensively dated the sediments and analyzed elemental composition and bulk isotopes for lake sediment characterization. Our results show that C-14-dating of bulk organic carbon and terrestrial macrofossils provide a robust and precise chronology for the past 7.4 +/- 0.3 cal ka BP at Shireet Naiman Nuur and C-14-ages are mostly in stratigraphic order. The C-14-based chronology is confirmed by paleomagnetic secular variations, which resemble the predictions of spherical harmonic geomagnetic field models. The very good chronological control makes paleomagnetic secular variation stratigraphy a powerful tool for evaluating and refining regional C-14-chronologies when compared to the record presented here. The lake sediment proxies TOC, N, log (Ca/Ti) and log (Si/Ti) reveal increased lake primary productivity and high growing season temperatures from 7.4 +/- 0.3 to 4.3 +/- 0.2 cal ka BP, which is likely the result of stronger summer insolation and pronounced warming. Reduced summer insolation thereafter results in decreased productivity and low growing season temperatures at Shireet Naiman Nuur from 4.3 +/- 0.3 cal ka BP until present day. The globally acknowledged 4.2 ka event also appears as a pronounced cooling event at Shireet Naiman Nuur, and additional abrupt cooling events occurred during minima in total solar irradiance at similar to 3.4, 2.8 and 2.4 ka BP. Low lake primary productivity and growing season temperatures are likely the result of longer ice cover periods at the high-altitude (2,429 m a.s.l.) Shireet Naiman Nuur. This leads to shorter mixing periods of the lake water which is supported by more positive delta C-13(TOC) because of increased incorporation of dissolved HCO3- by aquatic producers during periods of longer ice cover.

Tests were conducted for up to 14 days. Rhizobium meliloti and 1 fluorescent and 1 nonfluorescent strain of Pseudomonas were resistant to starvation because their population sizes did not fall appreciably in buffer and sterile lake water, and the first 2 maintained high numbers after being added to sterile sewage. Cell densities of these bacterial species dropped slowly in nonsterile sewage, and more cells of these 3 organisms than of the other test organisms remained in nonsterile lake water. R. leguminosarum was moderately resistant to starvation because its numbers fell slowly in buffer and sterile lake water and did not change appreciably in sterile sewage. The abundance of Micrococcus flavus added to buffer and sterile lake water did not change, but the density of M. flavus declined in nonsterile lake water. The abundance of R. leguminosarum fell in nonsterile lake water and nonsterile sewage. Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, an asporogenous strain of Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus sp. were susceptible to starvation because their populations were markedly reduced in buffer. Populations of the last 3 spp. declined rapidly in nonsterile and sterile samples of lake water and sewage. S. faecalis declined rapidly when added to nonsterile lake water and sewage and sterile lake water but not when added to sterile sewage, the persistence in the last instance probably being associated with the availability of organic nutrients. In a comparison of random isolates from nutrient-poor and nutrient-rich habitats, the percentage of survival of 17 of 19 bacteria from lake water was greater than that of all 11 isolates from human skin and mouth. Evidently, starvation-susceptible bacteria will not persist in environments that are nutrient poor or in which they fail to compete for organic nutrients and starvation resistance is a necessary but not sufficient condition for persistence in environments that are nutrient poor or that support intense interspecific competition.																			0099-2240	1098-5336					1984	48	2					410	415		10.1128/AEM.48.2.410-415.1984	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.48.2.410-415.1984								6435525					WOS:A1984TD33700031

This is the first known occurrence of the ruffe in North America. The likely vector for this species was ballast water of a transoceanic vessel dumped into the international port of Duluth-Superior located on the lower end of the St. Louis River. The ruffe is increasing in abundance and expanding its range into other tributaries and nearshore areas of Lake Superior.																			0706-652X					AUG	1992	49	8					1616	1618		10.1139/f92-179	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f92-179													WOS:A1992JP08800011
J	Xie, L; Pietrafesa, LJ; Peng, MC				Xie, L; Pietrafesa, LJ; Peng, MC			Incorporation of a mass-conserving inundation scheme into a three dimensional storm surge model	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The rapid rise and fall of coastal sea level due to tides and storm surge complicates the application of hydrodynamic models that use constant lateral boundaries in the region where sea level change falls within the tidal range or between the negative and positive surge extremes. In order to enable a hydrodynamic model for use in tidal or surge zones, an inundation and drying scheme must be incorporated into the hydrodynamic model. In this study, a mass-conserving inundation (wetting) and draining (drying) scheme is incorporated into a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model (the Princeton Ocean Model, often referred to as POM) for coastal ocean and estuarine systems. This coupled hydrodynamic and inundation modeling system is tested in an idealized lake/estuarine setting. The results show that: 1) incorporation of the inundation/drying scheme into the POM enabled its application in shallow water systems with time-dependent coastal boundaries; 2) the mass conservation constraint used in the inundation and drying scheme eliminates the problem of artificial flooding associated with the imbalance of water mass that is typical of a non-mass-conserving schemes; 3) using vertically-averaged flow as flooding velocity resulted in a reduced flooding area as compared to the cases that use the surface flow as the flooding velocity. This is partly due to the fact that vertically-averaged flow tends to be weaker and directed more parallel to the coastline than the surface flow.																			0749-0208					FAL	2004	20	4					1209	1223		10.2112/03-0084R.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2112/03-0084R.1													WOS:000225276900022

Spatial Density, Biomass, and Composition of Crustacean Zooplankton on Lake Michigan Beaches	FISHES												Ecosystem alterations to Lake Michigan (LM), such as the invasion of dreissenid mussels, have decreased the abundance of phytoplankton and, subsequently, zooplankton, which has implications for Great Lake fisheries. The community composition of zooplankton has also been altered over the past 20 years in LM, shifting the summer dominance from cladoceran to calanoid taxa. However, most of our information on zooplankton community dynamics is from deeper pelagic zones. The nearshore beach (<= 1 m) habitat, which serves as a critical nursery for some larvae and juvenile fish, is composed of different zooplankton taxa than deeper zones, but limited data are available for comparison. We conducted a standardized summer sampling campaign to characterize the zooplankton community across 32 beaches in LM. We found the lowest crustacean zooplankton density and biomass on northern LM beaches and a higher zooplankton density and biomass on Greater Green Bay and central LM beaches, which had warmer water temperatures. Smaller-bodied cladocera (mainly Bosmina) and cyclopoid taxa were the most abundant groups on beaches. Our results provide the first comprehensive characterization of zooplankton on beaches in the Great Lakes, with applications for other lake systems. These results may help identify potential "hot spots" of fish recruitment for management.					; S, SUBRAMANYA/AAF-1675-2021	Smith, Jason/0000-0001-9771-9940; Doubek, Jonathan/0000-0003-2651-4715														2410-3888				DEC	2023	8	12							599	10.3390/fishes8120599	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fishes8120599													WOS:001130819900001

The main habitats of A. fabalis are Caizi lake and Shengjin Lake in the Middle and Lower Yangtze River Floodplain. We utilized high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics to analyze the composition and structural characteristics of the intestinal microbiota of Caizi Lake (CL) and Shengjin Lake (SL) A. fabalis during overwintering. Lactobacillus is the main genus of A. fabalis, of which Lactobacillus aviaries is the highest. There was only a positive correlation between Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria in the intestinal microbiota of SL A. fabalis, and the species were closely related. However, CL is mainly associated with a positive correlation between Firmicutes and Actinomycetes. The functions of intestinal microbiota of A. fabalis involve energy production and transformation, amino acid transport and metabolism, carbohydrate transport and metabolism, and transcription. This study provides basic data for the study of intestinal microbiota of A. fabalis. The intestinal microbiota of migratory birds participate in the life activities of the host and are affected by external environmental factors. The difference in habitat environment provides diversity in external environmental selection pressure for the same overwintering waterfowl, which may be reflected in their intestinal microbiota. Caizi lake and Shengjin Lake in the Middle and Lower Yangtze River Floodplain are the main habitats for migratory waterfowl in winter, especially the Anser fabalis (A. fabalis). It is important to explore the changes in intestinal microbiota composition and function of A. fabalis in the early overwintering period to clarify the effect of habitat size and protection status on intestinal microbiota. In this study, the composition and structural characteristics of the intestinal microbiota of A. fabalis in Shengjin Lake (SL) and Caizi Lake (CL) were preliminarily explored in order to obtain data for the migratory birds. In both SL and CL groups, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing analysis showed that Firmicutes was the dominant bacterial phylum, but the relative abundance showed significant differences. Lactobacillus was the most abundant genus in both SL and CL groups. At the species level, the abundance of L. aviaries was the highest, with a relative abundance in both SL and CL groups of more than 34%. When comparing the average relative abundance of the 15 most abundant genera, it was found that Subdoligranulum, Exiguobacterium, and Terrisporobacter had higher abundances in the intestinal microbiota of CL A. fabalis, while Streptococcus and Rothia had higher abundances in the intestinal microbiota of SL A. fabalis. There was only a positive correlation between Bacteroidota and Proteobacteria in the intestinal microbiota flora of SL A. fabalis, and the species were closely related. At the same time, there were positive and negative correlations between Firmicutes and Actinomycetes. However, CL is mainly associated with a positive correlation between Firmicutes and Actinomycetes, and there are also a small number of connections between Firmicutes. PICRUSt1 prediction analysis revealed that the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) functions of SL and CL involve energy production and transformation, amino acid transport and metabolism, carbohydrate transport and metabolism, and transcription. Understanding the changes in intestinal microbiota in Aves during the overwintering period is of great importance to explore the adaptation mechanism of migratory Aves to the overwintering environment. This work provides basic data for an A. fabalis intestinal microbiota study.

Trend analysis of rainfall and temperature and its relationship over India	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												This study investigated the trends in rainfall and temperature and the possibility of any rational relationship between the trends over the homogeneous regions over India. Annual maximum temperature shows an increasing trend in all the homogeneous temperature regions and corresponding annual rainfall also follow the same pattern in all the regions, except North East. As far as monthly analysis is concerned, no definite pattern has been observed between trends in maximum and minimum temperature and rainfall, except during October. Increasing trends of maximum and minimum temperature during October accelerate the water vapor demand and most of the lakes, rivers, ponds and other water bodies with no limitation of water availability during this time fulfills the water vapor demand and shows an increasing trend of rainfall activity. This study shows there exists no direct relationship between increasing rainfall and increasing maximum temperature when monthly or seasonal pattern is concerned over meteorological subdivisions of India, however we can make a conclusion that the relation between the trends of rainfall and temperature have large scale spatial and temporal dependence.																			0177-798X	1434-4483				AUG	2014	117	3-4					449	462		10.1007/s00704-013-1015-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-013-1015-9													WOS:000339905000009

Where Wolves Kill Moose: The Influence of Prey Life History Dynamics on the Landscape Ecology of Predation	PLOS ONE												The landscape ecology of predation is well studied and known to be influenced by habitat heterogeneity. Little attention has been given to how the influence of habitat heterogeneity on the landscape ecology of predation might be modulated by life history dynamics of prey in mammalian systems. We demonstrate how life history dynamics of moose (Alces alces) contribute to landscape patterns in predation by wolves (Canis lupus) in Isle Royale National Park, Lake Superior, USA. We use pattern analysis and kernel density estimates of moose kill sites to demonstrate that moose in senescent condition and moose in prime condition tend to be wolf-killed in different regions of Isle Royale in winter. Predation on senescent moose was clustered in one kill zone in the northeast portion of the island, whereas predation on prime moose was clustered in 13 separate kill zones distributed throughout the full extent of the island. Moreover, the probability of kill occurrence for senescent moose, in comparison to prime moose, increased in high elevation habitat with patches of dense coniferous trees. These differences can be attributed, at least in part, to senescent moose being more vulnerable to predation and making different risk-sensitive habitat decisions than prime moose. Landscape patterns emerging from prey life history dynamics and habitat heterogeneity have been observed in the predation ecology of fish and insects, but this is the first mammalian system for which such observations have been made.

J	Tweddle, D				Tweddle, Denis			Overview of the Zambezi River System: Its history, fish fauna, fisheries, and conservation	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The Zambezi River has a catchment area of 1.32 million km(2), including parts of eight countries. Three divisions of the river are recognised: the Upper Zambezi separated from the Middle Zambezi by Victoria Falls, and the Lower Zambezi below Cahora Bassa gorge. The Okavango River is also linked to the Upper Zambezi system in wet years in an area of complex geomorphological history. Habitats include forested headwater streams, extensive floodplains, deep gorges, two large man-made lakes and an extensive delta. On floodplains, subsistence fisheries exploit the natural seasonal cycles, while the man-made lakes have commercial-scale fisheries for introduced kapenta, Limnothrissa miodon. Aquaculture is on a small scale, though with larger commercial cage culture enterprises on Lake Kariba. This paper summarises current knowledge on the fish faunas and their origins, the status of the different fisheries and their management, and the conservation status of the river's resources.																			1463-4988	1539-4077					2010	13	3					224	240		10.1080/14634988.2010.507035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634988.2010.507035													WOS:000281763400002
J	Ziganshin, II; Ivanov, DV				Ziganshin, I. I.; Ivanov, D., V			Recreation capacity as an indicator of environmental and tourist potential of protected lakes of the Republic of Tatarstan	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												The growing need of population in having a safe rest of good quality not far from where they live causes demand of space and increasing load on nature, including the natural protected terrritories which due to their status have kept a unique potential and beautiful natural landscapes. Recreational load is a huge non-regulated anthropogenic factor that transforms their ecosystems. Solving the problem of putting recreational flows in order requires limiting recreational load, and there is a need in determining a unit of recreational capacity. The article presents the results of comparative estimation of recreational load for 32 specially protected water reservoirs of the Republic of Tatarstan. For assessing recreational load, the methods by I.P. Shamardina and S.E. Jorgenson of evaluating recreational potential of lakes was used which are based on assessing water surface area and water volumes. According to Jorgenson method the protected water objects of the republic were divided into four groups: with recreational capacity over 2000 people per year, from 10000 to 20000 people per year, from 5000 to 10000 people per year and less than 5000 people per year. It is stated that the maximal recreational capacity (over 20000 people per year) is characteristic for the biggest lakes in the republic: Arkhiyereyskoye Lake, Kovalinskoye Lake, Salamykovskoye Lake, Shchuchye Lake, and Yurtushinskoye Lake. These popular recreational lakes of for all the conditions for developing a wide range of water tourism and recreation without any harm to ecology. The recreational capacity of the most part of protected water basins in Tatarstan is 5000 people per year or less. There it is recommended to organize tourist-recreational activity. It was shown that the volume of actual recreational load on the protected lakes in spring and summer does not exceed over the norm. There is a potential possibility to use these objects for recreation and tourism on condition that any activity within the basisns should be strictly controlled and it should be restricted to certain types of recreational use.

J	van Dam, H				van Dam, Herman			The Role of Hydromorphology in the Partial Recovery of Chemistry in Acidified and Warmed Dutch Moorland Pools	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												To monitor recovery from acidification, water chemistry was sampled in 11 Dutch moorland pools from 1978 to 2018. Changes were assessed by visual inspection of time series and tested non-parametrically. As a net result of all inputs and outputs, the median sulphate and ammonium concentrations in the surface water dropped by about 90%. This was accompanied by increases in pH, acid neutralizing capacity, and dissolved organic matter, and decreased metals, particularly toxic aluminium. Decreases of ammonium and sulphate in the surface water are considerably higher than in deposition, indicating the importance of losses to sediments and the atmosphere. The changes were greatest in pools with relatively flat banks exposed to the air in extremely dry summers. After the extremely dry summer of 1976, the changes were dramatic due to acidification by oxidation of the reduced sulphur and nitrogen compounds stored in the moorland pool bottom. In later dry years, the changes in the pools with flat banks were less extreme, as the sulphur stock in the sediment was depleted by winterly discharge to groundwater. In pools with steep banks, the sulphur compounds are retained in the sediment and may cause eutrophication by the displacement of phosphorus from iron compounds.						van Dam, Herman/0000-0002-8778-5490													0049-6979	1573-2932				JAN	2023	234	1							10	10.1007/s11270-022-05994-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-022-05994-y													WOS:000900897300003
J	LOW, JB				LOW, JB			ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT OF THE REDHEAD, NYROCA-AMERICANA, IN IOWA	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												The life history and ecology of the redhead, were investigated from March, 1938, to June, 1941, in Clay and Palo Alto counties, Iowa. Northbound redheads reached the research area about March 20. Peaks of spring migration were noted Mar. 21-25 and Apr. 11-18, the latter dates representing the main flight. The sex ratio was 1.42 [male][male] to 1 [female] among 3,400 redheads. Marshes of 5 acres, or larger, situated not farther than 1/4 mile from large permanent lakes were preferred nesting habitats. Nesting extended through 105 days, Apr. 30 to Aug. 12, 1940, a period of 28 days longer than in the 2 previous seasons. A total of 160 nests were under observation: 42 in 1938, 53 in 1939, and 65 in 1940. Calculated on the basis that 60% of the nests were found, during the average yr. on the 925 acres of vegetation available for nesting the average density was one nest to 10.6 acres. A high density of 1 nest to 2 acres was found on each of several small ponds in Dewey''s Pasture. 90 nests terminated successfully. A comparatively stable water level was correlated with the high (72%) success in 1939. An average of 9.75 eggs was recorded for 115 complete clutches. No definite rhythm of incubation was carried out by the ?. An average of 17.6 hrs. a day was spent on the nest by one closely observed $ during the 24-day incubation period. The most extensive nesting cover spp. were lake sedge, narrow-leaved cattail, hardstem bulrush, and awned sedge. Nesting densities for the important cover plants were as follows: one nest to 3 acres of slender bulrush, one nest to 6 acres of hardstem bulrush, one nest to 11 acres of whitetop, 1 nest to 13 acres of sedge and 1 nest to 16 acres of narrow-leaved cattail. 85% of the nests were located within 50 yards of open water. Nesting densities reached a max. where not less than 10% and not more than 25% of the habitat was open water. Nests were constructed over water which averaged 11 inches in depth. The Hardstem bulrush[long dash]River bulrush[long dash]Burreed Community was most important as juvenile rearing cover. The flight of the juveniles preceded the fall migration of northern redheads by nearly a month. An average of 6.3 juveniles of each brood survived, which represented a 70% survival of hatched young. Redheads were about 5% of the 1939 birds bagged by hunters. Marshes under 25 acres in area should be protected from livestock. An adequate controlled water level is the most important factor to insure the production and utilization of cover and food plants by redheads.																			0012-9615	1557-7015					1945	15	1					35	69		10.2307/1943294	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1943294													WOS:A1945YF70000002

Effects of Changes in Arctic Lake and River Ice	AMBIO												Climatic changes to freshwater ice in the Arctic are projected to produce a variety of effects on hydrologic, ecological, and socio-economic systems. Key hydrologic impacts include changes to low flows, lake evaporation regimes and water levels, and river-ice break-up severity and timing. The latter are of particular concern because of their effect on river geomorphology, vegetation, sediment and nutrient fluxes, and sustainment of riparian aquatic habitats. Changes in ice phenology will affect a wide range of related biological aspects of seasonality. Some changes are likely to be gradual, but others could be more abrupt as systems cross critical ecological thresholds. Transportation and hydroelectric production are two of the socio-economic sectors most vulnerable to change in freshwater-ice regimes.

The ability to undertake some traditional harvesting methods will also be affected.

J	Uri, ND				Uri, ND			The environmental implications of soil erosion in the United States	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Soil erosion has both on-farm and off-farm impacts. Reduction of soil depth can impair the land's productivity, and the transport of sediments can degrade streams, lakes, and estuaries. Since 1933, soil conservation policies have existed in the United States. Originally they focused on the on-farm benefits of keeping soil on the land and increasing net farm income. Beginning in the 1980s, however, policy goals increasingly included reductions in off-site impacts of erosion. As a consequence of conservation efforts associated with explicit U.S. government policies, total soil erosion between 1982 and 1992 was reduced by 32% and the sheet and rill erosion rate fell from an average of 4.1 tons per acre per year in 1982 to 3.1 tons per acre in 1992 while the wind erosion rate fell from an average of 3.3 tons per acre per year to 2.4 tons per acre per year over the same period. Still, soil erosion is imposing substantial social costs. These costs are estimated to be about $37.6 billion annually. To further reduce soil erosion and thereby mitigate its social costs, there are a number of policy options available to induce farmers to adopt conservation practices including education and technical assistance, financial assistance, research and development, land retirement, and regulation and taxes.																			0167-6369					FEB	2001	66	3					293	312		10.1023/A:1006333329653	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1006333329653								11281426					WOS:000166500700006

NITRIFYING ACTIVITY OF RAPIDLY SINKING PARTICLES	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Rapidly sinking particulate matters were collected by sediment traps at 15 m depth in Lake Kizaki during May to August in 1982. Potential nitrifying activities of water (15 m) and trap samples were measured with inhibitors, and the enumerations of nitrifying bacteria (MPN method) were carried out. The potential nitrifying activities of water samples corresponded to the course of in situ nitrification, reaching maximum on 10 July (0.65 .mu.g-at. N .cntdot. liter-1 .cntdot. day-1). Those of trap samples reached maximum on 14 July (0.48 .mu.g-at. N .cntdot. liter-1 .cntdot. day-1). Although both numbers of ammonium and nitrite oxidizing bacteria in the trap samples were about 100 times more than in the water samples, the nitrifying activity levels of the trap samples were the same as those of the water samples. Therefore, it was suggested that the nitrifying bacteria attached to the rapidly sinking particulate matters might be inactive and that the nitrification in the hypolimnion of Lake Kizaki during the early summer is caused not by them but by the nitrifying bacteria suspended in the water column.																			0003-9136						1985	104	4					557	570																WOS:A1985ARC9500008

The effects of these processes are revealed by a terrace staircase, together with the stratigraphy of each individual terrace, in the confluence zone of the Huang Shui and Yellow Rivers in the NETP, during the late Quaternary. On the basis of morphological mapping and OSL-dating, at least seven strath terraces were identified that formed during the last glacial cycle, which are preserved at locations where tectonic uplift was sufficient to separate them attitudinally from one another. The terraces are composed of stacked fluvial gravels,,sands and alluvial barns. The principal result is that we demonstrate that the terraces were formed in response to climatic cycles on a suborbital timescale. For each terrace, the lower coarse-grained sediments (gravel and sand)were deposited during cold periods (such as the LGM, MIS3b, MIS4 and MIS5d) associated with a strong Asian winter monsoon. The aggradation during cold periods was associated with floodplain widening. The river incised slightly during the transitions from cold to warm phases, resulting in the transformation of the previous river plain into a terrace. The coarse grained cold phase deposits are covered by inter-bedded, horizontally-laminated silt and sand (representing flood sediments that often contain reworked soil material), during the (cold to warm) transitional phases. The floodplain accumulation on the terrace continued during the subsequent warm period. The warm periods (such as MIS3a, MIS3c, and MIS5a) of the climatic cycles are associated with a strong Asian summer monsoon. Pronounced incision took place at the subsequent warm-cold transitions. After this warm-cold transition, aeolian loess accumulated on the abandoned terrace without any further fluvial reworking. Our results demonstrate that critical thresholds for fluvial response can be crossed at climatic changes on a suborbital timescale given conditions of accelerated tectonic uplift in the NETP. In addition, based on the OSL ages of different units in the sedimentary sequences of the terraces, we conclude that the durations of terrace aggradations and floodplain widening lasted much longer than the periods of fluvial downcutting.

Birmingham Med Res Expeditionary	Exercise Limitation of Acetazolamide at Altitude (3459 m)	WILDERNESS & ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE												Objective.-To assess the effect of acetazolamide (Az) on exercise performance during early acclimatization to altitude. Methods.-Az (250 mg twice daily) or placebo was administered for 3 days in a double-blind, randomized manner followed by a rapid ascent to 3459 m in the Italian Alps. Twenty healthy, adults (age range, 18-67 years) were tested at 60% of sea-level peak power output for 15 minutes on a bicycle ergometer after 16 to 27 hours of altitude exposure. Exercise performance was measured in relation to peripheral oxygen saturations measured from pulse oximetry (Spo(2)), Lake Louise acute mountain sickness (AMS) score, and perceived difficulty. Results.-At altitude, resting Spo(2) was higher in the Az group compared with placebo (P < .001). The highest AMS scores were in 4 of the placebo individuals with the lowest resting Spo(2) (P < .05). During the exercise test, Spo(2) fell in all but 1 subject (P < .001) and was reduced more in the Az group (P < .01). Four Az and 1 placebo subject were unable to complete the exercise test; 4 of these 5 had the largest fall in Spo(2). The perception of exercise difficulty was higher in the Az subjects compared with those taking the placebo (P < .01). There was an age relationship with exercise limitation; 4 of the 9 older than 50 years failed to complete the test whereas only 1 of 11 younger than 50 years failed, and there were no failures in the 6 younger than 30 years (P < .05). Conclusions.-In this study group, and despite higher resting Spo(2), Az may have compromised exercise at 3459 m altitude during early acclimatization, particularly in older subjects.

These wetlands are of major interest because they are considered important for food for waterbirds, and in the future, they might be potential sites for Saharan aquaculture. Little is known about the hydrology of these areas, the few existing physico-chemical investigations only concern drillings and Oued Righ channel. Here, for the first time we provide physico-chemical data of three permanent saline lakes in this region: Ayata, Megarine and Temacine Lakes. In order to characterize them, a monthly analysis of thirteen factors (temperature, electrical conductivity, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, NO2, NO3, HCOr, Cl-, SO4+, Na+, K+ and CC) was conducted between August 2009 and March 2010. The results show that Megarine was the saltier with 35.00 t 0.28 Ayata and Temacine are considered brackish and salty (11.56 t 0.93 g.L4 and 16.45 0.35 respectively). Water temperature was similar in the three lakes and varied between 15.70 degrees C in winter and 34.25 degrees C in summer. Their pH was alkaline and between 7.23 and 8.05. Dissolved oxygen was low with a maximum of 4.52 mg.L4 which corresponds to 50.51 % of saturation in Temacine. These lakes are highly mineralized; sulphate, chlorides and calcium were dominant. The analysis of Pearson's linear correlation matrix shows that temperature was the main factor influencing the changes in salinity, conductivity and dissolved oxygen. The higher salinity in Megarine was due to the two salts KC1 and NaC1, with a dominance of the first. Cl-, SO4, Na+ and K+ originated from groundwater and adjacent soil evaporates, whereas HCO3+ came from groundwater and adjacent soil calcite and /or dolomite, and from a biological source. The Ca was from calcite and /or dolomite. Globally, climate, groundwater, the adjacent soils and artificial drainage systems in Ayata and Temacine were the main factors controlling the physico-chemical functioning of these ecosystems.

A leading hypothesis suggests that hyperpycnal-plume deposits accurately record the rising and falling discharge of a flooding river (in terms of sediment-size grading, bedform sequence, and deposit thickness), which, if correct, has significant implications for unraveling river dynamics, reservoir potential, and Earth history from marine-event beds. Herein, we present one of the first experimental flume studies aimed at testing this hypothesis. Results indicate that depth-averaged hyperpycnal-plume velocities can be uncorrelated or even anti-correlated with river discharge at certain seabed locations because of translation of the plunge point resulting from temporal variations in discharge and sediment concentration through the duration of a river flood. An advection length scale of settling sediment is found to be an important control on hyperpycnal-plume deposits, where coarse sediment (sand) is most likely to record multiple flow accelerations and decelerations related to plunge-point translation even for a river flood with a single-peaked hydrograph. In contrast, fine sediment (mud) is relatively insensitive to local plunge-point dynamics and is most likely to preserve directly rising and falling river discharge. Finally, it was found that the necessary fluvial sediment concentration to form a plunging plume can be much larger than the concentration typically used assuming density equivalence because of deposition upstream of the plunge point.

J	MINER, JJ; POWELL, RD				MINER, JJ; POWELL, RD			AN EVALUATION OF ICE-RAFTED EROSION CAUSED BY AN ICEFOOT COMPLEX, SOUTHWESTERN LAKE-MICHIGAN, USA	ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												The Lake Michigan icefoot complex at Wilmette, Illinois, U.S.A., has a variable and transient nature. Data collected during winter 1988/89 show an alternation of additions to and subtractions from the volume of the complex. A total of 548 m3 of ice per linear meter of shoreline (m3 m-1) were added to the complex in discrete masses throughout the winter. All additions of ice were sampled to determine the weight of enclosed sediment. The total weight of sediment added to the complex by wave action during ice formation was 4.1 Mg per m of shoreline (Mg m-1). Eolian action and basal freeze-on also subsequently contributed sediment to the icefoot complex. These amounts were respectively calculated to be 1.5 and 0.3 Mg m-1. Wave impacts are the primary mechanism of icefoot complex destruction and subsequent dispersal of ice blocks into the nearshore zone. Time-lapse filming of the beach shows this destruction, with ice pieces being transported by southerly longshore currents. An estimate of enclosed sediment set adrift from the site in this manner totals 5.4 Mg m-1. It is hypothesized that ice-rafting caused by the breakup of an icefoot complex is capable of transporting sediment to a depocenter in southern Lake Michigan.

J	Mäemets, H; Freiberg, L				Mäemets, H; Freiberg, L			Long- and short-term changes of the macrophyte vegetation in strongly stratified hypertrophic Lake Verevi	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The aim of study was to bring out changes in the macrophyte vegetation, caused by eutrophication, short-term lowering of the water level and the following restoration of equilibrium in L. Verevi. Also biomass and N and P content of shoots of main submergent species were studied in 1999-2001, to follow the temporal and specific differences. Due to strong eutrophication, the type of the lake changed from a Myriophyllum-Potamogeton-Charophyta lake to a Ceratophyllum-Lemna trisulca lake in 1984-1988, obviously owing to the formation of loose organic-rich sediment. Water lowering by 0.7 in during summer months of 1998 facilitated mineralization of sediments, as a consequence of which a mass development of Ranunculus circinatus and a temporary increase in the abundance and biomass of other nutrient-demanding species took place during following years. Our data suggest differences in nutrient supply and release of submerged species and the need for more species-related approach to this group. The problem of nutrient supply of unrooted plants at the time of stratification arises. Regarding the increase of biomass of Ceratophyllum demersum in second half of summer, we suppose that one part of nutrients for this growth may derive from freshly decayed filamentous algae or vascular plants.					; Mäemets, Helle/F-7627-2017	Maemets, Helle/0000-0001-9792-6624; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP 15	2005	547						175	184		10.1007/s10750-005-4158-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-005-4158-6													WOS:000232760300016

Magnetic properties of marine magnetotactic bacteria in a seasonally stratified coastal pond (Salt Pond, MA, USA)	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL												Magnetic properties of suspended material in the water columns of freshwater and marine environments provide snapshots of magnetic biomineralization that have yet to be affected by the eventual time-integration and early diagenetic effects that occur after sediment deposition. Here, we report on the magnetism, geochemistry and geobiology of uncultured magnetite- and greigite-producing magnetotactic bacteria (MB) and magnetically responsive protists (MRP) in Salt Pond (Falmouth, MA, USA), a small coastal, marine basin (similar to 5 m deep) that becomes chemically stratified during the summer months. At this time, strong inverse O-2 and H2S concentration gradients form in the water column and a well-defined oxic-anoxic interface (OAI) is established at a water depth of about 3.5 m. At least four morphological types of MB, both magnetite and greigite producers, and several species of magnetically responsive protists are found associated with the OAI and the lower sulphidic hypolimnion. Magnetic properties of filtered water were determined through the water column across the OAI and were consistent with the occurrence of magnetite- and greigite-producing MB at different depths. Sharp peaks in anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) and saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM) and single-domain (SD) values of ARM/SIRM occur within the OAI corresponding to high concentrations of MB and MRP with magnetically derived cell densities of 10(4)-10(6) ml(-1). Low-temperature (< 300 K) remanence indicated that while only magnetite producers inhabit the OAI, both magnetite and greigite producers inhabit the sulphidic hypolimnion below the OAI. Magnetic measurements also show that the amount of Fe sequestered in magnetite magnetosomes within the OAI is no more than 3.3 per cent of the total available dissolved Fe(II) in the water column. However, below the OAI, magnetic minerals constitute a much larger fraction of the total dissolved Fe(II) ranging from 13.6 to 32.2 per cent depending on magnetic mineralogy. Most of this iron is possibly in the form of nanophase magnetic particles, possibly associated with biologically induced mineralization processes occurring below the OAI. Still, the OAI is a narrow but intense zone of SD particle production. Despite using just a small fraction of available dissolved Fe(II) in the water column for magnetosome production, the total number of MB living within an OAI, such as at Salt Pond, is all that is needed to produce the biogenic SD concentrations observed in some sediments. We also observed that Verwey transition temperatures fell within a narrow range of values between 95 and 105 K that were independent of both water depth and geochemical conditions. Reduced Verwey transition temperatures (T-v < 120 K) appear to be an intrinsic property of magnetite magnetosomes whether grown in pure laboratory cultures or from a diverse population of magnetite-producing MB in the environment. This indicates that a limited amount of oxygen non-stoichiometry (> 1 per cent) is present within magnetite magnetosomes, produced either initially during magnetosome formation or subsequently as an 'aging' process in living magnetite-producing MB. Therefore, reduced values of the Verwey transition in biogenic SD magnetite in sediments do not necessarily indicate diagenetic alteration.

New data sets (stratigraphy, chronology, hydrogen isotopes, plant macrofossil and charcoal records) for two sedimentary sequences are here combined with earlier multi-proxy studies to provide a comprehensive reconstruction of past climatic and environmental changes for Northeast Thailand. Gradually higher moisture availability due to a strengthening of the summer monsoon led to the formation of a large shallow lake in the Kumphawapi basin between >10,700 and c. 7000 cal. BP. The marked increase in moisture availability and lower evaporation between c. 7000 and 6400 cal. BP favoured the growth and expansion of vegetation in and around the shallow lake. The increase in biomass led to gradual overgrowing and infilling, to an apparent lake level lowering and to the development of a wetland. Multiple hiatuses are apparent in all investigated sequences between c. 6500 and 1400 cal. BP and are explained by periodic desiccation events of the wetland and erosion due to the subsequent lake level rise. The rise in lake level, which started c. 2000 cal. BP and reached shallower parts c. 1400 cal. BP, is attributed to an increase in effective moisture availability. The timing of hydroclimatic conditions during the past 2000 years cannot be resolved because of chronological limitations.					; Reimer, Paula/I-5915-2015; Chawchai, Sakonvan/GRF-2426-2022; Blaauw, Maarten/E-4539-2011; Smittenberg, Rienk/A-3296-2008	Smittenberg, Rienk/0000-0001-5578-9916; Reimer, Paula/0000-0001-9238-2146; Chawchai, Sakonvan/0000-0003-0527-9381; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				APR	2016	26	4					614	626		10.1177/0959683615612565	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683615612565													WOS:000372866100011

Laminae formed over the interval from 4000 to 900014C years B. P. consisted of regular layers of dinoflagellate cysts (cf. Peridinium) and chrysophyte cysts alternating with light and dark brown layers of amorphous organic matter. Pollen grains and diatoms occurred in light brown layers deposited in the summer; dark brown layers corresponded to late summer deposition. Diatom abundance was higher and Chrysophyte cyst abundance was lower in sediment deposited 9000 to 1100014C years B. P. Late-glacial sediments (> 11000 years B.P.) were characterized by discontinuous laminae rich in iron and lower in silt. The predominantly thin laminations (100-200 .mu.m) did not permit continuous counts throughout the core. Therefore, the numbers of laminations/mm were estimated by microscopically examining thin sections of sediments from various portions of the core and extrapolating to intervening levels. These estimates were used to calculate sedimentation rates and absolute ages within the core. The latter agreed with radiocarbon dates calibrated for atmospheric variations in 14C concentration, supporting the hypothesis that the laminae represent annual increments of sediment.

Linking silver carp habitat selection to flow and phytoplankton in the Mississippi River	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Invasive silver carp (Hypothalmichthys molitrix) occurs throughout much of the Mississippi River and threatens the Laurentian Great Lakes. To quantify habitat selection relative to river flow and potential phytoplankton food, 77 adult silver carp were implanted with ultrasonic transmitters during spring 2008 through spring 2009 in adjacent upstream dammed and downstream undammed reaches (48 km total) of the Mississippi River. Sixty-seven percent of the fish were located. Selection of major river habitat features (dammed vs. undammed, backwaters, channel border, wing dikes, island side channels, and the main channel) was quantified. Flow rates and chlorophyll a concentration were compared between silver carp locations and random sites. Foregut chlorophyll a concentrations plus presence of macrozooplankton and detritus of 240 non-tagged silver carp were quantified. About 30% of silver carp moved upstream into the dammed reach, where average flow was slower and chlorophyll a concentration was higher. Silver carp selected wing dike areas of moderate flow (about 0.3 m/s) and elevated chlorophyll a (about 7 mu g/L) relative to random sites. No silver carp occurred in areas where flow was absent. Wing dikes were preferred while the main channel was avoided.

Dispersal in the desert: ephemeral water drives connectivity and phylogeography of an arid-adapted fish	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim We examine landscape processes shaping the range-wide phylogeography of a dispersal-limited, desert-dwelling fish (the desert goby, Chlamydogobius eremius) in arid Australia. Location South-western Lake Eyre Basin, central Australia. Methods We obtained sequence data for the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (n = 513 individuals) and nuclear genetic markers (51 allozyme loci; n >= 128 individuals) to investigate the phylogeographic relationships among 51 populations. Sampling spanned multiple habitat types (permanent desert springs, ephemeral rivers) and sub-catchments, and the entire distribution of C. eremius and representatives of its sister species, Chlamydogobius japalpa. Phylogeographic analyses (genetic diversity, AMOVA, Tajima's D, W-ST, mismatch distribution) were used to explore the distribution and partitioning of mtDNA variation; principal coordinates analysis and neighbour-joining tree networks were used to explore allozyme variation. Results Three main genetic groups exist across C. eremius/C. japalpa populations. The geographical distributions of these groups reflected the historical and current confluence point of major rivers in the region. Surprisingly, permanent desert springs did not contain higher genetic diversity than ephemeral rivers. Main conclusions Genetic structuring of Chlamydogobius populations revealed unanticipated levels of connectivity, indicating that the ephemeral waters of Lake Eyre have allowed gene flow across drainage boundaries and large distances. Phylogeographic breaks reveal that connectivity relies on temporary surface water, while rapid temporal changes in diversity highlight flood-driven dispersal as the main means of gene flow between localities and habitats. Dispersal pathways reveal that ecological context (life history and tolerance of extreme conditions) has played a key role in shaping observed patterns.					; Unmack, Peter/AAU-3023-2020; Chapple, David/B-9073-2008	Unmack, Peter/0000-0003-1175-1152; Chapple, David/0000-0002-7720-6280; Wong, Bob/0000-0001-9352-6500													0305-0270	1365-2699				DEC	2015	42	12					2374	2388		10.1111/jbi.12596	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.12596													WOS:000367690000013

From 1998 to 2000, 18 adult lake trout ( mean fork length 553 mm) implanted with acoustic transmitters ( battery life 2 years) were manually tracked. For evening fall locations within the erosive zone of the lake ( determined using an existing sedimentation model), habitat variables ( slope, depth, and effective fetch) were summarised using GIS. Sites selected by lake trout during the spawning window were in areas of mean fetch equal to 1.5 km and mean slope of 10.6% (n = 50 fixes). We used GIS to identify areas that matched the mean habitat criteria and thus locate potential spawning areas. This model correctly identified 19 of 21 known spawning sites, as well as additional sites used by spawning females in an earlier telemetry study. Depths of traditional fall netting sites are shallow compared to areas in which telemetered lake trout were found during evenings of the spawning period ( means 3.1 vs. 5.1 m, respectively). Through the use of information on spawning habitat selection gained through telemetry and knowledge of the physical characteristics of the lake, we provide an alternative means of identifying potential spawning habitat for lake trout.

Understanding the storage conditions and fl uctuating eruption style of a young monogenetic volcano: Blue Lake crater (&lt;3 ka), High Cascades, Oregon	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Blue Lake crater (<3 ka) is monogenetic volcano that produced one of the youngest eruptions in the central Oregon Cascades. Understanding monogenetic volcano behavior - from storage through eruption - is imperative in planning for future eruptions. Here we combine physical volcanology and geochemistry to determine the pre eruptive storage conditions, ascent rate, eruption style, and deposit distribution of this young eruption. We find that the eruption of Blue Lake was initially phreatomagmatic, producing lithic-rich fall deposits and thin surge deposits and excavating the maar crater, before transitioning rapidly to a final voluminous magmatic volatile driven explosive eruption. The mapped fall deposit has an estimated volume of 3.9 x 10(7) m(3) (2.2 x 10(7) m(3) DRE) which suggests a VEI of 3. Although similar in magnitude (as measured by fall deposit volume) to many other recent cinder cone eruptions in the Cascades, the Blue Lake crater eruption lacks an effusive phase. The absence of lava flows may reflect the lack of evidence for syn-eruptive magma storage at shallow levels. Indeed, corrected volatile contents of olivine-hosted melt inclusions (2.9-4.2 wt% H2O, 910-1330 ppm CO2) are strikingly uniform and indicate storage and crystallization at a restricted pressure range (average similar to 235 MPa), equating to a depth of similar to 8.6 km. Melt inclusion geochemistry indicates that the basaltic andesite magma cooled and crystallized similar to 25% during storage at this pressure. Crystals in the Blue Lake magma show evidence of mixing with, or entrainment in, a more evolved magma. Feldspar crystals have large An-rich cores (An(80-85)) and abrupt An-poor rims (An(60-70)); olivine crystals have large, broad cores (similar to Fo(82-84)) and thin rims with lower Fo and NiO contents. Diffusion modeling of olivine zoning suggests that an intrusion event occurred similar to 10-60 days prior to eruption. Diffusive loss of H+ from melt inclusions was minimal (<1.3 wt% H2O) during magma ascent, from which we calculate minimum ascent times from 235 MPa of <1 day. Many inclusions indicate ascent times of 3 h, corresponding to ascent rates of similar to 1 to 13 m/s. This study illustrates the pre-eruptive and eruptive complexities of monogenetic volcanoes and highlights the minimal warning that may precede future eruptions.

J	Dinsmore, WP; Prepas, EE				Dinsmore, WP; Prepas, EE			Impact of hypolimnetic oxygenation on profundal macroinvertebrates in a eutrophic lake in central Alberta .1. Changes in macroinvertebrate abundance and diversity	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Hypolimnetic oxygenation from 1988 to 1991 in the north basin of Amisk Lake increased mean summer (June-August) dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in the deep hypolimnion (25 m) from <0.4 mg.L-1 during pretreatment years (1980-1987) to 2.7 mg.L-1 during treatment. Mean summer hypolimnetic temperatures at 25 m also increased from 6.3 (pretreatment) to 8.1 degrees C (treatment). Profundal (15-25 m) Chironomus spp. abundance in the treated basin increased from <100 to >2000.m(-2) from 1988 to 1991 whereas Chaoborus spp., Tubificidae, and other taxa remained uncommon at similar depths. Shannon-Weaver indices of diversity decreased as oxygenation progressed, in contrast with previous studies. Similar patterns in densities and diversity were observed in the south basin of Amisk Lake, although the increase in DO concentrations was smaller relative to the north basin. The impact of increased water temperature on macroinvertebrates appeared minor relative to the effects of increased DO concentrations. No changes in macroinvertebrate communities were noted in a nearby reference lake during the study period. Responses to hypolimnetic oxygenation in Amisk Lake differed markedly from those reported for smaller, single-basined water bodies.																			0706-652X					SEP	1997	54	9					2157	2169		10.1139/cjfas-54-9-2157	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-54-9-2157													WOS:A1997YH98200021

Twenty-one samples, composed of dug well waters, spring waters, river, and lake, were measured in stable isotopes (delta H-2, delta O-18) and tritium. Results showed that only two dug well waters, collected at the immediate vicinity of the landfill, have high tritium activities (22.82 TU and 10.43 TU), probably of artificial origin. Both upstream and further downstream of the landfill, tritium activities represent natural source, with values varying from 0.17 TU to 1.46 TU upstream and from 0.88 TU to 1.88 TU further downstream. Stable isotope data suggest that recharge occurs through infiltration of slightly evaporated rainfall. Using the radioactive decay equation, the calculated tracer ages related to two recent ground water samples collected down gradient of the landfill lay between [8-15] years and [4-7] years, taking into account the uncertainty of tritium measurements. For the calculation, a value of 2.36 TU was taken as A (o). The latter was estimated based on similarity between stable isotope compositions of nearby spring and dug well waters as well as tritium activities of the local precipitation. Calculation of the tritium activities from the contaminated water point having 22.82 TU to further downstream using the calculated tracer ages showed values of one order of magnitude higher than the measured values. The absence of hydrological connection from the contaminated water point to further downstream the landfill would explain the lower tritium activities measured. Groundwater pollution seems to be limited to the closest proximity of the landfill.																			2190-5487	2190-5495				MAY	2018	8	2							57	10.1007/s13201-018-0695-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13201-018-0695-9													WOS:000439082600006

J	Wang, Q; Yang, SY				Wang, Quan; Yang, Shouye			Clay mineralogy indicates the Holocene monsoon climate in the Changjiang (Yangtze River) Catchment, China	APPLIED CLAY SCIENCE												The sediments from two cores (CM97 and LGZ) in the Changjiang (Yangtze River) Delta were collected for clay mineral analyses, with the aims of examining the origin of the clay and the application of clay mineralogy to the reconstruction of monsoon climate variability during the Holocene. The clay mineral assemblages of the Holocene sediments are similar overall to clays deposited in the modern Changjiang, albeit with large fluctuations in depositional environments. Peak contents of smectite occurring at ca. 13-11.5 ka are primarily due to the significant contribution of clays weathered from the upper Changjiang catchment under the impact of an enhanced Indian Summer Monsoon. The regular variations of crystallographic indices including illite crystallinity, chlorite crystallinity and chemical index of illite in the cores show close correspondence with the well-known oxygen isotopic curves of stalagmites in China. This suggests that the evolution of the Asian Summer Monsoon in the Changjiang catchment can be reliably reconstructed from variation in the weathering characteristics of the detrital clay component of sediments, despite the complex sediment source-to-sink transport patterns and the changes of depositional environments. For short timescales, the degree of crystallinity of day minerals is more sensitive to chemical weathering and climate change than their absolute abundance. This study sheds new light on the reconstruction of paleodimatic change in large drainage basins through the clayey sediments accumulated in estuarine and deltaic areas where land and sea interact.

The sediment accumulation rates measured from a common horizon in cores from 64 sites on Esthwaite Water, U.K., were used to determine the relative importance of these mechanisms on the distribution of sediment in the lake. River inflows generally produced localized effects but there were indications of periodic turbidity flows to the deepest point of the lake from the major inflow. Active sediment focusing processes were the dominant distribution mechanisms, a major resuspension of sediment at autumn overturn probably being the most important. The remaining variance was much greater than observed in similar work elsewhere, suggestin that redistribution of sediment by direct and indirect wave action may be taking place all over the lackbed during isothermal periods. The relative contributions of the different processes were corroborated by analysis of previously published sediment trap data.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	1986	31	1					125	133		10.4319/lo.1986.31.1.0125	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1986.31.1.0125													WOS:A1986A266300011

Nitrogen cycling in a freshwater estuary	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Freshwater estuaries may be important control points but have received limited research attention, emblematic of a general under-appreciation of these ecosystems and the services they provide. These ecotone environments exist at the interface of rivers flowing into large lakes, where seiches cause mixing of lotic and lentic waters within flooded river deltas. We assessed the dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) retention and processing controls in the Saint Louis River Estuary (SLRE), which receives inputs from rivers, urban sources, and Lake Superior. Nitrate (NO3-N) was the dominant form of DIN and was consistently highest in the lower estuary due to seiche-delivered Lake Superior water and nitrification of ammonium from urban sources. The estuary transitioned from a net NO3-N source during high flows to a net sink during summer baseflow conditions. NO3-N availability controlled site-specific denitrification rates while sediment organic matter explained the spatial pattern in denitrification potential. As the estuary shifted from a riverine state to one with more lake influence, seiches delivered Lake Superior NO3-N to the lower portion of the estuary, alleviating the final denitrification control and activating the estuary's 'denitrification pump'. This amplified removal condition is maintained by critically delivered NO3-N during periods of warm temperatures and long residence times. Often these controls are unsynchronized in streams where NO3-N is typically lowest during summer baseflow. Similar ephemeral biogeochemical processes are likely found within other seiche-prone lakes where organic-rich sediments accumulate at river mouths and are supplied with chemically distinct lake water during low flow periods.					; Finlay, Jacques/B-6081-2011	Small, Gaston/0000-0002-9018-7555; Stanley, Emily/0000-0003-4922-8121; Loken, Luke/0000-0003-3194-1498; Sterner, Robert/0000-0003-2292-6122; Finlay, Jacques/0000-0002-7968-7030													0168-2563	1573-515X				FEB	2016	127	2-3					199	216		10.1007/s10533-015-0175-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-015-0175-3													WOS:000371606000004

Application of machine learning techniques for regional bias correction of snow water equivalent estimates in Ontario, Canada	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Snow is a critical contributor to Ontario's water-energy budget, with impacts on water resource management and flood forecasting. Snow water equivalent (SWE) describes the amount of water stored in a snowpack and is important in deriving estimates of snowmelt. However, only a limited number of sparsely distributed snow survey sites (n = 383) exist throughout Ontario. The SNOw Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) is a daily, 1 km gridded SWE product that provides uniform spatial coverage across this region; however, we show here that SWE estimates from SNODAS display a strong positive mean bias of 50 % (16 mm SWE) when compared to in situ observations from 2011 to 2018. This study evaluates multiple statistical techniques of varying complexity, including simple subtraction, linear regression and machine learning methods to bias-correct SNODAS SWE estimates using absolute mean bias and RMSE as evaluation criteria. Results show that the random forest (RF) algorithm is most effective at reducing bias in SNODAS SWE, with an absolute mean bias of 0.2 mm and RMSE of 3.64 mm when compared with in situ observations. Other methods, such as mean bias subtraction and linear regression, are somewhat effective at bias reduction; however, only the RF method captures the nonlinearity in the bias and its interannual variability. Applying the RF model to the full spatio-temporal domain shows that the SWE bias is largest before 2015, during the spring melt period, north of 44.5 degrees N and east (downwind) of the Great Lakes. As an independent validation, we also compare estimated snowmelt volumes with observed hydrographs and demonstrate that uncorrected SNODAS SWE is associated with unrealistically large volumes at the time of the spring freshet, while bias-corrected SWE values are highly consistent with observed discharge volumes.					; Fletcher, Christopher/I-4168-2012; Erler, Andre/AAE-6550-2021	King, Fraser/0000-0003-1698-8482; Fletcher, Christopher/0000-0002-4393-5565; Erler, Andre/0000-0002-2502-2295													1027-5606	1607-7938				OCT 14	2020	24	10					4887	4902		10.5194/hess-24-4887-2020	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-4887-2020													WOS:000582049300001

This article presents a study of lake ice changes in different regions of Eurasia: the Arctic (Lake Imandra in the Murmansk region and Lake Kilpisj & auml;rvi in Finland), the temperate zone (six small and medium lakes in Karelia, Mozhaysk Reservoir in the Moscow region, and Lake P & auml;& auml;j & auml;rvi in Finland), the arid zone (Lake Ulansuhai in China), and the highlands (lakes Arpi and Sevan in Armenia). In the study regions, a statistically significant increase in winter air temperature has been recorded over the past few decades. The number of days with thaw (air temperature above 0 degrees C) has increased, while the number of days with severe frost (air temperature below -10 degrees C and -20 degrees C) has decreased. The share of liquid or mixed precipitation in winter increases most rapidly in the temperate zone. For two Finnish lakes, lakes Vendyurskoe and Vedlozero in Karelia, and Mozhaysk Reservoir, a decrease in the duration of the ice period was revealed, with later ice-on and earlier ice-off. The most dramatic change occurred in the large high-mountain Lake Sevan, where the water area has no longer been completely covered with ice every winter. In contrast, the small high-mountain Lake Arpi showed no significant changes in ice phenology over a 50-year period. Changes in the ice composition with an increase in the proportion of white ice and a decrease in the proportion of black ice have occurred in some lakes. In the temperate lakes P & auml;& auml;j & auml;rvi and Vendyurskoe, inverse dependences of the thickness of black ice on the number of days with thaw and frost in December-March for the first lake and on the amount of precipitation in the first month of ice for the second were observed.

The response of ectotherms to changes in temperature depends not only on their species-specific thermal tolerances but also on temperature-mediated interactions across different trophic levels. Warming is predicted to reinforce trophic cascades in linear aquatic food chains, but little is known about how warming might affect the lower trophic levels of food webs involving extensive fish omnivory, a common scenario in subtropical and tropical waterbodies. In this study, a mesocosm warming experiment was conducted involving a pelagic food chain (fish-zooplankton-phytoplankton) topped by the omnivorous bighead carp [Aristichthys nobilis(Richardson)]. We found that temperature elevation significantly enhanced the growth of fish and suppressed zooplankton, including both metazooplankton and ciliates, while abundances of phytoplankton, despite disruption of temporal dynamics, did not increase correspondingly-likely due to fish predation. Our results suggest that trophic cascades are less unlikely to be reinforced by warming in food chains involving significant omnivory. Moreover, we found that warming advanced the spring abundance peak of phytoplankton abundance and that of the parthenogenetic rotiferBrachionus quadridentatus; whereas, it had no effect on the only sexually reproducing copepod,Mesocyclops leuckarti, presumably due to its prolonged life history. Our study also confirmed that warming may lead to a phenological mismatch between some predators and their prey because of the distinct life histories among taxa, with potentially severe consequences for resource flow in the food chain, at least in the short term.					; Jeppesen, Erik/A-4463-2012; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019	Liu, Wei/0000-0003-4063-3542; Jeppesen, Erik/0000-0002-0542-369X; 													0029-8549	1432-1939				OCT	2020	194	1-2					251	265		10.1007/s00442-020-04758-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-020-04758-x		SEP 2020						32964292					WOS:000572024400001
J	Clendenon, C				Clendenon, Cindy			KARST HYDROLOGY IN ANCIENT MYTHS FROM ARCADIA AND ARGOLIS, GREECE	ACTA CARSOLOGICA												Cindy Clendenon: Karst Hydrology in Ancient Myths from Arcadia and Argolis, Greece The history of karst science includes ancient Greek literary narratives that describe the behavior of karstic waters, yet remain largely unrecognized for their hydrogeological relevance. This paper integrates karst hydrology with ancient myth and travelogues describing natural features in Arcadia and Argolis of the Greek Peloponnese. The karstic landscapes of these two regions were figuratively represented ill the interrelated myths of the Danaids, Poseidon, and Amymone. In a nonmythical report of a historical occurrence, a deer hunter chased a deer into the temporarily flooded polje of ancient Stymphalus, but a sudden dislodging of the sinkhole debris plug caused the lake to drain so rapidly that the hunter and his prey were suctioned helplessly down into the whirlpool. Other ancient narratives described the subterranean connection of the Stymphalian polje and the Argolic springs of Erasinus. Some accounts stemmed from all ancient religious practice of throwing items into waters to propitiate the water gods: In one case, the watery disposition of propitiatory wreaths was determined by interweavings of the surface and subsurface components of the two karstic rivers named Alpheus and Eurotas. In other ancient accounts, certain rivers were said to sink Underground at the coastline, travel through the bed of a bay or sea, and resurge as subacrial fresh-water springs on the opposite shore of the saline waterbody.																			0583-6050	1580-2612					2009	38	1					145	154																WOS:000272064700013

Because of this, stratification is often continuous and far from the typical two-layered structure, favoring the excitation of higher vertical modes. The analysis of wind, temperature, and current data from San reservoir (Spain) shows that the third vertical mode of the internal seiche (baroclinic mode) dominated the internal wave field at the beginning of September 2003. We used a continuous stratification two-dimensional model to calculate the period and velocity distribution of the various modes of the internal seiche, and we calculated that the period of the third vertical mode is similar to 24 h, which coincides with the period of the dominating winds. As a result of the resonance between the third mode and the wind, the other oscillation modes were not excited during this period.

J	Hansen, HP				Hansen, HP			The influence of volcanic eruptions upon post-Pleistocene forest succession in Central Oregon	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												A pollen study of a montane peat deposit, on the east slope of the Cascade Range in central Oregon, indicates that the post-Pleistocene forest succession was influenced more by the deposition of a pumice mantle than by climate. At least 2 volcanic eruptions are evidenced by the presence of pumice strata in the peat profile. An initial predominance of Larix occidentalis suggests repeated fire prior to the beginning of sedimentation. When the effects of the hypothetical fires had been modified, Pinus contorta assumed predominance for a short time, only to be superseded by P. ponderosa as the climate became warmer and dryer. The latter trend was interrupted by a pumice fall that favored a resumption of P. contorta predominance. The latter maintained its predominance to the present, although another pumice fall interrupted a 2d trend toward a P. ponderosa climax. The source of the pumice is not known with certainty, but it seems probable that at least one, probably the upper stratum, came from the eruption of Mt. Mazama between 5000 and 10,000 yrs. ago. This eruption resulted in the formation of the caldera holding Crater Lake.																			0002-9122	1537-2197				MAR	1942	29	3					214	219		10.2307/2437672	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2437672													WOS:000200471200005

Planned and even already realized reclamation procedure in the region is based on the formation of artificial lakes. The nature of the surface cover in the studied area has changed from mining landscapes without vegetation to the water area with "green" surroundings after the hydrological reclamation of the residual pit of the quarry Most - Lezaky. The local climate is significantly influenced within the warm part of the year, when the temperature of the water in the Lake is higher than the air temperature. The period of daily temporarily degraded local dispersion conditions is extended under certain meteorological conditions and thus the time for the possible dilution of cumulated pollutants is shorter. The evaluation of the fresh air pollution development in the foothills of the "Krusne hory" Mountain during the gradual filling of the Lake in the years 2008 to 2013 proved an anomalous increase in the number of the day with the exceeded limit of the 24-hour average of the PM10 concentration of aerosol particles on the stations in the vicinity of Lake Most in the comparison with the other stations in the region. This situation was typical for the spring and summer months of the years 2010 to 2013. The similar phenomenon was not detected within the years 2008 and 2009, when only a small part of the Lake was filled. The subject of the current research is the classification of the real dispersion conditions in the context with the meteorological situation in the area and the selection of such situations in which a significant influence on the local air pollution can be expected thanks to the microclimate change. The model evaluation will be done for such selected situations to evaluate their spatial extent and the significance of this influence.																			1314-2704		978-619-7105-16-2				2014							591	598																WOS:000371090000078

The invasion reached Saginaw Bay. Lake Huron, in 1991 and initially cleared the waters and lowered algal biomass. However, an unexpected result occurred 3 years after the initial invasion with the return of nuisance summer blooms of cyanobacteria, a problem that had been successfully addressed with the implementation of phosphorus controls in the late 1970s. A multi-class phytoplankton model was developed and tested against field observations and then used to explore the causes of these temporal changes. Model scenarios suggest that changes in the phytoplankton community can be linked to three zebra mussel-mediated effects: (1) removal of particles resulting in clearer water, (2) increased recycle of available phosphorus throughout the summer, and (3) selective rejection of certain Microcystis strains. Light inhibition of certain phytoplankton assemblages and the subsequent alteration of competitive dynamics is a novel result of this model. These results enhance our understanding of the significant role of zebra mussels in altering lower trophic level dynamics of Saginaw Bay and suggest that their physical re-engineering of the aquatic environment was the major force driving changes in the phytoplankton community composition.

J	Zeno, C				Zeno, C.			THE ECOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE OF THE MARGHERITA DI SAVOIA SALTWORKS	GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL												The Margherita di Savoia Saltworks, located in Apulia (South Italy), are the largest productive saltworks in Italy. They are connected with the Apulian wetlands, an important network thanks of its central geographic position, between the east and west of the Mediterranean basin. Several species and habitats of European and international interest (Natura 2000 network, Ramsar list) are present in them. It plays a significant role as an area of stopover, wintering and breeding along the migratory routes of birds that cross the Mediterranean. The most interesting migratory and wintering species is the Numenius tenuirostris (slender-billed curlew), which is the bird most at risk of extinction in Europe. Moreover in the early 1990s The Phoenicopterus ruber (greater flamingo) has colonised the reserve in great number, around 6,000 today, making it the largest concentration of the species in mainland Italy. The Margherita di Savoia saltworks are entirely a man-made area, the characteristics of which (water levels, salinity) are preserved entirely due to sea salt production, which guarantees all the chemical and physical factors necessary for the survival of these habitats. It is also worth noting the type of production adopted in the saltworks, which makes it possible to recover the processing brine, thus eliminating one of the critical factors in the symbiotic relationship between salt production and environmental protection.																			1790-7632					MAR	2009	11	1					1	9																WOS:000264461100001

In situ water measurements of exchange rates between surface water and groundwater are, however, hard to conduct because of the harsh natural conditions of the SAYR. We here present an indirect method using in situ Rn-222 measurements to estimate groundwater discharge into rivers and lakes in the SAYR. Rn-222 was measured in rivers, lakes, groundwater and springs during three sampling periods (2014-2016), and the results indicate large variability in the concentration of the isotope. The data also indicate decreasing Rn-222 trends in groundwater in the cold season (the Feb-2015 sampling period) which may be linked to frequency of capturing Rn-222 in the frozen ground caused by geocryogenic processes. In addition, permafrost spatial extent and freeze-thaw processes have strongly affected the hydrological conditions in the region.					; Ｃｈｅｎ, Ｌｉ/E-3771-2013	Zheng, Minjie/0000-0003-2111-9476; Chen, Xiaobing/0000-0001-6074-099X; 													0265-931X	1879-1700				DEC	2018	192						257	266		10.1016/j.jenvrad.2018.07.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2018.07.003								29986317					WOS:000446289100028

It is generally considered the key driver of the collapse of several mid-Holocene agricultural societies, on a global scale. However, only a few previous studies have tried to verify the climatic origin of the collapse of these societies, using the compilation of spatiotemporal data at a large scale. Especially, the nature of mid-Holocene human-environment interactions in the climatically-sensitive margin of the East Asian summer monsoon front remains to be thoroughly understood. However, a systematic compilation of archaeological data at a regional scale can be used to verify the role the mid-Holocene environmental transition played in the collapse of late Neolithic cultures in China. Here, we present a regional compilation of Holocene records from sub-aerial sedimentary deposits, lake sediments, and archaeological sites in the deserts of NE China and the adjacent regions to explore human-environment interactions during the mid-Holocene. Comparison of the records of Holocene climate change with the evolution of archaeological sites reveals that the mid Holocene environmental transition resulted in ecosystem degradation in the deserts of NE China, rendering these areas much less habitable. Faced with substantially increased environmental pressures, the late Neolithic inhabitants used several subsistence strategies to adapt to the environmental transition, including change in agricultural practices and ultimately migration. Overall, our results support the view that a widespread mid-Holocene drought destroyed the rain-fed agricultural and/or plant-based subsistence economies, ultimately contributing to the collapse of late Neolithic cultures in NE China.

The extent, long-distance effects and potential long-term changes of these two atmospheric circulations are not yet fully understood. Here, we analyse modern airborne pollen in a transition zone of seasonally alternating dominance of the Westerlies and the ISM to develop a pollen discrimination index (PDI) that allows us to distinguish between the intensities of the two circulation systems. This index is applied to interpret a continuous lacustrine sedimentary record from Lake Nam Co covering the past 24 cal kyr BP to investigate long-term variations in the atmospheric circulation systems. Climatic variations on the central TP widely correspond to those of the North Atlantic (NA) realm, but are controlled through different mechanisms resulting from the changing climatic conditions since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). During the LGM, until 16.5 cal kyr BP, the TP was dominated by the Westerlies. After 16.5 cal kyr BP, the climatic conditions were mainly controlled by the ISM. From 11.6 to 9 cal kyr BP, the TP was exposed to enhanced solar radiation at the low latitudes, resulting in greater water availability.					; Wang, Junbo/IVH-8446-2023; Zhu, Liping/AAC-4284-2022; Daut, Gerhard/AAO-1514-2021; LI, QUAN/MGW-3061-2025; Peng, Ping'an/KOC-4726-2024; Haberzettl, Torsten/AAV-9216-2021	Haberzettl, Torsten/0000-0002-6975-9774; Schwalb, Antje/0000-0002-4628-1958; Daut, Gerhard/0000-0001-7414-1103; Zhu, Liping/0000-0002-4234-8748; 													2045-2322					AUG 21	2015	5								13318	10.1038/srep13318	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep13318								26294226					WOS:000359846000001

Cyanobacterial blooms (Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, Aphanizomenon sp. and Anabaena sp.) cause N-loading via nitrogen fixation, which can exceed the total external N-load to the reservoir during the summer. Nitrogen fixation of phytoplankton in the system in 2009 was measured using the N-15-isotope technique. The light dependence of fixation was described by an exponential saturated curve which was then used to calculate daily nitrogen fixation. The total amount of nitrogen fixed during summer months (July-August) exceeded 170 t for the 21 km(2) of open water area, which was more than three times higher than the external load by inflows. Total nitrogen:total phosphorus mass ratios (2.5-11.5) favoured the development of a N-2-fixing cyanobacterial bloom, the contribution of which to the total algae biomass varied between 50 and 90%. The estimated primary production of phytoplankton was used to calculate the contribution of nitrogen fixation (0.01-28%) to algae N-demand. Nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria were found to play a key role in addressing the N-demand of phytoplankton.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2013	702	1					255	265		10.1007/s10750-012-1329-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1329-0													WOS:000312781200021

We sampled lake waters, surface sediments and sediment trap samples (dry vs wet season) in lake Santa Maria del Oro (SMO), Western Mexico (21 degrees 22'58 '' N, 104 degrees 34'48 '' W, 750 m asl). Its present condition was assessed in terms of: i) thermal and oxygen stratification patterns, ii) hydrochemistry and nutrient status, iii) carbonate precipitation (dry vs wet season), and iv) spatial (depth) and seasonal (dry vs wet season) distribution of ostracod and diatom communities. Our results indicate that this 65-m deep lake is warm monomicitic, with a stable thermal stratification for most of the year (thermocline 16-24 m, metalimnetic gradient up to 7 degrees C). The water column is thermally homogeneous from late January to early March. Dissolved oxygen is vertically homogeneous only in January, when deoxygenation occurs throughout the water column. This is the first report of such a situation in a Mexican lake. Santa Maria del Oro has slightly alkaline, [HCO3-]-[Cl-] and [Na+]>[Mg2+]>>[Ca2+] waters. Although it is a freshwater system, total dissolved solids, electrical conductivity (EC) and [Cl-] indicate that the lake has undergone evaporative concentration. Aragonite precipitation, occurring during the wet and warm part of the year, favours Ca2+ depletion and Cl(-)enrichment of lake waters. This is a mesotrophic lake with relatively high soluble reactive phosphorus and silica levels. Nitrogen reaches its highest values during winter mixing (January), but becomes the limiting nutrient during stratification. Ostracod and diatom assemblages differ in specific regions of the lake. Ostracods are more diverse and abundant in littoral areas with dense vegetation, where the community is mainly formed by Potamocypris variegata, Cypridopsis vidua and Darwinula stevensoni. Diatoms show high diversity and low dominance in the littoral areas, where benthic, periphytic species (Amphora coffeaeformis, Planothidium delicatulum and Hippodonta lunemburgensis) are dominant. Deeper (> 10 m) areas show low diversity and high dominance, and sediment trap data indicate a diatom bloom during winter mixing, dominated by Aulacoseria ganulata and Nitzschia amphibia.					; P, Dr.Gopinathan/O-2348-2018; Rodríguez-Trejo, Alejandro/AAG-3691-2020	Ortega-Guerrero, Beatriz/0000-0002-3823-1926; Roy, Priyadarsi D./0000-0003-3284-8762; Lozano-Garcia, Socorro/0000-0002-3579-175X; Vilaclara, Gloria/0000-0003-4923-891X; Caballero, Margarita/0000-0001-5691-0773													1129-5767	1723-8633					2013	72	3					512	523		10.4081/jlimnol.2013.e42	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2013.e42													WOS:000326626700010
J	Wells, M; Parker, S				Wells, Mathew; Parker, Scott			The thermal variability of the waters of Fathom Five National Marine Park, Lake Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Measurements of the thermal stratification at 3 locations within Fathom Five National Marine Park in Lake Huron, Ontario during the summers of 2006 and 2007 found large oscillations in the position of the thermocline. These oscillations led to considerable variability in the temperature at a given depth, with frequent changes in temperature at a rate of 5 degrees C per hour, and brief periods where temperatures changed at the rate of 10 degrees C per hour. The thermal stress due to such fast rates of temperature change has been previously implicated in negative effects on many aquatic organisms. The thermocline was observed to move by as much as 20m vertically, and had dominant periods of oscillation of 12, 17 and 24h. The strongest temperature variability occurs in the depth range of 10-20 m, which accounts for 20% of the total lakebed area within Fathom Five. The temperature variability was lowest in deep regions well below the thermocline and at a sheltered area behind a reef. This variability was a ubiquitous feature of the water column of Fathom Five during the summer stratification, and the impact of these frequent short-term thermal fluctuations on benthic and fish habitat is discussed in this note.

The influence of light on the diel vertical migration of young-of-the-year burbot Lota lota in Lake Constance	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The diel vertical distribution of young-of-the-year (YOY) burbot Lota lota in the pelagic zone of Lake Constance was compared to light intensity at the surface and to the light intensity at their mean depth. Lota lota larvae inhabited the pelagic zone of Lake Constance from the beginning of May until the end of August. From early June, after the stratification of the water column, fish performed diel vertical migrations (DVM) between the hypolimnion and epilimnion. The amplitude of DVM increased constantly during the summer and reached 70 m by the end of August. Lota lota started their ascent to the surface after sunset and descended into the hypolimnion after sunrise. As the YOY fish grew from May to August, they experienced decreasing diel maximum light intensities: in May and early June L. lota spent the day at light intensities > 40 W m(-2), but they never experienced light intensities > 0.1 W m(-2) after the end of June. From this time, L. lota experienced the brightest light intensities during dusk and dawn, suggesting feeding opportunities at crepuscular hours. The present study implies, that YOY L. lota in the pelagic zone of Lake Constance increased their DVM amplitude during the summer to counteract a perceived predation risk related to body size and pigmentation.																			0022-1112					JAN	2009	74	1					150	166		10.1111/j.1095-8649.2008.02120.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.2008.02120.x								20735530					WOS:000262516900010
J	Botte, V; Kay, A				Botte, V; Kay, A			A numerical study of plankton population dynamics in a deep lake during the passage of the Spring thermal bar	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												An N-P-Z plankton model has been included in a finite volume formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations and has been used to predict the effect of the spring warming and the thermal bar on the plankton ecosystem of a section of the Central Basin of Lake Baikal. The results presented show that the currents converging towards the thermal bar generate a maximum in the phytoplankton population at the location of the thermal bar, while the boundary between the unstable near-surface region and the stably stratified lower part of the lake acts as a barrier to the diffusion of the plankton population towards deeper regions. The enlargement of the unstable area during the warming of the lake has been found to have a major effect on the distribution of the phytoplankton, with enhanced vertical diffusion balancing the growth near the surface and preventing the phytoplankton population from reaching bloom values, and consequently inhibiting any development of the zooplankton population. It has also been found that the vertical component of the Coriolis force could allow the currents generated by the thermal bar to reach the deeper part of the lake. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Landscape-hydrological phenomenon of the formation of floating islands on Lake Chebarkul (Davletovo) in the Ural River basin, Russia	SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT												Aim. To record factually the development of floating islands on Lake Chebarkul (Davletovo) as a landscape-hydrological phenomenon in the Ural River basin and in the Southern Trans-Urals, to determine the mechanisms of formation and to identify the specific features of their morphostructure, intra-annual movements and long-term dynamics. Materials and Methods. Based on images of high (2003-2020) and medium (1972-2020) spatial resolution, an analysis was made of qualitative and quantitative indicators reflecting the long-term and intraannual dynamics of the state of floating islands (mats) and coastal thickets of macrophytes (<< splavina >> or << labza >> in Russian). Results. It was established that the main source of material for the islands were the coastal thickets of macrophytes at the site of the confluence of watercourses into the lake (Yangelka River and Mogak Crrek), which periodically (during periods of extreme spring floods) lose contact with coastal shallow waters and are carried into the lake. The high variability of the states and the dynamism of the displacement of the islands, as well as the tendency to reduce the number and area of the islands and coastal thickets of macrophytes, caused, among other factors, by the consequences of the anomalous summer flood of 2013, were revealed. Being in an unfixed state, floating islands drift along the water area of the lake for considerable distances, reaching 10-15 km or more during the ice-free period of the year. The main driving force is the wind, which causes prevailing alongshore displacements of the islands: as a result of collisions, they are reduced in size and acquire a rounded shape in plan. Conclusion. Throughout the historical period, floating islands around the world have been perceived as a landscape phenomenon that deserves protection and rational use. Lake Chebarkul with floating islands is of undoubted interest as an object of geographical, hydrological, ecological and biological research.

The main aim of our study was to check which age (size) groups of snails are the most susceptible to trematode invasion. Furthermore, we examined in which season the parasite prevalence is the highest. We collected Lymnaea stagnalis individuals in a nearshore zone of the Jeziorak Lake (the longest Polish lake located in northern Poland). The shell height of the snails was measured and the infestation by trematode larvae was determined. The logistic regression has shown that parasite prevalence increased significantly with the snail size (with the individuals > 30 min being the most infected), the distance from the beginning of the year (i.e., month) and the vicinity of summer.

Generation and evolution of hydrothermal fluids at Yellowstone: Insights from the Heart Lake Geyser Basin	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS												We sampled fumaroles and hot springs from the Heart Lake Geyser Basin (HLGB), measured water and gas discharge, and estimated heat and mass flux from this geothermal area in 2009. The combined data set reveals that diverse fluids share an origin by mixing of deep solute-rich parent water with dilute heated meteoric water, accompanied by subsequent boiling. A variety of chemical and isotopic geothermometers are consistent with a parent water that equilibrates with rocks at 205 degrees C +/- 10 degrees C and then undergoes 21% +/- 2% adiabatic boiling. Measured diffuse CO2 flux and fumarole compositions are consistent with an initial dissolved CO2 concentration of 21 +/- 7 mmol upon arrival at the caldera boundary and prior to southeast flow, boiling, and discharge along the Witch Creek drainage. The calculated advective flow from the basin is 78 +/- 16 L s(-1) of parent thermal water, corresponding to 68 +/- 14 MW, or similar to 1% of the estimated thermal flux from Yellowstone. Helium and carbon isotopes reveal minor addition of locally derived crustal, biogenic, and meteoric gases as this fluid boils and degasses, reducing the He isotope ratio (Rc/Ra) from 2.91 to 1.09. The HLGB is one of the few thermal areas at Yellowstone that approaches a closed system, where a series of progressively boiled waters can be sampled along with related steam and noncondensable gas. At other Yellowstone locations, steam and gas are found without associated neutral Cl waters (e. g., Hot Spring Basin) or Cl-rich waters emerge without significant associated steam and gas (Upper Geyser Basin).					; Evans, William/J-4283-2012	Lowenstern, Jacob/0000-0003-0464-7779; 													1525-2027					JAN 28	2012	13								Q01017	10.1029/2011GC003835	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2011GC003835													WOS:000299698200001

Separate and/or synergistic impacts of these environmental drivers on pelagic GPP remain largely unresolved. Here, we assess key drivers of pelagic GPP by combining detailed depth profiles of summer pelagic GPP with environmental and climatic data across 45 small and shallow lakes across northern Sweden (20 boreal, 6 subarctic, and 19 arctic lakes). We found that across lakes summer pelagic GPP was strongest associated with lake water temperatures, lake carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations impacted by lake water pH, and further moderated by dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations influencing light and nutrient conditions. We further used this dataset to assess the extent of additional DOC-induced warming of epilimnia (here named internal warming), which was especially pronounced in shallow lakes (decreasing 0.96 degrees C for every decreasing m in average lake depth) and increased with higher concentrations of DOC. Additionally, the total pools and relative proportion of dissolved inorganic carbon and DOC, further influenced pelagic GPP with drivers differing slightly among the boreal, subarctic and Arctic biomes. Our study provides novel insights in that global change affects pelagic GPP in northern lakes not only by modifying the organic carbon cycle and light and nutrient conditions, but also through modifications of inorganic carbon supply and temperature. Considering the large-scale impacts and similarities of global warming, browning and recovery from acidification of lakes at higher latitudes throughout the northern hemisphere, these changes are likely to operate on a global scale.					; Ask, Jenny/AGL-6833-2022	Karlsson, Jan/0000-0001-5730-0694; Ask, Jenny/0000-0003-2156-4908; Bergstrom, Ann-Kristin/0000-0001-5102-4289; puts, Isolde Callisto/0000-0003-0291-2639; 													1354-1013	1365-2486				JAN	2023	29	2					375	390		10.1111/gcb.16469	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.16469		OCT 2022						36197126					WOS:000869699400001

The study suggests that an expanding and changing methanotroph assemblage is responsible for the increasing methane oxidation capacity during autumn overturn. Lakes and reservoirs contribute substantially to atmospheric concentrations of the potent greenhouse gas methane. Lake sediments produce large amounts of methane, which accumulate in the oxygen-depleted bottom waters of stratified lakes. Climate change and eutrophication may increase the number of lakes with methane storage in the future. Whether stored methane escapes to the atmosphere during annual lake overturn is a matter of controversy and depends critically on the response of the methanotroph assemblage. Here we show, by combining 16S rRNA gene and pmoA mRNA amplicon sequencing, qPCR, CARD-FISH and potential methane-oxidation rate measurements, that the methanotroph assemblage in a mixing lake underwent both a substantial bloom and ecological succession. As a result, methane oxidation kept pace with the methane supplied from methane-rich bottom water and most methane was oxidized. This aspect of freshwater methanotroph ecology represents an effective mechanism limiting methane transfer from lakes to the atmosphere.

J	Xiong, C; Li, XD				Xiong, Chuan; Li, Xudong			Joint mapping of melt pond bathymetry and water volume on sea ice using optical remote sensing images and physical reflectance models	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Melt ponds are a common phenomenon on the surface of Arctic sea ice during the summer, and their low albedo strongly influences the energy balance of the Arctic sea ice. Estimating Melt Pond Fraction (MPF) and Melt Pond Depth (MPD) using optical remote sensing is crucial for a better understanding of rapid climate change in the Arctic region. However, current retrieval algorithms for monitoring Arctic melt ponds using optical imagery often fail to estimate MPD. In this study, a radiative transfer model for melt ponds is establish to describe the relationship between melt pond reflectance and its physical properties. Using Sentinel-2 observation data, we propose a novel algorithm for the simultaneous retrieval of MPF and MPD, thereby enabling the estimation of Melt Pond Volume (MPV). This method does not depend on prior assumptions regarding the spectral reflectance of sea ice and melt ponds, and it accounts for the spatiotemporal variability in their reflectance. Compared with other high-resolution MPF and MPD products, the results of this study demonstrate comparable spatial distributions. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the retrieved MPF is less than 10 %, and the RMSE for MPD is approximately 24.51 cm. The analysis of melt pond evolution along the MOSAiC track shows the rapid expansion of melt ponds and their significant spatial variability. Ultimately, using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and machine learning, a dataset of MPF, MPD, and MPV for the Arctic from 2013 to 2023 is generated from 57,842 Landsat-8 images. Correlation analysis shows that MPF, MPD, and MPV all have a positive correlation with downward surface radiation. The approach outlined in this study is entirely based on remote sensing imagery, demonstrating significant potential for large scale application. This offers new opportunities for estimating the volume of water stored in Arctic summer melt ponds.						xiong, chuan/0000-0001-9164-4810; Li, Xudong/0009-0000-7528-6240													0034-4257	1879-0704				MAR 1	2025	318								114571	10.1016/j.rse.2024.114571	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2024.114571		DEC 2024											WOS:001392917400001
J	Sharifikia, M; Rabbani, F				Sharifikia, Mohammad; Rabbani, Fatemeh			Source routing and detection of dust storm in the Salt Lake basin of Qom in Iran	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												In the last decades, the frequency of dust storms has increasingly emerged in the central regions of Iran. This study investigated the SDS sources in the Salt Lake basin of Qom using daily visibility, wind speed, dust weather codes and NCEP/NCAR data, and MODIS and Sentinel-1 sensor datasets. Sample SDS days were selected by daily visibility and dust weather codes with 3-h interval ranging from 2000 to 2017. These sample SDS days were related to the 19 synoptic stations of the Salt Lake basin. Dust entry trajectories were determined through the HYSPLIT model and evaluated with the MODIS Deep Blue aerosol optical depth and atmospheric patterns. SDS sources were identified using Sentinel-1 radar images of IW mode and SLC type through radar interferometry technique. Analysis of variability and frequency in dusty days and wind speed indicated that in high wind speed and dusty days, frequency increases in the second half of the course. SDS entry trajectories indicated that the SDS mainly entered in the study area during April and May from Iraq and eastern Syria and also during June and July from the east of Iran and the study basin. Study of the regional atmospheric circulation represented that the thermodynamic relationship between the thermal low pressure and trough at 500 hPa in spring provides instability and ascending air in Iraq and eastern Syria. In summer, the pressure gradient between thermal low pressure in the east of Iran and the Caspian high pressure intensifies the wind in the eastern part of Iran from the surface to 850 hPa level. Investigation of the dust pickup areas with radar interferometry technique revealed that as far as Iraq and eastern Syria were concerned, the eastern part of Al-Anbar province in the western desert of Iraq was the first source, desert areas in central and southern Iraq were the second source, and the eastern part of Syria ranked the third source of dust. In Iran, the main sources of SDS are located in the eastern regions of the Salt Lake basin as newfound region, the southeastern areas of Semnan province, the northwest of Yazd, and the northeast of Isfahan in the central desert of Iran. In recent years, there has been more abundance of dust originated from the eastern SDS trajectories.																			1866-7511	1866-7538				JUL 16	2020	13	14							678	10.1007/s12517-020-05596-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12517-020-05596-0													WOS:000553890800008

The occurrence and characteristics of surface waves, near-bottom current velocities, and related suspended sediment concentrations and properties were measured simultaneously in Lake Constance over 1 year. Wind and ship waves are distinguished on the basis of their typical properties, enabling a detailed investigation of their respective importance for sediment resuspension. In the littoral zone of Lake Constance, resuspension occurred during 25% of the entire observation period. Of those observations, 54% were caused by ship waves, which therefore were as important for resuspension as wind waves. Resuspension induced by wind waves occurs rather sporadically throughout the year, whereas ship wave-induced resuspension occurs regularly during the daytime in summer and is hence associated with pronounced diurnal and seasonal patterns in the suspended sediment concentration.

Here, we analyzed downcore variations of D values of long-chain C-31 and C(33)n-alkanes from Poyang Lake in southeastern China to infer hydrological changes recorded in terrestrial higher plants during the past 1400years. Variations in D values of long-chain n-alkanes were generally consistent with fluctuations of published rainfall proxy (Dry-Wet Index) in southern regions of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Valley. We suggest that the D record from Poyang Lake is likely influenced by the regional rainfall variations, which is interpreted as a result of the combined effect of amount effect' and evapotranspiration. More negative D values during ca. AD 1200-1500 with a higher amount of rainfall suggested a wetter Medieval Warm Period' (MWP), and more positive D values at ca. AD 1500-1900 with a lower amount of rainfall indicated a relatively dry Little Ice Age' (LIA). This pattern of hydrological changes generally corresponded to the intensity of the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) as recorded in oxygen isotopic compositions (O-18) of stalagmite from the Wanxiang Cave in central China, providing further support that ASM has played an important role in controlling hydrological changes during the MWP and LIA in monsoon-dominated southeastern China.					; Li, Xiangzhong/I-8714-2014; 陈, 雨薇/HKF-1175-2023	Yao, Yuan/0000-0002-9833-5639; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				JUL	2015	25	7					1068	1075		10.1177/0959683615576231	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683615576231													WOS:000355758100002
J	Arce, JL; Macías, JL; Vázquez-Selem, L				Arce, JL; Macías, JL; Vázquez-Selem, L			The 10.5 ka Plinian eruption of Nevado de Toluca volcano, Mexico: Stratigraphy and hazard implications	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												During the late Pleistocene, a large Plinian eruption from Nevado de Toluca volcano produced a complex sequence of pyroclastic deposits known as the Upper Toluca Pumice. This eruption began with a phreatomagmatic phase that emplaced a hot pyroclastic flow (F0) on the east and northern flanks of the volcano. Eruption decompressed the magmatic system, almost immediately allowing the formation of a 25-km-high Plinian column that was dispersed by winds predominantly 70degrees to the northeast (PC0). Next, three other Plinian columns were dispersed in a northeast to east direction, reaching heights of 39, 42, and 28 km, resulting in fall layers (PC1, PC2, and PC3), respectively. These Plinian phases were interrupted several times by phreatomagmatic and collapse events that emplaced pyroclastic flows (F1, F2, and F3) and surges (S1 and S2), mainly on the eastern and northern flanks of the volcano. The eruption ended with the extrusion of a crystal-rich dacitic dome at the vent. The juvenile components of the Upper Toluca Pumice sequence are white, gray, and banded pumice, and gray lithic clasts of dacitic composition (63%-66% SiO2) and minor accidental lithic fragments. The fall deposits (PC1 and PC2) covered a minimum area of 2000 km(2) and constitute a total estimated volume of 14 km(3) (similar to6 km(3) DRE [dense-rock equivalent]). The mass eruption rate ranged from 3 x 10(7) to 5 x 10(1), kg/s, and total mass was 1.26 x 10(13) kg. Charcoal found within Upper Toluca Pumice yielded an age of 10,500 C-14 yr B.P. (12,800-12,100 C-14 calibrated yr B.P.), somewhat younger than the earlier reported age of ca. 11,600 C-14 yr B.P. This new age for the pumice falls within the Younger Dryas cooling event. The eruption emplaced 1.5 m of pebble-sized pumice in the City of Toluca region and similar to50 cm of medium to fine sand in the Mexico City region. Distal lahar deposits derived from the Upper Toluca Pumice event incorporated mammoth bones and other mammals in the basin of Mexico. A future event of this magnitude would disrupt the lives of 30 million people now living in these cities and their surroundings.

J	Gadek, B				Gadek, Bogdan			Climatic sensitivity of the non-glaciated mountains cryosphere (Tatra Mts., Poland and Slovakia)	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												This paper concerns the response of the conditioned by orography cryosphere of the non-glaciated mountains of mid-latitude to the climate impulses. It presents the relationships among the air temperature, precipitation, snow cover, lake ice cover, firn-ice patches (glacierets) and permafrost in the Tatras. The data from the warmest multi-year in the history of the local meteorological measurements and statistical models (multiple regression) have been used. The results indicate that all the components of the contemporary cryosphere are very sensitive to the changes in the air temperature in winter or snow precipitation/accumulation. Due to the diverse orographic conditions, interannual variability of seasonal and perennial, surface and subsurface ice deposits in the mountain areas may not be synchronous. However, the long-term trends of this variability reflect the changes in the global climate system. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The purpose of the study was to examine the physical characteristics of the low atmosphere over land-lake nonuniform underlying surfaces in the Gobi Desert of northwestern China. The results of the statistical analysis showed that, during the observational period, the average daytime surface horizontal thermal gradient reached up to -0.2 degrees C/km from the lakeshore to southern Gobi Desert area. The near-surface wind field of the 7 km horizontal extent from the lakeshore was dominated by onshore breezes with average peak wind speeds above 5 m/s. In the atmospheric near-surface layer, an isohumidity layer at a height between 10 and 50 m a.g.l. was observed from 11;00 to 18;00 LST. Also, a case study for the atmospheric boundary layer and local circulation analyses was conducted. The onshore breezes were found to play a major role in the vertical structure of the local atmospheric boundary layer. The numerical simulation results indicated that there was an alternating day-night local circulation in the Bosten Lake area.					sun, xuejin/K-3542-2019	SUN, XUEJIN/0000-0003-1463-9457													1687-9309	1687-9317					2018	2018								3061282	10.1155/2018/3061282	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/3061282													WOS:000423095400001
J	Zhang, X; Duan, KQ; Shi, PH; Yang, JH				Zhang Xiao; Duan Ke-qin; Shi Pei-hong; Yang Jun-hua			Effect of lake surface temperature on the summer precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE												There are numerous lakes on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), but the role of lake temperature in precipitation over the TP remains unclear. Here the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was used to detect the impact of lakes on summer rainfall. Three test cases were used to evaluate the effect of lakes surface temperature (LSTs) on precipitation variability. The three cases used different methods to determine initial LSTs, including using sea surface temperature data (SST), the WRF inland water module (avg_tsfc), and a lake model. Results show that when precipitation was stimulated over the TP, LSTs cannot be initialized using SST, which led to large discrepancies of precipitation. Compared with the simulations, the simulated precipitation were improved obviously with LSTs using avg_tsfc, indicating that LSTs have an considerable influence on determining precipitation over the TP. Due to a lack of observational data, the lake scheme does not improve on rainfall simulation, but does effectively simulate precipitation pattern over lakes, such as rainfall over the lakes was dominated by convection during the nighttime. Though the simulated precipitation using SST to initialize LSTs caused large discrepancies, it suggested that precipitation increase especially convective precipitation with increase in LSTs, which confirmed that the moisture from lakes cannot be neglected over the TP. Generally, it was necessary to monitor the LSTs for accurate weather and climate prediction over the TP.																			1672-6316	1993-0321				MAY	2016	13	5					802	810		10.1007/s11629-015-3743-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-015-3743-z													WOS:000375790800004
S	Gavrieli, I; Stein, M		Enzel, Y; Agnon, A; Stein, M		Gavrieli, Ittai; Stein, Mordechai			On the origin and fate of the brines in the Dead Sea basin	NEW FRONTIERS IN DEAD SEA PALEOENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH	Geological Society of America Special Papers											This paper summarizes the research efforts devoted over the years to the understanding of the origin and evolution of brines in the Dead Sea basin. These brines are characterized by a unique Ca-Chloride composition, which evolved from interaction of evaporated seawater filling the late Neogene Sedom lagoon with the Cretaceous carbonate rocks exposed at the basin-bounding escarpments. Following the disconnection of the lagoon from the open sea and the development of inland lakes, the composition of the ancient Sedom brine changed due to precipitation of evaporites and addition of salts from incoming fresh water. Relative to highly evaporated seawater, these processes led to enrichment of the brines in Cl, Br, Mg, Ca, and K and depletion in Na and SO4+. The modern Dead Sea, representing a recent product of these evolutionary processes, derived its ingredients from residual brines that remained after the desiccation of the late Pleistocene Lake Lisan, from incoming fresh water, and from saline springs that emerge along the western shores of the Dead Sea. Similar sources probably dictated the composition of the Pleistocene lakes (Amora, Lisan), though their relative contribution changed through time, reflecting the control of climate on the hydrological system (e.g., the activity of saline springs).

To address this, a field study was conducted in an office building at INES, Le Bourget-du-Lac, France. The bioclimatic design of the building takes advantage of the local climate, influenced by mountain ranges and Bourget Lake, to minimize overheating while ensuring occupant comfort thanks to solar control, natural ventilation and thermal inertia. It optimizes natural ventilation through features such as a green atrium with automated openings and internal leafs. Pedestal fans completed this strategy to maximize occupant comfort without air-conditioning. Data were collected over six years (2017-2022) through sensors networks and thermal comfort surveys thanks to a Human Machine Interface (HMI), which has been developed and improved over the different campaigns. The surveys gather occupant perception of comfort, clothing details, and the effect of draughts, while sensors monitored door and window openings, office temperatures and fan use. Instrumentation includes temperature sensors connected to comput ers, plug-in power sensors for fans, and openings status sensors. Data were recorded every 5-10 min using a Jeedom home automation system linked to a Raspberry Pi, with a Python script transferring data to a central database. Across the study, up to 29 participants contributed annually, generating datasets ranging per year from 250 to 17,500 responses. This dataset supports research into the relationship between thermal comfort, occupant perception, and passive cooling strategies, such as natural and mixed-mode ventilation. It provides insights into variations in occupant comfort and behavior across similar offices environment and forms a basis for studying building overheating, operational performance, and the effectiveness of passive cooling strategies.

However, the widely used soil hydrology and biogeochemistry models have their weaknesses in simulating soil N cycling and soil water movement processes, respectively. In this study, we proposed an alternative approach by simply combining the HYDRUS-3D and DNDC models to investigate the spatio-temporal variations of NO3 - -N leaching on a representative tea garden hillslope in Taihu Lake Basin, China. Results showed that the soil hydrology and N cycle were well simulated by HYDRUS-3D and DNDC models, respectively. Based on the leaching equation, the soil water flux simulated by HYDRUS-3D and soil NO3 - -N content simulated by DNDC were combined to calculate the leachate NO3 - -N concentrations with good accuracy. The accumulative NO3 - -N leaching flux during the simulation year was 71.7 kg N ha(-1), with remarkable spatio-temporal variations on this hillslope. Hot spots of NO3 - -N leaching were observed in blocks 24, 27, 31, 34, 37, and 40 with accumulative leaching fluxes > 82.0 kg N ha(-1) y(-1). The spatial variation of NO3 - -N leaching was mainly controlled by soil texture and soil hydraulic properties. Hot moments of NO3 - -N leaching were observed after the applications of spring fertilizer (16 March) and basal fertilizer (30 October). The temporal variation of NO3 - -N leaching was mainly controlled by precipitation and the spring fertilization. Methods and findings of this study will be benefit for the risk assessment of non-point source N loss and the precise agricultural management.

Next-Generation Sequencing to Identify Lacustrine Haptophytes in the Canadian Prairies: Significance for Temperature Proxy Applications	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The Great Plains of North America often experience prolonged droughts that have major economic and environmental impacts. Temperature reconstructions are thus crucial to help decipher the mechanisms responsible for drought occurrences. Long-chain alkenones (LCAs), lipids produced by three major phylogenetic groups (Groups I, II, and III) of haptophyte algae within the order Isochrysidales, are increasingly used for temperature reconstructions in lacustrine settings. However, to select the most appropriate calibration of the LCA-based temperature proxy, it is first essential to identify the LCA-producing haptophyte species present. Here we used next-generation sequencing to target the 18S rRNA haptophyte gene from sediments with distinct LCA profiles to identify the LCA-producer(s) from five Canadian prairie lakes. In total, 374 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified across the studied samples, of which 234 fell within the Phylum Haptophyta. Among the most abundant OTUs, three were characterized as LCA-producers, one falling within the Group I haptophytes and two within the Group II haptophytes. The OTU from Group I haptophytes was associated with a single, highly specific LCA profile, whereas Group II OTUs showed higher variability in LCA distributions. Our study revealed that most of the LCA-producing OTUs thriving in the Canadian lakes are included within the genus Isochrysis, which helps guide selection of the most appropriate calibration for down-core temperature reconstructions. Our findings also suggest that the temperature dependency is likely consistent within different taxa from Group I and Group II haptophytes, but that other environmental parameters may influence the accuracy of the calibration.					; Ijaz, Umer/F-3583-2014; Plancq, Julien/L-2995-2015; Leavitt, Peter/A-1048-2013; Toney, Jaime/I-5083-2012	Ijaz, Umer Zeeshan/0000-0001-5780-8551; Couto, Jillian/0000-0001-9371-3795; Plancq, Julien/0000-0001-7682-8419; Leavitt, Peter/0000-0001-9805-9307; Toney, Jaime/0000-0003-3182-6887													2169-8953	2169-8961				JUL	2019	124	7					2144	2158		10.1029/2018JG004954	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JG004954													WOS:000481443800024
J	Kulshrestha, U				Kulshrestha, Umesh			Human Induced Severity of Natural Disasters and Extreme Climatic Events	JOURNAL OF INDIAN GEOPHYSICAL UNION												This paper presents the status of knowledge about human influence on natural disasters and extreme weather events. It also reports the basic causes and related analyses of data pertaining to warmth of Delhi winters in 2015-16 and the Chennai floods 2015. Recent climate reports have indicated that the majority of the scientists agree upon the human induced climate change due to which the severity and frequency of extreme weather events such as hurricanes, rains, cloud bursts, heat waves, droughts, wildfires and floods have increased. The scientists also agree that certain extreme events have happened due to natural causes as well. In some cases ambiguity persists in classifying various weather related aberrations in to natural or manmade. This is probably because the presently available scientific tools are not capable enough to differentiate the two effects. Hence, more efforts are needed to identify to what extent natural calamities have contribution of manmade activities, such as fossil fuel combustion and land use changes. Frequent cloud bursts as reported in recent past in Himalayan region are probably due to increased human activities such as tourism and land use and land cover change, which emit fine aerosols that act as cloud condensation nuclei and trigger cloud and rain formation. Similarly, the relative warmth in Delhi winters needs an in-depth analysis of various factors. Data analysis showed that during December 2015 only 22.5% days followed the long term average minimum temperature. Monthly mean of actual minimum was 10 degrees C which was higher than the long term minimum temperature of 7 degrees C. In 55% cases, daily actual minimum temperature was above the long term average minimum temperature of the month indicating greater frequency of warmer days in Delhi during this winter. Similarly, Chennai floods that occurred during north east monsoon may also be classified under human induced climate change event. Chennai floods can be termed as 'The disaster of the year 2015'. Combination of heavy rainfall of 490mm in 24 hrs and water from the Chembarambakkam Lake resulted in drainage system failure, leading to this disaster. In spite of heavy rain forecast, opening of the lake water indicated poor planning, lack of communication and coordination between different agencies responsible for disaster management. Chennai floods suggested that there is a great need- i) to improve inter-agency efforts for effective coordination, ii) to put relevant information on-line so that social networking people can use the data quickly and iii) to provide more precise forecast so that public and concerned authorities trust it and follow the prediction to avoid huge economic and human losses in future.																			0257-7968					APR	2016	20	2					283	290																WOS:000382092600014
J	Moore, EK				Moore, Eli K.			Trimethylornithine Membrane Lipids: Discovered in Planctomycetes and Identified in Diverse Environments	METABOLITES												Intact polar membrane lipids (IPLs) are the building blocks of all cell membranes. There is a wide range of phosphorus-free IPL structures, including amino acid containing IPLs, that can be taxonomically specific. Trimethylornithine membrane lipids (TMOs) were discovered in northern wetland Planctomycete species that were isolated and described in the last decade. The trimethylated terminal nitrogen moiety of the ornithine amino acid in the TMO structure gives the lipid a charged polar head group, similar to certain phospholipids. Since their discovery, TMOs have been identified in various other recently described northern latitude Planctomycete species, and in diverse environments including tundra soil, a boreal eutrophic lake, meso-oligotrophic lakes, and hot springs. The majority of environments or enrichment cultures in which TMOs have been observed include predominately heterotrophic microbial communities involved in the degradation of recalcitrant material and/or low oxygen methanogenic conditions at primarily northern latitudes. Other ecosystems occupied with microbial communities that possess similar metabolic pathways, such as tropical peatlands or coastal salt marshes, may include TMO producing Planctomycetes as well, further allowing these lipids to potentially be used to understand microbial community responses to environmental change in a wide range of systems. The occurrence of TMOs in hot springs indicates that these unique lipids could have broad environmental distribution with different specialized functions. Opportunities also exist to investigate the application of TMOs in microbiome studies, including forensic necrobiomes. Further environmental and microbiome lipidomics research involving TMOs will help reveal the evolution, functions, and applications of these unique membrane lipids.					; Moore, Eli/MXL-8719-2025	Moore, Eli/0000-0002-9750-7769; 														2218-1989				JAN	2021	11	1							49	10.3390/metabo11010049	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/metabo11010049								33445571					WOS:000610376500001

Water levels on germination in soil seed banks have been documented in many ecosystems. However, there is a lack of knowledge about water levels on seed banks in freshwater wetlands, especially in those buried by sedimentation. Three burial depths (0-5 cm, 5-10 cm and 10-15 cm) within five water level gradient zones along the elevation in Poyang Lake, Eastern China, were sampled. The seedling-emergence method in a greenhouse under moist conditions and submersion was applied to allow all active seeds to be germinated. The experiment continued over an eight-week period in late spring up to early summer. A total of 7090 seedlings emerged, belonged to 20 families, 36 genera and 49 species. In terms of results, an average active soil seed density of 17,328 +/- 1675 seeds/m2 was found in 0-15 cm in Poyang Lake, and the greatest average seed density was found at 0-5 cm with 7607 +/- 790 seeds/m2, along with 5-10 cm and 10-15 cm with 5419 +/- 589 seeds/m2 and 3855 +/- 790 seeds/m2, respectively. An obvious difference in composition was found in the species composition of the seed bank at different water levels and burial depths. The highest water level and top layer of soil had the highest diversity index, with a Shannon-Wiener value of 2.011. Seed density, species richness and diversity decreased with the water level gradient zone from low elevation to high elevation and burial depth from surface to deepness. However, there was no interaction between inundation duration and burial depth, indicating that the water level fluctuation and sediment buried had a separate impact on the seed bank composition and diversity index. The present findings can be directly applied to the ecosystem conservation of healthy wetlands, and the ecological restoration of devastated and degraded wetlands in Poyang Lake.

Phylogenetic reconstructions based on combined and separate analyses of the datasets identified P. wrighti as the sister taxon to a P. johnsoni + P. gyrina clade. For both gene regions there was little or no sequence variation among conspecific individuals, but a number of diagnostic differences existed between each of the species pairs. Tree topologies and estimates of sequence divergence indicate that the divergence events which separated the three species occurred rather recently and at relatively brief intervals, and it is likely that P. wrighti is the source of the ancestral population from which P. johnsoni and P. gyrina were derived. Our findings support the recognition of P. johnsoni and P. wrighti as endemic species. The populations of P. johnsoni probably separated from P. gyrina about 10 000 years ago, when glaciers retreated from the Banff area and prehistoric lake levels dropped. The limited molecular divergence between P. johnsoni and P. gyrina argues against their current placement in different subgenera within the genus Physella.

J	Nagid, EJ; Canfield, DE; Hoyer, MV				Nagid, EJ; Canfield, DE; Hoyer, MV			Wind-induced increases in trophic state characteristics of a large (27 km2), shallow (1.5 m mean depth) Florida lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Nutrient and chlorophyll concentrations in Lake Newnan (27 km(2), mean depth 1.5 m), Florida showed dramatic increases from 1991 to 1998. Historical data showed Lake Newnan never had sufficient aquatic macrophyte abundance for a shift in alternate stable states to account for increases in trophic state characteristics. External phosphorus and nitrogen loads from incoming streams were monitored from August 1997 to July 1998 to determine if external supplies of nutrients were responsible for increases in lake nutrient and chlorophyll concentrations. During the study period, external nutrient loading rates were not correlated to lake nutrient concentrations. Phosphorus and nitrogen models based on the external loading estimates predicted the lake total phosphorus and total nitrogen concentrations to be 370% and 680% less, respectively, than the observed lake total phosphorus and total nitrogen mean concentrations. Consequently, phosphorus and nitrogen exports were 280% and 540% greater, respectively, than stream input loading. Data during the study period revealed strong inverse relations between lake stage and total phosphorus (r=-0.78), total nitrogen (r=-0.71). and chlorophyll (r=-0.90) concentrations. Long-term data (1965-1998) also revealed inverse correlations (r=-0.48 to -0.52) between take stage and total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and chlorophyll concentrations. Applying fundamental wave theory and using a bathymetric map, it is probable that as much as 70% of the lake bottom sediment could be subjected to resuspension 50% of the time when the lake stage falls below 19.9 m mean sea level (msl). Above a lake stage of 19.90 m msl, less than 20% of the lake bottom sediment can potentially be resuspended 50% of the time. A percent frequency distribution from 1991 to 1998 showed that over 30% of the lake stages fell below 19.9 m msl. However, from 1967 to 1990, only 8% of the lake stage values fell below 19.9 m msl. Increases in total phosphorus, total nitrogen and chlorophyll concentrations in Lake Newnan were likely caused by an increased probability of internal loading due to decreased lake levels, and not to external loading of phosphorus and nitrogen.																			0018-8158					JUL 1	2001	455						97	110		10.1023/A:1011913200302	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1011913200302													WOS:000173247400010
J	Zhou, YQ; Yang, JX; Liu, LY; Liu, XQ				Zhou, Yaqi; Yang, Jingxuan; Liu, Liyuan; Liu, Xingqi			A sedimentary record of Holocene earthquake activity and climate change from Muge Co, southeastern Tibetan Plateau	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The Xianshuihe fault zone, on the southeastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, is one of the most tectonically active regions on Earth, with intensive and frequent seismic activity. However, knowledge of its long-term seismicity is based mainly on trench excavations which have the shortcomings of discontinuity and chronological uncertainties. By contrast, however, lake sediments can provide long and continuous records of paleoearthquakes. In this study, we used high-resolution X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) core scanning of a 3.92 mlong piston core from Muge Co, a lake in the Xianshuihe fault zone, to establish a paleoearthquake sequence with a well-constrained chronology spanning the past 11 kyr. The most recent seismic events recorded in the lacustrine deposits are well correlated with the historical record of regional earthquakes, enabling us to interpret similar deposits deeper within the core as the product of earthquakes. Thirty-three earthquakes were identified within a radius of 30 km around Muge Co. Paleoseismicity was weaker at the beginning of the Holocene and from 9.0 to 8.0 cal kyr BP; there were seismically quiescent periods from 10.8 to 9.0 cal kyr BP, and from 8.0 to 5.5 cal yr BP; and from 5.5 cal kyr BP to the present, major earthquakes occurred frequently, with shorter recurrence intervals. Our paleoearthquake record is generally supported by paleoseismic records revealed in trench excavations within 30 km of Muge Co. After subtracting the event layers caused by earthquakes, pollen and XRF core scanning data were used to reconstruct a record of climate change during the Holocene. This record is in good agreement with changes in the Indian Summer Monsoon inferred from climate proxy records from Dongge Cave and Hongyuan peatland during the Holocene. Wavelet analyses of arboreal pollen percentages and principal component analysis results (PC1) from Muge Co, and records of delta 13C from Hongyuan peatland and delta 18O from Dongge Cave, indicate common periodicities of 80, 100, 200, 500, 1000, and 1500-yr above or below the 95% confidence level.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				OCT 15	2024	652								112424	10.1016/j.palaeo.2024.112424	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2024.112424		AUG 2024											WOS:001296084100001

This study assessed the relative influence of water quality vs. water depth on sediment nutrient uptake rates in a shallow agricultural lake during spring, when sediment and nutrient loading are highest. Nitrate and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) flux rates were measured from sediment cores collected across a depth and spatial gradient, and correlated to water quality. Overlying water depth and distance to shore did not influence rates. Both nitrate and SRP sediment uptake rates increased with greater Secchi depth and higher water temperature, and nitrate and SRP rates increased with lower water total N and total P, respectively. The importance of water temperature on N and P cycling was confirmed in an additional experiment; however, different patterns of nitrate reduction and denitrification suggest that alternative N-2 production pathways may be important. These results suggest that water quality and temperature can be key drivers of sediment nutrient flux in a shallow, eutrophic, turbid lake, and water depth manipulation may be less important for maximizing spring runoff nutrient retention than altering water quality entering the lake.

EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Previous periods of extreme warmth in Earth's history are of great interest in light of current and predicted anthropogenic warming. Numerous so called "super interglacial" intervals, with summer temperatures significantly warmer than today, have been identified in the 3.6 million year (Ma) sediment record from Lake El'gygytgyn, northeast Russia. To date, however, a high-resolution paleotemperature reconstruction from any of these super interglacials is lacking. Here we present a paleotemperature reconstruction based on branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) from Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 35 to MIS 29, including super interglacial MIS 31. To investigate this period in detail, samples were analyzed with an unprecedented average sample resolution of 500 yrs from MIS 33 to MIS 30. Our results suggest the entire period currently defined as MIS 33-31 (similar to 1114-1062 kyr BP) was characterized by generally warm and highly variable conditions at the lake, at times out of phase with Northern Hemisphere summer insolation, and that cold "glacial" conditions during MIS 32 lasted only a few thousand years. Close similarities are seen with coeval records from high southern latitudes, supporting the suggestion that the interval from MIS 33 to MIS 31 was an exceptionally long interglacial (Teitler et al., 2015). Based on brGDGT temperatures from Lake El'gygytgyn (this study and unpublished results), warming in the western Arctic during MIS 31 was matched only by MIS 11 during the Pleistocene.

Artificial light device for attracting pestiferous chironomids (Diptera): A case study at Lake Trasimeno (Central Italy)	ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												In recent years, Lake Trasimeno (Central Italy) has been affected by massive chironomid swarms that have been a serious nuisance to inhabitants and tourists. The introduction of 'tofo lamps', to divert chironomid midges from inhabited areas, has exploited the natural attraction that these insects have for artificial light. These tofo lamps had a high white light intensity (450 W) and were equipped with an external net that imitates the fish net, called 'tofo'. The attractive efficiency of such lamps was tested in the summers of 2007, 2008 and 2009 by monitoring these devices in areas on eastern (S. Feliciano) and western (Castiglione del Lago) sides of Lake Trasimeno. The most attracted taxa included the species causing a serious nuisance, i.e. the large-sized Chironomus plumosus, and the small-sized Tanypus punctipennis and Procladius sp. In summer, massive swarms of the last two taxa preceded those of C. plumosus. Female chironomids were much more attracted than were males by the artificial white light, with a sex ratio much lower than 1. In addition, the percentage of gravid females of C. plumosus was higher than that of females not carrying eggs. Artificial lights were confirmed as effective in diverting the pestiferous chironomids, a feature that should be carefully considered in order to limit the nuisance from these insects and to avoid spreading insecticides in natural environments.

J	Wriston, T; Smith, GM				Wriston, Teresa; Smith, Geoffrey M.			Late Pleistocene to Holocene history of Lake Warner and its prehistoric occupations, Warner Valley, Oregon (USA)	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												During the late Pleistocene, Warner Valley (Oregon, USA) was filled by Lake Warner; however, little is known about its rise and fall and how its changing lake levels effected the distribution of the valley's earliest occupants. The discovery of Paleoindian projectile points along ancient shorelines of the lake spurred us to examine them for geochronological controls to aid in constructing the lake's history. We found that Lake Warner filled the valley floor between ca. 30,000 and 10,300 cal yr BP, probably reaching its maximum ca. 17,000-16,100 cal yr BP before it began to recede. People arrived with Clovis and Western Stemmed Tradition (WST) projectile points before ca. 12,800 cal yr BP, around the time the lake stalled in its retreat. When the lake continued its decline, people using WST points followed it southward into the valley floor, where dune-and-slough topography began developing ca. 10,300 cal yr BP in response to episodic wetting and drying during the early Holocene. By the time Mazama tephra fell, ca. 7600 cal yr BP, the once large lake was divided into a series of small lakes, ponds, and sloughs that attracted people to their abundant resources of endemic fish and marsh plants.																			0033-5894	1096-0287				NOV	2017	88	3					491	513		10.1017/qua.2017.59	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/qua.2017.59													WOS:000414467800009
J	Leung, MYT; Cheung, HHN; Zhou, W				Leung, Marco Yu-Ting; Cheung, Hoffman Ho-Nam; Zhou, Wen			Energetics and dynamics associated with two typical mobile trough pathways over East Asia in boreal winter	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Two dominant types of East Asian mobile trough (EAMT) are identified by a novel mobile trough detection algorithm. The two major EAMTs likely pass through to the north and the south of Lake Baikal. In this study, both of synoptic and planetary time scales influences on East Asia are studied. For synoptic scale, southern path of mobile trough shows a higher rate of intensification that of northern path. Southern path has stronger impact on Southeast Asia temperature fluctuation because of more southern pathway and stronger magnitude of wave train. But duration of fluctuation is shorter in southern due to the downstream development. For planetary scale, the northern path shows a large warm anomaly over Southeast Asia and a cold anomaly over Northeast Asia, which is associated with the northward shift of the jet stream. The southern path shows a cold anomaly over East Asia due to a northwesterly anomaly. The forcing of high frequency eddy on low frequency eddy is estimated in terms of momentum and energy. The reinforcement of high frequency eddy flux on low frequency variation can be observed in northern path, but not in southern path. The energy difference for two paths is also caused by the variations of barotropic and baroclinic conversion. The energy tendency of interaction between two frequency eddies is only responsible for sustention of energy anomaly over southwestern Japan.

However, ice-free conditions of the lake over winter occurred three times in the 21st century, which is probably due to global warming. In order to understand how thermal regime of the lake responds to climate change, a change in lake mean water temperature from the heat storage change was calculated by integrating observed water temperature over water depths and by numerical calculation of heat budget components based on hydrometeorological data. As a result, a temporal variation of lake mean water temperature from the heat budget calculation was very reasonable to that from the observed water temperature (determination coefficient R-2 = 0.969). The lowest lake mean temperature for non-freeze was then evaluated at -1.87 degrees C, referring to the zero level at 6.80 degrees C. The 1978-2017 data at a meteorological station near Kuttara indicated that there are significant (less than 5% level) long-term trends for air temperature (+0.024 degrees C/year) and wind speed (-0.010 m/s/year). In order to evaluate the effects of climate change on freeze-up patterns, a sensitivity analysis was carried out for the calculated lake mean water temperature. It is noted that, after two decades, the lake could be ice-free once per every two years.																				2306-5338				MAR	2018	5	1							17	10.3390/hydrology5010017	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/hydrology5010017													WOS:000455156200016
J	Jensen, T; Carlson, DA; Barnard, DR				Jensen, T; Carlson, DA; Barnard, DR			Factor from swamp water induces hatching in egg of Anopheles diluvialis (Diptera: Culicidae) mosquitoes	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Anopheles quadrimaculatus Say, An. smaragdinus Reinert, and An. diluvialis Reinert mosquitoes are recently described sibling species that occur in northern Florida where the adults are sympatric but larvae develop in different aquatic habitats. The hatching dynamics of these species showed that An. diluvialis utilizes a hatching stimulus that occurs in the substrate in intermittently flooded swamps. Most eggs of An. quadrinaculatus and An. smaragdinus hatch spontaneously in distilled water, but most eggs of An. diluvialis do not. Most An. diluvialis eggs hatch when placed in swamp water or when placed in an infusion of distilled water, leaf litter, and detritus from intermittently flooded swamps, suggesting the presence of an exogenous compound(s) as a hatching factor for this species. Percentage of egg hatch was largest in infusions made from swamp soil and in hexane extracts of swamp water, indicating that the hatching factor is a chemically stable organic substance. Because this phenomenon was not observed with water from lakes, ponds, springs, spring outlet streams, and rivers, An. diluvialis appears to require the hatching factor to facilitate egg hatch when intermittently flooded swamps are inundated. This article reports an exogenous compound being: exploited as a hatching stimulus by an Anopheles mosquito.																			0046-225X	1938-2936				AUG	1999	28	4					545	550		10.1093/ee/28.4.545	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/28.4.545													WOS:000082554100002

The site has long been recognised for the preservation of sediments containing Early Pleistocene fauna and flora, but since 2005 has also yielded humanly made flint artefacts, extending the record of human occupation of northern Europe by at least 350,000 years. The sediments consist of sands, gravels and laminated silts laid down by a large river within the upper reaches of its estuary. In May 2013 extensive areas of the laminated sediments were exposed on the foreshore. On the surface of one of the laminated silt horizons a series of hollows was revealed in an area of ca. 12 m(2). The surface was recorded using multi-image photogrammetry which showed that the hollows are distinctly elongated and the majority fall within the range of juvenile to adult hominin foot sizes. In many cases the arch and front/back of the foot can be identified and in one case the impression of toes can be seen. Using foot length to stature ratios, the hominins are estimated to have been between ca. 0.93 and 1.73 m in height, suggestive of a group of mixed ages. The orientation of the prints indicates movement in a southerly direction on mud-flats along the river edge. Early Pleistocene human fossils are extremely rare in Europe, with no evidence from the UK. The only known species in western Europe of a similar age is Homo antecessor, whose fossil remains have been found at Atapuerca, Spain. The foot sizes and estimated stature of the hominins from Happisburgh fall within the range derived from the fossil evidence of Homo antecessor.

Holocene hydrologic and hydrochemical changes of the South Basin of Lake Manitoba, Canada, inferred from ostracode shell chemistry and autoecology	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Holocene record of ostracode shell chemistry from the South Basin of Lake Manitoba shows how isostatically and climatically induced changes in the surface and groundwater input to the overall hydrologic budget affected the hydrochemistry. The shallow South Basin experienced periods of extensive shell transport from isolated pools and groundwater seeps, as suggested by disparate chemistry of Fabaerformiscandona rawsoni shells from the same 1-cm-thick sediment sample. Temporal changes reconstructed from ostracode species and F. rawsoni shell chemistry include, for some depth intervals, shells of individuals that were not living at the same time or were not living at the core site. Shell chemistry before the South and North Basins became connected at 1850 BP broadly show a hydrologically closed-basin behavior with alternating periods of a more and less stressful environment to ostracodes. F. rawsoni with high delta O-18 and low Mg/Ca or low delta O-18 and high Mg/Ca were likely transported from marginal evaporated pools or groundwater seeps. Overall delta O-18 and delta C-13 values increase over time, but at levels for which multiple analyses were made, the values show a wide range, and indicate a highly variable hydrochemical environment both spatially and temporally (over one summer or multiple summers).

The underlying mechanisms driving these precipitation changes remain poorly understood. Here we collect extensive paleoclimate records and compare them with the Transient Climate Evolution of the last 21,000 years (TraCE-21ka) simulation to better understand the variations in mean annual precipitation in NEC during the Holocene. The findings demonstrate strong alignment between the paleoclimate records and the simulation, highlighting consistent spatiotemporal patterns of mean annual precipitation. Both show an increase in mean annual precipitation from the early to mid-Holocene across the northern margin of the East Asian monsoon region. However, during the mid-to late Holocene, meridional out-of-phase patterns emerged, characterized by reduced mean annual precipitation in southern NEC but minimal changed or slightly increased mean annual precipitation in northern NEC. We attribute this meridional out-of-phase patterns of mean annual precipitation in NEC to the combined effects of diminished East Asian summer monsoon, strengthened westerlies, and the movement of the westerlies indicated by the simulated wind field.					sun, weiwei/GQA-5041-2022; Zhang, Fengyi/P-7858-2019; Cheng, Jun/G-4625-2013	Cheng, Jun/0000-0003-0168-1410													0277-3791	1873-457X				MAR 15	2025	352								109211	10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109211	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109211		JAN 2025											WOS:001413782600001

Various environmental factors, such as habitat area, habitat quality, and climatic factors, play important roles in shaping animal distribution. However, the mechanism underlying animal distribution remains unclear. Using generalized additive mixed models, we analyzed the effects of environmental factors and years on the population of five Anatidae species: Tundra swan, swan goose, bean goose, greater and lesser white-fronted goose, across their wintering grounds along the Middle and Lower Yangtze River floodplain (MLYRF) during 2001-2016. We found that: (1) All populations decreased except for that of the bean goose. (2) The patch area was not included in any of the best models. (3) NDVI was the most important factor in determining the abundance of grazing geese. (4) Climatic factors had no significant effect on the species in question. Our results suggest that, when compared to habitat area, habitat quality is better in predicting Anatidae distribution on the basin scale. Thus, to better conserve wintering Anatidae, we should keep a sufficiently large area at the single lake, as well as high quality habitat over the whole basin. This might be achieved by developing a more strategic water plan for the MLYRF.

Biomarker evidence for arid intervals during the past ∼1,800 years in the central Andean highlands	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												The late Holocene behavior of the South American Summer Monsoon (SASM) has been a focal point of studies of oxygen isotope ratios in Andean speleothems and other archives, as they primarily reflect large-scale atmospheric circulation over the South American lowlands rather than localized precipitation vs. evaporation. Consequently, the local effective moisture history throughout the Andes has remained poorly constrained. Here we present similar to 1800-year plant wax hydrogen (delta H-2(wax)) and carbon (delta C-13(wax)) isotope records from Lake Chacacocha, southeastern Peru. delta H-2(wax) and delta C-13(wax) from terrestrial upland and wetland vegetation allow large-scale atmospheric conditions and local-scale effective moisture to be evaluated side-by-side. In agreement with delta O-18-based proxies from the region, Chacacocha delta H-2(wax) shows that the SASM was strengthened during the Little Ice Age (LIA). However, our record shows that the SASM began this intensification around 1250 CE, well before the external radiative forcings of the LIA, suggesting that long-term shifts in SASM behavior can be catalyzed by internal drivers e.g., teleconnections with the tropical Pacific. Independent of SASM dynamics, Chacacocha delta C-13(wax) reveals two pronounced, centennial to multi-centennial arid intervals between ca. 450-900 CE and ca. 1640-1850 CE - the latter co-occurring with peak SASM intensity. LIA aridity aligns with nearby evidence for reduced net ice accumulation and glacial retreat from the LIA maximum extent around this time, implying that despite enhanced monsoon activity regionally, reduced effective moisture locally affected the glacial mass balance in southern Peru. Our results help reconcile conflicting interpretations of the SASM, glacial, and high-alpine environmental histories in the Central Andes over the past 1,800 years.

Watercolumn data for every 5th consecutive day between April 20 and October 6, 2001, and continuous recordings of lake water level and meteorological conditions are used to infer controls on contemporary lake functioning, sediment formation and climate-lake interactions. Limnological observations demonstrate the importance of lake-ice formation and its role in haline convection and the development of meromixis. Observed lake cycling suggest that the lake at present is in a state of near-meromixis where stagnant bottom waters de-stratify through deep penetration of weak haline convective cells by the end of June. From this study, the primary reasons the shallow Greenlandic low salinity lakes develop meromixis are: (i) lack of an outflow (ii) meltwater dilution and chemical strati. cation of surface waters, (iii) insubstantial wind mixing, (iv) a weak winter thermohaline convective cell forced by cryoconcentration, and (v) biogeochemically enhanced solute concentrations near the sediment bed. Throughout the open water period the hydrological balance is dominated by evaporative losses. Lake surface water conductivities change from 2110 to 2890 muS cm(-1) due to the combined effects of open water evaporation, meltwater dilution, diffusive exchanges over the seasonal pycnocline, and boundary mixing. Freeze-out of salts and resulting deep haline convection increase overall water column salinity during winter. Owing to deep convective mixing, plant nutrients are relatively high in the upper watercolumn with a dominant internal source of phosphorous. Extreme productivity pulses of phytoplankton are observed as soon as sub-ice radiation levels increase and directly after ice-out when sufficient wind mixing can support an intense monospecific diatom bloom of Diatoma spp. leading to the rapid depletion of dissolved silica.					; Schokker, Jeroen/AEX-2297-2022	Dankers, Rutger/0000-0003-2375-5468; Schokker, Jeroen/0000-0002-8345-9356													0018-8158	1573-5117				AUG	2004	524	1					167	192		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000036132.96154.01	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000036132.96154.01													WOS:000222941600012

The water resources include the tertiary carbonate aquifer (TCA), Nubian sandstone aquifer (NSSA), springs, drains, and hypersaline lakes. Geophysical logs were used to identify various aquifer systems. Stable isotopes, major ions, and heavy metals were examined. K -means cluster analysis based on principal component analysis (PCA), hydrochemistry, stable isotopes, and mixing models using NETPATH were applied in order to understand the complex hydrogeological conditions in the different aquifer systems. The results showed that all water samples were under -saturated (SI < 1) with respect to anhydrite, halite, and gypsum minerals, indicating the water's ability to dissolve more from these minerals and increase water salinity.In contrast, calcite, dolomite, Ca-montmorillonite, and illite minerals were supersaturated in most water samples (SI > 1), showing their ability to precipitate these minerals. There is no recharge for the aquifer systems, and all the groundwater resources have paleo meteoric origin, where the maximum values of delta 18O and delta 2H are -8.45 and -65.63, respectively. All of the springs originated from the TCA, as indicated from the Kmean cluster analysis. There is a rapid increase in the water salinity of the TCA from 1998 to 2022 due to evaporation, rock weathering, mixing with old trapped sea water, and seepage of saline water from salt lakes. The significant variations in the water salinity of the TCA aquifer are due to the mixing between fresh water of NSSA (dilution) and salt water from Zeituna and Siwa lakes through downward flow in some locations, where over -extraction of water for irrigation purposes has decreased the water pressure in the TCA. The mixing model confirmed salt lakes' contribution in increasing the TCA salinity by 2%-4%. Mixing water from TCA and NSSA could be the best management of the water resources in Siwa Oasis, as well as the application of subsurface drip irrigation.					; Eissa, Mustafa/AFV-8071-2022; Eid, Mohamed Hamdy/HSF-4759-2023	Eid, Mohamed Hamdy/0000-0002-3383-1826; 													2352-801X					MAY	2024	25								101124	10.1016/j.gsd.2024.101124	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gsd.2024.101124		FEB 2024											WOS:001204186100001

P. H. Greg. & S. Waller causing sooty bark disease in British Columbia, Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY												Sooty bark disease is an invasive disease causing significant mortality of sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) in Europe, where it is emerging due to increasing drought and heat events. The causal agent, Cryptostroma corticale (Ellis & Everh.) P. H. Greg. & S. Waller, is a fungus endemic to the Great Lake region in eastern Canada, where it does not appear to cause disease within its natural host range (e.g. sugar maple, Acer saccharum Marshall). Sooty bark disease was reported causing mortality on sycamore maple and additional species within Washington State beginning in 2017. In summer 2022, sooty bark disease was found on a sycamore maple near Vancouver, representing the first report of the disease and causal agent within the province of British Columbia (BC). In this study, we identify the causal agent of sooty bark disease by morphological and molecular methods and confirm its pathogenicity in a controlled growth chamber experiment fulfilling Koch's postulates on sycamore maple. Cryptostroma corticale has so far been found in BC on sycamore maple, Norway maple (A. platanoides L.) and bigleaf maple (A. macrophyllum Pursh). Sooty bark disease has been previously shown to increase in severity and occurrence under drought and warm conditions; we anticipate rising sooty bark disease cases as BC experiences increasingly frequent and extreme summer droughts and heat events.					; Dicaire, Annie/LFS-7365-2024	Tanney, Joey/0000-0002-6151-9346; Feau, Nicolas/0000-0001-5925-9867													0706-0661	1715-2992				NOV 1	2024	46	6					596	610		10.1080/07060661.2024.2369324	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07060661.2024.2369324		JUL 2024											WOS:001268844900001

The contribution of local citizens was essential for this finding, particularly the interviews with local professional fishermen made it possible to report the presence of this species. To confirm this datum, some specimens were collected and identified at the species level by morphological characteristics. Biological parameters were collected (standard length, mass, sex, mass of gonads and of digestive tracts) from each specimen. From the observation of gonads, we confirm the presence of mature individuals in Lake Bracciano during autumn 2020. This report represents the southernmost data for this species in the European distribution range. For this reason, this population may be further studied to evaluate the adaptability and invasiveness potential of this species in southern habitats, particularly in volcanic lakes.

Lake levels in the Erie Basin of the Laurentian Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Water levels in the Lake Erie basin are inferred from glacial lake times to present. An era of early to middle Holocene lowstands is defined below outlets by a submerged paleo-beach, and truncated reflectors in glaciolacustrine sediment beneath a mud-covered wave-cut terrace. Also, the glacial clay surface above the paleo-shore level has elevated shear strength because of porewater drainage during subaerial exposure. Below the paleo-shore where exposure did not occur, clay strength remained normal. Sedimentation rates were reduced during the lowstands. The distortion of once-level shore zone indicators by differential glacial rebound was removed by computing original elevations of the indicators using an empirical model of rebound based on observations of upwarped former lake shorelines. Erie water-level history was inferred from a plot of the original elevations of lake-level constraints and outlets versus age. The lake history was validated by reference to similar to 83 water-level indicators, not used as constraints. During the deglaciation, lake-crossing moraines were likely eroded by fluvial drainage into low-level Lake Ypsilanti and a subsequent unnamed low lake to produce the Lorain Valley and Pennsylvania Channel. Once inflow from the upper Great Lakes basins was directed to Ottawa Valley about 10,400 (12,270 cal BP), Erie water levels descended in a dry, evaporative climate to a closed lowstand during which ostracode delta O-18 increased similar to 2aEuro degrees above present values. Lake level began to rise 6,000 to 7,000 (6,830 to 7,860 cal) BP in response to increased atmospheric moisture and later, to northern inflow as the Nipissing Transgression returned upper Great Lakes drainage to Lake Erie by about 5,200 (6,000 cal) BP. At that time, the lake overflowed the uplifted Lyell-Johnson Sill north (downstream) of the present Niagara Falls at higher-than-present levels. After recession of the Falls breached this sill about similar to 3,500 (similar to 3,770 cal) BP, Lake Erie fell 3-4 m to its present Fort Erie-Buffalo Sill. The extended low-water phase with its isolated sub-basins could have restricted migration of aquatic fauna. The early to middle Holocene closed-basin response highlights the sensitivity of Lake Erie to climatic reductions in its water budget.																			0921-2728					MAR	2012	47	3			SI		493	511		10.1007/s10933-012-9578-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-012-9578-5													WOS:000302381900013

Diel vertical migration produced maximum concentrations in the thermocline at night of 1 to 10 mysids .cntdot. m-3. Variation among replicates averaged 28% with a 3-net Tucker trawl and 19% with Puget Sound vertical closing nets. Mean areal abundances over 5 yr averaged 110 mysids .cntdot. m-2 (SE = 20; n = 30; range = 25 to 645) based on nighttime vertical and oblique net tows at 1-3 wk intervals during summers at the reference station. Synoptic cruises from 43.degree.N to 45.degree.N during August indicated that densities were considerably greater offshore than inshore, and greater in the north than in the south. Hypothesized long-term changes in mysid abundances were not detected. Although Mysis is potentially an important predator on Daphnia, differences in nighttime vertical distributions reduce encounters between Mysis and Daphnia during summer in Lake Michigan, such that Mysis exert mortality rates on Daphnia of < 1.5% per day; the latter are in general less than 10% of the birth rates of Daphnia populations, estimated from fecundities.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				MAY	1990	47	5					977	983		10.1139/f90-112	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f90-112													WOS:A1990DD54900015

Aquifer assessment for agriculture through geophysical, hydrochemical and hydrogeological approaches around Perumattunallur lake, Southern India	SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												This study mainly focused on aquifer assessment using 2-D Electrical Resistivity Imaging (ERI), hydrochemical, Geographic Information System(GIS)-based analysis and aquifer yield test for agriculture around Perumattunallur lake, Southern India. It comprises on quantifying aquifer thickness and yields with groundwater quality. The 2-D ERI technique was an attempt to study the geological structural and compare with borewell lithologs. The litho units encompass clay, calcrete weathered gneiss rock and charnockites. It shows that the resistivity of the top layer covered by clay/calcrete with kankar ranges of 1-12 Omega m followed by fine sand with a resistivity range of (10-20 Omega m) and calcrete mixed with gneissic rocks with a resistivity range of 20-120 Omega m. The massive charnockite with a resistivity range of >200 Omega m is observed in the hill ranges, present in the NE-SW direction. The hydrochemical study was attempted for the parameters (i.e., TDS, pH, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and Cl-) from bore well water samples briefly displayed by GIS-based geospatial analysis. The geochemical facies analysis of rock-water interaction study was used for the groundwater quality for agriculture. The pumping test helped to determine the aquifer yields with exact determination of the estimation of groundwater supply for agricultural use. The NW side of the wall is a high yield of water discharge from the lake. The average water yield of the study area is about 245.8 m(3)/day in summer and 310.6 m(3)/day in winter through the selected 7 bore wells. The alluvium clay with a calcrete layer occurs at the SE part and the results show as a low yield due to poor porosity. The radius influence of each well to be taken as 150 m was identified using the pumping test. The pumping test gives details about an aquifer of leaky aquifer with complex structure of gneissic rock with fracture/fault zone help for aquifer types. The results of the geophysical, hydrochemical and water yield test are used for groundwater quality and quantity for agriculture purpose and domestic use for the sustainable development of groundwater resources in the surroundings of the lake.					, Antonicogeo/P-3522-2019; srinivasamoorthy, krishnaraj/D-2497-2016; Mondal, N/C-5087-2009	Krishnaraj, Srinivasamoorthy/0000-0001-7111-4572; 													2363-5037	2363-5045				JUN	2015	1	2					137	154		10.1007/s40899-015-0011-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40899-015-0011-x													WOS:000514101400005

Trace metal speciation predictions in natural aquatic systems: incorporation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) spectroscopic quality	ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY												To calculate metal speciation in natural waters, modellers must choose the proportion of dissolved organic matter (DOM) that is actively involved in metal complexation, defined here as the percentage of active fulvic acid (FA); to be able to estimate this proportion spectroscopically would be very useful. In the present study, we determine the free Cd2+, Cu2+, Ni2+ and Zn2+ concentrations in eight Canadian Shield lakes and compare these measured concentrations to those predicted by the Windermere Humic Aqueous Model (WHAM VI). For seven of the eight lakes, the measured proportions of Cd2+ and Zn2+ fall within the range of values predicted by WHAM; the measured proportion of Cu2+ falls within this range for only half of the lakes sampled, whereas for Ni, WHAM systematically overestimated the proportion of Ni2+. With the aim of ascribing the differences between measured and modelled metal speciation to variations in DOM quality, the percentage of active FA needed to fit modelled and measured free metal concentrations was compared with the lake-to-lake variation in the spectroscopic quality of the DOM, as determined by absorbance and fluorescence measurements. Relationships between the percentage of active FA and DOM quality were apparent for Cd, Cu, Ni and Zn, suggesting the possibility of estimating the percentage of active FA spectroscopically and then using this information to refine model predictions. The relationships for Ni differed markedly from those observed for the other metals, suggesting that the DOM binding sites active in Cd, Cu and Zn complexation are different from those involved in Ni complexation. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such a distinction has been resolved in natural water samples.

We used fine-resolution and continuous sampling to analyse several proxies including pollen (for vegetation on and around the mire), testate amoebae (TA; for mire-wetness changes), oxygen and carbon isotopes from Sphagnum cellulose (18O and 13C; for humidity and temperature changes), peat-accumulation rates and peat-colour changes. In spite of an excellent accumulation model (30 14C dates and estimated standard deviation of sample ages <1 year in the most recent part), the potential to determine causeeffect (or leadlag) relationships between environmental changes and biotic responses is limited by proxy-specific incorporation processes below the actively growing Sphagnum surface. Nevertheless, what emerges is that mire development was closely related to water-table changes rather than to summer temperature and that water-table decreases were associated with increasing peat-accumulation rates and more abundant mire vegetation. A rapid fen-to-bog transition occurred within a few years around AD 1960 when the water table decreased beyond the historical minimum, supporting the notion that mires can rapidly shift into bogs in response to allogenic factors.

The focus is on Lake St. Moritz, Switzerland, which has an area of 0.78 km(2) and is about 45 m deep. In winter the lake is extensively used for recreational purposes, including horse racing with thousands of spectators. Safety on the ice cover is essential, and there is a great need to have a simple tool with which the growth rate of the ice layer can be calculated for given meteorological conditions. The approach is based on a simple formulation of the upper temperature of the ice layer, which depends on air temperature and snow cover. Input data are the date on which the lake freezes over, daily mean air temperatures and snow depth. For the winter 2021/22 calculated ice growth compares well with ice thickness measurements. We demonstrate that grooming of the snow has a significant positive effect on the ice thickening rate. We also evaluate the sensitivity of the simulated ice thickness to increasing mean temperature.																			0022-1430	1727-5652				AUG	2023	69	276					1085	1090		10.1017/jog.2022.110	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jog.2022.110													WOS:001038121200032

In this study, we present results of pollen, geochemistry, and grain-size analyses from the STP18-03 core sampled from Miryang in the Korean Peninsula, which spans ca. 8.3-2.3 ka BP. In-phase relationships of these proxies revealed an imprint of the Holocene Climate Optimum (HCO) during the early to mid-Holocene and subsequent drying toward the late-Holocene in accordance with decreasing solar insolation. At centennial timescales, our study indicates drier climate during ca. 7.5-7.1, 6.4-6.0, and 4.8-3.6 ka BP. Notably, our finding for ca. 6.4-6.0 ka BP contributes further evidence of a drying event in the Korean Peninsula during this period. We suggest that the Pacific Ocean played a role in the underlying mechanism of hydroclimate change in the region. A strong Kuroshio Current (KC) and long-term El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-like variability in the Western Tropical Pacific (WTP) were closely linked to the influence of the EASM over the Korean Peninsula. In particular, dry phases during ca. 4.8-3.6 and 2.8-2.3 ka BP, which were synchronous with a more active ENSO, closely corresponded to lower population levels indicated by a summed probability distribution (SPD) of archaeological records previously assembled in the Korean Peninsula. This finding implies that past human societies of Korea were highly vulnerable to climate deterioration caused by precipitation deficits.					; Kim, Jin-Soo/AAF-3359-2019; Yi, Sangheon/D-4780-2011; YI, Sangheon/D-4780-2011; Lim, Jaesoo/N-4219-2017	Park, Jinheum/0000-0002-2250-8804; YI, Sangheon/0000-0002-2938-0380; Lim, Jaesoo/0000-0001-7478-0562													0959-6836	1477-0911				SEP	2021	31	9					1489	1500	09596836211019115	10.1177/09596836211019115	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836211019115		JUN 2021											WOS:000660213700001

However, the rate at which shrubs can colonize previously glaciated terrain in a warming world is largely unknown. Reconstructions of past vegetation dynamics in conjunction with climate records can provide critical insights into shrubification rates and controls on plant migration, but paleoenvironmental reconstructions based on pollen may be biased by the influx of exotic pollen to tundra settings. Here, we reconstruct past plant communities using sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA), which has a more local source area than pollen. We additionally reconstruct past temperature variability using bacterial cell membrane lipids (branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers) and an aquatic productivity indicator (biogenic silica) to evaluate the relative timing of postglacial ecological and climate changes at a lake on southern Baffin Island, Arctic Canada. The sedaDNA record tightly constrains the colonization of dwarf birch (Betula, a thermophilous shrub) to 5.9 +/- 0.1 ka, similar to 3 ka after local deglaciation as determined by cosmogenic Be-10 moraine dating and >2 ka later than Betula pollen is recorded in nearby lake sediment. We then assess the paleovegetation history within the context of summer temperature and find that paleotemperatures were highest prior to 6.3 ka, followed by cooling in the centuries preceding Betula establishment. Together, these molecular proxies reveal that Betula colonization lagged peak summer temperatures, suggesting that inefficient dispersal, rather than climate, may have limited Arctic shrub migration in this region. In addition, these data suggest that pollen-based climate reconstructions from high latitudes, which rely heavily on the presence and abundance of pollen from thermophilous taxa like Betula, can be compromised by both exotic pollen fluxes and vegetation migration lags.

J	Zhang, J; Liu, C; Chen, HS				Zhang, Jie; Liu, Chen; Chen, Haishan			The modulation of Tibetan Plateau heating on the multi-scale northernmost margin activity of East Asia summer monsoon in northern China	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												The northernmost margin of East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) could well reflect wet/dry climate variability in the EASM marginal zone (northern China). The study shows that EASM occurs in northern China from Meiyu period to midsummer, and it is also the advancing period of the northern margin of EASM (NMEASM) before the 43rd pentad. NMEASM activity exhibits multi-scale variability, at cycles of 2-3-yr, 4-6-yr and 9-12-yr, which respond not only to EASM intensity but also to westerly circulation anomaly, exhibiting the mid-latitude Eurasian waves and the high-latitude Eurasian teleconnection (EU) patterns. The positive anomalies of Silk Road pattern and EU pattern in recent two decades contribute to the enhanced west-ridge and east-trough anomaly around 120 degrees E over northern China, leading to divergence of moisture flux and north wind anomaly, which is helpful for southward western pacific subtropical high (WPSH) and southward NMEASM. Negative Eurasian pattern along subtropical Jet leads to anticyclone anomaly over south of the Yangtze River, deep trough and north wind anomaly along the west coast of the subtropical Pacific, contributing to southward WPSH and NMEASM at the cycle of 4-6-yr. Remote forcing sources of these anomalous Eurasian waves include North Europe, north of Caspian Sea, Central Asia, Tibetan Plateau and the west of Lake Baikal; the south of Lake Baikal is a local forcing region. The Tibetan Plateau heating and snow cover could modulate Eurasian wave pattern at multi-scale, which could be used as prediction reference of multi-scale NMEASM.

The Importance of Coastal Hauling Grounds in the Life of the Baikal Seal (Pusa sibirica Gmelin 1788, Pinnipedia): 4. Behavior of Seals on Coastal Hauling Grounds of Tonkii Ushkan Islet (Ushkan Islands, Lake Baikal), Based on Video Observations	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												Remote monitoring of the behavior of the Baikal seal was carried out for the first time on one of the main islands of the archipelago of the Uskan Islands, allowing for a large amount of video material to be obtained and analyzed over four seasons (2012, 2014, 2018, and 2019). The summer-fall haul-outs of Baikal seals on coastal hauling grounds are classified as communities with the elements of hierarchical and social relations, elements of which occur during their feeding season in the pelagic zone of Lake Baikal in the form of relatively independent groups of animals. The video recordings clarify the patterns of Baikal seal approach to the hauling ground area, the ways the animals haul out ashore, and the main elements of animal behavior, under both peaceful interactions and aggressive relations with their counterparts. The main elements of comfortable behavior include body care in the form of scratching of various body areas (rubbing of the back against the rock is first described for the Baikal seal); sleep (rest); and ways of thermoregulation under various conditions of hauling out on rocks. The author emphasizes the frequency rate of body stretching and yawning as a way to restore adequate blood flow to the muscles after sleep or a period of low mobility. The well-developed mimic serves the animal to express a variety of emotions. Animals are generally reluctant to leave the hauling grounds, on average spending approximately three hours per approach, while some animals, occupying particularly advantageous positions, can stay almost the entire daylight hours in the open air. Partial renewal of the haul-out composition ( "rotation ") is observed during the day. The haul-out is completely renewed under the panic-driven flight. In addition to humans, only seagulls are capable of chasing the seals from rocks, but the seals do not respond to them in panic, but are wary. The authors emphasize the role played by individual behavior, depending on the individual psychological response, rather than physical conditions. The main known elements of aggressive behavior of the Baikal seal, such as lightning-fast head thrusts towards the enemy, strikes with flippers or claws, splashing with water, biting, etc., are displayed in response to fear experienced by the animal. The concepts of fight, quarrel, and pushing are distinguished. The Baikal seal is considered quite aggressive toward its counterparts and can inflict small injuries on them. An important role is played by "touching, " tapping, and scratching neighbors in the haul-out, as well as pacifying displays/demonstrations, including head retraction drawing into the neck, turning away the head or glances, and raising and holding the head upright. The latter two elements of behavior, in our view, express (display) reluctance to continue the fight (i.e., peaceful disposition), whereas the first element is submission.

Modeling the Effects of Lakes and Wetlands on the Water Balance of Arctic Environments	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												Lakes, ponds, and wetlands are common features in many low-gradient arctic watersheds. Storage of snowmelt runoff in lakes and wetlands exerts a strong influence on both the interannual and interseasonal variability of northern rivers. This influence is often not well represented in hydrology models and the land surface schemes used in climate models. In this paper, an algorithm to represent the evaporation and storage effects of lakes and wetlands within the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) macroscale hydrology model is described. The model is evaluated with respect to its ability to represent water temperatures, net radiation, ice freeze-thaw, and runoff production for a variety of high-latitude locations. It is then used to investigate the influence of surface storage on the spatial and temporal distribution of water and energy fluxes for the Kuparuk and Putuligayuk Rivers, on the Alaskan arctic coastal plain. Inclusion of the lake and wetland algorithm results in a substantial improvement of the simulated streamflow hydrographs, as measured using the monthly Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency. Simulations of runoff from the Putuligayuk watershed indicate that up to 80% of snow meltwater goes into storage each year and does not contribute to streamflow. Approximately 46% of the variance in the volume of snowmelt entering storage can be explained by the year-to-year variation in maximum snow water equivalent and the lake storage deficit from the previous summer. The simulated summer lake storage deficit is much lower than the cumulative precipitation minus lake evaporation (-47 mm, on average) as a result of simulated recharge from the surrounding uplands.					lettenmaier, dennis/F-8780-2011; Bowling, Laura/B-6963-2013	Bowling, Laura/0000-0002-1439-3154													1525-755X					APR	2010	11	2					276	295		10.1175/2009JHM1084.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/2009JHM1084.1													WOS:000277601000003

Quantifying responses of M exchange to warming in these ecosystems will require coordinated experimentation using standard temperature manipulations and measurements. Here, we used the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) standard warming treatment to determine CO2 flux responses to growing-season warming for ecosystems spanning natural temperature and moisture ranges across the Arctic biome. We used the four North American Arctic ITEX sites (Toolik Lake, Atqasuk, and Barrow [USA] and Alexandra Fiord [Canada]) that span 10 degrees of latitude. At each site, we investigated the CO2 responses to warming in both dry and wet or moist ecosystems. Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE), ecosystem respiration (ER), and gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP) were assessed using chamber techniques conducted over 24-h periods sampled regularly throughout the summers of two years at all sites. At Toolik Lake, warming increased net CO2 losses in both moist and dry ecosystems. In contrast, at Atqasuk and Barrow, warming increased net CO2 uptake in wet ecosystems but increased losses from dry ecosystems. At Alexandra Fiord, warming improved net carbon uptake in the moist ecosystem in both years, but in the wet and dry ecosystems uptake increased in one year and decreased the other. Warming generally increased ER, with the largest increases in dry ecosystems. In wet ecosystems, high soil moisture limited increases in respiration relative to increases in photosynthesis. Warming generally increased GEP, with the notable exception of the Toolik Lake moist ecosystem, where warming unexpectedly decreased GEP >25%. Overall, the respiration response determined the effect of warming on ecosystem CO2 balance. Our results provide the first multiple-site comparison of arctic tundra CO2 flux responses to standard warming treatments across a large climate gradient. These results indicate that (1) dry tundra may be initially the most responsive ecosystems to climate warming by virtue of strong increases in ER, (2) moist and wet tundra responses are dampened by higher water tables and soil water contents, and (3) both GEP and ER are responsive to climate warming, but the magnitudes and directions are ecosystem-dependent.					; Welker, Jeffrey/C-9493-2013; Oberbauer, Steven/JNE-2672-2023	Hollister, Robert/0000-0002-4764-7691; Starr, Gregory/0000-0002-7918-242X; 													0012-9615	1557-7015				MAY	2007	77	2					221	238		10.1890/06-0649	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/06-0649													WOS:000246181800005

However, the millennial temporal and spatial patterns of Holocene hydroclimate variations on the QTP remain unclear due to the lack of high -quality paleoclimatic records. This paper examines high -resolution stable oxygen and carbon isotopes of authigenic carbonate (818Ocarb and 813Ccarb) covering the past 5,000 years taken from Sumxi Co, a hydrologically closed lake lies outside the direct influence of the large ice caps on the northwestern QTP. The hydrological environment of Sumxi Co inferred from the covariance between 818Ocarb and 813Ccarb values was unstable during the middle to late Holocene, with abrupt increases in lake -levels during the 5.0-4.0 cal ka BP, 3.2-3.1 cal ka BP, 1.8-1.3 cal ka BP, and 0.7 cal ka BP to present. Past millennial hydrological fluctuations coincide temporally with the occurrences of glacier advances on the northwestern QTP, implying increased regional moisture and precipitation during cold periods in the region. The 'cold and wet' hydroclimatic pattern is comparable in other records to the arid areas of central Asia dominated by westerlies before the current anthropogenic warming. The four millennial -scale humid events are synchronous with reduced solar irradiance within dating errors, supporting the hypotheses that the regional pattern of hydroclimatic evolution in arid central Asia responds dominantly and directly to changes in solar activity. This external forcing may be amplified by North Atlantic cooling events and southward shifts of the intertropical convergence, which have further modulated the position of mid -latitude westerlies and the strength of the Indian summer monsoon.					; sun, weiwei/GQG-8925-2022	Shen, Ji/0000-0001-9143-5648; Meng, Xianqiang/0000-0003-3088-2211; 													0341-8162	1872-6887				APR 30	2024	239								107908	10.1016/j.catena.2024.107908	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2024.107908		FEB 2024											WOS:001197773800001
J	Extermann, G; Zapletalová, J				Extermann, Gregoire; Zapletalova, Jana			The Hvezda Summer Palace in Prague, the Villa Trivulzio at Rome, and Giovanni Maria Stella	UMENI-ART												This article focuses on the author of the stucco decoration of the Hvezda [Star] Summer Palace near Prague (1556-1560), one of the most coherent decorative cycles of sixteenth-century Central Europe. With the help of stylistic comparisons, archival data and historical deduction, the article draws attention to the figure of Giovanni Maria Stella, brother of the more famous Paolo Stella, who from 1538 built the Villa del Belvedere, another emblematic building of the Prague Renaissance. Originally from Melide on the shore of Lake Lugano, Giovanni Maria led an successfull career in Italy that took him to Genoa, Rome and Naples, before moving to Bohemia. The high point of this trajectory took him into the service of Cardinal Agostino Trivulzio, for whom he restored the collection of antiquities and directed the stucco decoration of the Villa at Salone outside Rome, under the direction of Baldassarre Peruzzi. The article points precisely to the Salone stuccos which appear to be the most immediate precedent in terms of style and ornamental repertoire to those of Hvezda, and make Giovanni Maria the most likely candidate for the Prague cycle. This proposal places the figure of Antonio Brocco, hitherto thought to be responsible for the decoration, decisively in the background and opens new avenues for further investigation. The close similarities between Hvezda and the stuccos of the Residenzschloss in Dresden made a few years earlier suggest that Giovanni Maria likewise directed this building site and can be identified with the figure of `Johann Maria' mentioned in the documents. Finally, Stella`s brilliant trajectory in Italy, his acquaintance with artists of importance such as Perino del Vaga, Peruzzi and Vasari, as well as his branching out in the milieu of Prague through his brother Paolo, are new arguments to explain, contextualise and relate the great artistic significance of the Hvezda Summer Palace in the sixteenth-century Habsburg empire.

In some cases, the body of the victim floats up to the underside of the ice, making detection and recovery difficult using traditional search methods with divers. A robust and contact-less sensing system is required to locate drowning victims that does not put rescue teams at risk of falling through the ice themselves. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of a ground penetrating radar (GPR) for detecting deceased drowning victims that have floated up to the underside of the ice. We placed three euthanized pigs simulating drowning victims under ice ranging in thickness from 5 to 26 cm. We dragged a GPR at 500 MHz and 1 GHz across the ice to detect the simulated victims using an autocorrelation-based detection technique. Results showed that both frequencies were able to detect the rough shape of the simulated victims at ice thicknesses up to 42 cm, with the 1-GHz data showing slightly more resolution than the 500-MHz data. These results show promise and suggest future development of an autonomous drone-based GPR detection system.

The chronology of an 11-m-long sediment core was controlled by 19 accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon dates on terrestrial plant macrofossils. The pollen record shows a long-term change from a closed canopy forest to open landscape over the last 6200 years: from mixed deciduous-coniferous forest dominated by Betula, Quercus, Picea and Pinus at 6200-2900 cal yr BP, to transitional steppe forest co-dominated by trees (Betula. Picea and Pious) and herbs (mostly Arternisia) at 2900-1100 cal yr BP, and to open landscape dominated by Artemisia and Poaceae after 1100 cal yr BP. This general pattern of vegetation change indicates a drying climate trend, consistent with other independent climate records mostly from the monsoon region that show a weakening summer monsoon since the mid-Holocene. The gradual increase in both Poaceae pollen and microscopic charcoal since about 2000 cal yr BP and a sharp increase in Poaceae but a decrease in charcoal at 1000 cal yr BP indicate two phases of human impacts on vegetation. The results from pollen and charcoal analysis, together with archaeological and historical evidence, suggest that human activities over the last 2000 years have significantly accelerated deforestation that was initiated by a drying climate since the mid-Holocene.

Surface and atmospheric contributions to passive microwave brightness temperatures for falling snow events	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Physically based passive microwave precipitation retrieval algorithms require a set of relationships between satellite-observed brightness temperatures (TBs) and the physical state of the underlying atmosphere and surface. These relationships are nonlinear, such that inversions are ill-posed especially over variable land surfaces. In order to elucidate these relationships, this work presents a theoretical analysis using TB weighting functions to quantify the percentage influence of the TB resulting from absorption, emission, and/or reflection from the surface, as well as from frozen hydrometeors in clouds, from atmospheric water vapor, and from other contributors. The percentage analysis was also compared to Jacobians. The results are presented for frequencies from 10 to 874 GHz, for individual snow profiles, and for averages over three cloud-resolving model simulations of falling snow. The bulk structure (e. g., ice water path and cloud depth) of the underlying cloud scene was found to affect the resultant TB and percentages, producing different values for blizzard, lake effect, and synoptic snow events. The slant path at a 53 degrees viewing angle increases the hydrometeor contributions relative to nadir viewing channels. Jacobians provide the magnitude and direction of change in the TB values due to a change in the underlying scene; however, the percentage analysis provides detailed information on how that change affected contributions to the TB from the surface, hydrometeors, and water vapor. The TB percentage information presented in this paper provides information about the relative contributions to the TB and supplies key pieces of information required to develop and improve precipitation retrievals over land surfaces.

J	Tan, ZL; Yao, HX; Zhuang, QL				Tan, Zeli; Yao, Huaxia; Zhuang, Qianlai			A Small Temperate Lake in the 21st Century: Dynamics of Water Temperature, Ice Phenology, Dissolved Oxygen, and Chlorophyll a	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												It is unclear how small temperate lakes will evolve physically and biologically in the whole water column under future climate because previous modeling studies usually focused on only one or two physical or biological state variables in the surface waters. Here we used a well-validated lake biogeochemistry model driven by different climate scenarios of the 21st century to predict the dynamics of ice phenology, water temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), and chlorophyll a in a small Canadian temperate lake (0.714 km(2)) that is oligotrophic and strongly stratified in summer, considering the influence of catchment hydrology. The ice season and thickness of the lake are projected to shrink substantially under warming, resulting in a positive energy feedback between climate and the lake. Due to the reduced heat diffusion and water mixing, the dynamics of water temperature in surface and deep waters of the lake are considerably different, with surface waters warmed dramatically but deep waters muted to warming. DO depletion is predicted to occur in the whole water column of the lake under warming, but the controlling processes are depth dependent. Unexpectedly, the predicted growth of the lake's chlorophyll a is small under warming, due to the weakened convection and the mismatch of the timings of favorable solar radiation, thermal, and nutrient conditions. For the examined state variables, our prediction shows that only the dynamics of DO is significantly impacted by the changing catchment hydrology. This study suggests that similar temperate lakes will have diverse physical and biological responses to climate change. Plain Language Summary Understanding the influence of climate change on the physical and biological states of small temperate lakes is important given their landscape's abundance on the Earth surface. Using a well-validated lake biogeochemistry model, the dynamics of ice thickness, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll a during the 21st century was simulated for a small temperate lake that is nutrient poor and seasonally ice-covered and experiences strong temperature stratification in summer. The model predicts that the lake would change dramatically under intense warming, including the occurrence of ice-free years and severe depletion of dissolved oxygen in the surface and deep waters. The model also predicts that chlorophyll a in the lake, a negative factor for water quality, would not increase rapidly under climate warming. This study highlights the importance to study small temperate lakes using complex lake biogeochemistry models that can simulate diverse lake processes and their interactions.

J	Penc, RS				Penc, RS			Moisture analysis of a Type I cloud-topped boundary layer from Doppler radar and rawinsonde observations	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY												Moisture data from radar and rawinsonde observations during three lake-effect snow events are analyzed to determine entrainment rates. Type I convective boundary layers, which are those driven largely by surface heating, typically accompany these storms. Gathered during the winter of 1990, the data are a subset from the Lake Ontario Winter Storms (LOWS) Project, which deployed a mesoscale network of sensors. Doppler wind profiler signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) data are used to derive humidity structure function parameter (C-q(2)) time-height series analysis, which are then compared to rawinsonde specific humidity (q) plots. Visual comparison of log(C-q(2)) and q analysis indicated a strongly positive correlation. Radar-derived humidity analysis is used to estimate the depth of the Type I (driven by surface heating), cloud-topped boundary layer (CTBL), which corresponded well with results from LOWS rawinsonde data. Calculations of the contribution of (C-q(2)) to the refractive index structure parameter (C-n(2)) showed the humidity correction factor (alpha (2)(r)) to range from 1.02 to 1.04 within the CTBL, consistent with previous findings for Type II CTBLs. A comparison of entrainment rates, computed via two different methods, were in agreement.																			0739-0572						2001	18	12					1941	1958		10.1175/1520-0426(2001)018<1941:MAOATI>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0426(2001)018<1941:MAOATI>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000172881500001

This paper will: (1) compile the 1972-1974, 1978-1980 and 1985-1988 investigation data regarding phosphorous and microalgae for one of the lakes; (2) complement with unpublished data from 1985 and 2003; and (3) introduce a discussion regarding three alternatives for future development of the lakes in their last phase of recovery. In the latest investigation, 2003, the lakes were assessed as almost recovered. They had returned to an oligotrophic state, but not fully to a pre-sewage situation. In the upper lake, more heavily polluted, the total phosphorous levels had decreased from an average of 168 mu g P/L in 1972-1974 to an average of 12 mu g P/L in 2003. The phytoplankton biomass had decreased twentyfold during the same period, from 11.2 mg/L to 0.6 mg/L. The Secchi depth had increased from 1.3 m to 2.8 m. The low oxygen level in late winter was still not recovered, thereby profoundly affecting residential organisms in the lakes. The low winter oxygen is assumed to remain so for a long time due to phosphorus release from sediments in the lakes.

J	Umbanhowar, CE Jr				Umbanhowar, CE Jr			Interactions of climate and fire at two sites in the northern Great Plains, USA	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The relationship of fire and climate in explaining the origin and maintenance of the grasslands of the northern Great Plains has long been of interest. I examined the hypothesis that burning was more frequent during wet years using charcoal to reconstruct fire histories near Coldwater Lake in southcentral ND, and Rice Lake in northcentral ND and published records of ostracod Mg/Ca ratios as a proxy for climate at these same two sites. Over the past 10000 years, charcoal influx rates for Coldwater (0.04-5.68 mm(2) cm(-2) year(-1)) greatly exceeded influx rates for Rice (<0.01-1.91 mm(2) cm(-2) year(-1)). Both sites showed strong, significant periodicities of similar to 1500-1800, similar to 800-900 and similar to 130-140 years but charcoal maxima and minima were only similar at similar to 4200 cal years BP. Charcoal influx during the past 2000 years also revealed strong periodicities of between 310-400 and 140 years at both sites. Comparison of smoothed charcoal influxes and ostracod Mg/Ca ratios suggests that both proxies are responding to changes in climate. When smoothed with a 320-400-year window, increases in charcoal influx typically preceded rises in ostracod Mg/Ca ratio by similar to 50-100 years, and further smoothing (140-year window) of the residuals suggested a variable relationship between Mg/Ca ratios and charcoal influx. These results do not clearly support or reject the fuel limitation hypothesis, and this lack of clear support may result from (a) climate-driven shifts in the mix of C-3 and C-4 grasses resulting in maximum productivity at intermediate moisture levels, (b) possibly different responses of charcoal and Mg/Ca ratios to summer vs. winter precipitation, or (c) ground-water driven lags in the response of Mg/Ca ratios to shifts in climate. Comparison of the results from this study with other studies suggests that links between fire and fuels at finer time scales (0-100 years) may be broadly constrained by longer term (similar to 500-2000 years) patterns of climate in the northern Great Plains.

To elucidate possible causes of the MI, here we present three high-resolution, precisely dated oxygen-isotope records of stalagmites from Qingtian and Hulu Caves in China, reflecting changes in the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) then. Based on well-established chronologies using precise Th-230 dates and annual-band counting results, the two-cave delta O-18 profiles of similar to 7-yr resolution match well at decadal timescales. Both of the two-cave records document an abrupt weakening (2%. of delta O-18 rise within 20 yr) in the EASM at similar to 16.1 ka, coinciding with the transition of the two-phased MI reconstructed from New Mexico's Lake Estancia. Our results indicate that the maximum southward displacement of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone and associated southward shift of polar jet stream may generate this two-phase feature of the MI during that time. We also discover a linear relationship among decreasing EASM intensity, rising atmospheric CO2 and weakening Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation between the MI and Younger Dryas episodes, suggesting a strong coupling of atmospheric/oceanic circulations in response to the millennial-scale forcing, which in turn regulates global climate changes and carbon cycles.

J	Han, SZ; Sun, JQ				Han, Shuangze; Sun, Jianqi			Connection between the November snow cover over northeast Asia and the following January precipitation in southern China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												In this paper, the connection between the November northeast Asian snow cover and the following winter precipitation over southern China is studied for the period of 1979-2014. The results indicate that, when there is more November snow cover over northeast Asia, the precipitation in southern China is depressed during the following January, and vice versa. Mechanism analysis suggests that the troposphere-stratosphere interaction may play an important role in the delayed connection between the two. The more November snow cover over northeast Asia could enhance the vertical propagation of the wave activity, and it could also weaken the westerly winds over northern Asia in the troposphere by decreasing the meridional temperature gradient over the region. The persistent weakening of the tropospheric westerly winds is in favour of the upward propagation of the wave activity into the stratosphere in November and December, and the associated convergence anomalies of the E-P flux in the stratosphere induce the weakened stratospheric polar vortex. Thereafter, the abnormal polar vortex propagates downward to the lower troposphere and produces a low pressure anomaly to the east of Lake Baikal during January. Such a low pressure anomaly tends to strengthen the southward invasion of the cold air to southern China, which is unfavourable for the precipitation there. This leading signal of the November snow cover over northeast Asia provides a potential source for the prediction of the January precipitation over southern China.

This may lead to low redox conditions and accumulation of phosphate and ammonia in the hypolimnion. Hypolimnetic oxygenation has been used as a lake management strategy to improve the water quality in five eutrophic dimictic Danish lakes where oxygenation was conducted for 4-20 years. In one lake, the hypolimnetic oxygen concentration clearly improved by oxygenation, whereas the other four lakes still exhibited low mean summer levels (< 2.2 mg O-2 l(-1)). Oxygenation generally increased the hypolimnetic water temperature by 0.5-2A degrees C, but in one lake it increased by 4-6A degrees C. In all lakes, oxygenation significantly reduced the hypolimnetic concentrations of phosphorus and ammonia during stratification. The accumulation of phosphorus and ammonia typically decreased by 40-88%. In two lakes oxygenation was stopped for 1-2 years and here hypolimnion concentrations of both phosphorus and ammonia increased again. Surface water quality only improved in one lake, but was likely also influenced by simultaneously occurring changes in external nutrient loading. Overall, it is concluded that hypolimnetic oxygenation reduces the hypolimnetic accumulation of phosphorus and ammonia and may prevent anoxia in the deeper parts of the lake. However, long-term oxygenation is required and it is uncertain whether the overall lake water quality can be improved by oxygenation. Reduction of the external nutrient loading is still essential to improve lake water quality.

These processes in cohesive sediment rivers are not fully understood. Therefore, this paper demonstrates the impact of river ice cover on sediment transport, i.e. turbidity, suspended sediment loads and erosion potential, compared with a river with ice-free flow conditions. The present sediment transportation conditions during the annual cycle are analysed, and the implications of climate change on wintertime geomorphological processes are estimated. A one-dimensional hydrodynamic model has been applied to the Kokemaenjoki River in Southwest Finland. The shear stress forces directed to the river bed are simulated with present and projected hydroclimatic conditions. The results of shear stress simulations indicate that a thermally formed smooth ice cover diminishes river bed erosion, compared with an ice-free river with similar discharges. Based on long-term field data, the river ice cover reduces turbidity statistically significantly. Furthermore, suspended sediment concentrations measured in ice-free and ice-covered river water reveal a diminishing effect of ice cover on riverine sediment load. The hydrodynamic simulations suggest that the influence of rippled ice cover on shear stress is varying. Climate change is projected to increase the winter discharges by 27-77% on average by 2070-2099. Thus, the increasing winter discharges and possible diminishing ice cover periods both increase the erosion potential of the river bed. Hence, the wintertime sediment load of the river is expected to become larger in the future. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	EVANS, MS				EVANS, MS			LARGE-LAKE RESPONSES TO DECLINES IN THE ABUNDANCE OF A MAJOR FISH PLANKTIVORE - THE LAKE-MICHIGAN EXAMPLE	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Alewife abundances declined dramatically in southeastern Lake Michigan over 1973-77, several years before the lakewide decline occurred. The regional effects of this decline on adult copepod abundances, zooplankton biomass, and water clarity are examined. In the offshore region, the two largest copepods, Limnocalanus macrurus and Diaptomus sicilis, increased in abundance during the mid-1970''s, reflecting the decrease in alewife predation. Limnocalanus macrurus abundances declined in later years, reflecting increased predation pressures from the increasing bloater population. The small-bodied D. minutus and the medium-bodied D. ashlandi exhibited no apparent response to the decline in alewife abundance. Large-bodied D. oregonensis and small-bodied C. bicuspidatus thomasi declined in abundance. Size-selective fish predation pressures continued to remain high in the inshore region: increased abundances of yellow perch and rainbow smelt apparently compensated for the alewife decline. Zooplankton biomass, zooplankton mean dry weight, and water clarity apparently were not affected by the decline in either the inshore or offshore region. The results of this study are evaluated in terms of the lakewide decline in alewife abundance, the summer 1983 dominance of Daphnia pulicaria in offshore waters, the 1983 marked improvement in offshore water clarity, and later changes in summer offshore D. pulicaria populations.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				SEP	1990	47	9					1738	1754		10.1139/f90-198	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f90-198													WOS:A1990DX55200011

High Microbial Diversity Despite Extremely Low Biomass in a Deep Karst Aquifer	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Despite the importance of karst aquifers as a source of drinking water, little is known about the role of microorganisms in maintaining the quality of this water. One of the limitations in exploring the microbiology of these environments is access, which is usually limited to wells and surface springs. In this study, we compared the microbiology of the Madison karst aquifer sampled via the potentiometric lakes of Wind Cave with surface sampling wells and a spring. Our data indicated that only the Streeter Well (STR), which is drilled into the same hydrogeologic domain as the Wind Cave Lakes (WCL), allowed access to water with the same low biomass (1.56-9.25 x 10(3) cells mL(-1)). Filtration of similar to 300 L of water from both of these sites through a 0.2 mu m filter allowed the collection of sufficient cells for DNA extraction, PCR amplification of 16S rRNA gene sequences, and identification through pyrosequencing. The results indicated that bacteria (with limited archaea and no detectable eukaryotic organisms) dominated both water samples; however, there were significant taxonomic differences in the bacterial populations of the samples. The STR sample was dominated by a single phylotype within the Gammaproteobacteria (Order Acidithiobacillales), which dramatically reduced the overall diversity and species richness of the population. In WCL, despite less organic carbon, the bacterial population was significantly more diverse, including significant contributions from the Gammaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria, Planctomycetes, Fusobacter, and Omnitrophica phyla. Comparisons with similar oligotrophic environments suggest that karst aquifers have a greater species richness than comparable surface environs. These data also demonstrate that Wind Cave provides a unique opportunity to sample a deep, subterranean aquifer directly, and that the microbiology of such aquifers may be more complex than previously anticipated.

The two ponds were located at a distance of about 0.5 km from one another in a post-agricultural landscape in the Mazurian Lakeland, north-eastern Poland. We examined the community structure and migration rates of adults and juveniles. The amphibian breeding communities were similar in the two ponds in each year. The moor frog Rana arvalis was the most common species and comprised between 35 and 55 % of all adult amphibians migrating to both ponds. The new pond was colonized by adult amphibians in the first spring after its creation. In the second year, the amphibian migration rates doubled in the new pond and remained stable over the next two years. However, during the entire period of the study the old pond was a more attractive spawning site than the new pond, when measured by the number of migrating individuals of all recorded species. Despite some annual variation, there were no significant differences between the ponds in terms of the sex structure, mean body mass or migration timing of the predominant amphibian species. The most probable explanation for the observed differences in the rates of migration is breeding site fidelity.					; Mętrak, Monika/HMO-6034-2023	Metrak, Monika/0000-0002-6069-6041; Brzezinski, Marcin/0000-0002-6300-0425													0139-7893	1573-1189				NOV	2014	63	3					161	170																WOS:000346330800003

Here, we present the results of analyses of the shell geochemistry of Radix sp. from an exposed terrace of Nam Co lake on the south-central Tibetan Plateau. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating reveals that deep-water lacustrine sediments formed between ca. 4.4 and 2.2 ka, suggesting a high and stable lake level significantly above the present. The results of Sr/Ca, C-13 and O-18 analyses of the fossil shells of Radix sp. indicate that during the mid- to late-Holocene, lake-level variations in Nam Co were mainly controlled by variations in the Indian Summer Monsoon. A trend of decreasing evaporation also played an important role. Comparison with other results suggests a consistent pattern of mid- to late-Holocene lake-level changes across a large area of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions to the south, which had a similar causal mechanism. Finally, our results indicate that fossil shells of the gastropod Radix sp. of the lakes on the Tibetan Plateau are a valuable archive for reconstructing the regional paleohydrology and paleoclimatology.					chen, feng/P-7135-2019	Chen, Feng/0000-0001-6210-8146													0959-6836	1477-0911				APR	2017	27	4					594	604		10.1177/0959683616670247	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683616670247													WOS:000400198600009

The studied habitats included the limnetic zone and two littoral zones, each dominated by a different type of emergent macrophyte, reed grass (Glyceria maxima) and common reed (Phragmites australis). Species richness (calculated as number of taxa) was higher in both littoral zones than in the limnetic zone. The seasonal development of limnetic and littoral zooplankton communities differed. In contrast to the two littoral zones, close correlation with chlorophyll-a concentration was found for rotifers and cladocerans in the limnetic zone. Moreover, cladocerans inhabiting littoral areas (mainly Bosmina longirostris) reached annual maxima during spring when chlorophyll-a concentrations were low.

Four novel bacterial strains were selected for the experimentation: Gordonia amicalis S2S5, Rhodococcus erythropolis S2W2, Acinetobacter tibetensis S2S8, and Acinetobacter puyangensis S1W1. The four isolates can use diesel oil as their sole carbon source, and some exhibited a relatively high emulsifying capacity and ability to adhere to hydrocarbons. Furthermore, genome analyses revealed the presence of genes associated with the degradation, detoxification, and transport of various contaminants. Mesocosm experiments demonstrated that the bioaugmentation enhanced the capacities of the native lake microbial communities to remove hydrocarbons, although drastic changes in their composition (analysed through Next-Generation Sequencing-NGS) were observed. Taken together, these results suggest that naturally contaminated environments can serve as a valuable reservoir of microorganisms with significant biotechnological potential, particularly in the field of bioremediation. However, a complete understanding of the ability of the isolated bacterial strains to efficiently degrade contaminants requires further research to fully assess their capabilities and limitations across different settings.

In this paper, we obtained records of pollen, algae, sediment grain-size, and other environmental proxies, from a late Holocene sediment core (CFD-E) from the Caofeidian area, on the northwest coast of the Bay of Bohai, China. Our results indicate three major stages of environmental change. During Stage I (3500-2800 cal yr BP), arboreal pollen content was high (mostly >60%), especially for Pinus and Quercus, and the PCA sample scores on Axis 1 were negative indicating that regional vegetation was temperate broadleaved forest and the climate was wet. During Stage II (2800-2350 cal yr BP), the arboreal pollen content decreased substantially (mostly <40%), and the PCA Axis 1 sample scores were positive indicating a decrease in forest vegetation, grassland expansion, and a drier climate. During Stage III (2350-1400 cal yr BP), the arboreal pollen content increased again (mostly >40%), although it remained lower than during Stage I, indicating that forests expanded under a relatively humid climate while the wetland area decreased slightly. Our results also record the 2.8 ka and 2.4 ka events of monsoon weakening, which were characterized by increases in herbaceous pollen (indicating grassland expansion) and the drying of the regional climate. There are several differences in the regional expression of these two climatic events. During the 2.4 ka event, Chenopodiaceae pollen increased substantially (average of 42.0%), indicating the expansion of halophytes; whereas during the 2.8 ka event, an increase in Artemisia indicates the occurrence of a dry climate throughout the region. We suggest that the aridity during the 2.8 ka event was triggered by decreased solar activity and the resulting changes in the El Nin similar to o-Southern Oscillation, which weakened the East Asian summer monsoon. However, we suggest that the 2.4 ka event was driven by the weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation.

J	Kolerski, T				Kolerski, Tomasz			Mathematical Modeling of Ice Dynamics as a Decision Support Tool in River Engineering	WATER												The prediction of winter flooding is a complicated task since it is affected by many meteorological and hydraulic factors. Typically, information on river ice conditions is based on historical observations, which are usually incomplete. Recently, data have been supplemented by information extracted from satellite images. All the above mentioned factors provide a good background of the characteristics of ice processes, but are not sufficient for a detailed analysis of river ice, which is highly dynamic and has a local extent. The main aim of this paper is to show the possibility of the prediction of ice jams in a river using a mathematical model. The case of the Odra River was used here. Within the Lower and Middle Odra River, the most significant flood risk, in winter conditions, is posed by ice jams created when movable ice is stopped by existing obstacles such as shallow areas in the riverbed, the narrowing of the riverbed, and other obstacles caused as a result of sudden changes of the river current, backwater from sea waters, and north winds, which contribute to the creation of ice jams. This in turn causes the damming of water and flooding of adjacent areas. The DynaRICE model was implemented at two locations along the Odra River, previously selected as ice-prone areas. Also, a thermal simulation of ice cover formation on Lake Dbie was shown with variable discharge. The results of numerical simulations showed a high risk of ice jamming on the Odra River, created within one day of ice moving downstream. The prediction of the place and timing, as well as the extent, of the ice jam is impossible without the application of a robust mathematical model.

IGNEOUS ORIGIN OF CO2 IN ANCIENT AND RECENT HOT-SPRING WATERS AND TRAVERTINES FROM THE NORTHERN ARGENTINEAN ANDES	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												Thermal travertines are an archive of CO2 sources and sinks in hydrothermal systems. Two major regional factors control travertine precipitation: water availability and CO2 supply. Thus, travertines; form a valuable archive of hydrodynamic variability and sources of main contributions to dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). It is relevant to determine the main DIC sources of thermal waters (i.e., organic-matter degradation, recycled from older carbonates, emission of deep-seated magmatic CO2), as they are key inputs to calculate the lithosphere-atmosphere CO2 budget. The Antuco travertine from the Central Andes represents one of such archives, with a 500 ky record of accretionary periods (dated as 425-320, 260, and 155 ky BP) related to high hydrothermal activity of hot springs. It consists of two travertine units: (1) a lower massive unit displaying large calcite pseudomorphs after aragonite that precipitated in proximal ponds with abundant water, and (2) an upper stratified unit showing more distal facies bearing siliciclastics and manganese and iron oxides. The replacement of aragonite by calcite in the lower unit was related to the decrease of water salinity in the thermal system through time. In the Antuco travertine, DIC delta C-13 values of travertine parental waters of around -9 parts per thousand suggest that CO2 was related to igneous processes and volcanic activity, and released along deep-seated faults. Relative water/rock ratios derived from delta O-18 values and fluid-inclusion microthermometric data from travertine carbonates are consistent with an interpretation of greater water availability in the hydrothermal system during the late Pleistocene than at present. The different petrographic features and isotopic signatures are interpreted to reflect increased water availability during more humid periods in the Altiplano, which triggered precipitation of travertine bodies. Travertine growth took place during interglacial-humid climate periods between Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 3 and 9, which correspond to highstand events in large lakes of the Andean Altiplano. Results of this study illustrate that volcanic activity, furnishing rather constant CO2 and heat fluxes, were the key controls of thermalism in the Altiplane region during the Quaternary, whilst climatic changes (humid vs. arid periods in the late Pleistocene) controlled mineralogy, facies, and architecture of the travertines. The combined use of delta C-13 and Sr-87/Sr-86 signatures in carbonate precipitates has been proven to be of major relevance to evaluate the CO2 sources along fault zones in this study.

Eolian sand sheet deposition in the San Luis paleodune field, western Argentina as an indicator of a semi-arid environment through the Holocene	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Eolian deposits are common in the western Pampas of Argentina, and most are assumed to be associated with glacial conditions. Stratigraphic and sedimentologic studies coupled with OSL dating in San Luis Province document for the first time a nearly continuous sequence of eolian sand sheet deposits that span most of the Holocene. Petrology and geochemical analyses indicate that the source of the sand is from pre-existing Pleistocene eolian sediments. Sand sheet deposition between Ca. 12 and 1 ka is associated with sparse, Monte-type vegetation that occurs with drier conditions (MAP 450-100 mm) than the late 20th century (similar to 700 mm). This paleoenvironmental inference is consistent with nearby pollen and lake level records. A persistent semi-arid environment in western Argentina during the Holocene may reflect sustained warm SSTs in the western equatorial Atlantic Ocean, which may have suppressed the pressure gradient between the South Atlantic Anticyclone and Chaco Low and thus, the flux of summer moisture to western Argentina. There appears to be a paleoclimatic "dipole" response between a dry western Argentina and a wet southeastern Brazil, which is consistent with the increasing strength of the South American Monsoon through the Holocene. Sand sheet accretion appears to cease by 800 to 200 years ago with wetter conditions and succession to Espinal vegetation prior to European contact. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Lyu, Y; Huang, Y; Bao, AM; Zhong, RS; Yang, H				Lyu, Ye; Huang, Yue; Bao, Anming; Zhong, Ruisen; Yang, Han			Temporal/Spatial Variation of Terrestrial Water Storage and Groundwater Storage in Typical Inland River Basins of Central Asia	WATER												In this study, the Amu Darya river basin, Syr Darya river basin and Balkhash lake basin in Central Asia were selected as typical study areas. Temporal/spatial changes from 2002 to 2016 in the terrestrial water storage (TWS) and the groundwater storage (GWS) were analyzed, based on RL06 Mascon data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite, and the sum of soil water content, snow water equivalent and canopy water data that were obtained from Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS). Combing meteorological data and land use and cover change (LUCC) data, the joint impact of both human activities and climate change on the terrestrial water storage change (TWSC) and the groundwater storage change (GWSC) was evaluated by statistical analysis. The results revealed three findings: (1) The TWS retrieved by CSR (Center for Space Research) and the JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) showed a decreasing trend in the three basins, and the variation of TWS showed a maximum surplus in spring (March-May) and a maximum deficit in autumn (September-November). (2) The decreasing rates of groundwater storage that were extracted, based on JPL and CSR Mascon data sets, were -2.17 mm/year and -3.90 mm/year, -3.72 mm/year and -4.96 mm/year, -1.74 mm/year and -3.36 mm/year in the Amu Darya river basin, Syr Darya river basin and Balkhash lake basin, respectively. (3) In the Amu Darya river basin, annual precipitation showed a decreasing trend, while the evapotranspiration rate showed an increasing trend due to an increasing temperature, and the TWS decreased from 2002 to 2016 in most areas of the basin. However, in the middle reaches of the Amu Darya river basin, the TWS increased due to the increase in cultivated land area, water income from flooded irrigation, and reservoir impoundment. In the upper reaches of the Syr Darya river basin, the increase in precipitation in alpine areas leads to an increase in glacier and snow meltwater, which is the reason for the increase in the TWS. In the middle and lower reaches of the Syr Darya river basin, the amount of evapotranspiration dissipation exceeds the amount of water replenished by agricultural irrigation, which leads to a decrease in TWS and GWS. The increase in precipitation in the northwest of the Balkhash lake basin, the increase in farmland irrigation water, and the topography (higher in the southeast and lower in the northwest) led to an increase in TWS and GWS in the northwest of the Balkhash lake basin. This study can provide useful information for water resources management in the inland river basins of Central Asia.																				2073-4441				DEC	2021	13	23							3385	10.3390/w13233385	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13233385													WOS:000734627200001

Phytoplankton, as an important part of aquatic microorganisms, has always been of concern for its crucial place in the aquatic ecosystem. In this study, phytoplankton data and 18 abiotic factors collected from 15 stations in Duliujian River, a seagoing river, were investigated in different seasons. The results showed that the river studied was of a Cyanophyta-dominant type. Salinity (SAL) was the key control factor for phytoplankton species richness, while water temperature (WT) was critical not only for species richness, but also community diversity, and the abundance and biomass of dominant species. Apart from WT, the abundance and biomass of dominant species were also driven by total nitrogen (TN), nitrate (NO3-), pH, and water transparency (SD). Moreover, total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), pH, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were crucial for community diversity and evenness. The bloom of dominant species positively associated with TDP led to lower diversity and evenness in autumn. In addition, when available nitrogen was limited, Pseudoanabaena sp. could obtain a competitive advantage through the N-2 fixation function. Increased available nitrogen concentration could favor the abundance of Chlorella vulgaris to resist the negative effect of WT. The results show that Oscillatoria limosa could serve as an indicator of organic contamination, and nutrient-concentration control must be effective to inhibit Microcystis bloom. This could help managers to formulate conservation measures.

J	Spaak, P; Denk, A; Boersma, M; Weider, LJ				Spaak, P; Denk, A; Boersma, M; Weider, LJ			Spatial and temporal patterns of sexual reproduction in a hybrid Daphnia species complex	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Evidence for extensive interspecific hybridization among species of the genus Daphnia has been accumulating on a global scale. Although there is evidence for limited gene flow between taxa via hybridization, many species still maintain discrete morphological and molecular characteristics. We studied temporal and spatial patterns of sexual reproduction within the Daphnia galeata-hyalina-cucullata hybrid species complex in a lake (Plusssee), located in northern Germany. Allozyme electrophoresis allowed us to track seasonal changes in taxon composition as well as the quantification of back-crosses. Sexually-reproducing animals (ephippial females and males) were mainly found in autumn. The simultaneous presence of sexual morphs of D. galeata and D. galeata x hyalina with the dominant D. hyalina taxa makes recent hybridization, as well as back-crossing, plausible. Males and ephippial females of D. hyalina were not back-crossed as were the parthenogenetic females. The low number of sexual clones of the hybrid D. galeata x hyalina might reflect its reduced fertility, although these few clones were detected in high densities. Only hybrid-clones that had a back-cross genotype (towards D. hyalina) exhibited ephippial females and males. This indicates that male and ephippial female production within the Daphnia taxa is not random, which might increase the chance for the parental Daphnia species to remain distinct.					; Boersma, Maarten/A-5475-2013	Weider, Lawrence/0000-0003-1310-4418; Boersma, Maarten/0000-0003-1010-026X													0142-7873					JUN	2004	26	6					625	635		10.1093/plankt/fbh064	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbh064													WOS:000221746500004
J	Gao, L; Xiao, XY; Li, YL; Jiang, QF; Long, H				Gao, Lei; Xiao, Xiayun; Li, Yanling; Jiang, Qingfeng; Long, Hao			Chronological constraints on the late Quaternary Beihai wetland deposits in southwestern China and its depositional history linked to hydroclimate change	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												As documented in several studies, lake sediments in south-western China are important archives to decipher Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) variability through reconstructions of precipitation and temperature changes, based on multi-proxy analysis of lake sediments. However, lacustrine records on glacial-interglacial timescales in south-western China remain limited because of a lack of reliable long chronologies. In this paper, we provide a 53 ka chronology for the Beihai wetland (core TCBH14) deposits in combination with luminescence and radiocarbon dating of sediments for the upper 13.4 m of a 36.6 m long drill core. The reliability of our chronological framework was verified within two independent chronology sequences and validated by correlations with regional chronostratigraphy. Results suggest that luminescence dating is a feasible method that can provide reliable age controls for lake sediments in south-western China. The depositional history of the Beihai wetland was characterised by alternating lake and wetland facies. Lakes existed at 52-47 ka, 41-32 ka, 26-19 ka and 11-7 ka, whereas a wetland system prevailed at 47-41 ka, 32-26 ka, 19-11 ka, and after similar to 7 ka. The patterns and formation periods of alternate lake-wetland successions are consistent with speleothem delta O-18 and lake delta D-wax records in South Asia, indicating that the sedimentary evolution of the Beihai wetland and other lake-wetland systems in this region are closely linked to ISM-dominated hydroclimate changes. Correlation of sedimentation rates (SRs) of the studied core (TCBH14) with the cores from 11 additional lakes in south-western China suggest that higher SRs occurred during the periods 47-34 ka, 26-19 ka,15-3 ka, and the early Holocene (11-7 ka). In contrast, lower SRs existed during the periods 50-47 ka, 34-26 ka, the last deglaciation (19-15 ka and 12-11 ka), and the middle Holocene (7-5 ka). Thus, we infer that such quasi-synchronous variations of the SRs from these different lakes in south-western China were strongly controlled by the suborbital- or millennial-scale regional hydroclimate, keeping pace with the Northern Hemisphere insolation-induced ISM variability since the last glaciation.

In the state of Santa Catarina, anew species- Hyalella insulae- was recently described- the first insular species of Hyalella in Brazil, on the island of Florianopolis. The species was identified in the Municipal Natural Monument of Lagoa do Peri (MONA), south of the island, which has a large source of freshwater in the state, consisting of two watersheds: Cachoeira Grande and Ribeirao Grande. This study aims to analyze the spatial distribution of H. insulae in two mesohabitats (backwater and rapids) of these watersheds. Specimens were sampled in stretches of rifles and pools between winter/2010 and summer/2012, in three 1st to 3rd order streams inserted in the two watersheds, totaling 192 samples. It was observed that most samples with the presence of H. insulae occurred in the Cachoeira Grande watershed. The mean total abundance of H. insulae was higher in the pools stretches of Cachoeira Grande streams when compared to Ribeirao Grande. In the streams of both watersheds, in addition to males and females, juveniles of H. insulae were collected, which demonstrates that the species is reproducing in these streams. In addition, a higher concentration of dissolved oxygen and lower values of water temperature, water velocity, electrical conductivity and alkalinity were observed in Cachoeira Grande stream. This study demonstrated the preference of H. insulae for pools stretches of streams in Cachoeira Grande, which has primary and dense vegetation, unlike Ribeirao Grande, where areas with secondary vegetation and evidence of anthropic actions are observed in the surroundings. Thus, this research demonstrated the importance of studies regarding the distribution of endemic species, as well as the conservation and preservation of island streams and their biota.

J	Afzal, S; Younas, M; Ali, K				Afzal, S; Younas, M; Ali, K			Selenium speciation studies from Soan-Sakesar valley, Salt Range, Pakistan	WATER INTERNATIONAL												A regional study of Selenium (Se) speciation in surface waters, groundwaters, and saturation extracts from Soan-Sakesar valley Salt-Range, Pakistan was started in March 1994 and completed in October 1996. Groundwaters, streams, and springs had median concentrations of total Se 48, 404.5, and 82 mug/l; Se+VI 40, 350 and 51 mug/l, Se+IV 8, 48 and 29 mug/l; Se-II 0, 6.5 and 2.0 mug/l, respectively. The concentration of Se exceeded the recommended water quality guidelines for drinking and irrigation water of 10 and 20 mug/l, respectively. In saturation extracts, median total Se, Se+VI, Se+IV and Se-II were 190, 146 37 and 7.0 mug/l, respectively. Uchhali, Khabbaki and Jahlar lake water samples had the mean concentration of total Se 2103, 670 and 297 mug/l; Se+VI 1777, 470, and 233 mug/l, Se+IV 291, 166 and 39 mug/L; Se-II 35, 34 and 25 mug/l, respectively. The Sakesar limestone Formation of Eocene age rich in shales and fossils (median Se concentration 7.2 mug/kg) are considered to be the source of selenium that have enriched soils of Soan-Sakesar valley. Selenim speciation results show the abundance of selenate in all the environmental samples. A linear relationship between Se+VI and pH (R-2 = 0.84, 0.58, 0.88, 0.82, and 0.91, significant at the 0.05 level) for groundwater, saturation extract, stream, spring, and lake waters were noted, suggesting that the Se+VI in the samples is highly associated with pH. Linear relationships were established between Se+VI and Mg, NO3, and SO4 for groundwater (R-2 = 0.24, 0.16 and 0.64; significant at the 0.01 level) and surface water (R-2, 0.96 0.14, and 0.91, significant at the 0.001 level). This suggests the high concentrations of Mg, NO3 and SO4, which strongly adsorb and compete with selenium for surface site, increases the Se+VI fraction. The results show that the higher percentage of selenate on other species in the analyzed samples is favored by higher pH and oxidizing environments of the valley.																			0250-8060	1941-1707				SEP	2000	25	3					425	436		10.1080/02508060008686850	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02508060008686850													WOS:000090047100010
J	Richman, MB; Lamb, PJ				Richman, Michael B.; Lamb, Peter J.			Pattern Analysis of Growing Season Precipitation in Southern Canada	ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN												This paper presents the results of climatic pattern analyses of three- and seven-day summer (May-August) precipitation totals for southern Canada. A range of eigenvectorial methods is applied to 1949-80 data for a fairly uniform network of 170 stations that extends to the east of the Rockies, to the north of the Great Lakes, and through the St Lawrence Valley. The major objectives are to identify the characteristic spatial patterns of the precipitation (including any dependence on the eigenvectorial model) and to suggest some potential applications of the results. The entire domain variance fraction cumulatively explained by the first eight unrotated Principal Components (PCs), and also the eight orthogonally-rotated (VARIMAX criterion) PCs derived from them, is approximately 55% for square-root transformations of both the three-and seven-day totals. The unrotated PC spatial loading patterns possess moderately strong large-scale (e. g. one-third to one-half domain) anomaly features through root 3, but thereafter decay progressively on both counts. The higher roots exhibit little structure and seem especially difficult to interpret physically. The VARIMAX PC loading patterns, in contrast, each emphasize a relatively strong anomaly in a different and somewhat restricted part of the domain, and are therefore considered more meaningful physically. They collectively yield a regionalization of the domain into eight subareas within which the three- and seven-day summer precipitation tends to be spatially coherent. This regionalization is strongly supported by (i) obliquely rotated (Harris-Kaiser Case II B'B criterion) PC and Common Factor analyses, (ii) further VARIMAX PC analyses on subsets of the data, (Hi) quantitative comparison with the interstation correlation matrix from which it is derived, and (iv) its close dovetailing with its central United States counterpart in Richman and Lamb (1985). The regionalization is suggested to be of considerable potential utility for crop yield modelling, short-range weather prediction, and research into climatic variation and change.

All of these waterbodies are strongly loaded. 146 species of aquatic fungi were found on the carapaces: 40 Chytridiomycetes, 1 Hyphochytriomycete and 105 Oomycetes. The most common fungus species were Karlingia chitinophila, Myzocytium microsporum, Myzocytium zoophthorum, Pythium acanthicum, Pythium butleri and Pythium myriotylum. Most zoosporic fungus species were observed on the specimens of Daphnia pulex (50 fungus species), Daphnia magna (48) and Cyclocypris laevis (44), fewest on Cyclops fuscus and Cyclops vicinus (each 10). The most fungi were growing in the water from River Suprasl (86), the fewest in the water from Pond Fosa (53). Cluster analysis of the investigated parameters carried out in water bodies during the experiment on zoosporic fungus species has revealed that in the water from springs and Pond Fosa the number of fungus species is closely associated with the concentration of sulphates, in water from River Suprasl and Lake Komosa with calcium and in the water from Pond Dojlidy with chlorides. Out of these 146 species, 21 are known as parasites or necrotrophs of fish. Some dead specimens of crustacean species are a new substrate for some fungus species.

Holocene vegetation dynamics in response to climate change and human activities derived from pollen and charcoal records from southeastern China	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Our knowledge about the Holocene evolution of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and its relation to human activities remains incomplete. A detailed palynological investigation of two sediment sections from the Daiyun Mountain Nature Reserve (ca. 25 degrees 38'-25 degrees 44'N, 118 degrees 05'-118 degrees 21'E, Fujian Province) suggests EASM-controlled subtropical climate conditions that were wetter and warmer than present over the early and middle Holocene. After 5700 cal. yr BP, steadily increasing non-arboreal pollen and fern spore percentages imply an attenuation of the EASM. The general climate trend is interrupted by several century-scale changes in composition and concentration of arboreal pollen taxa around 8200, 7200, 6300, and 4400 cal. yr BP, coinciding with weaker precipitation (and lower temperature) as suggested by the EASM oxygen isotope record. Our results further support the hypothesis that the natural vegetation cover of southern China was not markedly affected by human activities until 3000 cal. yr BP. The pollen records suggest a quick decrease in the forest cover ca. 30002450 cal. yr BP followed by a generally open (agricultural) landscape and spread of secondary pine forests. This pattern is in line with a major population growth promoted by the southward expansion of rice-based agriculture across the region that postdates the widely accepted 'Holocene climate optimum' by several millennia. This highlights the multidimensional significance of this term, which is commonly used in palaeoenvironmental and archaeological studies and should be consequently applied with respect to the specific issue under consideration.

Here, we present a ca. 120-year-resolution compound-specific carbon (delta C-13) and hydrogen (SD) isotopes of terrestrial long-chain n-alkanes extracted from a well-dated sediment core from an alpine lake in north China. Our delta C-13 data, together with previously reported pollen data from a parallel core, demonstrate a humid mid-Holocene from ca. 8-5 ka BP. Assuming that the climatic humidity of north China is an indicator of the EASM intensity, then the maximum EASM intensity occurred in the mid Holocene. Our SD data reveal a similar long-term trend to the delta O-18 record from nearby Lianhua Cave, indicating that the synchronous SD and delta O-18 records faithfully record the SD and delta O-18 of precipitation, respectively. The most negative SD and delta O-18 values occur in t he early-mid Holocene, from ca. 11-5 ka BP. This contrast in the timing of isotopic variations demonstrates a complex relationship between the isotopic composition of precipitation and precipitation amount, or EASM intensity. Further comparisons indicate a possible linkage between the precipitation amount in north China and the west-east thermal gradient in the equatorial Pacific. In addition, the temperature of the moisture source area may play an important role in determining the isotopic composition of precipitation in monsoonal China. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Scientific diving techniques for the study of flooded sinkholes in Italy	UNDERWATER TECHNOLOGY												The hydrogeology and geomorphology of some flooded sinkholes in central Italy have been studied by means of scientific diving techniques. A first group of three sinkholes is located on travertine deposits around the limestone ridge of the Cornicolani Mounts. One of these, S. Angelo Lake, is flooded by the outcrop of the regional water table. The other two, Regina Lake and Colonnelle Lake, are fed by geothermal springs with high levels of gas and are known as Acque Albule (white waters) because of the presence of cloudy layers of sulphuric water. It was possible to identify the S. Angelo Lake as a sinkhole created by the collapse of the roof of a former flooded cave. The underwater survey and water sampling of the Acque Albule sinkholes confirmed the presence of sulphuric springs emitting acidic water. The last studied sinkhole, Doganella sinkhole, is in the sedimentary cover of the Pontina Plain. It was created almost overnight by a sudden collapse in the unconsolidated sediments, and was then flooded by the local groundwater table. The S. Giovanni Lake can be classified as 'collapse sinkhole', while the Acque Albule are identified as hydrothermal-karst sinkholes. The Doganella sinkhole shows alluvial and piroclastic deposits in the submerged section, and its genesis is not totally understood yet.

From these investigations we concluded the following. (1) When stickleback are forced into the littoral zone by salmon, competition in this restricted area increases, or alternatively, stickleback distribute themselves in an area with less profitable prey. This, combined with predation from salmon, results in a population decline and reduced growth of the stickleback. (2) At least in autumn, parasitized sticleback distribute themselves in areas with high predation risk from salmon; when exposed to salmon predation, parasitized stickleback are preyed upon at a higher rate than healthy ones. Hence, parasitized individuals have almost disappeared from the stickleback population in Lake Kvernavann, Norway.

J	Pechsiri, JS; Gröndahl, F				Pechsiri, Joseph S.; Grondahl, Fredrik			Assessing energy return on investment for harvest of Nodularia spumigena during blooms in the Baltic Sea	JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY												Recurring summer cyanobacteria blooms in the Baltic Sea has gained academic interests for decades. The harvest of wild cyanobacteria, for example, Nodularia spumigena, during summer blooms in the Baltic Sea has been studied in the past but lacked evaluation for environmental and economic performances. This study provides a first-hand assessment of environmental and economic performance from an energy perspective, using energy return on investment (EROI) as evaluation method where harvest of biomass and the downstream conversion of biomass to biogas and biofertilizer are considered for Gotland, Sweden. Energy analysis results indicate fuel consumption during harvest and transport operations to be the major energy consumer. Traditional sailing boats have been suggested as an alternative. Overall, when considering only biogas yield and usage of sailing boats, a break-even EROI of 1 is achieved. When including biofertilizer as product, a breakeven EROI of 1 is also achieved. Depending upon the biomass concentration in the Baltic Sea at the time of harvest, an EROI > 6 is possible, surpassing the economic viability EROI benchmark of 3, indicating the importance of nutrient recovery as the driver for harvest of wild cyanobacteria biomass during blooms in the Baltic Sea.

During 1330-1200 cal BP, we infer the existence of a swamp bog with dense cypress forests, based on dominant Cupressaceae pollen, suggesting cold and dry conditions during this early period. Fine-grained sediment and higher percentages of wetland pollen and fern spores suggest intermittent-lake conditions, indicating a wet Medieval Warm Period (MWP; 1200-730 cal BP). The increase in coniferous forest and montane shrub-meadow pollen indicate a cold and dry climate during the early to mid-Little Ice Age (LIA; 730-370 cal BP), but coarse-grained sediments associated with more abundant wetland taxa pollen indicate a shallower intermittent-lake landscape, reflecting relatively humid periods during 620-560 cal BP and 400-450 cal BP. During the last 370 cal BP, a rapid increase in the secondary forest component and a gradual decrease in the pollen-inferred floristic diversity index suggest that the natural vegetation was converted to secondary vegetation, as a result of severe anthropogenic disturbance in the montane region of Fujian Province. The reconstructed regional precipitation trend prior to this period was mainly correlated with East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) intensity, which is related to variation in solar irradiation.					; jin, jianhui/ACO-9148-2022; LEI, Guoliang/B-3707-2008; Li, Zhizhong/ADV-8886-2022	LEI, Guoliang/0009-0006-5231-8645; Jiang, Xiuyang/0000-0001-9617-0431; Wang, Liang-Chi/0000-0002-2320-0908; 													1040-6182	1873-4553				SEP 10	2019	528						53	62		10.1016/j.quaint.2019.04.016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2019.04.016													WOS:000497646500007

Atlantic salmon and sea-run brown trout were captured in the estuary during their return migration to the Vosso River, Norway, tagged with acoustic transmitters, and tracked in the watershed and estuary in three different years (2020-2023). We found a relatively narrow window of river exit timing among trout that survived overwinter, whereas salmon tended to leave during a more protracted period. Trout preferred overwintering in lakes within the river system, which provided for lower locomotor activity than fish that overwintered in pools in the river according to data from tri-axial accelerometer transmitters. In contrast, Atlantic salmon tended to spend surprisingly little time in lakes even though the energy expenditure in this habitat is was seemingly lower for salmon that did overwinter in the lake. Our results demonstrate different use of habitat during overwintering and could suggest that measures to protect iteroparous life history strategies of salmonids will differently impact these two iteroparous salmonids.

J	Wei, K; Gasse, F				Wei, K; Gasse, F			Oxygen isotopes in lacustrine carbonates of West China revisited: implications for post glacial changes in summer monsoon circulation	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Five lakes in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and North Xinjiang have provided oxygen isotope records covering the past 17-11 cal. kyr BP. The modern lakes are first presented within the major atmospheric circulation and climate patterns of China, with the climate-related isotope composition of input water. Equations used to extract hydrological and climatic information from delta(18)O in carbonates are then given. After a discussion on potential causes for delta(18)O changes. each of the five isotope profiles is interpreted in the light of its specific environmental data. The most significant event observed in all records occurred at 12-11 cal. kyr BP: an abrupt intensification of summer rainfall associated with an extremely rapid 1000-1500 km westward migration of the monsoon fronts. The monsoon regime weakened in stages after 8-7 cal. kyr BP. Holocene maximal aridity is recorded at all sites between about 4.5 and 3.5 cal. kyr BP. Long-term changes in monsoon strength as inferred from our isotopic interpretation are in good agreement with climate model reconstructions in the Tibet-Qinghai Plateau, while observed hydrological changes in North Xinjiang are not simulated by the models. Also, the non-linearity of the Holocene monsoon variations cannot be accounted for by orbital forcing. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The seasonal development of phytoplankton was basically monomodal with one definite early May maximum (1,350 mu(3) l(-1) fresh weight). During the maximum, unicellular blue-green algae of picoplanktonic size and Cyclotella tripartita dominated. The latter is new for the flora of Germany.

A previously unexplored sedimentary sequence reaching back 16,000 years from Lakes Peters and Schrader (Neruokpuk Lakes) in the northeastern Brooks Range (69 degrees N), Alaska, shows distinct changes in accumulation rates and biophysical properties including bulk density (BD), organic matter (OM) content, and grain-size distribution at five widely distributed core sites. The oldest sediments contain little OM and accumulated rapidly as glaciers retreated around 15 ka. OM peaked between 12 and 10 ka along with Northern Hemisphere summer insolation. BD increased and OM decreased until around 5 ka, possibly reflecting a decrease in river-transported terrestrial OM. From 5-2 ka, OM consistently increased, suggesting a rise in river discharge, or a rise in summer temperatures, which led to higher productivity, or both. After 2 ka, sediments increased in BD and decreased in OM, suggesting glacier growth. Evidence for glacier expansion late during the Little Ice Age is weak, but increased sedimentation rates may reflect glacier retreat during the last century. This study provides a framework for future paleoenvironmental research of a rare archive in a relatively pristine Arctic setting.

Chaoborus trivittatus was reduced from a mean summer density of 650/m2 in 1987 to a mean summer density of 10/m2 in 1988. Chaoborus trivittatus and Daphnia pulicaria were the most important prey items of the trout. Although D. pulicaria was equally important in the trout diet, its density following trout introduction did not change. Two factors may explain the lack of D. pulicaria decline. First, size-selective predation from trout was not intense enough to remove the largest D. pulicaria, which likely had the highest fecundity. Secondly, any predation effect the trout had upon D. pulicaria was offset by the lack of C. trivittatus predation on D. pulicaria, due to the precipitous decline of C. trivittatus. During the decline of C. trivittatus, no significant changes in the density of their potential prey zooplankton species was evident. Any changes in the zooplankton community would likely have taken place the following year due to less recruitment of C. trivittatus into the community.

Current research has revealed the connection between lake-level variations and astronomical forcing on a million-year scale. Other studies have also highlighted the influence of orbitally-induced climate cycles on halite deposition. However, our understanding of the impact of astronomically-paced lake-level changes on halite formation remains constrained. The Paleogene Dawenkou Formation in the Huanggang Basin of East China provides a continuous salt-bearing sedimentary record to investigate the lake-level changes in halite deposition. Lake-level fluctuations reconstructed by sedimentary noise modeling for the Middle and Upper members of the Dawenkou Formation indicate that the lake-level variations in the Huanggang Basin were linked to astronomical forcing with periods of-2.4 Myr,-1.2 Myr and/or-100 kyr. Our results suggest that astronomical forcing, as a driver of lake-level variations, may have had an impact on halite deposition during the Paleogene. In the initial stage of halite formation within the Middle Member of the Dawenkou Formation, reduced heat and moisture transport during the-1.2 Myr obliquity minima resulted in low lake levels in mid-to-high latitudes. The prolonged droughts caused by the low amplitude of-2.4 Myr eccentricity created conditions more favorable for the development of thicker layers of halite. Subsequently, in the next halite-forming stage, a larger amplitude of-2.4 Myr eccentricity led to a more humid climate. Warm/dry winters and cool summers paced by the-100 kyr orbital eccentricity minima resulted in enhanced evaporation, relatively lower lake levels, and thinner halite deposition. Nevertheless, the possible transgressions may have contributed to complicated phase relationship between the lake-level change cycles and orbital cycles. This study offers an opportunity to delve deeper into the mechanism of halite deposition by objectively reconstructing lake levels using sedimentary noise modeling.

The model is driven by 3 1/2 years of hourly meteorological data obtained directly from the output of doubled-CO2 experiments (2 x CO2) conducted with a regional climate model nested in a general circulation model. The regional atmospheric model is the climate version of the National Center for Atmospheric Research/Pennsylvania State University mesoscale model, MM4. Average annual surface temperature of Pyramid Lake for the 2 X CO2 climate is 15.5 +/- 5.4 degrees C (+/- 1 sigma), 2.8 degrees C higher than the control. Annual overturn of the lake ceases as a result of these higher temperatures for the 2 x CO2 climate. Evaporation increases from 1400 mm yr(-1) in the control to 1595 mm yr(-1) in the 2 X CO2 simulation, but net water supplied to the Pyramid Lake basin increases from -6 mm yr(-1) in the control to +27 mm yr(-1) in the 2 x CO2 simulation due to increased precipitation. For the open water periods, the average annual surface temperature of Yellowstone Lake is 13.2 +/- 5.1 degrees C for the 2 x CO2 climate, a temperature 1.6 degrees C higher than the control. The annual duration of ice cover on the lake is 152 days in the 2 X CO2 simulation, a reduction of 44 days relative to the control, Warming of the lake for the 2 x CO2 climate is mostly confined to the near-surface. Simulated spring overturn for the 2 X CO2 climate occurs earlier in the year and fall overturn later than in the control. Evaporation increases from 544 mm yr(-1) to 600 mm yr(-1) in the 2 X CO2 simulation, but net water supplied to the Yellowstone Lake basin increases from +373 mm yr(-1) in the control to +619 mm yr(-1) due to increased precipitation. The effects of these climatic changes suggest possible deterioration of water quality and productivity in Pyramid Lake and possible enhancement of productivity in Yellowstone Lake.

The objective of this study was to assess the water quality of six urban ponds in the city of Lisbon, Portugal, to determine the factors that influence it and consider remediation measures for them. Besides that, our study aims to deliver data in order to support the best approach for a future monitoring program, toward more strategic and sustainable management. Floating treatment wetlands (FTW) were installed in three of the ponds during the study, where nutrient levels were higher. Water sampling was performed since 2016, with more intensive campaigns in 2020 and 2021. Average pH ranged from 7.9 to 9.0, average Chemical Oxygen Demand ranged from 36 mg/L to 90 mg/L and average Total Suspended Solids ranged from 7 to 93 mg/L. The main factors that contribute to these values were identified as the presence of waterbirds, vegetative debris that falls in ponds, and contamination with sewage. The FTW that were installed in some of the ponds could help to improve the water quality, but additional measures such as removal of bottom sediments and leaves in the fall, may be necessary. It is expected that the assessment of water quality carried out in the urban ponds can contribute to the overall improvement of urban water management.

Interannual varve thickness correlates with annual flood magnitude. Interdecadal trends in varve thickness are influenced by other environmental factors such as glacier recession. Despite major differences in the lakes and their contributing watersheds, substantial concordance is observed among the records. A pronounced change in the nature of lake sedimentation, accompanied by higher interannual variability, occurred in 1980. The change coincides with an increase in the magnitude of autumn flooding and major re-organization of the North Pacific climate system. These results highlight new directions for palaeoenvironmental research using varved sediment records, specifically to study the magnitude and spatial extent of past hydro-climatic events.

J	Rhew, K; Ochs, CA				Rhew, K; Ochs, CA			Spatial patterns in autotrophic picoplankton abundance in a reservoir examined using microcosm experiments	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												Autotrophic picoplankton (APP) are critically important in the production of organic matter in plankton food webs. A number of obvious environmental factors, including light, temperature, nutrient concentrations. and predation, have been identified as influencing APP abundance and growth rates. However, few experiments have investigated more than one factor at a time for their relationships to APP abundance or growth rate. We conducted a series of single and multi-factor experiments to examine the relative importance of several biotic and abiotic variables, and their interactions, for their effects on APP abundance and growth rates. Experiments were conducted using APP samples collected during summer from the riverine and lacustrine zones of a southeastern U.S. reservoir. Growth rates of APP responded rapidly to nutrient addition, but the magnitude of the response was dependent on location of collection, and on the presence of grazers and other phytoplankton. Growth rates of APP from the riverine zone were limited by nitrogen, whereas lacustrine zone APP responded positively to both phosphorus and nitrogen addition. Regulation of APP population size by heterotrophic nanoflagellates appeared to be most effective when APP growth rates were relatively slow. APP cell chlorophyll concentrations varied inversely with the percentage of surface light in the mixed layer of the reservoir. We suggest that due to spatial differences in the rate and depth of vertical mixing, lacustrine zone APP receive less light on average, or light at less frequent intervals, than APP in the more turbid but shallower riverine zone. Longitudinal declines in both nutrient and light availability during summer may reduce APP growth rates and population size in the lacustrine zone compared to the more productive riverine zone of this reservoir.																			1434-2944						2000	85	4					395	412		10.1002/1522-2632(200008)85:4<395::AID-IROH395>3.0.CO;2-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1522-2632(200008)85:4<395::AID-IROH395>3.0.CO;2-4													WOS:000089161400003

Depth Moderates DOC Impact on Cold-Water Refugia in Small, Northern Temperate Lakes	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Widespread changes in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in lakes of the Northern Hemisphere are well documented, and there is a need to understand the ecological implications for changes in cold-water refugia. DOC controls thermal structure in small, wind-sheltered lakes, thus influencing the volume and persistence of the hypolimnion and cold-water habitat. We explored the relationship between the quantity and quality of DOC and the availability of cold-water habitat over the course of summer stratification in small lakes of varying depths. The ratio of the hypolimnetic volume to total lake volume was calculated to assess the relative changes in cold-water habitat availability in each lake over time. DOC concentration, maximum lake depth, and the interaction between DOC concentration and maximum lake depth explained 87% of the variability in percent change in hypolimnion volume ratio across studied lakes. Hypolimnion compression was greater in shallow, low DOC lakes, whereas deeper, intermediate DOC lakes had more persistent hypolimnion volumes over the course of summer stratification. These results demonstrate that depth moderates the effect of DOC on the volume and persistence of cold-water refugia availability in north temperate lakes, advancing our understanding of differing lake sensitivity in a rapidly changing physical and chemical environment.

Tephra successions were described at 54 sites, and more than 20 major eruptive units were identified, consisting of pumice fall, scoria fall and ash fall deposits, each of which are separated by paleosol or peat layers. The source volcano of each recognized tephra layer was confirmed by correlation with proximal deposits of each eruption center with respect to petrography and whole-rock and glass chemistry. The age of each layer was determined by radiocarbon dating and the stratigraphic relationship with the dated, widespread tephra from Kamchatka according to the thickness of paleosols bracketed between tephra layers. The Holocene activity in this region was initiated by eruptions from the Tatarinov and Lomonosov volcanoes. After the eruptions, the Fuss and Chikurachki volcanoes started their explosive activities at ca. 7.5 ka BP, soon after the deposition of widespread tephra from the Kurile Lake caldera in southern Kamchatka. Compared with Fuss located on the back-arc side, Chikurachki has frequent, repeated explosive and voluminous eruptions. Whole-rock compositions of the rocks of the CTL volcanic chain and Fuss are classified into medium-K and high-K groups, respectively. These suggest that magma systems beneath the CTL volcanic chain and Fuss differ from each other and have been independently constructed. The rocks of the Chikurachki volcano are basalt-basaltic andesite and have gradually evolved their chemical compositions; when graphed on a SiO2-oxide diagram, these form smooth trends from mafic to more felsic. This suggests that the magma system evolved mainly by fractional crystallization. In contrast, matrix glass chemistries for Fuss pumices are distinct for each eruption and show different K2O levels on a SiO2-K2O diagram. This implies that the magma system of Fuss has been frequently replaced. Both volcanoes have been active under the same subduction system. However, the Chikurachki volcano will continue eruptive activity under a stable magma system with a higher magma discharge rate, whereas Fuss may continue construction with an intermittent supply of distinct, small magma batches.

In Chignik Lake the isopod was most abundant in association with organic and mud bottoms and areas where salmon carcasses accumulate. Abundance decreased from early to late summer, perhaps because of a postre-productive mortality. Males may grow faster than females, though both sexes mature at age I+ and that growth terminates with maturation. Most reproduction apparently occurs in early summer but some ovigerous females were found as late as Sept. Length at maturity in both sexes was less than reported by other workers in Arctic marine populations. _Mature isopods were smaller in_the upper lake (males 40[long dash]46 mm, X = 43; and females 29[long dash]38 mm, X = 33) than in the lower lake (males 41 - 65, X = 55; and females 29-47 mm, X = 39) of the Chignik River system. Females in the upper lake had a higher average fecundity and a greater increase in fecundity per unit increase of fecundity per unit increase of length than those in the lower lake.																									1968	25	1					157	+		10.1139/f68-010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f68-010													WOS:A1968A451800010

In this paper, we discuss the dispersal and distribution of the ringed seal during different stages of the Baltic Sea in relation to past and ongoing environmental changes. Subfossil ringed seal remains around the Baltic Sea and the Danish Straits were radiocarbon dated in order to map the distribution of the species in different time periods. The delta C-13 data were used in evaluating the changes in the marine character of the Baltic Basin. The sequence of the dates indicates a continuous presence of the species in the Baltic Basin. The earliest ringed seal finds come from the Skagerrak/Kattegat area (Denmark, Swedish west coast) and date to the full glacial period and Baltic Ice Lake. In the Baltic Basin, the species appears in the subfossil record during the Ancylus period, but the main part of the remains date to the Littorina stage. During the Littorina stage, the distribution of the species was at least periodically wider than today, covering also southern parts of the Baltic. The presence of breeding populations in southern parts of the Baltic during the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) indicates that the winters were at least periodically cold enough for winter ice. The changes in the marine influence in the Baltic Basin can be seen in the seal collagen delta C-13 values, which serve as a proxy for qualitative changes in water mass salinity.					; Lõugas, Lembi/N-2409-2019; Lougas, Lembi/G-6063-2016	Pilot, Malgorzata/0000-0002-6057-5768; Arppe, Laura/0000-0003-4445-6096; Lougas, Lembi/0000-0003-2011-2141; Oinonen, Markku/0000-0002-0881-7643													0959-6836	1477-0911				DEC	2014	24	12					1694	1706		10.1177/0959683614551226	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683614551226													WOS:000346178500007

The peak decadal frequency was 55 storms (1950s), and the minimum was 45 storms (1970s and 1980s). The east north-central region experienced the greatest number of large snowstorms (148) followed by the west north-central (136) and central (133) regions. Regional trends were different. Assessment of surface cyclone tracks associated with the large snowstorms identified three primary tracks: one was located from the leeward side of the south-central Rocky Mountains east-northeast toward the Great Lakes; a second was from the lower Mississippi River basin northeastward toward the Great Lakes; and a third was along the coastal mid-Atlantic region northeast toward Maine. Temporal differences in the frequency of certain surface cyclone tracks were related to the decadal trends in regional large snowstorm occurrence. The minimum surface pressure associated with these storms ranged from 959 to 1013 hPa with more than 67% of all storms having a minimum surface pressure between 980 and 999 hPa. The average orthogonal distance from the storm track to the heavy snow region was 201 km. The average rate of cyclone movement ranged from less than 483 to more than 1930 km day(-1), with more than 57% of storms moving between 805 and 1287 km day(-1).																			0027-0644					AUG	2008	136	8					3193	3202		10.1175/2008MWR2324.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/2008MWR2324.1													WOS:000258450700021

In this study, a well-established one-dimensional hydrodynamic model (GLM) was used to investigate the response of stratification dynamics in Rappbode Reservoir to different wind conditions, in particular to episodic strong wind events. In years with increased wind speed, stratification duration and intensity were reduced. Episodic wind forcing by strong wind events are important determinants of thermal structure and can induce persisting shifts in the thermal structure that remain over the season until the next overturn. The results showed that reductions in stratification intensity were particularly distinct when the strong wind occurred in early summer. Strong wind events outside of this sensitive time window did not exert an important impact on the thermal dynamics of the reservoir. Our research confirms the decisive impact of wind speed on stratification of lakes and reservoirs. It effectively illustrates the sensitive time window of thermal dynamics to episodic wind events.

The Sawtooth Valley lakes are deep, oligotrophic, glacial lakes located in central Idaho, U.S.A., and historically contained populations of anadromous O. nerka. In general, low light intensities limited foraging opportunities of O. nerka under ice, especially at night. In Stanley Lake, O. nerka underwent diel vertical migrations to exploit available light to feed. Oncorhynchus nerka occupied shallow water at night, where there was still sufficient light to feed, but were found in deep water during the day. It is unknown whether O. nerka occupied deep depths during the day to feed on high densities of zooplankton or to avoid predators. In Alturas Lake, O. nerka remained in the top 25 m both day and night to feed high densities of zooplankton found near the surface. In Redfish Lake, O. nerka also showed little migration: O. nerka stayed in shallow water both day and night and occupied the same depths with the highest zooplankton densities. The vertical distribution of O. nerka during the winter appears to be determined by available food and light, but the deep daytime distribution found in Stanley Lake is still unexplained.					; Wurtsbaugh, Wayne/G-6856-2011	Steinhart, Geoffrey/0000-0003-3514-7996; 													0706-652X						1999	56			1			152	161		10.1139/cjfas-56-S1-152	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-56-S1-152													WOS:000085591600014

In winter 2017-2018, vigilance patterns in Bean Goose (Amer fabalis) and White-fronted Goose (Anser albifrons) were quantified in natural and artificial habitats in Shengjin Lake, one of the typical Yangtze-connected lakes in China. No significant difference in percentage time spent vigilant between species was found, but vigilance frequency of White-fronted Goose was higher than Bean Goose.

However, the variations of loess source and composition over time remain controversial. Soluble salt is an important dust component and is linked to the landforms and environments associated with dust mobilization, transport and deposition. Based on an investigation of the soluble salts of two loess sequences from the central and western CLP, we show that the soluble salts of Chinese loess mainly stepwise increased at -1 and - 0.5 Ma. Several lines of evidence indicated that the increased supply of soluble salts mainly originated from dust input, suggesting the enhanced salinity of Asian dust. The enhanced soluble-salt-bearing dust was driven by lakebed evolution in the potential source areas, as confirmed by abundant geomorphological and sedimentological evidence. The Mid-Pleistocene Transition (associated with Tibetan Plateau uplift) induced aridity of the potential source areas (PSA) and Mid-Brunhes Transition triggered intensifying East Asian summer monsoon are responsible for the stepwise lakebed evolution in the PSA at -1 and - 0.5 Ma, respectively, which in turn acted as an important soluble-salt-bearing dust reservoir. These findings provide new evidence for understanding the evolution of regional dust emissions and their possible environmental effects in the past and future.

Compared with large-scale field measurements, wind erosion modeling based on geospatial data is an efficient and effective method for quantitative soil wind erosion mapping. However, conventional local-based wind erosion modeling is time-consuming and labor-intensive, especially when processing large amounts of geospatial data. To address this issue, we developed a Google Earth Engine-based Revised Wind Erosion Equation (RWEQ) model, named GEE-RWEQ, to delineate the Soil Wind Erosion Potential (SWEP). Based on the GEE-RWEQ model, terabytes of Remote Sensing (RS) data, climate assimilation data, and some other geospatial data were applied to produce monthly SWEP with a high spatial resolution (500 m) across CA between 2000 and 2019. The results show that the mean SWEP is in good agreement with the ground observation-based dust storm index (DSI), satellite-based Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), and Absorbing Aerosol Index (AAI), confirming that GEE-RWEQ is a robust wind erosion prediction model. Wind speed factors primarily determined the wind erosion in CA (r = 0.7, p < 0.001), and the SWEP has significantly increased since 2011 because of the reversal of global terrestrial stilling in recent years. The Aral Sea Dry Lakebed (ASDLB), formed by shrinkage of the Aral Sea, is the most severe wind erosion area in CA (47.29 kg/m(2)/y). Temporally, the wind erosion dominated by wind speed has the largest spatial extent of wind erosion in Spring (MAM). Meanwhile, affected by the spatial difference of the snowmelt period in CA, the wind erosion hazard center moved from the southwest (Karakum Desert) to the middle of CA (Kyzylkum Desert and Muyunkum Desert) during spring. According to the impacts of land cover change on the spatial dynamic of wind erosion, the SWEP of bareland was the highest, while that of forestland was the lowest.					; ma, long/JHU-2289-2023; ge, yongxiao/K-1251-2012; Zou, Shan/HTN-7391-2023; Samat, Alim/H-5309-2019	Zou, Shan/0000-0003-3896-5679; Wang, Wei/0000-0003-1813-0551; ji, li li/0000-0001-8483-1554; Ma, Long/0000-0002-8233-8640; Samat, Alim/0000-0002-9091-6033; 														2072-4292				OCT	2020	12	20							3430	10.3390/rs12203430	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12203430													WOS:000585660100001
J	Yihdego, Y; Webb, JA; Leahy, P				Yihdego, Yohannes; Webb, John A.; Leahy, Paul			Modelling of lake level under climate change conditions: Lake Purrumbete in southeastern Australia	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Lake Purrumbete is located in western Victoria, Australia, and is highly regarded for its ecological, social, economic and scientific values. Recently, many lakes in the region have been dry or at their lowest level in recorded history, due to a drought that broke in 2010. For this study, a modified difference water budget method was employed to estimate net groundwater flux through the difference between the level of the lake and the water table, along with the specific yield and area of the aquifer. This model successfully modelled the lake level fluctuations. In recent years, Lake Purrumbete has fallen below the outflow level; however, because of its large volume, changes in salinity to date are minor and do not affect its freshwater status. An understanding of how these systems will behave in the future and how they may be best managed in a drying climate is considered an important step to adapt to climate change. Postulated future climatic changes in the region of the lake were used to project the lake level fluctuations to 2030 using the water budget model, and showed that dry conditions would cause the lake level to remain below its outlet elevation, but wet conditions would result in a significant recovery in the lake level. If the level of Lake Purrumbete continues to fall, the main threat to its ecological status will be the potential loss of some significant areas of fringing wetland habitat. The lowering in lake level could cause a shift in the abundance of algal plankton and so influence the whole lake food web. This may reduce the invertebrate diversity of the lake.

All the subsamples collected in November were dominated with Microcystis ichthyoblabe and the percentages of M. ichthyoblabe exceeded 83%. The percentages of Microcystis aeruginosa of the subsamples in >500 mu m class collected in October was 93.5%. For the sample collected in October, the percentage of M. ichthyoblabe was more than 58% in <75, 75-150, 150-300 gm classes. The 16S rDNA as well as some polysaccharide biosynthesis-related genes were analyzed to understand the phylogeny of Microcystis species. There was no variant site presented in each Microcystis subsample but a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was found in 16S rDNA alignment tested using MSR1 in subsamples between the two months in the current study. Our results also showed that samples collected in two months can by divided into two parts by the phylogenetic analysis using two polysaccharide biosynthesis-related genes (espL and TagH). All the results suggested that 16S rDNA was valuable to identify seasonal succession of Microcystis genospecies and the diversity of Microcystis morphospecies would be explained by these polysaccharide biosynthesis-related genes.

Temperature, moisture content, proximity to water bodies and the normalized difference vegetation index in the autumn were the four underlying factors found to contribute the most to the development of the epidemic. Typhoid infection was most severe in the south-eastern region of Jiangsu and a significant hotspot with high positive autocorrelation was detected in Taicang county in the south-east of the province. To improve the typhoid situation, intervention efforts should be concentrated in the south-eastern region of the province, targeting the hotspot and include reduction of lake pollution.

The CE-QUAL-W2 water quality model is a tool that can integrate the effects of all these factors on striped bass habitat. Once a baseline model is calibrated, it can be used to diagnose constraints to striped bass habitat, identify potential enhancement measures, and evaluate ways to alleviate the impacts of conflicting water uses. Importantly, the model integrates the best available information within the best available scientific method of evaluating water quality or habitat issues. Centering the discussion around an agreed-upon scientific tool helps to ensure that the subjective concerns expressed by stakeholders are objectively evaluated. In the three case studies explored in this paper, a change of hydropower operation was agreed to for Lake Murray, South Carolina that would help maintain summer habitat for striped bass; simulations indicated that hydropower operations were not a major factor affecting striped bass habitat in Claytor Lake, Virginia; and an efficient oxygen injection system was designed for J. Strom Thurmond Reservoir, South Carolina and Georgia to mitigate for habitat loss associated with a change in hydropower operation. Water quality modeling is an important tool for objectively evaluating the maintenance or enhancement of striped bass and hybrid striped bass (white bass M. chrysops x striped bass) habitat in reservoirs.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-36-3				2013	80						161	179																WOS:000323292100009
J	Zhi, YJ; Shao, MQ; Cui, P; Chen, B				Zhi YiJin; Shao MingQin; Cui Peng; Chen Bin			Time Budget and Activity Rhythm of the Mandarin Duck Aix galericulata in the Poyang Lake Watershed	PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												From January to March 2016, and in November 2016, we examined the effects of sex and ambient temperature on how time was budgeted, and activity rhythms were established in wintering Mandarin Ducks (Aix galericulata). This was done using instantaneous scan sampling in the Poyang Lake watershed in the Jiangxi province, China. The results showed that the Mandarin Ducks' predominant behaviors were resting (36.56%), swimming (21.75%), foraging (20.88%), and maintenance (15.58%), indicating that during the winter, Mandarin Ducks spend most of their time accumulating energy. Mandarin Ducks reduced their energy consumption by increasing time spent on resting behavior. Females spent more time resting than the males, and less time on maintenance and vigilance. No significant difference was found in the allocation of time to different behaviors under different ambient temperatures. Foraging behaviors peaked in the morning (10:00-10:59) and afternoon (15:00-17:30), which is like the foraging strategies of most Anseriformes. Mandarin Ducks increased their foraging time in the mornings and afternoons to get maximal energy for the long cold nights. Occurrences of foraging and swimming behaviors showed similar patterns, because foraging was often accompanied by swimming to find suitable foraging sites. The pattern of resting behaviors was opposite to that of swimming. Sex had little effect on daily activity rhythms, mainly because both were involved in the same tasks to support similar requirements.																			0030-9923					APR	2019	51	2					725	730		10.17582/journal.pjz/2019.51.2.725.730	http://dx.doi.org/10.17582/journal.pjz/2019.51.2.725.730													WOS:000461147800039

J	GEDZELMAN, SD; ARNOLD, R				GEDZELMAN, SD; ARNOLD, R			MODELING THE ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION OF PRECIPITATION	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The physics of the stable isotopes of water is incorporated into a two-dimensional, kinematic, bulk cloud microphysical model. The model is run for several idealized, classical stratiform and convective storm situations, and the resulting isotope ratios of precipitation and water vapor are diagnosed and compared to observations. For stratiform snow, the model produces low isotope ratios that decrease rapidly poleward of the warm front. The lowest isotope ratios occur when the atmosphere is cold and when the vertical velocity attains its maximum value high in the troposphere. For stratiform rains, the model produces much higher isotope ratios without a significant poleward gradient as a result of isotope exchange between the falling rain and the surrounding vapor. Isotope ratios of rain are lowest when the melting level is near the ground and isotope exchange is minimized. For air mass thunderstorms, isotope ratios are uniformly high in warm air, no matter what the cloud height, unless hail approaches or reaches the ground. The model also produces a significant amount effect for rain, in which isotope ratios decrease with increasing rainfall totals. Isotope ratios are particularly low when the rain derives from a recirculation process in which air previously charged by vapor from falling rain subsequently rises. Under such conditions, the model sometimes produces isotope ratios that decrease from the periphery to the core of the precipitation shield. It is suggested that this recirculation process is responsible for extraordinarily low isotope ratios observed in some hurricanes and organized thunderstorms. The dominant cloud microphysical processes can sometimes be inferred from isotope ratios of precipitation. The model produces ice pellets with isotope ratios close to those of rain when the pellets are produced by homogeneous freezing of rain and close to those of snow when the pellets are produced by refreezing of partially melted snow. A cliniatology of isotope values that matches the main features of the observed global data set and of a seven-year record of storms at Mohonk Lake, New York is generated by running the model for a wide range of conditions. This includes the deuterium excess (d = deltaD - 8*deltaO-18) for Antarctic snows that increases markedly as deltaD falls below -300 parts-per-thousand and the deuterium deficit observed for rain in warm, dry regions.																			2169-897X					MAY 20	1994	99	D5					10455	10471		10.1029/93JD03518	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/93JD03518													WOS:A1994NN51700013
J	Livingstone, DM; Lotter, AF				Livingstone, DM; Lotter, AF			The relationship between air and water temperatures in lakes of the Swiss Plateau: a case study with palaeolimnological implications	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												In palaeolimnological studies, inference models based on aquatic organisms are frequently used to estimate summer lake surface water temperatures. However, the calibration of such models is often unsatisfactory because of the sparseness of measured water temperature data. This study investigates the feasibility of using air temperature data, usually available at much higher resolution, to calibrate such models by comparing regional air temperatures with surface water temperatures in 17 lakes on the Swiss Plateau. Results show that altitude-corrected air temperatures are sufficiently uniform over the entire Swiss Plateau to allow local air temperatures at any particular lake site to be adequately estimated from standard composite air temperature series. In early summer, day-to-day variability in air temperature is reflected extremely well in the temperature of the uppermost metre of the water column, while monthly mean air temperatures correspond well, with respect to both absolute value and interannual variations, with water temperatures in most of the epilimnion. Standardised altitude-corrected air temperature series may therefore be a useful alternative to surface water temperatures for the purposes of calibrating lake temperature inference models. In Northern Hemisphere temperate regions, mean air and water temperatures are likely to correspond most closely in July, suggesting that calibration and reconstruction efforts be concentrated on this month.

The concentration of the pollutants varied seasonally, approaching levels in precipitation at high water discharge. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that PCB congener distribution in river water at high flow was similar to that found in precipitation. At low water discharge, and coinciding with high water temperatures during summer, concentration of PCB increased. The relationships indicated desorption of PCB from sediment, a conclusion supported by PCA of the congener distribution in the sediment and water. The results, consequently, revealed two sources of PCB to river water, atmospheric dominance during high flow and internal, sediment recycling during low flows explaining seasonal variation.																			0013-936X					NOV	1997	31	11					3232	3237		10.1021/es9702172	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es9702172													WOS:A1997YE04000052

Vertical distribution of alewife in the Lake Ontario offshore: Implications for resource use	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Oligotrophication of Lake Ontario has led to increased water clarity and an increased proportion of zooplankton residing in the metalimnion during the day, which may affect the utilization of different depth regions for planktivorous fish. We investigated day and night distributions of fish using hydroacoustics and suspended vertical gillnets during the summer of 2013 when a deep chlorophyll layer (DCL) was established. We related fish distributions to concurrent measures of temperature and prey (zooplankton) density. Alewife dominated in vertical gill net catches, indicating that most acoustic targets were alewife. Alewife schooled during the day in the bottom of the mixed layer, and at dusk alewife schools broke up and fish moved towards the surface. We hypothesize this movement followed migrating zooplankton to allow feeding at night; alewife sampled from vertical gillnets fed on cyclopoid copepods and cladocerans, prey groups that migrate into the epilimnion at night. Some alewife remained at the bottom of the mixed layer at night and these fish ate deep-water calanoid copepods such as Limnocalanus. Vertical distributions were best predicted by temperature and the interaction between temperature and zooplankton density. We include uplooking acoustics data to complement our downlooking datasets, which provided evidence for potential bias in downlooking acoustic assessments of alewife due to high proportions of alewife found in the surface exclusion zone. Our approach combining several datasets provides a new perspective to understand summer diel distribution of alewife and the factors driving their distribution.

Crustacean zooplankton available for larval walleyes in a Lake Michigan embayment	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Adequate densities of zooplankton prey are critical for growth and survival of larvae of many fish species. Little information exists on the density of zooplankton in Great Lakes inshore areas during early spring, when larvae of important fishes rely on zooplankton. Reduced age-0 walleye recruitment and the absence of data on zooplankton availability for larval walleyes in northern Green Bay, Lake Michigan, led us to assess zooplankton densities during this critical spring period. We conducted biweekly vertical plankton tows in 2014-2016 near reefs and river plumes used by spawning walleyes for periods when larval walleyes were expected to be relying on zooplankton prey. Densities of zooplankton were well below literature values identified for good growth and survival of larval walleyes, averaging 1.5 individuals L-1 for all taxa and 0.12 individuals L-1 for large-bodied taxa across all sites and sampling dates. Various factors could contribute to the low density of zooplankton observed. We found low but significantly higher densities of cyclopoid copepods, nauplii, Bosmina, and total zooplankton at river mouth sites compared to open water sites. These results suggest that food availability for larval walleye in our study area was severely limiting which is consistent with the paucity of strong year classes observed since 2000. We suspect northern Green Bay has limited potential for producing strong year classes of walleyes under such conditions. Fishery managers working in unproductive waters should consider assessing the zooplankton community during critical periods to identify potential bottlenecks to reproductive success and larval fish survival.

While glacier-fed lakes play a crucial role in global carbon cycling, related studies are limited. In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal variability of DIC in the maritime glacier-fed lakes of the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, identifying the carbon sources and potential controlling factors of DIC pathways The results revealed significant temporal variations in DIC and delta 13C-DIC, with averages of 7.29 +/- 0.45 mg C L-1 and -8.6 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand in summer, and 3.40 +/- 0.54 mg C L-1 and -7.4 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand in winter, respectively. Temporal variations in DIC and delta 13C-DIC were mainly controlled by carbonates weathering and silicate weathering processes. The chemical weathering reactions facilitate the consumption of dissolved CO2. Undersaturated pCO2 (120.02 +/- 29.18 mu atm) relative to atmospheric equilibrium suggests considerable capacity for CO2 uptake within glacier-fed lakes system. We estimated that the maritime glacier-fed lakes in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau absorb a total of 9.6 +/- 2.7 x 10-3 Tg C-CO2 yr-1, highlighting their significant contribution to the global carbon budget. The distinctive landscape of the glacier-fed system and the vulnerable weathering environment result in seasonal and spatial variations of DIC concentration and delta 13C-DIC values, as well as the chemical weathering-induced CO2 sink in glacier regions. Given the accelerated glacier retreat observed in this area, further studies on the temporal variability of DIC in the water column are urgently needed to identify the mechanisms driving the biogeochemical reactions inside glacier-fed lake. Our study highlights the unrecognized role of maritime glacier-fed lakes as CO2 sinks and emphasizes their significance in regional carbon budgets. Maritime glacier-fed lakes play important roles in global carbon cycling; however, the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) source, transportation, and transition are not well-known. Here we investigated the spatiotemporal variations of DIC and identified that maritime glacier-fed lakes in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau as atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) sinks. We found significant temporal variations in DIC and delta 13C-DIC, primarily controlled by carbonate and silicate weathering. The glacier-fed lake system displayed tremendous CO2 uptake potential and almost 9.6 +/- 2.7 x 10-3 Tg C-CO2 was absorbed by the maritime glacier-fed lakes per year in this region. The unique landscape of the glacier-fed lake system and vulnerable weathering environment have led to the formation of CO2 sinks.

The stalagmite delta O-18 record characterizes orbital- to decadal-scale variability of Asian summer monsoon (ASM) intensity, with the Holocene optimum period (HOP) between 9.8 and 6.8 ka BP which is reinforced by its co-varying delta C-13 data. The large multi-decadal scale amplitude of the cave delta O-18 indicates its high sensitivity to climate change. Four centennial-scale weak ASM events during the early Holocene are centered at 11.2, 10.8, 9.1 and 8.2 ka. They can be correlated to cold periods in the northern high latitudes, possibly resulting from rapid dynamics of atmospheric circulation associated with North Atlantic cooling. The 8.2 ka event has an amplitude more than two-thirds that of the Younger Dryas (YD), and is significantly stronger than other cave records in the Asia monsoon region, likely indicating a more severe dry climate condition at the cave site. At the end of the YD event, the delta C-13 record lags the also record by 300-500 yr, suggesting a multi-centennial slow response of vegetation and soil processes to monsoon enhancement.

Quantitative summer temperature reconstruction derived from a combined biogenic Si and chironomid record from varved sediments of Lake Silvaplana (south-eastern Swiss Alps) back to AD 1177	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												High-resolution quantitative temperature records are needed for placing the recent warming into the context of long-term natural climate variability. In this study we present a quantitative high-resolution (9-year) summer (June August) temperature reconstruction back to AD 1177 for the south-eastern Swiss Alps. This region is a good predictor for summer temperatures in large parts of western and central Europe. Our reconstruction is based on a combination of the high-frequency component of annually resolved biogenic silica (bSi flux) data and the low-frequency component of decadal chironomid-inferred temperatures from annually laminated well dated sediments (varves) from proglacial Lake Silvaplana, eastern Swiss Alps. For the calibration (period AD 1760-1949) we assess systematically the effects of six different regression methods (Type I regressions: Inverse Regression IR, Inverse Prediction IP, Generalised Least Squares GLS; Type II regressions: Major Axis MA, Ranged Major Axis RMA and Standard Major Axis SMA) with regard to the predicted amplitude and the calibration statistics such as root-mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP), reduction of error (RE) and coefficient of efficiency (CE). We found a trade-off in the regression model choice between a good representation of the amplitude and good calibration statistics. The band-pass filtered bSi flux record is in close agreement both in the structure and the amplitude with two fully independent reconstructions spanning back to AD 1500 and AD 1177, respectively. All known pulses of negative volcanic forcing are represented as cold anomalies in the bSi flux record. Volcanic pulses combined with low solar activity (Sporer and Maunder Minimum) are seen as particularly cold episodes around AD 1460 and AD 1690. The combined chironomid and bSi flux temperature record (RMSEP = 0.57 degrees C) is in good agreement with the glacier history of the Alps. The warmest (AD 1190) and coldest decades (17th century; 1680-1700) of our reconstruction coincide with the largest anomalies in the Alpine tree-ring based reconstruction; both records show in the decadal variability an amplitude of 2.8 degrees C between AD 1180 and 1950, which is substantially higher than the amplitude of hemispheric reconstructions. Our record suggests that the current decade is slightly warmer than the warmest decade in the pre-industrial time of the past 800 years. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

B	Alder, DD		Cannon, BQ; Embry, JL		Alder, Douglas D.			Utah's Recent Growth The St. George/Washington County Example	UTAH IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY												According to most Salt Lake City television stations, there are two types of weather in Utah: the Wasatch Front (basically Salt Lake City) and Utah's Dixie (St. George). One of the fastest-growing areas in the United States because of its mild winters, St. George played an increasingly important role in Utah during the twentieth century (although Brigham Young's winter home may have forecast the area's future). While other authors use St. George to illustrate their conclusions, Douglas D. Alder focuses on the way that Utah's Dixie changed from a provincial religious community to a retirement one and how it differs from Cache Valley, another rapidly growing area in northern Utah. Using local development records and personal experience, he carefully spells out the reasons why people come to St. George and why they stay. He also points out the challenges and advantages the increased population has brought to the area. His essay provides a model to help us understand other changing areas in the state. Alder's experience as a professor at Utah State University and president of Dixie College makes him the ideal person to put the St. George story in a larger Utah context.																					978-0-87421-745-2				2009							385	401																WOS:000294543700021

Ramana			The Pulicat, a distinctive shallow lagoon: Hypersalinity, thermodynamics and meromixis	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Modelled and observed tendencies of temperature and salinity are investigated to assess the factors governing the heat and salt in the Pulicat lagoon, a hypersaline (>3.5%) lagoon along the south east coast of India. The salinity of the lagoon is extremely fluctuating, shifting regimes from fresh to hypersaline on seasonal scales. Examination of the spatio-temporal variability of the salinity of the lagoon shows certain regions of the lagoon remain hypersaline during most of the year. Hydrology and vertical solar heat fluxes constitute the major governing factors of the salt and heat of the lagoon respectively, while advection by hydrodynamics is important in specific regions during particular time of the year. Extremely high salinities higher than previously reported values, exceeding those during severe drought conditions were observed during this study period. A first account of meromixis with high heliothermic subsurface temperature and salinity during winter months November to February of different years in an embedded region of the lagoon is reported.

JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The formation of chlorophyll a degradation products was measured with natural phytoplankton from Lake Constance and Daphnia magna and native Daphnia as grazers in grazing experiments during spring bloom conditions using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Chlorophyll a start concentrations were between 1.2 and 16.3 mu g l(-1); phaeopigment weights constituted similar to 5% of chlorophyll a weight. Only phaeophorbide a was a marker for Daphnia grazing; concentrations of other phaeopigments (phaeophytin a, chlorophyllide a and two unidentified phaeopigments) did not increase during Daphnia grazing. Conversion efficiencies (chlorophyll a to phaeophorbide a) were between 0 and 43% on a weight basis, and between 0 and 65% on a molar basis. Conversion efficiencies were highest at high grazer density (40 Daphnia l(-1)) and after a 24 h exposure time. Grazing by microzooplankton probably led to the formation of the two unidentified phaeopigments. In Lake Constance, Daphnia density was significantly positively correlated with the phaeophorbide a/chlorophyll a ratio when it was <5000 Daphnia m(-3). However, when higher Daphnia densities were included in calculations, then Daphnia density was positively, but insignificantly, correlated with the phaeophorbide a/chlorophyll a ratio. This suggests that when the level of food per Daphnia is low, then grazing is more efficient with less production of phaeophorbide a and a higher production of colourless products.																			0142-7873					AUG	1998	20	8					1449	1462		10.1093/plankt/20.8.1449	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/20.8.1449													WOS:000075493300003

Evaluating the contributions and economic costs for Walleye fry and fingerling stocking in a large midwestern reservoir	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Stocking is a common management practice to maintain Walleye populations where natural recruitment is low or to introduce and sustain Walleye populations outside of their native range. Walleye can be stocked at multiple lengths (e.g., fry and fingerling) and different sizes of stocked Walleye may contribute differently to Walleye year class strength, depending on the system into which they are stocked. The cost associated with stocking also varies by product. Therefore, it is important to determine the contributions from different stocked products within a region or for an individual waterbody. The objectives of our research were to 1) compare the relative contribution of and total length and body condition at the time of capture at age-0 between stocked Walleye fry and fingerlings and naturally produced individuals; and 2) estimate and compare the economic costs of Walleye fry and fingerling production relative to their contribution to the age-0 catch in Lake McConaughy during 2022 and 2023.We collected 178 and 263 age-0 Walleyes from Lake McConaughy during the summer and fall of 2022 and 2023, respectively. Fingerling-stocked Walleye contributed 2.12 times in 2022 and 2.92 times more in 2023 than fry-stocked Walleye. Production cost estimates revealed that fry cost 1.08 and 1.35 times greater than fingerlings per stocking unit in 2022 and 2023, thus fingerlings were deemed the most cost-effective product in this study. Walleye stocked as fry were significantly longer at the time of collection in 2022 and were in significantly better condition in both years compared to fingerling stocked Walleye. Our results provide valuable insights for fisheries managers by offering a case study example as well as offering a practical approach to guide effective management decisions on which stocked product is most appropriate for other systems. Overall, this research enhances the existing literature on Walleye stocking in large reservoir systems, offering practical and useful information for effective management decisions.

This network crossed the actively deforming Northern Canadian Cordillera and the Mackenzie Mountains in Yukon, California; it also extended into the Canadian Shield in Northwest Territories, California. The array was deployed between July 2016 and August 2018 (with four pilot stations installed in July 2015 and three extended stations operating through August 2019) coinciding with and complementing the deployment of the EarthScope Transportable Array to Alaska and western Canada. In this article, we present an overview of project scientific objectives, station configurations, and site conditions; discuss environmental challenges, including those that resulted in station downtime (e.g., spring flooding and encounters with bears); and suggest potential solutions to such subarctic challenges for the benefit of future deployments in comparable regions.

Predictive models were developed for chlorophyll a from July 1994 (R-2 = 0.80) and December 1994 (R-2 = 0.84) data and for Secchi disc depth (R-2 = 0.96) from February 1995 data. These models were then tested using historic chlorophyll a data compiled from the previous ten years. The July 1994 model satisfactorily predicted chlorophyll a levels in six of the ten years and this improved to five out of five years when only summer seasons were considered. Phytoplankton analyses suggested an influence on algorithm development with respect to species composition at the time of satellite flyby.																			0143-1161	1366-5901				APR 15	1999	20	6					1057	1072		10.1080/014311699212849	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/014311699212849													WOS:000080119700002

One of these mechanisms works in well-mixed environments and corresponds to the classical critical depth theory. The other mechanism is based on the rate of turbulent mixing. If turbulent mixing is less than a critical turbulence, phytoplankton growth rates exceed the vertical mixing rates, and a bloom develops irrespective of the depth of the upper water layer. These results demonstrate that phytoplankton blooms can develop in the absence of vertical water-column stratification.					; Huisman, Jef/A-1089-2013	Weissing, Franz J./0000-0003-3281-663X; Huisman, Jef/0000-0001-9598-3211													0024-3590					NOV	1999	44	7					1781	1787		10.4319/lo.1999.44.7.1781	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1999.44.7.1781													WOS:000083446900017

Holocene temperature and precipitation variability on the central Tibetan Plateau revealed by multiple palaeo-climatic proxy records from an alpine wetland sequence	HOLOCENE												This study has reconstructed the Holocene environmental history of central Tibetan Plateau, a transitional area between monsoon-dominated Asia and Westerlies-dominated Asia, to examine the interplay between the two circulation systems and effects of other potential mechanisms on the temporal variability of Holocene climatic conditions in the study area. Specifically, this study has produced a twin record of palaeo-hydrology and palaeo-temperature from an alpine wetland sediment sequence using two sets of lipid-based biomarker indices: n-alkanes and branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (bGDGTs). The results show that (1) the Asian summer monsoon has supplied moisture that helped initiate the wetland habitat around 8000 cal. yr BP, about 2000 years later than locations along the southeastern edge of the plateau; (2) a significant decline in moisture supply is evident since the Medieval Warm period; (3) the Westerlies have transmitted variability of the North Atlantic climate to the study area, resulting in periodic increases in evaporation and causing short-term expansion or contraction of the wetland and (4) the palaeo-air temperature change follows closely that of global sea level and sea surface temperature, implying a link to global ice volume change throughout the Holocene. This study concludes that the Holocene climate history of central Tibetan Plateau is a result of monsoonal moisture supply interacted with the Westerlies variability, while the palaeo-temperature has followed changes in global ice volume during the present warm interglacial.

J	Liu, Z; Harrison, SP; Kutzbach, J; Otto-Bliesner, B				Liu, Z; Harrison, SP; Kutzbach, J; Otto-Bliesner, B			Global monsoons in the mid-Holocene and oceanic feedback	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												The response of the six major summer monsoon systems (the North American monsoon, the northern Africa monsoon, the Asia monsoon, the northern Australasian monsoon, the South America monsoon and the southern Africa monsoon) to mid-Holocene orbital forcing has been investigated using a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model (FOAM), with the focus on the distinct roles of the direct insolation forcing and oceanic feedback. The simulation result is also found to compare well with the NCAR CSM. The direct effects of the change in insolation produce an enhancement of the Northern Hemisphere monsoons and a reduction of the Southern Hemisphere monsoons. Ocean feedbacks produce a further enhancement of the northern Africa monsoon and the North American monsoon. However, ocean feedbacks appear to weaken the Asia monsoon, although the overall effect (direct insolation forcing plus ocean feedback) remains a strengthened monsoon. The impact of ocean feedbacks on the South American and southern African monsoons is relatively small, and therefore these regions, especially the South America, experienced a reduced monsoon regime compared to present. However, there is a strong ocean feedback on the northern Australian monsoon that negates the direct effects of orbital changes and results in a strengthening of austral summer monsoon precipitation in this region. A new synthesis is made for mid-Holocene paleoenvironmental records and is compared with the model simulations. Overall, model simulations produce changes in regional climates that are generally consistent with paleoenvironmental observations.

The focus is on fall because increasing precipitation in this season has contributed to record high lake levels since the 1960s and because the causes can be synoptically evaluated. Precipitation events were identified for the period 1935-95 from NOAA Daily Weather Maps. Precipitation days were classified as one of nine types. Trends in the precipitation classifications, 24-h precipitation totals, and the frequency and intensity of precipitation days and events were analyzed. It was found that the precipitation increased 15% over the basin and 35% at Grand Rapids, Michigan, from 1935- 65 to 1966-95. The increased precipitation was driven by an increase in the amount of precipitation per day (from low pressure systems and warm, stationary, and occluded fronts) and an increase in the frequency of precipitation days (from troughs and cold, warm, stationary, and occluded fronts). All classifications except for isolated convection contributed to the increase. Increases from warm, stationary, and occluded fronts contributed the most. Analysis of precipitation mechanisms and large-scale circulation features for two 10-yr periods from 1950 to 1959 and from 1980 to 1989 revealed that higher precipitation amounts were associated with a more zonal flow pattern that existed over the United States during 1980-89. This pattern was accompanied by more baroclinicity and moisture over the Rockies, a stronger upper-troposphere subtropical jet, and stronger low-level flow from the Gulf of Mexico. These features allowed a greater number of southern systems with more moisture to influence the region. Specifically, the increased frequency of low pressure systems approaching from the south( west) and their associated more rapid deepening rates allowed more precipitation from warm, stationary, and occluded fronts. The similarities in the synoptic precipitation classifications and precipitation amounts between the two 10-yr periods and the two 30-yr periods examined suggest that more meridional flow was present for much of the 1935-65 period and that more zonal flow was present for much of the 1966-95 period.																			0894-8755					JUL	2002	15	14					1943	1956		10.1175/1520-0442(2002)015<1943:TIOLSF>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0442(2002)015<1943:TIOLSF>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000176655500009

Survivorship of mussels in air significantly increased with increasing RH, decreasing temperature, and increasing mussel size. At 20 degrees C and 50% RH (early temperate summer conditions), large (21-28 mm) D. polymorpha survived more than 5 days exposure, whereas small (10-18 mm) D. polymorpha survived 1-3 days. Seventy-three percent of large D. polymorpha and 10% of small D. polymorpha survived 10 days exposure at conditions considered optimal for survivorship (10 degrees C and 95% RH). Survivorship of D. bugensis was tested at 20 degrees C and was 15-100% lower than that of D. polymorpha at all RH levels combined with exposures less than 5 days. Dreissena bugensis also suffered significantly higher percent weight losses because of desiccation than D. polymorpha. The differences in the desiccation tolerance of zebra and quagga mussels reflect their relative depth distribution in lakes. Our results suggest that, given temperate summer conditions, adult Dreissena may survive overland transport (e.g., on small trailered boats) to any location within 3-5 days' drive of infested waterbodies.					; Ricciardi, Anthony/A-8536-2010	Ricciardi, Anthony/0000-0003-1492-0054; 													0706-652X					MAR	1995	52	3					470	477		10.1139/f95-048	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f95-048													WOS:A1995RR80700004

J	Lonergan, T; Marsicano, L; Wagener, M				Lonergan, Thomas; Marsicano, Laurence; Wagener, Mitch			A laboratory examination of the effectiveness of a winter seasonal lake drawdown to control invasive Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum)	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												A set of laboratory studies were conducted to identify abiotic conditions associated with winter lake drawdowns that might be capable of sufficiently damaging root systems of Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum) to prevent shoot regrowth. Two separate conditions prevented regrowth: exposure of roots in hydrated sediment to a temperature of -5 C for 24 h or longer with a slow thaw over 12 h, or exposure to a sediment water content equivalent to 0.02 m(3)/m(3) for 48 h or longer. Eurasian watermilfoil can therefore be killed by freezing at -5 C or desiccation at 4 C in as short a time as 24-48 h, and a percent relative electrolyte leakage (% REL) of 80% or higher is sufficient to prevent shoot regrowth. The ability to regrow shoots after freezing at -5 C did not correlate to the sediment hydration level. Treatments that did not damage roots sufficiently to prevent shoot regrowth included freezing at -5 C with a 10 cm snow cover above the sediment; freezing at -5 C for 1 d with roots submerged in standing water, as would occur if exposed plants were standing in pooled water prior to freezing; and freezing at 0 C for 4 d. Treatments that resulted in partial root damage but still allowed subsequent shoot regrowth included freezing at -5 C in standing water for 4 d, and freezing at -5 C for 4 d with a rapid thawing of roots. Monitoring of temperature and moisture content of the exposed littoral zone in sequential years indicated that both damaging conditions were observed in the 2009-2010 drawdown season, but neither condition was observed in the 2010-2011 season, suggesting that the interannual variability in response to drawdowns is probably the result of variable annual climate conditions. Monitoring the exposed sediment could indicate if and when conditions suitable for killing root crowns have been satisfied and the appropriate timing to reverse the drawdown.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2014	30	4					381	392		10.1080/10402381.2014.954736	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2014.954736													WOS:000344167000006

We discussed the succession of benthic macroinvertebrates in relation to changes in the lake bottom environment, as evidence of lake eutrophication. On March 10, 2015, a bathymetrical sampling survey was carried out using a standard Ekman grab at each of the 5 stations (min. ca. 6 m - max. ca. 27 m) in Lake Nojiri. The average densities of the benthic communities for all the stations were ca. 5000 m(-2), comprised principally of oligochaetes ca. 2800 m(-2) (57%) and chironomids ca. 2100 m(-2) (43%), whereas their benthic biomass averaged ca. 9.7 g m(-2), chironomids ca. 7.6 g m(-2) (77%) and oligochaetes ca. 2.3 g m(-2) (23%). In the shallower stations, the dominant species was Heterotrissocladius sp., but Chironomus nipponensis Tokunaga was the dominant species in the deeper stations. The densities of C. nipponensis was ca. 14 times higher than those reported by Miyadi in 1931 and 4 times higher than reported by Kitagawa in 1973a. In recent years the density of the oligochaete Tubifex tubifex (Miller), has tended to increase and the anoxic-and anaerobic-layer have thickened, especially in deeper regions where they are widely distributed. Moreover, we found differences in the C. nipponensis larval growth rate with water depth, i.e., small IV-instar larvae that dominated at the deepest Station 5. At this station, we suggest that low dissolved oxygen concentration and low water temperature during summer-fall suppresses growth of C. nipponensis. Large environmental changes must have affected chironomid and oligochaete densities and growth rate of C. nipponensis, especially in the deeper regions with low dissolved oxygen concentrations, low water temperature and high organic matter (ignition loss; 15.0% in St. 4 and 13.9% in St. 5) in the sediments. This is a strong evidence that the eutrophication of this lake is continuing.																			1129-5767	1723-8633					2018	77			1			81	87		10.4081/jlimnol.2018.1781	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2018.1781													WOS:000453842300011

Drainage Ditches ("Hot Spots") and Storms ("Hot Moments") Define Aquatic Greenhouse Gas (CO2, CH4, N2O) Emissions From the Land-to-Ocean Aquatic Continuum	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Humans are altering coastal regions directly (land-use, drainage) and indirectly (climate change). Alterations potentially create positive climate feedback loops by enhancing production and emission of aquatic greenhouse gases (GHGs) CO2, N2O, and CH4. We tested this hypothesis by measuring dissolved CO2, N2O, and CH4 concentrations across the anthropogenic aquatic continuum (farm ponds, ditches, irrigation drains, streams, tidal rivers, and estuaries) and continuously during a winter storm. Combining measurements with hydrodynamic modeling enabled us to parameterize physical gas transfer uncertainties, revealing artificial waterways contributed disproportionately to emissions. Ditches and drains cover 5% of water surface area but produced >50% of emissions (2-11 Mmol d-1 CO2-equivalents). But storms inverted this pattern by increasing estuary emissions 16-fold (5.0 Mmol d-1 CO2-equivalent), suggesting storm patterns could control both sources and magnitudes of aquatic GHG emissions. Findings show overlooked artificial drains and hard-to-measure storms will increasingly define the aquatic offsets of landscape carbon budgets.

The clearhead icefish (Protosalanx chinensis, Basilewsky, 1855) is a small, pelagic, and commercially important fish that mainly feeds on zooplankton and will transition to feeding on fish when prey fish are available, though its life span is only about one year. In fact, we know little about the food selectivity and diet shifting of P. chinensis before its transition to feeding on fish. To reveal the food selectivity of P. chinensis before its transition to feeding on fish, the gut contents and environmental zooplankton community were investigated simultaneously in Lake Dalong of Northeastern China from April to June 2021. The results showed that P. chinensis experienced a diet shift from copepoda to cladocera during spring in Lake Dalong. From April to early June, both the size of cladocera and copepoda in guts increased as the size of P. chinensis increased. However, the favorite category changed to the smaller cladocera in late June, when the density of the smaller cladocera was rather high relatively. Considering June was the critical period for P. chinensis to prepare for transitioning to feeding on fish, the food resources availability must be seriously considered for sustainable aquaculture of P. chinensis. It was hypothesized that there was a trade-off of feeding selectivity between the size and density of the prey.

Proposed sources of methane along the Dead Sea Transform	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												The concentrations and isotopic compositions of methane, higher alkanes, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and CO2 were studied in fresh groundwater, brines and springs along the Dead Sea Transform (DST), from the Hula Valley in the north to the Dead Sea (DS) basin in the south. Although the occurrence of methane along the DST was documented before, this is the first time that comprehensive research was conducted on the methane provenance and the post-genetic reactions involved. The methane stable carbon isotopic composition (delta C-13(CH4)) shows a distinct geographic pattern. In the northern part of the DST studied, in the Hula valley and Lake Kinneret, where recent marshy and lacustrine environments exist, the methane source seems to be related to intense shallow depth methanogenesis. This microbial methane shows low C-13 values in the range of delta C-13(CH4) between -58 parts per thousand and -72 parts per thousand and high alkane ratios (C-1/C-2 + C-3) between 100 and 1000. The isotope fractionation alpha(CO2-CH4) of 1.065 parts per thousand suggests the domination of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis rather than acetoclastic methanogenesis. In the waters of Hammat Gader and Tiberias hot spring, whose source is the Cretaceous aquifer, delta C-13(CH4) has high values of -28 parts per thousand and -56 parts per thousand, respectively, with low alkane ratios of similar to 40 in both sites. The high delta H-2(CH4) values of Hammat Gader, in addition to the isotopic composition of the DIC and the difference between CO2 and CH4, reject the possibility of local microbially produced methane and suggest a sub-surface thermogenic source of an initial stage of thermal degradation of bituminous chalk of Senonian age. Similarly, methane in groundwater from the DS basin is also interpreted to be of thermogenic origin. In accordance with the local geology context in the DS basin of buried asphalt, and due to the low geothermal gradient in the region, it is speculated that methane is produced from slight heating of the asphalts. In general, it seems that there is a thermogenic methane contribution along the entire DST, which is locally masked by high microbial activity in shallow organic-rich environments, such as Lake Kinneret and the Hula basin.

For water samples, NOs were detected all the year round (0.11-3.08 ng ml(-1)) at high frequency (48/48) in the eight rivers. OC was detected at lower concentrations (ND similar to 0.09 ng ml(-1)) and at lower frequency (23/48). The concentrations of NOs in the river water always showed minimum values at 5-8 degrees C in winter. It was presumed that the formation of NOs by the biotransformation of nonylphenol polyethoxylates decreased much in the sludge treatment of nonionic surfactants at the low temperature (5-8 degrees C) in winter. Average BCF values of NOs and OC in the six kinds of fish were calculated from the field data. The field BCF values of NOs 15-31 in the six kinds of fish were lower than the laboratory BCF Values of 167 in Killifish and 282 in Salmon. For OC, the field BCF values 129-297 for the three kinds of fish were nearly equal to the laboratory BCF value, 261, in Killifish. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Hawes, I; Howard-Williams, C; Gilbert, N; Joy, K				Hawes, Ian; Howard-Williams, Clive; Gilbert, Neil; Joy, Kurt			Towards an Environmental Classification of Lentic Aquatic Ecosystems in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The McMurdo Dry Valleys are the largest single ice-free area in Antarctica, and of considerable scientific and conservation value as an extreme polar desert. This is recognised through the McMurdo Dry Valleys Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA), where management's goals focus on protection of its unique features, while facilitating science access. Using a mix of remote sensing and existing cartography, we have identified over 6000 lakes and ponds in the ASMA. This study develops a classification of those aquatic ecosystems to provide a framework for management. It uses a limited top-down, hierarchical classification to define 13 class separations based on physical attributes that could largely be ascribed from existing databases or remotely sensed information. The first hierarchical level was based on landscape position, separating coastal kettle holes (reflecting recent glacial history), from other "topographic" water bodies. The second level was based on endorheic vs exorheic drainage, the third on mid-summer ice condition (no-ice cap; ice capped; frozen to base) and the fourth on source of inflow (glacial or non-glacial). Kettles were sub-classed by mid-summer ice only. Classes were tested against a set of field observations and an expert workshop validation process considered management implications for the ASMA. This study shows how the classification assists our understanding of Dry Valley landscapes and addresses management issues faced by researchers, environmental managers and policy makers. The approach to classification, rather than the detailed classes that may be specific to the Dry Valleys, has potential for wider use in other polar landscapes.

J	van Wyck, PC				van Wyck, Peter C.			An Emphatic Geography: Notes on the Ethical Itinerary of Landscape	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION												The year 2007 marked the beginning of the fourth International Polar Year, another frenzy of big science and circumpolar interest in questions of sovereignty, climate change, resources, and so on. At the same time, in the domain of the humanities, there are a host of re-elaborations of the very discourses of nordicity that seek to bring to light a North that is no longer merely an empty space and passage to elsewhere; rather, it is a North that has become a site and a figure, and a caution and a limit-a problem, in other words. My text proceeds from the unstable ground of this refigured nordicity. In the summer of 2005, I went North to the Mackenzie River basin with the typewritten field journals of Harold Innis. The young Innis had made the same trip in the summer of 1924, and my initial interest was an attempt to retrace his steps and to reflect on the place of North (as margin) in the development of his ideas at that time. Where his abiding concern had been production, innovation, and social relations, my own interest concerned method, writing, and landscape. Nonetheless, as I travelled up the length of the "River of Disappointment," as Mackenzie called it, a methodological dialogue emerged.																			0705-3657	1499-6642					2008	33	2					171	191																WOS:000420229400003

Thirty-six residential sites, 12 on each of three Duke Energy lakes (Lake Norman, Lake Hickory, and Lake Wylie), were selected for the study. Each site had an automated, underground irrigation system that directly drew water from the Duke Energy lake that the property bordered. None of the systems had previously been metered and there was no charge to homeowners for withdrawing water from the bordering lake. All sites were instrumented with water meters in 2009 to monitor irrigation water withdrawals, and irrigation system audits were performed before installation of smart technologies. After collecting baseline water-use data in 2009, existing controllers were replaced with one of three smart controllers at 27 of the study sites in 2010, and irrigation was monitored through the end of the 2011 irrigation season. Irrigation treatments included a standard irrigation controller with an add-on soil moisture sensor system (SMS), an evapotranspiration (ET) based controller that received daily reference evapotranspiration estimates from a third-party provider (ET1), an evapotranspiration-based controller with an on-site weather sensor (ET2), and a comparison group that used the existing irrigation controller with no intervention (COMP). Weekly water withdrawals were monitored with on-site data loggers, and turf quality was visually rated and characterized with a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) meter. The SMS treatment applied the most irrigation per week (mean of 27.4mmweek-1), compared with 24.7mmweek-1 for the ET1 treatment, and the COMP and ET2 treatments that applied 20.9 and 19.9mmweek-1, respectively. Although applying the most irrigation, the SMS treatment had the greatest effect on water-use behavior for sites receiving technologies, reducing irrigation by 11.7mmweek-1 compared with the baseline year in which the SMS group applied the most water. There was no evidence of a change in water-use behavior in the COMP treatment, but collectively the smart treatments reduced irrigation from 60% more than the gross irrigation requirement (GIR) in 2009 to only 10% more than GIR in 2010 and 2011, without adversely affecting the turf quality. Visual turf quality ratings in the COMP treatment were slightly less than the minimally acceptable level, which may have resulted from underirrigation during high water demand periods. Several challenges to retrofitting existing systems and issues with smart controllers were observed, including poorly designed and maintained existing irrigation systems, incompatibility between existing controllers and SMS sensor modules, failure of all nine soil-moisture sensors, communication failures in ET-based controllers, and manual overrides of smart technologies by study participants. This study emphasizes the importance of proper installation, programming, and maintenance of smart technologies on suitable irrigation systems if they are to function correctly. To maximize water savings, smart irrigation retrofits should be targeted toward systems that historically overirrigate.

For this study, we conducted systematic analysis of magnetic minerals in sediments from Lugu Lake in northwestern Yunnan Province. Magnetic measurements suggest that magnetite dominated the studied magnetic mineral assemblages. Both natural origins and anthropogenic activities are considered to be the sources of the magnetic minerals based on the correlations of chi vs. chi(fd)% and chi(ARM)/chi. The magnetic minerals of natural origins can be attributed to terrestrial detrital input rather than biogenic sources. Combined with diatom and geochemical records, magnetic parameters including chi, chi(fd)%, and Sratio can be used as sensitive indicators of ISM change, and suggest that two significant dry periods occurred in the Medieval Warm Period (MWP, 800-1300 CE) and Roman Warm Period (RWP, 0-400 CE) and two relatively wet intervals in the Dark Ages Cold Period (DACP, 400-800 CE) and Little Ice Age (LIA, 1300-1850 CE). Significant shifts of magnetic parameters in Lugu Lake samples revealed sensitivity to precipitation-controlled catchment erosion. The climatic patterns shown by the magnetic characteristics were generally similar to those in extensive areas dominated by the ISM. We speculate that rainfall caused by the ISM during the last 2000 years may be related to the variations of El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the mean position migration of the ITCZ.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				SEP 15	2021	578								110581	10.1016/j.palaeo.2021.110581	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2021.110581		JUL 2021											WOS:000684182500015

In this research, a biogeochemical analysis of a sediment core from Lake Ebinur, Xinjiang, allowed us to infer the climate and environmental changes in the late Quaternary in arid northwestern China. The combined lipid biomarkers and bulk biogeochemical properties (TOC, delta C-13(org)) revealed moderately wet conditions from 34 to 28 ka, favoring the growth of terrestrial vegetation. The subsequent period from 28 to 13 ka was dominated by aquatic plants, algae and microbes, indicating cold and dry conditions. Ameliorated regional moisture conditions were deduced from the higher carbon preference index (CPI) and from delta C-13(org) values from 13 to 3.6 ka. The optimum climate conditions occurred from 9 to 5 ka. Several climatic events also exist in the Lake Ebinur records with a wide distribution into other regions. Our biogeochemical-based paleoclimate and paleoenvironmental reconstruction is generally synchronous with sedimentary records from mid-latitude Eurasia and the NGRIP ice core record, which probably has a certain linkage with the 45 degrees N summer insolation. We propose that summer insolation conditions in the northern hemisphere might have an impact on the climate and environmental changes in arid northwestern China in the late Quaternary.						ji, li li/0000-0001-8483-1554; Ma, Long/0000-0002-8233-8640													1437-3254	1437-3262				OCT	2019	108	7					2361	2371		10.1007/s00531-019-01767-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00531-019-01767-x													WOS:000491296500012
J	Chemagin, AA; Schletterer, M				Chemagin, Andrey A.; Schletterer, Martin			Insights into Daily Dynamics of Fish Migration during Spring in the Konda River	DIVERSITY-BASEL												Hydrology and temperature are known as key drivers for fish migration in floodplain-channel systems of large rivers. The Lower Irtysh contains valuable species of whitefish and sturgeon. Thus, along the Konda River, a complex study was carried out in order to investigate fish migration in spring, with a focus on daily and monthly dynamics. To estimate the number of fish passing up- and downstream, a hydroacoustic system with a scanning beam frequency of 455 kHz was deployed in May 2017. The survey revealed the presence of three peaks in migration activity, as well as differences between a location close to the shore and another in the main channel. Regression analysis revealed a high degree of reliability of the influence of water temperature on the number of migrating fish (p < 0.001). The dataset also showed a daily rhythm of fish migration. An analysis of the daily variation in the illumination index and the intensity of fish migration revealed the presence of noticeable and high correlations for upstream (RS = 0.55; p < 0.05) and downstream migration (RS = 0.71; p < 0.001), respectively. Our data underline the importance of temperature as a trigger for fish migration and reveal diurnal patterns related to illumination.

Frost events frequently lead to yield losses and quality reduction. This has motivated the development of several frost protection measures, which differ in terms of effectiveness, costs and workload. In many cases, it is an open question for fruit growers if investing in frost protection is worthwhile and which strategy would most positively affect their bottom line. OBJECTIVE: To support decision-making, we applied a participatory process with frost protection experts to build a probabilistic model. METHODS: The model was designed to investigate the impact of choices between eight active protection measures on an orchard's economic performance (Net Present Value, NPV) and apple yield, compared to apple production without frost protection. We applied this model to two important German apple production regions, the Rhineland and the Lake Constance region. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The highest chance for increasing the NPV was determined for the use of stationary wind machines in the Lake Constance region (46 %), while overhead irrigation had the strongest effect on apple yield in both regions. Results indicate that frost protection measures do not necessarily increase farmers' revenues in the current economic situation. However, as these measures improve yield stability, supporting the investment in frost protection could help to maintain and stabilize regional apple production. SIGNIFICANCE: The results indicate the importance of effectively managing uncertainties inherent in horticul- tural decision-making processes. They help growers make informed choices on frost protection measures to ensure economically feasible apple production under changing climatic and economic conditions.					; Luedeling, Eike/I-3269-2019; Whitney, Cory/I-2379-2015	Schmitz, Christine/0000-0003-3162-0563; Schiffers, Katja/0000-0003-2559-6579; Zimmermann, Lars/0009-0001-0757-6673; Luedeling, Eike/0000-0002-7316-3631; Whitney, Cory/0000-0003-4988-4583													0308-521X	1873-2267				MAR	2025	224								104255	10.1016/j.agsy.2024.104255	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2024.104255		JAN 2025											WOS:001398634900001

Statistical analyses are conducted using soundings and reported automated surface observing system data from Salt Lake International Airport for the last eighteen cold seasons (October to March, during 1997-2015). A Chi-square test of independence is performed on identified cold air pool, and fog events to determine whether the two events are correlated. Conditional probabilities are then computed to investigate the occurrence of fog, given the presence of a cold pool. These probabilities are compared against that of random fog generation in the mid-winter. It is concluded that the dependence between cold air pools and fog events is statistically significant. The presence of a cold pool makes the formation of fog more likely than random generation.

On thermohaline structure and circulation of the Western Large Aral Sea from 2009 to 2011: Observations and modeling	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												The shrinkage of the Aral Sea in the second half of the past century has significantly affected the hydrophysical regime of the lake. The objective of this paper is to report on a hydrological structure and circulation of the today's Aral Sea based on both direct field observations and modeling results. We focus on the results of three field surveys to the Aral Sea which took place in the period from 2009 to 2011. In addition, series of numerical experiments using Princeton Ocean Model adapted to the Aral Sea was undertaken to investigate the contributions from bathymetry and water stratification in the formation of the basin scale circulation. The hydrological structure of the Aral's western basin in autumn season exhibited a three-layered pattern with two local salinity maxima, separated by a fresher intermediate layer. According to direct observations, water circulation in the surface layer has anti-cyclonic character, while circulation in the bottom layer has cyclonic sign under the predominant northerly winds. The simulation experiments demonstrated clearly that the main cause of the anti-cyclonic circulation in the surface layer of the lake is the "asymmetric" bathymetry with broad shallow area along the eastern coast and relatively steep and deep western slope. However, strong stratification is a necessary condition for the formation of the cyclonic circulation gyre in the bottom layer. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Mafic Plinian volcanism and ignimbrite emplacement at Tofua volcano, Tonga	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												Tofua Island is the largest emergent mafic volcano within the Tofua arc, Tonga, southwest Pacific. The volcano is dominated by a distinctive caldera averaging 4 km in diameter, containing a freshwater lake in the south and east. The latest paroxysmal (VEI 5-6) explosive volcanism includes two phases of activity, each emplacing a high-grade ignimbrite. The products are basaltic andesites with between 52 wt.% and 57 wt.% SiO2. The first and largest eruption caused the inward collapse of a stratovolcano and produced the 'Tofua' ignimbrite and a sub-circular caldera located slightly northwest of the island's centre. This ignimbrite was deposited in a radial fashion over the entire island, with associated Plinian fall deposits up to 0.5 m thick on islands > 40 km away. Common sub-rounded and frequently cauliform scoria bombs throughout the ignimbrite attest to a small degree of marginal magma-water interaction. The common intense welding of the coarse-grained eruptive products, however, suggests that the majority of the erupted magma was hot, water-undersaturated and supplied at high rates with moderately low fragmentation efficiency and low levels of interaction with external water. We propose that the development of a water-saturated dacite body at shallow (< 6 km) depth resulted in failure of the chamber roof to cause sudden evacuation of material, producing a Plinian eruption column. Following a brief period of quiescence, largescale faulting in the southeast of the island produced a second explosive phase believed to result from recharge of a chemically distinct magma depleted in incompatible elements. This similar, but smaller eruption, emplaced the 'Hokula' Ignimbrite sheet in the northeast of the island. A maximum total volume of 8 km(3) of juvenile material was erupted by these events. The main eruption column is estimated to have reached a height of similar to 12 km, and to have produced a major atmospheric injection of gas, and tephra recorded in the widespread series of fall deposits found on coral islands 40-80 km to the east (in the direction of regional upper-tropospheric winds). Radiocarbon dating of charcoal below the Tofua ignimbrite and organic material below the related fall units imply this eruption sequence occurred post 1,000 years BP. We estimate an eruption magnitude of 2.24x10(13) kg, sulphur release of 12 Tg and tentatively assign this eruption to the AD 1030 volcanic sulphate spike recorded in Antarctic ice sheet records.

The ages of the SOJ-2 core is well controlled' by carbon 14 dating with high resolution accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), and the results indicated a general warm to cold climate trend from the mid-Holocene to the present, which can be divided into two different stages: a warmer stage between 6842 and 1297 cal yr BP and a colder stage from 1297 cal yr BP to, the present, with fluctuations during these stages. The climate was wetter from 6842 to 6227 cal yr BP and 4520 to 1297 cal yr BP and was drier from 6227 to 4520 cal yr BP. The climate changed to cold and dry during the period from 1297-425 cal yr BP. The impact of human activity on the climate began at approximately 1297 cal yr BP and became pronounced starting in 425 cal yr BP. The general cooling trend may represent a response to decreasing solar insolation; however, the relative dryness or wetness of the climate may have been co-determined by westerlies and the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). The climate had a teleconnection with the North Atlantic region, resulting from changes in solar activity. Nevertheless, EI Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) activity played an important role in impacting the EASM changes in western Pacific coastal areas.					; LEE, Jin-Young/ITV-7438-2023; YI, Sangheon/D-4780-2011; Nakanishi, Toshimichi/HTP-3573-2023; Kim, Jin-Soo/AAF-3359-2019; Yi, Sangheon/D-4780-2011; Lim, Jaesoo/N-4219-2017; Song, Bing/AAA-9421-2020; Li, Zhen/G-7667-2012	Nakanishi, Toshimichi/0000-0002-9560-9737; Li, Zhen/0000-0003-3989-7233; Lee, Jin-Young/0000-0002-4150-3910; Mao, Limi/0000-0002-0191-3042; YI, Sangheon/0000-0002-2938-0380; Song, Bing/0000-0002-8493-6273; Lee, Jin-Young/0000-0002-6941-5509; Lim, Jaesoo/0000-0001-7478-0562; 													1367-9120	1878-5786				JAN	2018	151						240	249		10.1016/j.jseaes.2017.11.006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jseaes.2017.11.006													WOS:000418974400017

Pluvial lakes in the Great Basin of the western United States a view from the outcrop	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Paleo-lakes in the western United States provide geomorphic and hydrologic records of climate and drainage-basin change at multiple time scales extending back to the Miocene. Recent reviews and studies of paleo-lake records have focused on interpretations of proxies in lake sediment cores from the northern and central parts of the Great Basin. In this review, emphasis is placed on equally important studies of lake history during the past similar to 30 years that were derived from outcrop exposures and geomorphology, in some cases combined with cores. Outcrop and core records have different strengths and weaknesses that must be recognized and exploited in the interpretation of paleohydrology and paleoclimate. Outcrops and landforms can yield direct evidence of lake level, fades changes that record details of lake-level fluctuations, and geologic events such as catastrophic floods, drainage-basin changes, and isostatic rebound. Cores can potentially yield continuous records when sampled in stable parts of lake basins and can provide proxies for changes in lake level, water temperature and chemistry, and ecological conditions in the surrounding landscape. However, proxies such as stable isotopes may be influenced by several competing factors the relative effects of which may be difficult to assess, and interpretations may be confounded by geologic events within the drainage basin that were unrecorded or not recognized in a core. The best evidence for documenting absolute lake-level changes lies within the shore, nearshore, and deltaic sediments that were deposited across piedmonts and at the mouths of streams as lake level rose and fell. We review the different shorezone environments and resulting deposits used in such reconstructions and discuss potential estimation errors. Lake-level studies based on deposits and landforms have provided paleohydrologic records ranging from general changes during the past million years to centennial-scale details of fluctuations during the late Pleistocene and Holocene. Outcrop studies have documented the integration histories of several important drainage basins, including the Humboldt, Amargosa, Owens, and Mojave river systems, that have evolved since the Miocene within the active tectonic setting of the Great Basin; these histories have influenced lake levels in terminal basins. Many pre-late Pleistocene lakes in the western Great Basin were significantly larger and record wetter conditions than the youngest lakes. Outcrop-based lake-level data provide important checks on core-based proxy interpretations; we discuss four such comparisons. In some cases, such as for Lakes Owens and Manix, outcrop and core data synthesis yields stronger and more complete records; in other cases, such as for Bonneville and Lahontan, conflicts point toward reconsideration of confounding factors in interpretation of core-based proxies.

A high-resolution seismic survey was carried out to analyse the seismic stratigraphy of the lake and to shed some light on the post-Last Glacial Maximum history of the area. Six seismic units were recognised, and their nature and depositional context were interpreted using seismic stratigraphy and acoustic facies analysis. A buried large ridge was identified within the glacial unit (SU1), interpreted as a frontal moraine that indicates a stabilisation phase. After retreat of the glacier from the basin, the trough was flooded by meltwater and a lake developed (SU2). The seismic facies, from bottom to top, depict a transition from ice-contact (SU2; SU3) to ice-distal proglacial conditions (SU4). A thick draping unit (SU5) marks a marine transgressive event and the instauration of a fjord environment in the basin. The marine transgression was a rapid event preceded by a fall in the lake level that caused an erosional unconformity. During the fjord phase the sedimentation remained controlled by meltwater discharge. Sea level fall, and subsequent disconnection from the Beagle Channel was accompanied by a progradation of the glaciofluvial deltaic sediments and the occurrence of several mass-wasting deposits (SU6).

Due to the pre-ceding heavy rainfall and flooding within the Mississippi River watershed, for the first time in history, the Bonnet Carre' Spillway (BCS) opened twice in one year during 2019. The coastal cyanoHAB coincided with the second BCS opening. The main objectives of this study were: (1) to investigate the potential for using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) ocean color standard Cyanobacteria Index (CIcyano) algorithm to characterize the spatial and temporal extent of the 2019 cyanoHAB; (2) to couple the CIcyano data with river discharge, salinity, and modeled-wind data to study the conditions leading to the cyanoHAB and factors aiding the advection and persistence of the bloom within the Mississippi Sound, including a possible relationship to the BCS; (3) to further investigate the relationship with the BCS by repeating the methods using data from 2018, which was a year when the BCS was opened but no evidence of cyanoHABs was reported along the Mississippi coast. Weekly means and monthly frequency CIcyano images, river discharge, salinity, and modeled-wind data from February to September of 2018 and 2019 were analyzed, which coincide with three BCS openings. In March 2018, a cyanobacteria bloom was observed within Lake Pontchartrain coinciding with the BCS opening; how-ever, the month-long bloom was contained to the lake. Two distinct cyanoHABs were observed in 2019 and both blooms were advected into the Mississippi Sound, and likely contributed to the 3-month-long beach water ad-visories of 2019 along the Mississippi coastline. From March to mid-July 2019, salinity at stations within the Mississippi Sound was consistently near zero indicating high levels of freshwater. During that time, winds were predominantly northwestward, preventing the BCS waters from flushing into the Mississippi Shelf and resulting in BCS waters remaining longer within the estuarine lakes and Mississippi Sound. Although the BCS had an undeniable impact on the presence of the coastal cyanoHAB of 2019, other variables including wind direction, water flow, mixing, and persistence of freshwater within the Sound can determine the intensity and extent of the cyanoHABs. Coupling in situ phytoplankton information from freshwater water bodies to the marine continuum along with water flow, wind data, and satellite imagery could help identify cyanoHABs at early stages and forecast their trajectory and potential impacts on coastal areas.					; Cetinic, Ivona/GSI-5613-2022	Cambazoglu, Kemal/0000-0002-2356-9481; Soto Ramos, Inia/0000-0001-7974-857X; Cetinic, Ivona/0000-0002-1363-3136; 													1568-9883	1878-1470				AUG	2023	127								102472	10.1016/j.hal.2023.102472	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2023.102472		JUN 2023						37544672					WOS:001026316000001
J	Kite, ES; Noblet, A				Kite, Edwin S.; Noblet, Axel			High and Dry: Billion-Year Trends in the Aridity of River-Forming Climates on Mars	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Mars' wet-to-dry transition is a major environmental catastrophe, yet the spatial pattern, tempo, and cause of drying are poorly constrained. We built a globally distributed database of constraints on Mars late-stage paleolake size relative to catchment area (aridity index (AI)), and found evidence for climate zonation as Mars was drying out. Aridity increased over time in southern midlatitude highlands, where lakes became proportionally as small as in modern Nevada. Meanwhile, intermittently wetter climates persisted in equatorial and northern-midlatitude lowlands. This is consistent with a change in Mars' greenhouse effect that left highlands too cold for liquid water except during a brief melt season, or alternatively with a fall in Mars' groundwater table. The data are consistent with a switch of unknown cause in the dependence of AI on elevation, from high-and-wet early on, to high-and-dry later. These results sharpen our view of Mars' climate as surface conditions became increasingly stressing for life.																			0094-8276	1944-8007				DEC 28	2022	49	24							e2022GL101150	10.1029/2022GL101150	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022GL101150													WOS:000924527300001

For the mesocosm experiment, we used a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design in which two levels of nutrient loading were cross-classified with two levels of omnivorous fish and two levels of clay. We found a significant nutrient-fish interaction effect for chlorophyll biomass with the effects of fish being greater in the presence of nutrient loading. Clay did not affect the nutrient-fish interaction effect for chlorophyll. In the pond experiment, we used a 2 x 2 factorial design in which two levels of nutrient loading were cross-classified with two levels of omnivorous fish. We did not detect a significant nutrient-fish interaction effect for chlorophyll except at the end of the second summer of the experiment when the biomass of omnivorous fish was high and the cumulative effects of nutrient loading were greatest. Chlorophyll was suppressed by dense populations of Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum), which developed in some ponds during the experiment. The role of the nutrient-fish synergism in regulating phytoplankton biomass may be reduced in lakes with Eurasian watermilfoil.																			0706-652X					SEP	1998	55	9					2087	2096		10.1139/cjfas-55-9-2087	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-55-9-2087													WOS:000077001400010

Diagnosis and character of hydromorphic salinization of the "Varnicy" landscape (Rostov Veliky, Yaroslavskaya oblast'): experience and methodology of geo-electric methods application	VESTNIK OF SAINT PETERSBURG UNIVERSITY EARTH SCIENCES												The main objective of this study is to find out the application of electrical resistivity measured in water saturated soil (ER) as a proxy to soil salinity assessment within a humid climate landscape located in the center of the Russian plain. The issue is not the only salinization, but some other processes controlling the soil formation can influence the ER significantly. These processes attributed to the phreatic water salinization are waterlogging, soil organic carbon accumulation, carbonate and gypsum sedimentation. For evaluation of landscape salinity of the nature reserve "Solyanoj istochnik Varnicy", where saline spring discharging, soil and water samples were collecting five times during an annual monitoring study (2016-2017). The samples from the two soil pits and water samples from the spring, groundwater and surface water draining the local catchment were analyzed in terms of the relationship between the ER values and major ions concentrations. Correlation analysis revealed a close relationship between the values of ER and TDS, calcium and sulfate content in the soil water extract. At the same time, parametric statistical analysis found that seasonal fluctuations of ER were due to short-term fluctuations in sodium and chloride concentrations. The ER values measured in the drainage and groundwater of the study site were more sensitive as compared with the soil to changes in the salinity level during the annual hydrological cycle. A high correlation coefficient was observed between the ER and both the total salt content and the major ions concentrations in water samples. Geospatial salinity variation and salinization area were detected by horizontal electric profiling (HEP) within the site previously covered with detailed geodetic surveys. With an example of the hydromorphic Varni.ky section in the humid climate it was shown that high soil salinity plays a main role in the resistivity value formation compared with other factors. The electrophysical parameters can be reliable indicators in monitoring studies of landscape salinity.

Dust storms in Central Asia: Spatial and temporal variations	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Dust/sand storms are common events in the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. The region is characterized by strong winds, scarcity of vegetation cover, continental climate with long and dry summers, frequent soil and atmospheric droughts. Central Asian drylands, covered by a great variety of desert types, represent a powerful source of mineral and salt aerosols. The main objectives of this study are to monitor and assess the spatial and temporal distribution of dust storms over the Central Asian region during the last seven decades. The identified active source areas of dust storms are located mainly in the sandy deserts and other types of deserts where the sensitive ecosystems suffered from human impact. The main persistent sources of dust storms are located in the large "dust belt" that extends from west to east over the southern deserts, north of Caspian Sea deserts, south of Balkhash Lake, and Aral Sea region. The results of the analysis show a significant decrease in dust/sand storm frequency during the last decades and considerable changes in the active source areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We focus on four basins, including Atlantis, Simois, Caralis, and an unnamed basin. They are hypothesized to have hosted isolated lakes after the drainage of the Eridania Lake. We produced a geologic map and derived model absolute ages of our main mapped units. The map and model ages enable us to interpret the geologic history of the region. The basin floors are covered by light-toned materials containing Fe/Mg-phyllosilicates. Across most of the region, the Electris unit covers the highlands and is eroded into mesas. The deposition of this unit corresponds to air fall and/or fluvial mechanisms that transported the material into the basins and accumulated it on the plateaus and basin floors and rims. The deposits on the basin floors were later degraded into light-toned knobs that are rich in Fe/Mg-phyllosilicates. On the rim of the Simois and the unnamed basins, a sequence of Al-phyllosilicates on top of Fe/Mg-phyllosilicates has been observed. These Al-phyllosilicate-rich materials may have been formed by pedogenic leaching. The presence of chloride in the area suggests that a playa environment prevailed during the last stage of water presence or after desiccation of the lakes. In the Early Amazonian, the last aqueous activity cemented the postlacustrine air fall deposits in the basins and shows that liquid water was present in Terra Sirenum long after the Noachian.					; Le Deit, Laetitia/M-7883-2018; Hauber, Ernst/U-2521-2018; Jaumann, Ralf/N-1001-2018; Adeli, Solmaz/HTQ-0235-2023	Adeli, Solmaz/0000-0001-9972-409X; Hauber, Ernst/0000-0002-1375-304X; 													2169-9097	2169-9100				NOV	2015	120	11					1774	1799		10.1002/2015JE004898	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015JE004898													WOS:000368435500003

The utility of MFO induction in white suckers as an indicator of chemical contamination was examined in three "areas of concern," Jackfish Bay, St. Marys River, and the Kaministiquia River. MFO determinations in spawning suckers suggested no induction, although white suckers captured in the summer from Jackfish Bay had MFO levels up to 6 (2,5-diphenyloxazole metabolism) and 7 (Benzo-a-pyrene hydroxylase) fold higher than did reference suckers. Similar induction was found in suckers collected in the summer from the Kaministiquia River and from the St. Marys River, hepatic MFO activities 3 (PPO) and 5 (BaP) times those of the reference populations suggesting exposure to chemicals with MFO inducing potential. The relative induction of hepatic MFO at all three polluted locations is a sensitive measure of industrially discharged xenobiotics, which might be useful in monitoring the efficiency of remedial action plans.																			0380-1330						1991	17	3					382	393		10.1016/S0380-1330(91)71374-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(91)71374-9													WOS:A1991GK77500010

Percent similarities between the two communities averaged only 37 over the course of the study. Overall, natural substrates exhibited greater species richness than artificial samplers, particularly during the summer, although this difference was slight. Patterns of selection and inhibition by artificial substrates of individual diatom species varied by both season and lake. Members of the genus Cymbella, particularly C. microcephala, appeared to be the most consistently inhibited, while Achnanthes minutissima was often selected for. In spite of the great differences between the two substrate types, replicability of artificial substrates was very high, and could prove to be a more important quality in monitoring applications than accurate representation of the natural community.																			0018-8158					NOV	2000	438	1-3					157	170		10.1023/A:1004182231973	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1004182231973													WOS:000166048100013

J	Cooley, SW; Pavelsky, TM				Cooley, Sarah W.; Pavelsky, Tamlin M.			Spatial and temporal patterns in Arctic river ice breakup revealed by automated ice detection from MODIS imagery	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The annual spring breakup of river ice has important consequences for northern ecosystems and significant economic implications for Arctic industry and transportation. River ice breakup research is restricted by the sparse distribution of hydrological stations in the Arctic, where limited available data suggests a trend towards earlier ice breakup. The specific climatic mechanisms driving this trend, however, are complex and can vary both regionally and within river systems. Consequently, understanding the response of river ice processes to a warming Arctic requires simultaneous examination of spatial and temporal patterns in breakup timing. In this paper, we describe an automated algorithm for river ice breakup detection using MODIS satellite imagery that enables identification of spatial and temporal breakup patterns at large scales. We examine breakup timing on the Mackenzie, Lena, Ob' and Yenisey rivers for the period 2000-2014. By dividing the rivers into 10 km segments and classifying each river pixel in each segment as snow/ice, mixed ice/water or open water based on MODIS reflectance, we determine breakup dates with a mean uncertainty of +/- 13 days. All statistically significant temporal trends are negative, indicating an overall shift towards earlier breakup. Considerable variability in the statistical significance and magnitude of trends along each river suggests that different climatic and physiographic drivers are impacting spatial patterns in breakup. Trends detected on the lower Mackenzie corroborate recent studies indicating weakening ice resistance and earlier brealcup timing near the Mackenzie Delta. In Siberia, the increased magnitude of trends upstream and strong correlation between breakup initiation and whole-river breakup patterns suggest that earlier onset of upstream discharge may play the dominant role in determining breakup timing. Exploratory analysis demonstrates that MODIS imagery may also be used to differentiate thermal and mechanical breakup events. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

To help reduce that knowledge gap, this study addressed these processes in Valle de Bravo (VB), a tropical (19(degrees) 11. 65' N) reservoir lake, that provides water supply to Mexico City metropolitan area. CH4 and CO2 concentrations and emissions from VB were measured during four field campaigns distributed along the annual limnological cycle of the reservoir. Dissolved CH4 concentration varied over four orders of magnitude (0.015-176.808 mu mol L-1), and dissolved CO2 varied from below atmospheric saturation (15.062 mu mol L-1) to 10 times that concentration (219.505 mu mol L-1). CH4 fluxes ranged from 23.25 to 1220.80 mu mol m(-2) day(-1), while CO2 fluxes ranged from -60.11 to 254.99 mmol m(-2) day(-1). Seasonal monitoring also allowed the assessment of the annual emissions as well as the greenhouse gas (GHG) storage during thermal stratification, which accounted for >58% of the total GHG annual emissions from VB. Overall, VB is a source of GHG, and its major contribution is the CH4 released during the autumn overturn.					; Valdespino, Patricia/M-2413-2018; Thalasso, Frederic/E-1403-2011; Valdespino-Castillo, Patricia/M-2413-2018; Sanchez-Carrillo, Salvador/L-1098-2014; Merino-Ibarra, Martin/KPY-5742-2024; Merino-Ibarra, Martín/KPY-5742-2024	SANCHEZ-CARRILLO, SALVADOR/0000-0002-5471-977X; Gerardo-Nieto, Oscar/0000-0003-3299-9456; Valdespino-Castillo, Patricia/0000-0002-2998-4627; Lestayo-Gonzalez, Julio A./0000-0002-7462-3118; Ramirez-Zierold, Jorge Alberto/0000-0001-8094-1852; Merino-Ibarra, Martin/0000-0002-6690-3101; 													2040-2244	2408-9354				MAY	2024	15	5					2364	2378		10.2166/wcc.2024.723	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wcc.2024.723		FEB 2024											WOS:001168117500001

Detection of tundra trail damage near Barrow, Alaska using remote imagery	GEOMORPHOLOGY					4th European Conference on Permafrost (EUCOP) / International-Permafrost-Association Regional Conference	JUN 18-21, 2014	Evora, PORTUGAL	Int Permafrost Assoc				In the past several decades, the use of all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) has proliferated in many Arctic communities in North America. One example is the village of Barrow, Alaska. This coastal community has only local roads, so all access to the interior utilizes off-road machines. These 4-wheel vehicles are the primary means of tundra traverse and transport in summer by hunters and berry-pickers, and by village residents accessing summer camps. Traveling cross-country is difficult due to the large number of thermokarst lakes, wetlands, and streams, and tundra trails tend to follow dryer higher ground while avoiding areas of high microrelief such as high-centered ice wedge polygons. Thus, modem ATV trails tend to follow the margins of drained or partially drained thermokarst lake basins where it is flat and relatively dry, and these trails are heavily used. The deeply-ribbed tires of the heavy and powerful ATVs cause damage by destroying the vegetation and disturbing the underlying organic soil. Exposure of the dark soil enhances summer thaw and leads to local thermokarst of the ice-rich upper permafrost. The damage increases over time as vehicles continue to follow the same track, and sections eventually become unusable; this is especially true where the trail crosses ice-wedge troughs. Deep subsidence in the ponded troughs results in ATV users veering to avoid the wettest area, which leads to a widening of the damaged area. Helicopter surveys, site visits, and collection of ground penetrating radar data were combined with time series analysis of high-resolution aerial and satellite imagery for the period 1955-2014. The analysis reveals that there are 507 km of off-road trails on the Barrow Peninsula. About 50% of the total trail length was developed before 1955 in association with resource extraction, and an additional 40% were formed between 1979 and 2005 by ATVs. Segments of the more modem trail are up to 100 m wide. Damage to the tundra is especially pronounced in wet areas, such as ice-wedge troughs. Knowledgeable indigenous people are aware of the problem. Some remediation has been attempted by using heavy-duty PVC matting in areas of greatest damage, but this approach is prohibitively expensive on a large scale. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It plays critical ecological roles, such as regulating heat balance and influencing the state of biocenoses. Due to progressive climate warming, we have observed significant changes in ice cover duration, thickness, and timing in recent decades. Ice phenomena on rivers are temporary. They strongly depend on air temperature, which has recently been increasing worldwide. This paper analyzes the variability of ice phenomena formation in selected river profiles of the central Vistula River catchment, central Poland. The research period covers the years 1968-2016. The data come from the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management-State Research Institute (IMGW-PIB). The duration (including the dates of occurrence and disappearance of the phenomenon) and the frequency of occurrence of ice phenomena over the long-term were determined with particular attention to ice cover. The long-term occurrence of ice phenomena shows a decreasing trend (shorter duration, later onset dates) with a simultaneous increase in the average air temperature during the winter half of the hydrological year.

Specifically, we examine how feelings toward one's community and feelings toward Salt Lake City's hosting of the 2002 Winter Olympics predict support for a future Olympic bid. In order to investigate our research question, we use data collected in Heber Valley in 2012 and 2018. We find that community attachment, community satisfaction, and the community's perceived desirability significantly predict support for a future Olympic bid. Compared to the baseline year of 2012, 2018 was significantly different, indicating that support for a future bid has decreased as time has passed since the 2002 Olympic Games. Length of residence, employment status, and use of the Soldier Hollow facilities were also significant predictors of support for a future Olympic bid. There were slight variations among the independent variables when separating the observations by community within Heber Valley (i.e., among residents of the city of Heber, Midway, or other towns).																			0036-0112	1549-0831				JUN	2025	90	2					263	281		10.1111/ruso.70002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ruso.70002													WOS:001510695800001
J	Hunt, RJ; Matveev, V; Jones, GJ; Warburton, K				Hunt, RJ; Matveev, V; Jones, GJ; Warburton, K			Structuring of the cyanobacterial community by pelagic fish in subtropical reservoirs: experimental evidence from Australia	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Subtropical reservoirs of Australia are commonly subject to summer blooms of cyanobacteria. The potential for food web manipulation to control cyanobacterial blooms was investigated in Lake Maroon, south east Queensland using enclosures in which the density of the Australian gudgeon Hypseleotris spp. was manipulated. 2. Zooplankton biomass and community structure were strongly affected by fish density. A size dependent predation effect of Hypseleotris on zooplankton was observed at ambient fish densities, and the community shifted towards a dominance of copepod juveniles and nauplii. Substantial increases in the populations of Ceriodaphnia and calanoid copepods were observed at low fish densities and in the absence of fish. 3. At ambient fish densities total phytoplankton and the proportion of cyanobacteria were maintained at levels similar to those prevailing at day 0. Total phytoplankton and the proportion of cyanobacteria decreased substantially at low fish densities and in the absence of fish. Chlorophytes became dominant in the 'no fish' treatment and the grazing-resistant species Oocystis and Dictyosphaerium were significantly higher than at ambient fish densities. 4. The experiment demonstrated a strong positive relationship between Hypseleotris density and cyanobacteria, and the results suggest that subtropical reservoirs may be suited to food web manipulation as a means of controlling summer cyanobacterial blooms.

ROLE OF NITROGEN FIXATION IN SANCTUARY LAKE, PENNSYLVANIA	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A study of the rates of nitrogen fixation using N15 as a tracer was made in Sanctuary Lake, Pennsylvania. The rates of fixation in the lake were found to be considerable during the summer and appeared to be correlated with the presence of a dense population of Anabaena. Laboratory experiments supported the idea that photo-synthetic organisms were responsible since a strong correlation with light was found.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1962	7	2					170	177		10.4319/lo.1962.7.2.0170	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1962.7.2.0170													WOS:A1962WU65000010

Plants in this region are exposed to a prolonged dry season, and we investigated if (1) these plants show spatial variability and temporal shifts in their water source use; (2) seasonal differences in the isotopic composition of precipitation are reflected in xylem water; and (3) plant family, growth form, leaf phenology, habitat and season influence the xylem-to-leaf water deuterium enrichment. In this study, the delta H-2 and delta O-18 of precipitation, lake water, groundwater, plant xylem water and plant leaf water were measured across different plant species, seasons and plant habitats in the vicinity of Lake Chala. We found that plants rely mostly on water from the "short" rains falling from October to December (northeastern monsoon), as these recharge the soil after the long dry season. This plant-available, static water pool is only slightly replenished by the "long" rains falling from February to May (southeastern monsoon), in agreement with the "two water worlds" hypothesis, according to which plants rely on a static water pool while a mobile water pool recharges the groundwater. Spatial variability in water resource use exists in the study region, with plants at the lakeshore relying on a water source admixed with lake water. Leaf phenology does not affect water resource use. According to our results, plant species and their associated leaf phenology are the primary factors influencing the enrichment in deuterium from xylem water to leaf water (epsilon(1/x)), with deciduous species giving the highest enrichment, while growth form and season have negligible effects. Our observations have important implications for the interpretation of delta(2)H( )of plant leaf wax n-alkanes (delta H-2(wax)) from paleohydrological records in tropical East Africa, given that the temporal variability in the isotopic composition of precipitation is not reflected in xylem water and that leaf water deuterium enrichment is a key factor in shaping delta H-2(wax center dot) The large interspecies variability in xylem-leaf enrichment (24 +/- 28 parts per thousand) is potentially troublesome, taking into account the likelihood of changes in species assemblage with climate shifts.

Tipping point-induced abrupt shifts in East Asian hydroclimate since the Last Glacial Maximum	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Multiple tipping points in the Earth system could be triggered when global warming exceeds specific thresholds. However, the degree of their impact on the East Asian hydroclimate remains uncertain due to the lack of quantitative rainfall records. Here we present an ensemble reconstruction of East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) rainfall since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) using nine statistical and machine learning methods based on multi-proxy records from a maar lake in southern China. Our results define five tipping points in the EASM rainfall since the LGM, which are characterized by abrupt and irreversible regime shifts with a median amplitude of 387 +/- 73 mm (24 +/- 5 %). Combined with multi-model simulations and existing records, we attribute these tipping points to cascades of abrupt shifts in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and Saharan vegetation. Our findings underscore the nonlinear behavior of the EASM and its coupling with other tipping elements.

A comparative study in the Broads and the Meres of England	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												Relationships between phytoplankton growth and supplies of phosphorus and nitrogen have been variously investigated in three lakes in two contrasted English lake areas using physiological nutrient indices (alkaline phosphatase activity, phosphorus debt, surplus phosphorus, phosphorus uptake kinetics, dark ammonium uptake, ammonium uptake kinetics, stimulation of C-14 uptake, and batch bioassay) and by inspection of water chemistry. None of the lakes was significantly affected by wastewater effluent but all lay in agricultural catchments. Physiological indices and water chemistry suggested limitation of phytoplankton biomass mostly by phosphorus, and to some extent by nitrogen in summer in North Ormesby Broad, by nitrogen in summer and to some extent by phosphorus in Lily Broad and by nitrogen in White Mere. Indices did not always accord with one another, though were not severely misleading. They added little to conclusions that could be drawn from water chemistry alone. Reasons for the differential relative importance of nitrogen and phosphorus in the two lake areas are discussed. The paradigm of phosphorus limitation, though unchallenged in upland waters and those on poorly weathered rocks, may be less relevant in lowland lakes.

J	OLSSON, M				OLSSON, M			SEASONAL-VARIATION OF PCB LEVELS IN FISH - IMPORTANT FACTOR IN PLANNING AQUATIC MONITORING PROGRAMS	AMBIO												Roach [Leuciscus rutilus] were collected from Lake Roxen [Sweden] up to 12 times a year during the past 7 yr, and PCB [polychlorinated biphenyl] levels in muscle tissue were monitored. These levels showed a rapid 3-fold increase during spring, while the rest of the year they were normally quite constant. It is clear that the PCB levels in roach can increase and decrease again within a 2 mo. period. It is likely that the increase of the PCB levels in roach depend mainly on increased water flow, which causes an erosion of PCB-loaded sediment in the feeder streams. Organochlorine levels in fish may show considerable short-term variation, a factor which must be included in the construction of any accurate monitoring program.																			0044-7447	1654-7209					1978	7	2					66	69																WOS:A1978EW29600006

CLIMATIC CHANGE												Millions of people in the geopolitically important region of Central Asia depend on water from snow- and glacier-melt driven international rivers, most of all the Syr Darya and Amu Darya. The riparian countries of these rivers have experienced recurring water allocation conflicts ever since the Soviet Union collapsed. Will climate change exacerbate water stress and thus conflicts? We have developed a coupled climate, land-ice and rainfall-runoff model for the Syr Darya to quantify impacts and show that climatic changes are likely to have consequences on runoff seasonality due to earlier snow-melt. This will increase water stress in unregulated catchments because less water will be available for irrigation in the summer months. Threats from geohazards, above all glacier lake outbursts, are likely to increase as well. The area at highest risk is the densely populated, agriculturally productive, and politically unstable Fergana Valley. Targeted infrastructural developments will be required in the region. If the current mismanagement of water and energy resources can be replaced with more effective resource allocation mechanisms through the strengthening of transboundary institutions, Central Asia will be able to successfully address these future climate-related challenges.

There is some evidence that B. longimanus has a negative effect on summer zooplankton species richness; however, no study has examined the effect of B. longimanus throughout the ice-free season in more than one lake. We visited 10 invaded and 4 reference lakes every 2 weeks from May to September, collecting B. longimanus, crustacean zooplankton, and water chemistry samples. Composite samples were pooled across the study season for each lake. Bythotrephes longimanus significantly reduced cladoceran species richness, diversity, and abundance, and the total zooplankton community also exhibited decreased richness, diversity, and abundance. Seasonal sampling was better than synoptic surveys at detecting changes in abundance, but richness estimates were similar. As B. longimanus continues to spread across lake landscapes, we expect it will have profound impacts on local and regional richness and species distribution patterns.

Jake; Vadeboncoeur, Yvonne			Littoral-benthic primary production estimates: Sensitivity to simplifications with respect to periphyton productivity and basin morphometry	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												Periphyton is a critical energy source for consumers in lakes of all sizes, but estimates of average, area-specific littoral zone benthic primary production (LBP) have been hampered by low spatial and temporal resolution of productivity data. We analyzed the sensitivity of estimates of LBP to depth-specific variation in photosynthesis-irradiance (PE) parameters and temporal variation in water clarity using monitoring data from five northern temperate lakes. Maximum photosynthesis rates peaked in the upper epilimnion in all five lakes, and our best daily estimates of LBP ranged from 125 mg C m(-2) d(-1) to 425 mg C m(-2) d(-1). Nonlinear variation in maximum photosynthesis (P-MAX) with depth caused overestimates in LBP by an average of 10% when mean values of P-MAX were applied throughout the euphotic zone. Conversely, applying values of light levels at onset of saturation (E-k) from the upper epilimnion resulted in underestimating LBP by an average of 19% compared with the most data-rich (optimal) calculations. Simplified approximations of bathymetry yielded underestimates or overestimates of LBP, depending on basin shape. Incorporating temporal variation in water clarity and daily solar irradiance did not substantially improve estimates of average summer LBP compared with estimates that incorporated summer average values of K-d, but this result should not be extrapolated to lakes with more variable water clarity. Estimates of average littoral zone benthic primary production can be optimized by incorporating depth-specific variation in maximum periphyton productivity, saturation light intensity, and sediment surface area into calculations.

The expansive and economically important North American Great Lakes are subjected to multiple stressors and understanding their responses to those stresses is important for understanding system-wide ecological controls. Here we show gradual increases in spring silica concentration (an indicator of decreasing growth of the dominant diatoms) in all basins of Lakes Michigan and Huron (USA and Canadian waters) between 1983 and 2008. These changes indicate the lakes have undergone gradual oligotrophication coincident with and anticipated by nutrient management implementation. Slow declines in seasonal drawdown of silica (proxy for seasonal phytoplankton production) also occurred, until recent years, when lake-wide responses were punctuated by abrupt decreases, putting them in the range of oligotrophic Lake Superior. The timing of these dramatic production drops is coincident with expansion of populations of invasive dreissenid mussels, particularly quagga mussels, in each basin. The combined effect of nutrient mitigation and invasive species expansion demonstrates the challenges facing large-scale ecosystems and suggest the need for new management regimes for large ecosystems.

USE OF BARN OWL (TYTO ALBA) PELLETS AS A POTENTIAL METHOD TO STUDY A RARE RODENT POPULATION IN NORTHEASTERN NEW MEXICO	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												In June 2008, I discovered a single jumping mouse (Zapus) cranium in a Barn Owl (Tyto alba) pellet from below an active nest along Cerrososo Creek, Colfax County, northeastern New Mexico. Although the cranium could not be identified to species, this specimen could potentially represent a previously unknown population of the endangered New Mexico meadow jumping mouse (Z. hudsonius luteus). In 2009 and 2010, I collected pellets at 8 Barn Owl nesting or roosting sites along streams in my study area with the following objectives: (1) determine whether Barn Owl pellets could be used to gain information about the abundance and distribution of this Zapus population, (2) use pellets to acquire additional Zapus specimens to aid in positive identification of the jumping mouse species present, and (3) potentially document a previously unknown population of the endangered New Mexico meadow jumping mouse. Focusing only on pellets produced during the Zapus active (nonhibernation) summer period, I dissected 298 pellets containing 487 individual mammalian prey items from 12 genera but did not locate any additional Zapus remains. Examination of owl pellets appears to be a poor survey tool for Zapus, perhaps due to the jumping mouse's short summer active period, natural low population density and preference for tall, dense riparian vegetation.																			1527-0904	1944-8341				MAR	2016	76	1					128	134		10.3398/064.076.0114	http://dx.doi.org/10.3398/064.076.0114													WOS:000380879000013

An extended Arctic proxy temperature database for the past 2,000 years	SCIENTIFIC DATA												Robust climate reconstructions of the most recent centuries and millennia are invaluable for placing modern warming in the context of natural variability. Here we present an extended and revised database (version 1.1) of proxy temperature records recently used to reconstruct Arctic temperatures for the past 2,000 years. The datasets are presented in a machine-readable format, and have been extended with the geochronologic data and consistently generated time-uncertain ensembles, which will be useful in future analyses of the influence of geochronologic uncertainty. A standardized description of the seasonality of the temperature response for each record, as reported by the original authors, is also included to motivate a more nuanced approach to integrating records with variable seasonal sensitivities. Despite the predominance of seasonal, rather than annual, temperature responders in the database, comparisons with the instrumental record of temperature suggest that, as a whole, the datasets best record annual temperature variability across the Arctic, especially in northeast Canada and Greenland, where the density of records is highest.					; McKay, Nicholas/JYQ-5440-2024; Kaufman, Darrell/A-2471-2008	McKay, Nicholas/0000-0003-3598-5113; 														2052-4463					2014	1								140026	10.1038/sdata.2014.26	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2014.26								25977783					WOS:000209843500019

Unicellular cyanobacteria generally dominated the picoplankton community, although unidentified picoplankton that fluoresced red under blue excitation were also abundant (maximum numbers 4 x 10(5) cells ml-1) and contributed up to approximately 40% of the total autotrophic picoplankton on occasions. Carbon and nitrogen biomasses of autotrophic picoplankton estimated by conversion from biovolumes were 14-84 mug C l-1 and 3.6-21 mug N l-1. These were comparable to or exceeded the biomass of heterotrophic bacteria. Autotropic picoplankton and bacteria accounted for as much as 33% of particulate organic carbon and 81% of nitrogen in the euphotic zone. Measurements of the photosynthetic uptake of [C-14]bicarbonate and the growth of picoplankton in diluted or size-fractionated waters revealed that 80% of total primary production was due to picoplankton, and that much of this production was consumed by grazers in the <20 mum cell-size category. These results suggest that picoplankton-protozoan trophic coupling is important in the pelagic food web and biogeochemical cycling of Lake Baikal during summer.

The MDC was shown to be significantly related to light through measurements taken by SD (R-2 = 0.46; p < 0.05) and a light meter (R-2 = 0.41; p < 0.05). While both light measurements can be used to estimate MDC, SD accounted for more variance in MDC than light attenuation coefficients. Plant type, sediment type and slope did not account for more variance in MDC than light measurements for these Florida lakes. Additional unpublished data from 187 Florida Lakes (Florida LAKEWATCH, 279 lake-years of data) also showed a significant positive relationship between SD and MDC (R 2 = 0.68; p < 0.05). The best fit MDC-SD regression line in meters was: log (MDC) = 0.66 log (SD) + 0.31. A maximum MDC line relating MDC to SD in meters was also calculated and was found to be equal to: log (max MDC) = 0.53 log (SD) + 0.59. The maximum MDC line describes light limitation when the MDC response falls on or near the response curve, and when MDC values fall below the line, some other factor likely limits colonization of macrophytes.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				SEP	2007	23	3					287	297		10.1080/07438140709354017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140709354017													WOS:000258162100008
J	Matveev, V; Matveeva, L				Matveev, V; Matveeva, L			Grazer control and nutrient limitation of phytoplankton biomass in two Australian reservoirs	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Grazer and nutrient controls of phytoplankton biomass were tested on two reservoirs of different productivity to assess the potential for zooplankton grazing to affect chlorophyll/phosphorus regression models under Australian conditions. Experiments with zooplankton and nutrients manipulated in enclosures, laboratory feeding trials, and the analysis oi in-lake plankton time series were performed. 2. Enclosures with water from the more productive Lake Hume (chlorophyll a = 3-17.5 mu g I-1), revealed significant zooplankton effects on chlorophyll a in 3/6, phosphorus limitation in 4/6 and nitrogen limitation in 1/6 of experiments conducted throughout the year. Enclosures with water from the less productive Lake Dartmouth (chlorophyll a = 0.8-3.5 mu g 1(-1)), revealed significant zooplankton effects in 5/6, phosphorus limitation in 5/6 and nitrogen limitation in 2/6 of experiments. 3. While Lake Hume enclosure manipulations of the biomass of cladocerans (Daphnia and Diaphanosoma) and large copepods (Boeckella) had negative effects, small copepods (Mesocyclops and Calamoecia) could have positive effects on chlorophyll a. 4. In Lake Hume, total phytoplankton biovolume was negatively correlated with cladoceran biomass, positively with copepod biomass and was uncorrelated with total crustacean biomass. In Lake Dartmouth, total phytoplankton biovolume was negatively correlated with cladoceran biomass, copepod biomass and total crustacean biomass. 5. In both reservoirs, temporal variation in the biomass of Daphnia carinata alone could explain more than 50% of the observed variance in total phytoplankton biovolume. 6. During a period of low phytoplankton biovolume in Lake Hume in spring-summer 1993-94, a conservative estimate of cladoceran community grazing reached a maximum of 0.80 day-1, suggesting that Cladocera made an important contribution to the development of the observed clear-water phase. 7. Enclosure experiments predicted significant grazing when the Cladocera/ Phytoplankton biomass ratio was greater than 0.1; this threshold was consistently exceeded during clear water phase in Lake Hume. 8. Crustacean length had a significant effect on individual grazing rates in bottle experiments, with large Daphnia having highest rates. In both reservoirs, mean crustacean length was negatively correlated with phytoplankton biovolume. The observed upper limit of its variation was nearly twice as high compared to other world lakes.

Pollen and charcoal data suggest that the Late Glacial landscape was dominated by a relatively fire-prone Larix forest-tundra during the Greenland Interstadial complex (GI 1) and a subarctic steppe during the Younger Dryas (GS1). The onset of the Holocene is marked by the reappearance of trees (mainly Alnus incana) within a fern and shrub dominated landscape. The Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) features shifting vegetational communities dominated by Alnus shrubs, diverse forb species, and locally abundant aquatic plants. The HTM is further defined by the first appearance of stone birch forests (Betula ermanii) Kamchatka's most abundant modern tree species. The Late Holocene is marked by shifts in forest dynamics and forest-graminoid ratio and the appearance of new non-arboreal taxa such as bayberry (Myrica) and meadow rue (Filipendula). Kamchatka is one of Earth's most active volcanic regions. During the Late Glacial and Holocene, Kamchatka's volcanoes spread large quantities of tephra over the study region. Thirty-four tephra falls have been identified at the site. The events represented by most of these tephra falls have not left evidence of major impacts on the vegetation although some of the thicker tephras caused expansion of grasses (Poaceae) and, at least in one case, forest die-out and increased fire activity.

J	Wu, XD; Kong, FX				Wu, Xiao-Dong; Kong, Fan-Xiang			Effect of Excess Light on Colony Size and Photosynthetic Quantum Yield of Microcystis spp. during a Summer Bloom	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Variation of Microcystis spp. (Cyanobacteria) colony size and photosynthetic quantum yield were examined during a summer bloom in a large shallow lake (Lake Taihu). After exposure to direct solar radiation for four hours, about 60% of the colonies larger than 36 mu m had changed into smaller colonies and single cells. Meanwhile, the photosynthetic quantum yields of Microcystis spp. decreased rapidly. Under a treatment of 30% of the light intensity of that at the surface, only about 10% of the large colonies changed into smaller colonies and single cells, and the photosynthetic quantum yields showed only a slight decrease. When the samples were incubated at the surface layer and 0.5 m depth from 0800 h to 1800 h, the number of small colonies and single cells increased more markedly than that at 1.0 m depth. During this incubation, the photosynthetic quantum yields of the Microcystis spp. at the surface water were significantly lower than that at the 0.5 m and 1.0 m depths from 1000 h to 1800 h. Direct exposure to excess light severely reduced the photosynthetic quantum efficiency of the Microcystis spp. cells but also induced large Microcystis spp. colonies to change into smaller ones and single cells.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				DEC	2010	25	4					507	516		10.1080/02705060.2010.9664399	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2010.9664399													WOS:000284243100002

In the Amazon, ecosystems are marked by strong seasonal variation in precipitation, which leads to drastic changes in the water level of lakes and rivers. The aim of this study was to evaluate Hg levels in muscle of detritivorous, herbivorous and omnivorous fish from an Amazon lake (Madeira River Basin, Amazonas, Brazil) over four seasons (rising water, high water, falling water and low water). We hypothesized that total Hg concentration varies during the seasons. The results indicate that total Hg levels in detritivorous fish were higher in rising and low water seasons while in herbivorous and omnivorous fish the total Hg concentration was higher during the rising water season. The hypothesis was supported by the results. Additionally, the study provides evidence that Hg levels in fish with different feeding habits are influenced by the flood pulse of the Amazon region.					; Bastos, Wanderley/AAQ-5875-2020; Azevedo, Lucas/ABC-9221-2020; Pestana, Inácio/S-1043-2018; Pestana, Inacio/S-1043-2018	Rodrigues Bastos, Wanderley/0000-0002-2105-9947; Azevedo, Lucas/0000-0001-9999-9923; Pestana, Inacio/0000-0002-8263-0078													0963-9292	1573-3017				MAY	2019	28	4					478	485		10.1007/s10646-019-02044-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-019-02044-y								31025154					WOS:000467546400011

A key science understanding developed over the past 75 years has been that Native people did not occupy North America (or any place in the so-called New World) longer than 12,000 years before present (BP), thus they could neither have experienced nor understood any event in the late Pleistocene interglacial period (128,000 BP to 11,700 BP). As called in this analysis, the Clovis glass ceiling references the popular use of Clovis spear points to represent the earliest signs of humans in North America with dates generally later than 12,000 BP. This analysis engaged with recent science findings that Native people were present in North America up to 40,000 years ago. Opening the science limits of Native presence affords a reinterpretation of the past using extant Native interpretations. As an example, Salt Spring near Death Valley is a component of an ancient Pleistocene heritage landscape that can be reconstructed using geology and Native American interpretations. Native American perspectives were derived from 404 ethnographic interviews with Numic speaking peoples, focused on 24 ancient springs near Death Valley, California, and Las Vegas, Nevada.

At Lochloosa Lake, stepwise multiple regression revealed a significant positive relationship between the mean CPH of age-0 largemouth bass and the percentage of areal coverage by hydrilla Hydrilla verticallata. At Orange Lake, mean CPH was directly associated with the percentage of areal coverage by hydrilla and inversely related to summer water levels. Thus, the influence of vegetation on age-0 largemouth bass abundance was similar at both lakes, but the effects of water levels were not. Further investigations into the effects of fluctuations in water levels on age-0 largemouth bass in natural lakes are needed.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				FEB	2003	23	1					251	257		10.1577/1548-8675(2003)023<0251:ROALBA>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8675(2003)023<0251:ROALBA>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000181587400022
J	WALKER, RG; WISEMAN, TR				WALKER, RG; WISEMAN, TR			LOWSTAND SHOREFACES, TRANSGRESSIVE INCISED SHOREFACES, AND FORCED REGRESSIONS - EXAMPLES FROM THE VIKING FORMATION, JOARCAM AREA, ALBERTA	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH SECTION B-STRATIGRAPHY AND GLOBAL STUDIES												In the Joarcam-Beaverhill Lake area of Alberta, there are three long (40 km), narrow (5 km) sandbodies in the late Albian Viking Formation. They are surrounded by offshore open marine mudstones and have previously been interpreted as offshore bars. However, the sandbodies are both underlain and overlain by erosion surfaces. Joarcam is the only field with abundant cores, and the sandbody shows a sandier-upward and coarsening-upward succession. All three fields have recently been reinterpreted in the literature as lowstand shoreface deposits, but the order in which they formed remains controversial. Our well log cross sections suggest that the Lindbrook shoreface was the first to form at a time of maximum lowstand of sea level. It was truncated as sealevel began to rise, and the Lindbrook transgressive surface of erosion (TSE) has been traced into the erosion surface that underlies Joarcam. Joarcam can therefore be interpreted as a shoreface incised during a pause in an overall transgression. Both the Lindbrook and Joarcam shorefaces appear to be truncated by the regressive surface of erosion (RSE) that underlies Beaverhill Lake. This suggests that Beaverhill Lake is the youngest of the shorefaces and implies a second major fall of relative sea level. The lowstand shorefaces tend to be thinner because of reduced accommodation space during sea level fall. They tend to prograde farther (Beaverhill Lake, about 23 km) because of abundant sediment supply at lowstand, but consist largely of sandstone directly overlying the RSE. At Beaverhill Lake, the shoreface sediments prograded at least 10 km before any mud in the offshore-to-shoreface transition was preserved. By contrast, the transgressive shorefaces tend to be thicker because of accommodation space created during transgression. However, they tend not to prograde so far (Joarcam, up to 13 km), possibly because of reduced supply of sediment to the shoreface during transgression. The two proposed episodes of lowering of relative sea level are tentatively correlated with the two separate valley incisions documented at Crystal, about 90 km to the southwest. These incisions represent type 1 sequence boundaries, but the boundaries are not continuous regressive surfaces of erosion from Crystal to the Joarcam-Beaverhill Lake area. In both cases, the falling-stage RSEs have been eroded by the subsequent TSEs; these TSEs are the only surfaces preserved between the incised valleys and the lowstand shorefaces.																			1073-1318					FEB 15	1995	65	1					132	141																WOS:A1995QL88800010
J	Andersson, G; Nilsson, L				Andersson, G; Nilsson, L			Autumn waterfowl abundance in Lake Ringsjon, 1968-1996	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lake Ringsjon has been subject to a severe eutrophication process followed by various counter measures, such as nutrient reduction and fish manipulation. We have quantified staging waterfowl populations from 1968, before the eutrophication process reached its maximum, to 1996 when both the nutrient and fish reduction programmes were performed. The general pattern is that high numbers staged in Lake Ringsjon in 1968-1972. In the following 15 years, few waterfowl used the lake as staging area, but from about 1989, the number of birds again began to increase. The likely explanation of this pattern is an improved food availability within the lake, rather than large-scale, national, increases in bird population sizes, a notion strengthened by comparisons with standardized national waterfowl counts. We conclude that there are strong relations between limnological conditions and waterfowl abundances, and that the measures undertaken in Lake Ringsjon improved the lake as a staging area for waterfowl.																			0018-8158					JUN	1999	404						41	51		10.1023/A:1003709620993	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003709620993													WOS:000083700800007

Vegetation history along the eastern, desert escarpment of the Sierra San Pedro Martir, Baja California, Mexico	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Plant macrofossils from 38 packrat middens spanning the last similar to 33,000 cal yr BP record vegetation between similar to 650 and 900 m elevation along the eastern escarpment of the Sierra San Pedro Martir, northern Baja California. The middens span most of the Holocene, with a gap between similar to 4600 and 1800 cal yr BP, but coverage in the Pleistocene is uneven with a larger hiatus between 23,100 and 14,400 cal yr BP. The midden flora is relatively stable from the Pleistocene to Holocene. Exceptions include Pinus californiarum, Juniperus californica and other chaparral elements that were most abundant >23,100 cal yr BP and declined after 14,400 cal yr BP. Despite being near the chaparral/woodland-desertscrub ecotone during glacial times, the midden assemblages reflect none of the climatic reversals evident in the glacial or marine record, and this is corroborated by a nearby semi-continuous pollen stratigraphy from lake sediments. Regular appearance of C-4 grasses and summer-flowering annuals since 13,600 cal yr BP indicates occurrence of summer rainfall equivalent to modern (JAS average of similar to 80-90 mm). This casts doubt on the claim, based on temperature proxies from marine sediments in the Guaymas Basin, that monsoonal development in the northern Gulf and Arizona was delayed until after 6200 cal yr BP.

Fluid-assisted intra-plate seismicity at the edge of the Gawler Craton, South Australia	PHYSICS OF THE EARTH AND PLANETARY INTERIORS												The Australian continent, being void of active plate boundaries, is often perceived as seismically quiescent. However, earthquakes of moderate magnitude (M6+) occur on the continent around once per decade. Such intra-plate activity can pose a significant risk as these earthquakes can occur along fault lines that are either unknown or considered inactive, are often non-periodic, and poorly understood. Within Australia, the spatial distribution of intra-plate seismicity is non-uniform, instead tending to concentrate along certain weak zones of increased activity. One such region is the eastern margin of the Gawler Craton in South Australia, one of the oldest building blocks of the continent. Recently, several new temporary seismic arrays have been deployed in the region, transforming data coverage across southern Australia. In total, 139 new local earthquakes have been recorded, most of which went undetected by the national seismic network. Following relocation, the pattern of earthquakes becomes more localised and appears to coincide with the edge of the Gawler Craton. Further, a spatial associ-ation was found between earthquakes and mound springs, which act as the discharge point for groundwater migrating from the Great Artesian Basin. Enhanced fluid pressures (mantle-degassing) within permeable crustal scale fault systems, responding to a regional contractional strain field, appear to be a key driver of seismicity in the area.					; Eakin, Caroline/AAE-7964-2020; Agrawal, Shubham/ISA-9636-2023	Agrawal, Shubham/0000-0001-8511-4901; Eakin, Caroline/0000-0001-9187-3138													0031-9201	1872-7395				JAN	2024	346								107133	10.1016/j.pepi.2023.107133	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pepi.2023.107133		DEC 2023											WOS:001139396400001

The latest exploration results show the characteristics of large oil (gas) regions. The basic theories of sedimentology and petroleum geology, core observation, logging and various thin-film data, the provenance, sedimentary environment, high quality of the Permian Wuerhe Formation in the Yanbei area reservoir characteristics and genesis have been comprehensively studied the main factors. These factors affected the reservoir properties which can be used to guide the next step of exploration and development. The research shows that the Lower Wuerhe Formation is a fan-delta sedimentary environment, dominated by delta front subfacies, and the types of sedimentary microfacies are mainly Heman Lake, braided channel, crest fan, underwater diversion channels, estuary dams, distant sand dams, inter-channels, etc. There are two major provenances, Madong provenance and lower summer salt provenance, with summer salt provenance as the main source. The Permian Lower Wuerhe Formation reservoir is mainly affected by sedimentary environment and diagenesis. The lower Wuerhe Formation reservoir rock type is mainly conglomerate, and the sedimentary facies is the key factor to control the reservoir physical properties. The facies belt is the underwater distributary channel in the front edge of the fan delta, which is a favorable area for further exploration.

These blooms were examined in relationship to basic meteorological and environmental parameters. Annual cyanoHAB extent trends were generated using two modified remote-sensing approaches. The first approach was a modified bio-optical chlorophyll retrieval algorithm enhanced with empirical relationships to estimate water column cyanoHABs (MCH), whereas the second approach uses near-infrared (NIR) reflectance to quantify the surface scums of cyanoHABs (SSI). The development and application of the SSI are unique products in the Great Lakes and may have generic application to ecological and public health issues. Satellite-derived cyanoHAB estimates agreed well with in situ observations (89% accuracy). The annual cyanoHAB trends (MCH and SSI) for WBLE, SB, and GB were not similar for the 2002-2013 analysis period. A recent trend of increasing cyanoHABs was noted in WBLE but not in GB or SB. Moreover, extensive and persistent surface scums were observed in WBLE but not in GB or SB. Meteorological parameters were similar among the basins; however, significant differences in spring discharge of the dominant river were observed among basins. Spring discharge was a significant predictor of cyanoHAB occurrence in WBLE but not in GB and SB. Wind-induced sediment re-suspension events were common during the bloom period in WBLE but not in GB or SB and these events were highly correlated with cyanoHAB occurrence. The differences among basins in the role of riverine discharge and re-suspension suggest local factors are more important than regional factors in controlling cyanoHAB dynamics within these three basins in the Great Lakes.

Geochemical analyses including Sr-87/Sr-86 and Nd-143/Nd-144 and trace elements support the local pyroclastic rock as the dominant source: <22% of the total Sr in the lake sediments and similar to 17% of the Nd arises from the distant source. Nb/Ta and Zr/Hf for the lake sediments are identical to those for the local rock but differ from the ratios for the wind-blown dust, and chondrite-normalized rare earth element patterns for the lake sediments are similar to those for the local rock and soil, but differ from those for the distant source. The sediments in Lake Huguang Maar are probably input into the lake through runoff and thus controlled by the hydrology of the lake. Wind-blown dust transported by the Asian winter monsoon from and North China is only a minor contribution to the sediments. (C) 2009 University, of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc.

J	OLSEN, RD; SOMMERFELD, MR				OLSEN, RD; SOMMERFELD, MR			PHYSICAL-CHEMICAL LIMNOLOGY OF A DESERT RESERVOIR	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The physical-chemical limnology of a desert lake in central Arizona [USA] was investigated from Feb. 1971 to July 1973. The reservoir is a warm-monomictic, eutrophic lake which exhibited pronounced thermal stratification during the summer months. Surface water temperatures ranged from a minimum of about 9.degree. C in Jan. to a maximum near 30.degree. C in July-Aug. Chemically the lake may be described as a hard water lake of moderately high alkalinity and salinity. The concentration of the principal ions was affected significantly by precipitation run-off. The primary nutrients N and P were subject to considerable seasonal variability, being influenced most by precipitation and phytoplankton abundance. Trace element concentrations were low and showed comparatively little fluctuation.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1977	53	2					117	129		10.1007/BF00029290	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00029290													WOS:A1977DC22200004
J	Eyles, N; Meriano, M				Eyles, Nick; Meriano, Mandana			Road-impacted sediment and water in a Lake Ontario watershed and lagoon, City of Pickering, Ontario, Canada: An example of urban basin analysis	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The world is increasingly urban but there are few studies of how contaminated water and sediment move through urban basins with their built landscapes and complexly disturbed geology. The central Canadian city of Pickering, Ontario sprawls across a small (27 km(2)) densely urbanized (pop: 53,000) watershed and is underlain by Pleistocene glacial sediments and thick artificial fill deposits. Almost 80% of the area is hardened by impervious cover; road and rail lines cover 40% and include Canada's busiest highway (12-lane Highway 401: 177,000 vehicles per day in 2003). The basin discharges to Lake Ontario through a small (85 ha) shallow (<3.5 m) lagoon (Frenchman's Bay). A 3-D steady state finite element groundwater numerical model (FEFLOW) was applied to 200 cored and geophysically-logged (gamma and resistivity) boreholes and 3400 digital water wells. It identifies the subsurface stratigraphy and hydrostratigraphic function of deposits and the rates of groundwater flow. Year-round monitoring Of groundwater, creek and lagoon water quality shows that transportation infrastructure is the primary source of contaminated water and sediment. Some 7600 tonnes of de-icing salt are applied to watershed roads each year: 52% accumulates in groundwater where it continues to be released as brackish baseflow to creeks in summer. The remainder is rapidly delivered by surface runoff to Frenchman's Bay where chloride contents are more than double the average values in waters across the Great Lakes. Highway 401 is the largest single Source of salt contamination to the lagoon: it receives 26% of all road salt applied to the watershed but covers just 1.3% of its area. Prominent spikes in chloride content (>2000 mg L-1) occur during winter thaws in creeks downstream of the highway. Enhanced stream bank erosion as a consequence of flashy storm runoff from road surfaces moves similar to 100 tonnes of contaminated sediment to Frenchman's Bay each year. Instantaneous suspended sediment concentrations in storm runoff are as high as 1600 g m(-3) and loadings of sulphate (SO4-2) nutrients reach 594 kg h(-1). Metals and E coli in road runoff are all elevated well above Canadian water quality standards. These findings underscore findings from other urban areas regardless of regional climate, that transportation corridors are a major global Source of contaminated water and sediment.

However, few quantitative temperature reconstructions have been made for the region, and this hinders our ability to validate climate models and to understand the coupling process between monsoon, ocean and ice sheets through time. Here we report a quantitative temperature reconstruction for the last deglaciation from a terrace of Lake Dangxiong Co in the southwestern Tibetan Plateau. Based on the unsaturation index of long-chain alkenones, the reconstructed mean annual air temperature during the late Last Glacial Maximum was about 0.2 degrees C, while the Bolling/Allerod (B/A) period was characterized by a rapid increase in temperature from 0.8 degrees C to 2.4 degrees C, (2.9) followed by an abrupt decrease in temperature to -0.9 degrees C in the early Younger Dryas (YD). The alkenones and n-alkanes record indicates that Dangxiong Co experienced a cold and wet climate in the early part of the last deglaciation after the Last Glacial Maximum, a warm-dry B/A, and a cold and dry YD. Our temperature reconstruction confirms that the thermal and dynamical effects of the Tibetan Plateau are one of the main elements contributing to abrupt changes in the Indian Summer Monsoon.

Dynamics of CFCs in northern temperate lakes and adjacent groundwater	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												[1] Three dimictic lakes and one meromictic lake in and near the Trout Lake, Wisconsin, watershed were sampled to determine the variation of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) concentrations within the lakes. The lakes were sampled during stratified conditions, during fall turnover, and during ice cover. The results demonstrate a considerable variation in CFC concentrations and corresponding atmospheric mixing ratios in the lakes sampled, both with depth and season within a given lake, and across different lakes. CFC profiles and observed degradation were not related to the groundwater inflow rate and hence are likely the result of in-lake processes influenced by CFC degradation in the ( lake) water column, CFC degradation in the lake-bed sediments, and gas exchange rates and the duration of turnover ( turnover efficiency).

Water sampling was performed during autumn (September) 2022 from 15 sampling points from surface layer (0.5 m). Based on the obtained results and according to Order 161/2006, water collected from Moara Domneasca pond was classified in quality classes. Limnological surveys of physicochemical parameters were completed by high-resolution remote sensing imagery by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). For each flight performance, an orthomosaic of georeferenced RGB images was made and the different features of interest were monitored and quantified by an automatic identification. UAV imagery is a useful tool for environmental lake management. Reporting the coordinates of the sampling points on the orthomosaic it helps to interpret better the results, having an overview of the studied area.					; Roxana Maria, Madjar/AAB-5908-2021; NICOLAE, Carmen/U-7033-2018; Iliescu, Alexandru Iulian/HKM-9516-2023; Virsta, Ana/KAO-2649-2024; Sandu, Mirela Alina/HGD-6388-2022; Sandu, Mirela/HGD-6388-2022; Gina, Scaeteanu Vasile/A-6790-2019; MADJAR, ROXANA MARIA/AAB-5908-2021	Virsta, Ana/0000-0003-1401-7447; Iliescu, Alexandru-Iulian/0000-0002-3716-1807; Sandu, Mirela Alina/0009-0009-8202-1916; Vasile Scaeteanu, Gina/0000-0001-5021-4750; MADJAR, ROXANA MARIA/0000-0002-9357-0664													2285-5718	2286-0126				JUN	2023	12	1					191	201																WOS:001025664100022
J	Tiner, RW				Tiner, RW			Geographically isolated wetlands of the United States	WETLANDS												While many wetlands form along floodplains of rivers, streams, lakes, and estuaries, others have developed in depressions far removed from such waters. Depressional wetlands completely surrounded by upland have traditionally been called "isolated wetlands." Isolated wetlands are not confined to basins, as some occur on broad flats and others form on slopes. The term "geographically isolated wetlands" better describes these wetlands, since many are hydrologically connected to other wetlands and waterbodies through ground-water flows or by intermittent overflows (spillovers). Numerous types of geographically isolated wetlands occur throughout the United States. They may be naturally formed or the result of human action. Naturally formed types include prairie pothole wetlands, playas, Nebraska's Rainwater Basin and Sandhills wetlands, West Coast vernal pools, sinkhole wetlands, Carolina bays, interdunal and intradunal wetlands, desert springs, terminal basins in the Great Basin, and kettle-hole bogs in glaciated regions. Human-caused isolated types may be intentionally built, such as ponds designed for various purposes and wetlands built on mined lands, or they may be accidentially created (e.g., natural wetlands that were once connected to rivers and streams but are now isolated by roads, railroads, and other development or isolated by altered river hydrology). Many of the functions and benefits attributed to non-isolated wetlands are present in isolated wetlands.																			0277-5212	1943-6246				SEP	2003	23	3					494	516		10.1672/0277-5212(2003)023[0494:GIWOTU]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1672/0277-5212(2003)023[0494:GIWOTU]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000185812100003

In these semi-arid and cold regions with sparse meteorological networks, remote sensing and topographic modeling are of potential interest for understanding how physiography influences the local climate regime. After integrating night land surface temperature from the MODIS satellite, and physiographic descriptors derived from a digital elevation model, we explored how regional and landscape-scale features influence frost occurrence in the southern altiplano of Bolivia. Based on the high correlation between night land surface temperature and minimum air temperature, frost occurrence in early-, middle- and late-summer periods were calculated from satellite observations and mapped at a 1-km resolution over a 45,000 km(2) area. Physiographic modeling of frost occurrence was then conducted comparing multiple regression (MR) and boosted regression trees (BRT). Physiographic predictors were latitude, elevation, distance from salt lakes, slope steepness, potential insolation, and topographic convergence. Insolation influence on night frost was tested assuming that ground surface warming in the daytime reduces frost occurrence in the next night. Depending on the time period and the calibration domain. BRT models explained 74% to 90% of frost occurrence variation, outperforming the MR method. Inverted BRT models allowed the downscaling of frost occurrence maps at 100-m resolution, illustrating local processes like cold air drainage. Minimum temperature lapse rates showed seasonal variation and mean values higher than those reported for temperate mountains. When applied at regional and subregional scales successively, BRT models revealed prominent effects of elevation, latitude and distance to salt lakes at large scales, whereas slope, topographic convergence and insolation gained influence at local scales. Our results highlight the role of daytime insolation on night frost occurrence at local scale, particularly in the early- and mid-summer periods when solar astronomic forcing is maximum. Seasonal variations and interactions in physiographic effects are also shown. Nested effects of physiographic factors across scales are discussed, as well as potential applications of physiographic modeling to downscale ecological processes in complex terrains.

Diet of lake trout and burbot in Northern Lake Michigan during spring: Evidence of ecological interaction	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We used analyses of burbot (Low Iota) and lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) diets taken during spring gillnet surveys in northern Lake Michigan in 2006-2008 to investigate the potential for competition and predator-prey interactions between these two species. We also compared our results to historical data from 1932. During 2006-2008, lake trout diet consisted mainly of alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus) and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), whereas burbot utilized a much wider prey base including round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), rainbow smelt, alewives, and sculpins. Using the Schoener's diet overlap index, we found a higher potential for interspecific competition in 1932 than in 2006-2008, though diet overlap was not significant in either time period. No evidence of cannibalism by lake trout or lake trout predation on burbot was found in either time period. In 2006-2008, however, lake trout composed 5.4% (by weight) of burbot diet. To determine whether this predation could be having an impact on lake trout rehabilitation efforts in northern Lake Michigan, we developed a bioenergetic-based consumption estimate for burbot on Boulder Reef (a representative reef within the Northern Refuge) and found that burbot alone can consume a considerable proportion of the yearling lake trout stocked annually, depending on burbot density. Overall, we conclude that predation, rather than competition, is the more important ecological interaction between burbot and lake trout, and burbot predation may be contributing to the failed lake trout rehabilitation efforts in Lake Michigan.

J	Nürnberg, GK; Tarvainen, M; Ventelä, AM; Sarvala, J				Nurnberg, Gertrud K.; Tarvainen, Marjo; Ventela, Anne-Mari; Sarvala, Jouko			Internal phosphorus load estimation during biomanipulation in a large polymictic and mesotrophic lake	INLAND WATERS												We quantified internal phosphorus (P) load for 26 years in the polymictic, large (155 km(2)) and shallow (mean depth 5.5 m) Lake Sakylan Pyhajarvi, which was heavily biomanipulated by fish removal. Internal load was estimated as (1) partially net estimates from in situ P summer increases, (2) net estimates from P budgets (mass balance approach), and (3) gross estimates from predicted active sediment release area and sediment P release, dependent on August lake temperature. Long-term averages of these estimates were similar and large at about 60% of average external load (105 mg m(-2) yr(-1)) and were larger than external load in years with high water temperature and low water load. Regression analysis revealed that external load is decreasing but internal load is increasing over time. Internal load was negatively correlated with annual water load and positively correlated with lake water temperature. Long-term average annual or summer P concentrations are adequately predicted by a P mass balance model that includes external load, internal load (Method 3), and sedimentation as independently predicted retention. Predictability was poor for individual years, however, partially due to the poor correlation of observed lake and outflow P concentrations, the variable abundance of planktivorous fish, and reflecting the violation of the steady state assumption when individual years are modeled. Scenario modeling shows that biomanipulation cancels out the effects of internal load and forecasts a rapid increase of internal load and P concentration due to climate change; therefore, measures that further decrease external and internal P load and strengthen biomanipulation are recommended.

J	Ludwig, FL; Horel, J; Whiteman, CD				Ludwig, FL; Horel, J; Whiteman, CD			Using EOF analysis to identify important surface wind patterns in mountain valleys	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY												Empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) have been determined for three wind datasets from stations in valleys south of the Great Salt Lake in Utah. Two of the datasets were for summer months, with individual days selected from the MesoWest archive to represent conditions conducive to well-developed thermally driven flows. The remaining dataset was for the month of October 2000 and was derived from a combination of MesoWest data and data collected during intensive observation periods of the Vertical Transport and Mixing Experiment (VTMX) conducted in the Great Salt Lake area. This experiment investigated stable atmospheric conditions in the complex urban terrain around Salt Lake City, Utah. In all three datasets, the primary EOFs represented flows that were directed predominantly along valley axes and were caused by channeled or thermally driven flow. Diurnal variations in EOF intensity showed that thermal effects were the most common causal mechanism. The along-valley EOFs accounted for 43%-58% of the variance in the wind component datasets ( 8 or 10 stations each). The second EOFs accounted for 13%-18% of the variance. In the summer datasets, the second EOF appeared to represent day-night transition periods; there was evidence of both side canyon flows and day-night transitional effects in the October dataset. The EOF approach has promise for classifying wind patterns and selecting representative cases for simulation or for further detailed analysis.																			0894-8763					JUL	2004	43	7					969	983		10.1175/1520-0450(2004)043<0969:UEATII>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0450(2004)043<0969:UEATII>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000222789300001
J	Varunan, T; Shanmugam, P				Varunan, Theenathayalan; Shanmugam, Palanisamy			Use of Landsat 8 data for characterizing dynamic changes in physical and acoustical properties of coastal lagoon and estuarine waters	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH												This study intends to develop methodologies that use high resolution satellite data from Landsat 8 (Operational Land Imager) OLI and (Thermal Infrared Sensor) TIRS sensors for characterizing spatial and temporal changes in physical and acoustical properties of coastal lagoon and estuarine waters. It employs multiple steps to achieve this possibility: a novel atmospheric correction algorithm is applied to OLI spectral data to retrieve water-leaving radiances which are key inputs for the applied models; appropriate parameterizations are developed for the OLI bands and used in conjugation with a hybrid model to produce the spectral absorption coefficients of coloured dissolved organic matter (acDom) and to derive surface salinity fields which inversely correspond with the acDom values; an efficient algorithm is employed to estimate surface water temperature using thermal infrared bands, and well-known models are employed with the satellite-derived products to determine the acoustical properties (sound attenuation and speed). Results from the above methodology were evaluated using in-situ data and Landsat 8 OLI matchup data acquired over the coastal lagoon systems (e.g., Chilika Lagoon on the coast of Bay of Bengal) during monsoon and non-monsoon seasons. The uncertainties associated with the derived products such as CDOM, salinity, temperature, sound attenuation and speed were found to be within the desirable mission goal. Recognizing the importance of the salinity gradient that plays a unique and fundamental role in defining a transitional ecosystem, spatial and temporal patterns in the structure of the salinity gradient were examined together with the CDOM patterns. High resolution OLI products exhibited a general horizontal gradient with salinity decreasing from the lagoon mouth in the eastern and central sectors to the river mouth in the northern sector and a near uniform gradient with moderate salinity in the adjacent locations (southern sector) of the lagoon. The time-series of OLI products further showed that spatial and temporal structures of the salinity are modulated by the terrestrially delivered freshwater inputs, tidal forcing at the lagoon mouth, mixing of these two waters sources, and local geomorphology. Surface water temperature products derived from the TIRS sensor for the lagoon and its adjoining locations depicted a well pronounced seasonal cycle with warmer temperatures modulated by reduced mixing and increased solar heating and stratification during non monsoon, summer months and cooler temperatures during monsoon, winter months. The effect of salinity and temperature on the sound attenuation and sound speed was prominent in the locations of the freshwater discharge and tidal mixing regimes, where the salinity exerted a greater influence on both sound attenuation and speed despite the opposing effects of surface water temperatures. In areas of surface heating and stratification, both salinity and temperature increased causing an increase in sound attenuation and speed over the ranges found in the lagoon. These results are important for sonar performance modelling and operation of acoustic devices in such shallow water environments impacted by the terrestrial and ocean forcing factors.

Combining underwater visual census and self-organising maps: a freshwater ecology application	UNDERWATER TECHNOLOGY												A very small and deep lake (a sinkhole) in Central Italy was studied during summer 2010 adopting an artificial intelligence based method, the self-organising map (SOM), for the analysis of data collected by a slightly modified underwater visual census (UVC) technique (strip-transects). The data were collected on the assemblage structure and individual age/size of the summer fish found in the sinkhole. UVC data are known to be in some cases partially unreliable for common quantitative statistical analysis (being noisy, uncertain and redundant, particularly in small systems). A specific type of artificial neural network (the SOM) was therefore put forward as a suitable solution for properly extracting information from this kind of data. In the past two decades SOMs have proved to be often more appropriate than other common multivariate techniques in assessing a range of ecological issues. Nevertheless, no study has explicitly taken advantage of the potential of using SOMs with UVC data. The paper gives a brief example of how SOMs can be used to represent and analyse multivariate patterns of a fish assemblage.																			1756-0543	1756-0551				MAR	2011	29	4					173	181		10.3723/ut.29.173	http://dx.doi.org/10.3723/ut.29.173													WOS:000437623700003

Will restoration targets as peat growth and waterfowl diversity be reached? Location: Valley fen of the river Peene (NE-Germany) and the Hansag fen (Lake Neusiedler See, NW-Hungary). Methods: Analysis of permanent plot data and vegetation maps over a period of up to seven years of rewetting. The general relations between newly adjusted water levels and changes in dominance of helophytic key species during early succession are analysed considering four rewetting intensities (water level classes) and eight vegetation types (Phalaris arundinacea type, Carex type, Glyceria maxima type, Phragmites australis type, Typha type, aquatic vegetation type, open water type and miscellaneous type). Results: The initial period of balancing the site conditions and vegetation is characterised by specific vegetation types and related horizontal vegetation structures. Most vegetation types displayed similar trends within the same water level class when different sites and regions were compared. A significant spread of potentially peat forming vegetation with dominance of Carex spp. or Phragmites as desired goal of restoration was predominantly restricted to long-term shallow inundated sites (water level median in winter: 0-30 cm above surface). Open water patches as bird habitats persisted mainly at permanent inundated sites (water level median in winter > 60 cm above surface). Conclusions: Site hydrology appeared as a main force of secondary succession.

Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles to Count and Monitor the Baikal Seal (Pusa sibirica Gmelin 1788)	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												To develop a method for monitoring the condition of Baikal seals (Pusa sibirica Gmelin 1788) and to count their numbers in summer haul-outs using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in July-August 2020 and 2021 on the islands of Tonkii (Thin), Kruglyi (Round), and Dolgii (Long) (the Ushkan Islands archipelago), visual surveys and surveys with UAVs were carried out. The maximum number of seals observed was 3467 in 2020 and 1295 in 2021, and their total number in 2021 was also lower than in 2020. During both years of observation, the number of seals in the haul-outs gradually decreased, which might be explained by the wave level on the lake. Contrary to the popular belief about the largest seal haul-out located on Tonkii Island, the greatest number of seals was found on Dolgii and Kruglyi islands. Recommendations for the use of UAVs, which can also be useful in developing the rules for tourists visiting the national park, are given.

J	Vione, D; Scozzaro, A				Vione, Davide; Scozzaro, Andrea			Photochemistry of Surface Fresh Waters in the Framework of Climate Change	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Photochemical processes taking place in surface fresh waters play an important role in the transformation of biorecalcitrant pollutants and some natural compounds and in the inactivation of microorganisms. Such processes are divided into direct photolysis, where a molecule is transformed following sunlight absorption, and indirect photochemistry, where naturally occurring photosensitizers absorb sunlight and produce a range of transient species that can transform dissolved molecules (or inactivate microorganisms). Photochemistry is usually favored in thoroughly illuminated shallow waters, while the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) acts as a switch between different photochemical pathways (direct photolysis, and indirect photochemistry triggered by different transient species). Various phenomena connected with climate change (water browning, changing precipitations) may affect water DOC and water depth, with implications for the kinetics of photoreactions and the associated transformation pathways. The latter are important because they often produce peculiar intermediates, with particular health and environmental impacts. Further climate-induced effects with photochemical implications are shorter ice cover seasons and enhanced duration of summer stratification in lakes, as well as changes in the flow velocity of rivers that affect the photodegradation time scale. This contribution aims at showing how the different climate-related phenomena can affect photoreactions and which approaches can be followed to quantitatively describe these variations.

Southern California Vegetation, Wildfire, and Erosion Had Nonlinear Responses to Climatic Forcing During Marine Isotope Stages 5-2 (120-15 ka)	PALEOCEANOGRAPHY AND PALEOCLIMATOLOGY												A multiproxy record from Baldwin Lake, San Bernardino Mountains, allowed us to examine variation and relationships between erosion, wildfire, vegetation, and climate in subalpine Southern California from 120 to 15 ka. Bulk organics, biogenic silica, and molar C:N data were generally antiphased with magnetic and trace element data and displayed long-term (10(5) year) shifts between autochthonous and allocthonous deposition. This was most pronounced during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5, and we hypothesize that local summer insolation was the primary driver for Baldwin Lake's productive and unproductive lake state alternations. Wildfire history was inferred from charcoal concentrations and vegetation change from pollen. Relationships between these ecological processes, basin deposition, and summer insolation were often nonlinear. Sagebrush expansion, wildfire, and weak basin weathering characterized MIS 4, while during MIS 2, the basin was highly erosive, rarely burned, and the forest was impacted by shifts in Southern Californian hydroclimate. Despite coniferous forest cover throughout MIS 3, submillennial oscillations in charcoal, pollen, and bulk organic content occurred, consistent with pollen records from Eurasia's Mediterranean biome that span multiple glacial-interglacial cycles. Highly resolved global CO2 records and sea surface temperatures in key regions of the Pacific show no apparent relationship to these landscape conditions, and we suggest submillennial hydroclimatic variability as a potential driver. Highly resolved long pollen records from Southern California are an urgent research need to better understand the finer-scale (<= 10(3) year) interactions between past vegetation, wildfire, and erosion, given the current natural disaster risks that 21st century climate change poses to both human and ecological communities.

J	Kirsten, KL; Meadows, ME				Kirsten, Kelly L.; Meadows, Michael E.			Late-Holocene palaeolimnological and climate dynamics at Princessvlei, South Africa: Evidence from diatoms	HOLOCENE												The 'Cape Flats' region, situated in the winter rainfall zone of South Africa, is a low-lying tombolo underlain by recent fluvial and aeolian sands and characterised by numerous small lakes and wetlands. One of these is Princessvlei, a eutrophic, freshwater coastal lake. The lake lies in an inter-dunal depression encroached on in the more recent past by high-density residential, industrial and agricultural land uses. A 210-cm core extracted from the lake periphery yielded high diatom fossil concentrations for the upper 174 cm. Princessvlei appears to oscillate between two ecologically stable states, namely, a state characterised by clear water, oligotrophic, benthic communities and a turbid state dominated by eutrophic, planktonic species. The two stable ecological states are interpreted to be a function of the relative dominance of catchment precipitation or groundwater influx which augments the open water conditions. From 2600 to 1500 cal. BP (173-135 cm), the system is predominantly turbid with greater moisture availability before a relatively rapid development of oligotrophic and dilute conditions from 1300 to 610 cal. BP (135-30 cm). A brief period of deeper water depths and meso-eutrophic conditions is observed between 550 and 445 cal. BP (23-13 cm). Following a short-lived hiatus, poly-hypertrophic, alkaline species are abundant in the top 10 cm coinciding with European colonisation in the region from the 17th century.

J	Daniszewski, P				Daniszewski, Piotr			Quality of Water in Dabie Lake (North-West Poland) During Different Seasons (2008-2012)	ASIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY												This paper presents the evaluation of physico-chemical parameters of lake water in Dabie Lake based on the European Union Water Framework Directive. The research was carried out in the years 2008-2012, between April and October. From each of the three measuring stations located in the lake included the study, two separate water samples were taken for chemical analysis. Dabie Lake is located within the administrative borders of the city of Szczecin. It constitutes a large sedimentation basin being a part of hydrographically complex Odra river estuary (the other one is Zalew Szczecinski-the Szczecin Lagoon). The accumulation of allochthonous and autochthonous sediments has taken place in these basins for few thousand years. The studied lake had pH values in the neutral range from 7.65 to 7.87. According to the classification of the European Union Water Framework Directive, all lake were classified as first class. By analyzing the average annual values, one can note that pH, O-2diss and NO3-concentration showed a relatively small variation in all the investigated lake. The total suspended solids in Dabie Lake, fell into the II class. The P-tot. concentrations in the surface layer of lake was little differentiated, reaching the levels appropriate for III quality class. The total phosphorus concentration was 0.41-0.69 mgP dm(-3). The concentrations of PO43-diss in the tested lake waters varied more significantly corresponding to water quality classes ranging from IV. The concentrations saturation with O-2 was 44.8-96.4 %. In case of nitrogen compounds, nitrates and nitrites values for these indicators fell into the I and II class in all the surveyed lake. The indicator which proves high productivity of lake is biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5). The level of this indicator in the studied Lake Dabie was at level III. The highest concentration of oxygen in lake waters was found in Lake Dabie about 8.6 mg O-2 dm(3).																			0970-7077	0975-427X				JUL	2014	26	14	B				4193	4196		10.14233/ajchem.2014.16059A	http://dx.doi.org/10.14233/ajchem.2014.16059A													WOS:000344361100010
J	Vandekerckhove, L; Muys, B; Poesen, J; De Weerdt, B; Coppé, N				Vandekerckhove, L; Muys, B; Poesen, J; De Weerdt, B; Coppé, N			A method for dendrochronological assessment of medium-term gully erosion rates	CATENA												A method based on dendrochronology to estimate gully erosion rates was developed as an alternative of traditional methods for assessing medium-term gully retreat rates, such as field monitoring of headcuts or aerial-photo interpretation of gully retreat. The method makes use of trees or parts of a tree affected by gully erosion revealing information on the history of the erosion process by datable deviations of their normal growth pattern, hence defined as 'datable objects'. These include roots exposed by erosion; browsing scars made by ungulates on exposed roots or on above-ground parts of fallen trees; exposed and dead root ends; root suckers; stems, branches and leading shoots of fallen trees; and a sequence of trees within a gully. The method is based on the differentiation between three main conditions depending on the relation between the dynamics of the datable object (part of the tree) and the development of the gully. The first condition implies that the datable object was created before erosion of the gully volume to be dated, e.g. exposed tree roots. According to the second condition, the datable object developed as an immediate consequence of the erosion event, e.g. growth reactions of a fallen tree. The third condition implies that the datable object was created some time after the erosion event took place, e.g. trees colonising the gully bed. Each principle has consequences for the accuracy and the correct interpretation of the estimated erosion rate, i.e. whether the true erosion rate is underestimated, exact or overestimated. In spite of methodological limitations and dendrochronological dating problems, the method was successfully applied in southeast Spain. Conservative estimations of gully-head retreat rate resulted in an average medium-term (3-46 years) value of 6 m(3) year(-1) (n = 9). For gully sidewall processes, the average minimum erosion rate per unit sidewall length amounted 0.1 m(3) year(-1) m(-1) (n = 9). A strong correlation was found between the headcut retreat rate (upsilon (m(ortho)) m(3) year(-1)) and the drainage-basin area (A, m(2)) of the gullies, expressed by upsilon (m(ortho)) = 0.02 A(0.57) (R-2 = 0.93, n = 9). Comparing the findings from this study with those obtained by short-term headcut retreat monitoring suggests a high reliability of the estimated retreat rates, supporting the applicability of the developed dendrochronological method.
