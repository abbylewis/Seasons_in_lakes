Temperature-related nocturnal vertical segregation of coexisting coregonids	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Habitat choice of fish may be influenced by many different ecological factors, e.g., predation risk, feeding opportunity, or temperature and oxygen availability. However, because most of the fish prey and their predators rely on vision for feeding, the predator avoidance and feeding opportunity hypotheses may fail to predict distribution of fish at complete darkness. Here, we accumulated patterns of nocturnal vertical distribution of two coexisting coregonid populations in Lake Stechlin from 13 samplings over 4 years, conducted by hydroacoustics and simultaneous midwater trawling. We calculated population depths, dispersion, illumination strengths and vertical temperature gradients for all sampling dates. Illumination strengths at fish population depths were far below the critical levels for feeding by vision, suggesting that predator avoidance or feeding opportunity did not trigger the depth distribution at night. In contrast, nocturnal population depths and dispersion of vendace Coregonus albula were significantly associated with the seasonally changing vertical temperature gradient in Lake Stechlin, whereas night-time distribution of the coexisting Fontane cisco Coregonus fontanae was almost unaffected by temperature. Vendace occurred just below the thermocline in isothermal water layers of about 6.5-9 degrees C during stratification of Lake Stechlin, whereas Fontane cisco preferred 4-6 degrees C cold layers. These experienced temperatures roughly correspond to species-specific optimum metabolic temperatures determined in earlier experiments. We assume, therefore, that the temperature-related vertical segregation during non-feeding hours at darkness is linked with metabolic benefits, thus suggesting that bioenergetics efficiency contributes to ultimate causes of diel vertical migrations at least in vendace.

Macroflora of the Krkonose-Piedmont Basin (Pennsylvanian-early Permian); Bohemian Massif, Czech Republic	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												The Krkono??e-Piedmont Basin is one of several land-locked post-collisional Variscan basins of the Bohemian Massif. The fossil record of the basin is evaluated, based on published data and unpublished lists of floras collected in borehole cores and during mapping. The occurrence ranges of plant taxa are plotted against radioisotopically calibrated lithostratigraphic units. The compiled dataset is used to evaluate species richness and vegetation patterns throughout Late Pennsylvanian and Asselian times. The species richness of particular intervals has been affected by taphonomic and sampling biases of varying intensities. Coal-bearing strata and grey lacustrine intervals represent well-documented fossil-rich taphonomic windows with 20???45 species. In contrast, red beds are fossilpoor and under-sampled, typically providing only a few species. It is assumed that coal-bearing and grey lacustrine intervals represent periods of increased climatic humidity, during which wetlands covered extensive areas of basinal lowlands or shallows and coastal areas of meromictic lakes. Most habitats were colonised by hygrophytes and mesophytes. However, sparse conifer shoots found in association with wetland taxa indicate seasonality to a sufficient degree that xerophytic taxa were able to get close to sites of deposition and wetland habitats. During the deposition of red beds, wetlands may have almost completely disappeared, resulting in the basinal landscape being colonised by gymnosperm-dominated forests of walchian conifers with co-dominant cordaitaleans. Wetland assemblages of low diversity and small populations may have survived in the basin, although many species may have disappeared from the basin, having dispersed elsewhere to habitats where their survival was possible. In the late Middle Pennsylvanian and early Upper Pennsylvanian, such habitats existed in the Intra-Sudetic Basin farther east, and in other basins located in western and central parts of the Bohemian Massif. These climatically-driven oscillations in vegetation patterns, which occurred on scales of hundreds of thousands to a million years, were superimposed on a long-term drying trend marked by an increase in gymnosperms in the species pool, as well as an abundance of their remains in the fossil record, at the expense of free-sporing plants. Among the gymnosperms, there was a gradual drop in the diversity and abundance of medullosalean pteridosperms and a concomitant rise of peltasperms and conifers. ?? 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Bacterial and archaeal communities might show spatial or seasonal patterns and were shown to be influenced by distinct environmental parameters and anthropogenic activities, including pollution and damming. Here, we determined the spatial variation and the environmental variables influencing the abundant and rare bacterial and archaeal communities in the sediments of eutrophic-hypereutrophic reservoirs from a tropical urban area in Brazil. The most abundant microbes included mainly Anaerolineae and Deltaproteobacteria genera from the Bacteria domain, and Methanomicrobia genera from the Archaea domain. Microbial communities differed spatially in each reservoir, reflecting the establishment of specific environmental conditions. Locations with better or worst water quality, or close to a dam, showed more distinct microbial communities. Besides the water column depth, microbial communities were affected by some pollution indicators, including total phosphorus, orthophosphate, electrical conductivity, and biochemical oxygen demand. Distinct proportions of variation were explained by spatial and environmental parameters for each microbial community. Furthermore, spatial variations in environmental parameters affecting these communities, especially the most distinct ones, contributed to microbial variations mediated by spatial and environmental properties together. Finally, our study showed that different pressures in each reservoir affected the sediment microbiota, promoting different responses and possible adaptations of abundant and rare bacterial and archaeal communities.

Eutrophication in subtropical lakes reinforces the dominance of balanced-variation component in temporal bacterioplankton community heterogeneity by lessening stochastic processes	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												This study first elucidates the shifts in the relative contributions of balanced-variation and abundance-gradient components to total temporal beta-diversity of bacterioplankton communities along the trophic state gradient, which are linked to the changes in the balance between deterministic and stochastic processes. Unveiling the rules of bacterioplankton community assembly in anthropogenically disturbed lakes is a crucial issue in aquatic ecology. However, it is unclear how the ecological processes underlying the seasonally driven bacterioplankton community structure respond to varying degrees of lake eutrophication. We, therefore, collected water samples from three subtropical freshwater lakes with various trophic states (i.e. oligo-mesotrophic, mesotrophic, and eutrophic states) on a quarterly basis between 2017 and 2018. To innovatively increase our understanding of bacterioplankton community assembly along the trophic state gradient, the total bacterioplankton community dissimilarity was subdivided into balanced variation in abundances and abundance gradients. The results indicated that balanced-variation component rather than abundance-gradient component dominated the total temporal beta-diversity of bacterioplankton communities across all trophic categories. Ecological stochasticity contributed more to the overall bacterioplankton community assembly in the oligo-mesotrophic and mesotrophic lakes than in the eutrophic lake. The reduced bacterioplankton network complexity at the eutrophic level was closely associated with the enhancement of environmental filtering, showing that bacterioplankton communities in eutrophic lakes are likely to be less stable and more vulnerable to water quality degradation. Together, this study offers essential clues for biodiversity conservation in subtropical lakes under future intensified eutrophication.					; Jiao, Congcong/AAQ-8264-2020; Zeng, Jin/AAQ-7810-2020; Wu, Qinglong/B-7625-2011	Jiao, Congcong/0000-0002-9096-8431; Zeng, Jin/0000-0002-3298-4820; 													0168-6496	1574-6941				MAY 23	2022	98	6							fiac051	10.1093/femsec/fiac051	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fiac051								35488869					WOS:000799452600003

Depositional and early diagenetic characteristics of modern saline pan deposits at the Bonneville Salt Flats, Utah, USA	SEDIMENTOLOGY												The Bonneville Salt Flats form a saline pan in western Utah, USA. This modern saline pan has a unique history of land-speed racing and potash mining. Multi-decadal measurements record decreasing evaporite volume and extent, spurring multiple environmental studies. The goal of this work is to describe saline pan evaporite morphologies within the context of environmental measurements. Environmental data include field observations, groundwater and dust trap samples, precipitation, albedo, time-lapse photography, groundwater level, and temperature measurements of air, groundwater and the shallow evaporite crust. Petrographic data include thick sections, evaporite slabs and sediments, and X-ray computed tomography of evaporites. Diverse halite morphologies are formed at the surface, vadose and phreatic zones. The presence and preservation of these morphologies are influenced by spatially heterogenous natural and anthropogenic processes, including daily to seasonal changes in brine salinity, mineral saturation states, and water level within and across saline pan stages. In addition to hydrological balances delineated by the saline pan stages of flooding, evapoconcentration and desiccation, changes in vertical brine movement, temperature and surficial sedimentary structures influence evaporite morphologies. These results are transferable to the interpretation of altered evaporites and enhancing saline pan depositional models.

Predictive Models for Determination of E. coli Concentrations at Inland Recreational Beaches	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Given the 24-h turn-around time before swimming advisories are released, advisories issued to protect public health really only indicates 'it may be unsafe to swim yesterday'. Predictive modelling for Escherichia coli concentrations at inflow-impacted beaches may be a favourable alternative to the current, routinely criticised monitoring approach. Using a total of 482 sets of meteorological and bacteriological data covering 14 swimming seasons, as well as environmental data of 10 inflow streams, this study developed models that could be used for predicting E. coli concentrations at five Lake Rotorua beaches. The models include predictor variables such as wind speed, antecedent rainfall, suspended solids at Puarenga, Utuhina and Ngongotaha stream inflows and particulate inorganic phosphorus concentration at Puarenga stream inflow. The combined 2011-2012 models had an average-adjusted R-2 of 0.73, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.33 logCFU/100 mL and captured 38% of the variance in the validation data when used to predict E. coli concentrations for an additional 2 years (2013-2014). Among the individual beach models, predictive accuracy ranged from 88.89 to 92.31 % for the three beaches considered in the study. The developed models can provide a faster estimation of E. coli condition, potentially assisting local beach managers in the decision process related to swimming advisories issuance.

Seasonal variation of malaria cases in children aged less than 5 years old following weather change in Zomba district, Malawi	MALARIA JOURNAL												Background: Malaria is seasonal and this may influence the number of children being treated as outpatients in hospitals. The objective of this study was to investigate the degree of seasonality in malaria in lakeshore and highland areas of Zomba district Malawi, and influence of climatic factors on incidence of malaria. Methods: Secondary data on malaria surveillance numbers and dates of treatment of children <5 years of age (n = 374,246) were extracted from the Zomba health information system for the period 2012-2016, while data on climatic variables from 2012 to 2015 were obtained from meteorological department. STATA version 13 was used to analyse data using non-linear time series correlation test to suggest a predictor model of malaria epidemic over explanatory variable (rainfall, temperature and humidity). Results: Malaria cases of children <5 years of age in Zomba district accounts for 45% of general morbidity. There was no difference in seasonality of malaria in highland compared to lakeshore in Zomba district. This study also found that an increase in average temperature and relative humidity was associated of malaria incidence in children <5 year of age in Zomba district. On the other hand, the difference of maximum and minimum temperature (diurnal temperature range), had a strong negative association (correlation coefficients of R-2 = 0.563 [All Zomba] beta = -1295.57 95% CI -1683.38 to -907.75 p value <0.001, R-2 = 0.395 [Zomba Highlands] beta = -137.74 95% CI -195.00 to -80.47 p value <0.001 and R-2 = 0.470 [Zomba Lakeshores] beta = -263.05 95% CI -357.47 to -168.63 p value <0.001) with malaria incidence of children <5 year in Zomba district, Malawi. Conclusion: The diminishing of malaria seasonality, regardless of strong rainfall seasonality, and marginal drop of malaria incidence in Zomba can be explained by weather variation. Implementation of seasonal chemoprevention of malaria in Zomba could be questionable due to reduced seasonality of malaria. The lower diurnal temperature range contributed to high malaria incidence and this must be further investigated.

J	Dripps, WR; Bradbury, KR				Dripps, W. R.; Bradbury, K. R.			The spatial and temporal variability of groundwater recharge in a forested basin in northern Wisconsin	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Recharge varies spatially and temporally as it depends on a wide variety of factors (e. g. vegetation, precipitation, climate, topography, geology, and soil type), making it one of the most difficult, complex, and uncertain hydrologic parameters to quantify. Despite its inherent variability, groundwater modellers, planners, and policy makers often ignore recharge variability and assume a single average recharge value for an entire watershed. Relatively few attempts have been made to quantify or incorporate spatial and temporal recharge variability into water resource planning or groundwater modelling efforts. In this study, a simple, daily soil-water balance model was developed and used to estimate the spatial and temporal distribution of groundwater recharge of the Trout Lake basin of northern Wisconsin for 1996-2000 as a means to quantify recharge variability. For the 5 years of study, annual recharge varied spatially by as much as 18 cm across the basin; vegetation was the predominant control on this variability. Recharge also varied temporally with a threefold annual difference over the 5-year period. Intra-annually, recharge was limited to a few isolated events each year and exhibited a distinct seasonal pattern. The results suggest that ignoring recharge variability may not only be inappropriate, but also, depending on the application, may invalidate model results and predictions for regional and local water budget calculations, water resource management, nutrient cycling, and contaminant transport studies. Recharge is spatially and temporally variable, and should be modelled as such.

Compared with circumpolar and temperate lakes, the responses of subtropical montane lakes to these external stressors have been less investigated. Here we present sedimentary multi-proxies records (i.e. chironomids, elements and stable isotope of carbon and nitrogen) in Pb-210-dated cores from two montane ponds (central China). Before the 1900s, low biomass and the dominance of opportunistic species (e.g. Chironomus anthracinus-type) in both ponds might be in response to cold and harsh condition. Thereafter, chironomid communities in both ponds experienced pronounced shifts. Nutrient-tolerant/warm-adapted species (e.g. Chironomus sp., Polypedilum nubeculosum-type and Endochironomus impar-type) proliferated and biomass increased synchronously after the 1900s, suggestive of favorable condition for chironomid growth. Redundancy analyses revealed that changes in chironomid communities in both ponds were significantly correlated with rising temperature and delta N-15 depletion. Prolonged growing season and nitrogen subsidy would increase primary productivity, and hence enhancing food availability for chironomids. Catchment-mediated indirect effects of warming and nitrogen deposition, such as hydrological changes and terrestrial organic matter inputs, would impose further influences on chironomid communities. Taken together, the combined effects of climate warming and nitrogen deposition have caused significant shifts in primary consumers of these montane ponds, and imposed cascading effects on structure and function of subtropical montane aquatic ecosystems.

Oral health and diet of a young Late Pleistocene woman from Quintana Roo, Mexico	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY												Objectives To increase understanding of the subsistence practices of the first Americans through analysis of the near-complete dentition of a young woman dating to the terminal Pleistocene of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Materials and Methods The skeleton is that of "Naia" a 15 to 17-year-old female from the submerged natural trap of Hoyo Negro found in association with remains of numerous extinct species of megafauna. Superbly preserved remains included the skull with 28 teeth, which are analyzed for evidence of caries, periodontal disease, wear patterns, and malocclusion. Results Naia exhibits a high frequency of dental caries, along with aggressive periodontal disease that threatened all her teeth, particularly her incisors. Dental attrition was extremely light for a hunter-gatherer, reaching to four on the Molnar scale on only one tooth. Lack of wear is associated with severe mandibular retrognathia, and low masticatory forces. Discussion Naia's dental condition is compared with that of other northern Paleoamericans, mostly females, dating before 11,000 cal BP. These exhibit a high degree of variability in both caries and tooth wear. All, however, exhibit rapid anterior wear owing to technological use of the front teeth. Naia exhibits the highest rate of caries, similar to that of the earliest South Americans, and one of the lowest rates of attrition. This demonstrates that she had a nonabrasive diet that was at least seasonally rich in carbohydrates. This does not mean her diet was low in meat, however, because similarly light dental attrition is seen in the Arch Lake female, a Paleoamerican from a big-game hunting society.

Carbon Dioxide Concentrations and Efflux from Permanent, Semi-Permanent, and Temporary Subalpine Ponds	WETLANDS												Small ponds account for a disproportionately high percentage of carbon dioxide emissions relative to their small surface area. It is therefore crucial to understand carbon flow in these ponds to refine the current global carbon budget, especially because climate change is affecting pond hydrology. High elevation ponds in the Elk Mountains of western Colorado are drying more frequently as the timing of snowmelt advances. We compared CO2 concentrations and fluxes among ponds of different hydroperiods over diel sampling periods during the course of the 2017 open-water period. CO2 concentrations were significantly negatively correlated with pond depth and averaged 77.6 +/- 24.5 mu mol L-1 (mean +/- S.E.) across all ponds and sampling events. Ponds were up to twenty times supersaturated in CO2 with respect to the atmosphere. Flux was highly variable within individual ponds but correlated with time of sampling and was highest at night. Flux averaged 19.7 +/- 18.8 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) across all ponds and sampling events. We also compared flux values obtained using modeled and empirical methods and found that widely-applied models of gas exchange rates using wind-based gas exchange (K) values yielded estimates of CO2 flux that were significantly higher than those obtained using the floating chamber approach, but estimates of CO2 flux using globally averaged convection-based K values were lower than those obtained using the floating chambers. Lastly, we integrated soil vs. water efflux measurements with long-term patterns in hydrology to predict how total season-long efflux might change under the more rapid drying regimes and longer seasons that are already occurring in these systems. Because soil CO2 efflux averaged 277.0 +/- 49.0 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1), temporary ponds emitted 674.1 +/- 99.4 kg CO2 m(-2) over the course of the 2017 season from ice-out to refreezing, which was over twice as much as permanent and semi-permanent ponds. Our results emphasize that contributions of CO2 from small ponds to the global carbon budget estimates will vary with pond hydroperiod and sampling methodology, which have been overlooked given that most previous estimates were collected from limited sampling periods and from pond waters alone. Furthermore, pond CO2 contributions are predicted to increase over time as pond areas transition from efflux from water to efflux from soil.

Four clone libraries were constructed from samples collected in two contrasting zones in the lake. Computerized statistic tools have suggested that sequence retrieval was representative of the in situ picoplankton diversity. The two sampling zones exhibited similar diversity patterns but shared only about 5% of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Phylogenetic analysis clustered our sequences into three taxonomic groups: Alveolates (30% of OTUs), Fungi (23%) and Cercozoa (19%). Fungi thus substantially contributed to the detected diversity, as was additionally supported by direct microscopic observations of fungal zoospores and sporangia. A large fraction of the sequences belonged to parasites, including Alveolate sequences affiliated to the genus Perkinsus known as zooparasites, and chytrids that include host-specific parasitic fungi of various freshwater phytoplankton species, primarily diatoms. Phylogenetic analysis revealed five novel clades that probably include typical freshwater environmental sequences. Overall, from the unsuspected fungal diversity unveiled, we think that fungal zooflagellates have been misidentified as phagotrophic nanoflagellates in previous studies. This is in agreement with a recent experimental demonstration that zoospore-producing fungi and parasitic activity may play an important role in aquatic food webs.					; Sime-Ngando, Télesphore/M-4134-2019; Carrias, Jean-François/AAT-2738-2021	Sime-Ngando, Telesphore/0000-0002-7240-5803; Viscogliosi, Eric/0000-0002-5805-7179; Carrias, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-6201-1544													1462-2912	1462-2920				JAN	2007	9	1					61	71		10.1111/j.1462-2920.2006.01111.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2006.01111.x								17227412					WOS:000243294900015

Sixteen species collected from 69 sites are new records for the study area. Seven of 16 species were found in their expected geographical distribution while two species (Ilyocypris bradyi, Psychrodromus olivaceus) showed different distribution (P < 0.05). Of which, P. olivaceus displayed a limited distribution in the northern region of the study area. Geographical distribution of some species and their co-occurrences varied among habitats. The mean values of three variables (water temperature, electrical conductivity, and elevation) were significantly different in northern region than the values of the sampling sites in the southern region (P < 0.01). Canonical Correspondence Analysis explained 72.5% of the significant relationship (P < 0.05) between species and four most effective environmental variables (water temperature, electrical conductivity, elevation, and magnesium). Heterocypris salina and Potamocypris fallax exhibited maximum and minimum tolerance (and optimum) values for electrical conductivity, respectively. Heavy metal presence on the carapace surfaces was investigated using Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDX) along with SEM photographing. The observation of metals such as copper, aluminum, silver and even radioactive element such as technetium on the carapace surfaces suggests that the organisms studied actually carry much more information about their aquatic environment than it was thought. Overall, our results support the findings of previous studies that water temperature and electrical conductivity were the two most effective factors on ostracod species and can be responsible for their distribution and occurrences in sampling area. 16 ostracods are new records for Giresun. Distribution and co-occurrences of some species varied among habitats. The means of water temperature, electrical conductivity, and elevation were different in the northern region than the south. CCA explained 72.5% of the relationship between species and four variables. Copper, aluminum, silver and technetium were found on the carapace.					; KÜLKÖYLÜOĞLU, OKAN/A-6441-2018; Akdemir, Derya/B-2635-2019	KULKOYLUOGLU, OKAN/0000-0003-4712-5612; Akdemir, Derya/0000-0003-1253-3376; Capraz, Cagatay/0000-0002-4015-603X; Yavuzatmaca, Mehmet/0000-0002-0398-6763; 														2823-1465				MAY 19	2022	58								3	10.1051/limn/2022002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2022002													WOS:000804087300001

Based on available measurements of methane emission and areal extent, seven types of aquatic systems are considered: streams and rivers, lakes, seasonally flooded forests, seasonally flooded savannas and other interfluvial wetlands, herbaceous plants on riverine floodplains, peatlands, and hydroelectric reservoirs. We evaluate the adequacy of sampling and of field methods plus atmospheric measurements, as applied to the Amazon basin, summarize published fluxes and regional estimates using bottom-up and top-down approaches, and discuss current understanding of biogeochemical and physical processes in Amazon aquatic environments and their incorporation into mechanistic and statistical models. Recommendations for further study in the Amazon basin and elsewhere include application of new remote sensing techniques, increased sampling frequency and duration, experimental studies to improve understanding of biogeochemical and physical processes, and development of models appropriate for hydrological and ecological conditions.					; Amaral, João Henrique/AAC-4315-2022; Zhou, Wencai/ABB-4141-2022; Guo, Mingyang/AAV-8580-2020; Wongchuig, Sly/MGW-7144-2025; Botía, Santiago/AAG-4970-2021; Basso, Luana/E-3290-2014	Guo, Mingyang/0000-0002-3087-453X; Fleischmann, Ayan/0000-0002-8547-4736; 														2296-665X				MAY 19	2022	10								866082	10.3389/fenvs.2022.866082	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.866082													WOS:000805627000001

Monitoring CDOM distribution and dynamics in small water is often limited by the coarse spatial resolution of traditional ocean color sensors. In this study, because of its high spatial resolution of 30 m, Landsat-8 data were used to assess seasonal variations of CDOM in the Saginaw River, by using an empirical statistic model. Pearson correlation analysis between CDOM variations and other environmental factors, such as temperature, discharge, and dissolved oxygen, shows that temperature was negatively correlated to CDOM variations and discharge played a positive role. We also calculated the monthly mean a(CDOM)(440) (the absorption coefficient of CDOM at 440 nm) for the Saginaw River between April and November from 2013 to 2016. This study demonstrates a good example for future applications in small waters: observing CDOM variations and other relevant environmental factors change by using Landsat remote sensing, so that we can know more about water quality and ecosystem health of small waters as well as the climate change impact on regional watersheds.

However, the Odiel Marshes are part of one of the most metal-polluted coastal estuaries in the world, which may pose risks to wildlife. We assessed the exposure of grebes to metal pollution during the critical moulting period in the Odiel Marshes and its potential to cause adverse health effects. Levels of metals in red blood pellet (as a biomarker of exposure), plasma carotenoids, eye redness, and body condition (as biomarkers of effects) were studied. Metal content was also analyzed in the brine shrimp Artemia parthenogenetica, the most important food for grebes in this hypersaline ecosystem during the moulting period. Results showed that, in comparison to toxicity thresholds, grebes had relatively high blood levels of arsenic (As), mercury (Hg) and zinc (Zn). The high loads found in Artemia and the way blood levels vary during the moulting period indicate that shrimp consumption may be the main route of metal exposure for grebes. Plasma carotenoids and body condition showed a positive association with exposure to As, while the relationship of lutein-like carotenoids with Hg accumulation was negative at the beginning of the moulting period to become positive afterwards. Moreover, eye redness was negatively affected by As accumulation. Factors including food resource availability, seasonal fluctuations in physiological status, and interannual variations in the degree of environmental contamination should be considered in monitoring efforts when using moult migrant waterbirds as sentinel species.

Investigating Abiotic Drivers for Vertical and Temporal Heterogeneities of Cyanobacteria Concentrations in Lakes Using a Seasonal In Situ Monitoring Station	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Harmful algal blooms (HAB) are ubiquitous ecological and public health hazards because they are composed of potentially toxic freshwater microorganisms called cyanobacteria. The abiotic drivers for toxic HAB are investigated using a research station deployed in a eutrophic lake in Minnesota in 2016. This research station provides full-depth water quality (hourly) and meteorological conditions monitoring (5min) at the sampling site. Water quality monitoring provides chemical, physical, and biological measurements, that is, phycocyanin concentration, a photosynthetic pigment distinct to cyanobacteria. The high cyanobacteria biovolume (BV) in the epilimnion observed in mid-July persisted until late September when it was distributed uniformly throughout the water column. A scaling relationship was developed among BV heterogeneity, thermal stratification stability, and surface water temperature. This relationship was verified in a dimictic lake the following year. The proposed scaling relationship is relevant to sampling protocols of HAB as it informs if the sample depth is representative of the entire water column. During the strongly stratified period, BV accumulated above the thermocline and in the photic zone, with distinct peaks forming occasionally both near the water surface and at locations with photosynthetically active radiation approximately equal to 10 E/m(2)s. Our observations suggest that the temporal/vertical variability of cyanobacteria BV is strongly influenced by lake dynamics, thermal structure, seasonal temperature variation, and light availability. These observations demonstrate that cyanobacteria tend to move and accumulate in specific warm water layers, confined by the thermocline and determined by well-defined light conditions.

Nevertheless several oxygenic phototrophs including some higher plants, mosses, lichens, various algal groups and cyanobacteria, survive that harsh climate and create the base of the trophic relationships in fragile ecosystems of polar environments. Ecosystems in polar regions are characterized by low primary productivity and slow growth rates, therefore they are more vulnerable to disturbance, than those in temperate regions. From this reason, chemical contaminants influencing the growth of photoautotrophic producers might induce serious disorders in the integrity of polar ecosystems. However, for a long time these areas were believed to be free of chemical contamination, and relatively protected from widespread anthropogenic pressure, due their remoteness and extreme climate conditions. Nowadays, there is a growing amount of data that prove that xenobiotics are transported thousands of kilometers by the air and ocean currents and then they are deposed in colder regions and accumulate in many environments, including the habitats of marine and freshwater cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria (blue green algae), as a natural part of phytoplankton assemblages, are globally distributed, but in high polar ecosystems they represent the dominant primary producers. These microorganisms are continuously exposed to various concentration levels of the compounds that are present in their habitats and act as nourishment or the factors influencing the growth and development of cyanobacteria in other way. The most common group of contaminants in Arctic and Antarctic are persistent organic pollutants (POPs), characterized by durability and resistance to degradation. It is important to determine their concentrations in all phytoplankton species cells and in their environment to get to know the possibility of contaminants to transfer to higher trophic levels, considering however that some strains of microalgae are capable of metabolizing xenobiotics, make them less toxic or even remove them from the environment.

However, researches on the relationships between nitrogen forms and nitrogen removal efficiency are very limited. Based on the fact that the nitrogen forms in the WWTP effluent may vary as the season changes, the nitrogen removal efficiencies of an integrated ecological floating bed (IEFB) was studied under different influent nitrogen forms. In addition, the effects of sediments in the system were also quantified during the experiment. Results showed that the total nitrogen (TN) removal rates of the IEFB were 25.61 +/- 5.72% and 60.03 +/- 7.00%, respectively, when the main influent nitrogen forms are nitrate and ammonia. The sediments in the system also played vital roles in the removal processes: when the sediments were covered with a polyethylene membrane, the total nitrogen (TN) removal rate of the system dropped from 27.86 +/- 5.53% to 14.78 +/- 4.97%, and the total phosphorus (TP), from 58.77 +/- 6.20% to 33.51 +/- 25.52%.					zhou, yuwei/KHD-4127-2024; He, Shun/AAC-1480-2019	He, Shengbing/0000-0002-0753-4860; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				JUL	2018	25	19					18793	18801		10.1007/s11356-018-2111-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-2111-2								29713975					WOS:000437264700054

However, in unproductive northern lakes, where anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition is low, N instead of P can limit primary producers. In addition, light can be limiting to primary producers at high concentrations of coloured dissolved organic matter (cDOM), as cDOM is the major determinant of light penetration in these lakes. To address resource limitation of epilithic algal biomass, we repeatedly sampled epilithon (periphyton on stony substrata) in 20 lakes covering a large, correlated cDOM and N-deposition gradient across boreal and subarctic Sweden. Across these lakes, pelagic total N (TN) and total P (TP) were positively correlated, and benthic light supply was negatively correlated, with cDOM. Microscopically determined algal biovolume and epilithic carbon (C), N and P were subsequently regressed against benthic light supply and pelagic TN and TP. Patterns in epilithic biovolume were driven by N-2-fixing cyanobacteria, which accounted for 2%-90% of total epilithic biovolume. Averaged over the growing season, epilithic algal biovolume, C and N were negatively related to TP and positively to TN, and were highest in the clearest, most phosphorus-poor lakes, where epilithon was heavily dominated by potentially N-2-fixing cyanobacteria. A structural equationmodel supports the hypothesis that cDOM had two counteracting effects on total epilithic algal biovolume: a positive one by providing N to algae that depend on dissolved N for growth, and a negative one by shading N-2-fixing cyanobacteria, with the negative effect being somewhat stronger. Together, these findings suggest that (1) light and N are the main resources limiting epilithic algal biomass in boreal to subarctic Swedish lakes, (2) epilithic cyanobacteria are more competitive in high-light and low-nitrogen environments, where their N-2-fixing ability allows them to reach high biomass, and (3) epilithic N increases with N-2 fixer biomass and isseemingly paradoxicallyhighest in the most oligotrophic lakes.

The antiquity and spatial distribution of Larix in many of these records suggest that full-glacial landscapes probably had a small but important tree component. The Tschuch'ye record further indicates the absence of a Younger Dryas climatic reversal and is in accord with the preponderance of other data from western Beringia, which indicate warmer than present climates between c.12900 and 9100 cal. a BP. The subsequent spread of Pinus pumila, which has similar temperature requirements as Larix, denotes a shift to wetter but still warm climates during the middle Holocene, with palynological data suggesting optimal conditions in far western areas of western Beringia c.7000-5000 cal. a BP. The postglacial occurrence of relatively warm/dry and warm/wet intervals is consistent with results of a regional climate-model simulation that indicates warmer than present temperatures and decreased effective moisture at 11000 cal. a BP and persistence of warm conditions but with greater moisture and longer growing season at 6000 cal. a BP.

A total of 16 lagoons were sampled, 4 in the Rimac river basin and 12 in the Mantaro basin during the dry season (June-October 2015). We determined 34 families Phylum Arthropoda obtained the highest relative richness and relative abundance of organisms (72.3% and 89.1%, respectively), followed by Phylum Annelida (12.8% and 4.3%, respectively), Mollusca (6.4% and 5.4%, respectively) and Platyhelminthes (8.5% and 1.2%, respectively). Of the 34 families, the Insecta Class predominated with 24 families distributed in 6 orders, within which the order Diptera was more representative with 7 families, followed by the Coleoptera Order with 5 families. The analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) showed that at a spatial level there are significant differences between the studied lagoons (R = 0.4845 and p = 0.0001). The Percentage Similarity Analysis (SIMPER) found dissimilarities at spatial and temporal level, where the families Corixidae (Hemiptera), Chironomidae (Diptera) and Hyalellidae (Amphipoda) are the ones that influence the structure of the community The Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) reported a higher correlation of insects, bivalves, gastropods and oligochaetes with respect to high values of conductivity, pH, temperature and dissolved oxygen. (Past version 2.17, p = 0.0001). Of the total variance, the abundance of taxa was due to the first 2 axes, the species-environmental correlations were of 53.86% for the first and 29.91% for the second axis respectively, explaining an environmental species relationship of 83.78%. The non-parametric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) analysis obtained a stress of 2D = 0.12, showing that the Canchis and Churuca lagoons tend to be separated from the rest. The families Chironomidae, Cyprididae, Corixidae and Hyalellidae were resistant to environmental conditions altered by organic matter and heavy metals. According to the ABI values of the 16 lagoons sampled, the lagoons Marca, Huaroncocha, Ticticocha, Yananyacu and Huacracocha presented the highest value, considered moderate ecological status, while the Huascocha, Canchis and Churuca lakes were considered to be in poor condition, and the remaining nine as bad.

The site is located in the Republican River basin in south-central Nebraska, where decreases in streamflow have been observed in recent decades. In an effort to reduce consumptive water use from evapotranspiration (ET), and thereby reclaim surface water, invasive species such as Phragmites australis have been removed throughout the riparian corridor of the river basin. In this study, we used energy/water balance monitoring stations, a Large Aperture Scintillometer (LAS), and numerous water and soil temperature probes to determine the energy and water balance during the 2009 growing season (April 11-October 3). Sensible heat flux was measured using the LAS, while ET was calculated as a residual of the energy balance (i.e., net radiation minus sensible heat flux and heat storage rates in the canopy, water, and soil). Rigorous quality control and uncertainty analyses were performed, and comparisons were also made with ET rates calculated via the simpler Priestley-Taylor method. Results of the energy budget analysis indicate that the average ET rate for the wetland during the growing season was 4.4 mm day(-1), with a maximum daily rate of 8.2 mm day(-1) (occurring on June 29). Precipitation during the same 176-day period averaged 2.7 mm day(-1). Net radiation and vegetation phenology were found to be the two largest drivers of seasonal variability in ET. Sensible heat flux was significantly larger than latent heat flux early in the season, when standing vegetation in the wetland was still dry and brown. By late May and early June, however, Bowen ratios had declined well below 0.5 in response to greener and more abundant vegetation, higher transpiration rates, and reduced sensible heat flux. Heat storage rates in the wetland were dominated by changes in water temperature (as compared to soil or canopy heat storage) and comprised a significant portion of the hourly energy balance. On daily mean timescales, changes in the rate of heat storage corresponded to similar to 13% of the variability in net radiation, while for the season-long average, the heat storage term was found'to be essentially negligible. The Priestley-Taylor equation provided a reasonable estimate of ET during the height of the growing season but significantly overestimated ET during the beginning of the season (since it could not account for large sensible heat fluxes from the dry vegetation). Analysis of the wetland water balance showed seasonal variations in water level that were similar to changes in cumulative water inputs (i.e., precipitation minus ET). Portions of the season when the two curves had differing rates of change indicated periods of net water influx or outflux from other sources (primarily groundwater). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Most of the inferences using temporal information have been derived from a malaria incidence time series from Kericho. Here, we report a detailed analysis of 5 monthly time series, between 15 and 41 years long, from West Kenya encompassing an altitudinal gradient along Lake Victoria basin. We found decreasing, but heterogeneous, malaria trends since the late 1980s at low altitudes (<1600 m), and the early 2000s at high altitudes (>1600 m). Regime shifts were present in 3 of the series and were synchronous in the 2 time series from high altitudes. At low altitude, regime shifts were associated with a shift from increasing to decreasing malaria transmission, as well as a decrease in variability. At higher altitudes, regime shifts reflected an increase in malaria transmission variability. The heterogeneity in malaria trends probably reflects the multitude of factors that can drive malaria transmission and highlights the need for both spatially and temporally fine-grained data to make sound inferences about the impacts of climate change and control/elimination interventions on malaria transmission.					; Chaves, Luis Fernando/F-3448-2010; Satake, Akiko/A-5895-2013; Chaves, Luis/F-3448-2010	Hashizume, Masahiro/0000-0003-4720-1750; Chaves, Luis Fernando/0000-0002-5301-2764; , Noboru/0000-0003-3664-9605; 													0031-1820	1469-8161				JAN	2012	139	1					14	25		10.1017/S0031182011001685	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0031182011001685								21996447					WOS:000299580900002

Coxiella striata (gastropod), Elphidium sp. (foraminifera). Daphniopsis sp. ephippia (Cladocera), and brine shrimp (Parartemia zietziana) faecal pellets, the 8180 of ostracods, and >130 pm quartz sand counts. The chronology is based on optically stimulated luminescence and calibrated radiocarbon ages. Relatively wet conditions are marked by lower salinities between 9600 yr and 5700 yr ago, but mutually exclusive high- and low-salinity ostracod communities suggest substantial variability in effective precipitation in the early Holocene. A drier climate was firmly in place by 4500 yr and is marked at the groundwater-dominated NW Jacka Lake by an increase in aeolian quartz and, at Jacka Lake, by a switch from surfacewater to groundwater dominance. Short-lived, low-salinity events at 8800, 7200, 5900, 480(1, 2400, 1300 and 400 yr are similar in timing and number to those recorded on Australia's southern continental shelf, and globally, and provide evidence for the existence of the -1500-yr cycle in mainland southern Australia. We surmise that these are cool events associated with periodic equatorward shifts in the westerly wind circulation. (C) 2011 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The dam was built between 1981 and 1988 north of the village of Eski Mosul, submerging the course of the Tigris River for c. 100 km. The analysis of historical images derived from declassified Corona satellite imagery acquired between December 1967 and August 1968 reveals the pristine pattern of the Tigris River, including the seasonal changes of its riverbed, shifting across the hydrological year from meandering to anastomosing patterns. Geomorphological mapping based on Corona images allowed us to estimate the seasonal modification of fluvial elements such as the floodplain and point, middle and longitudinal bars. The comparison with Landsat data collected since the 1990s showed the first phases of the basin filling and the control on the present-day aspect of the lake inherited from the setting of the Tigris channel belt and, more in general, the litho-structural control over the evolution of the local hydrographic network; we also document the influence of the original Tigris River course on its recent insertion into the lake. Our work allowed reconstruction of the ancient fluvial landscape below the Mosul Dam Lake and the evolution of its riverscape controlled by litho-structural factors and seasonal variations of the river discharge. Finally, this contribution highlights the relevance of declassified intelligence satellite imagery in interpreting natural geomorphic processes and landforms, today altered by human agency.

As a result, rather than making local decisions based on findings from national-scale studies, the study area's research gap of local level climate variability and trend was investigated within the endorheic Lake Hayk basin for the historic series from 1986 to 2015 to scientifically show climate change/variability implications on Lake Hayk water level variations. To achieve the study objective, the precipitation, temperature (station and ERA5 reanalysis product) and Lake water level (patchy lake level fused with remotely sensed water areas) were examined using various statistical approaches with the integration of remote sensing and geographical information system. The major findings revealed less variable (CV = 16.66%) and statistically nonsignificant declining trends (- 33.94 mm/decade) in annual precipitation. Belg and bega seasonal precipitations showed highly variable (CV = 43.94-47.46%) nonsignificant downward trends of 4.57 mm and 22 mm per decade respectively, whereas kiremt precipitation showed moderate variability (CV = 23.80%) and increased nonsignificantly at a rate of 21.89 mm per decade. Annual and seasonal mean temperatures exhibited less variable but statistically significant rising trends ranging from 0.20 to 0.45 degrees C each decade. The lake's water level showed less variable nonsignificant rising trends (70 mm to 120 mm per year) on annual and seasonal scales between 1999 and 2005. The lake's surface area has decreased from 2243.33 ha in 2005 to 2165.33 ha in 2011. During 2011-2015, it demonstrated a high variable (CV > 30%) statistically significant dropping trend ranging from - 250 mm to - 340 mm per year on annual and seasonal periods. The study discovered that the endorheic lake Hayk basin was dominated by variable and diminishing precipitation, as well as continuous warming trends, particularly in recent years. It is argued that this climatic state was having a negative impact on Lake Hayk's substantially dropping water level, necessitating an immediate basin-based water management decision to save Lake Hayk from extinction.

J	González-Gajardo, A; Sepúlveda, PV; Schlatter, R				Gonzalez-Gajardo, Angelica; Victoriano Sepulveda, Pedro; Schlatter, Roberto			Waterbird Assemblages and Habitat Characteristics in Wetlands: Influence of Temporal Variability on Species-Habitat Relationships	WATERBIRDS												Patterns of spatial and temporal variation in species richness, abundance and diversity were evaluated in eight wetlands in Central-South Chile in relation to nine wetland characteristics. Twenty-six bird species were recorded, among the most representative families were Rallidae, Ardeidae and Anatidae with five species each. Step-wise regression analyses identified wetland area and water level fluctuations as the most important variables determining bird abundance. Variations in species richness were explained by wetland area, shoreline length, vegetation cover and water-level fluctuations. Shoreline development, shoreline length and wetland area lower than one-teeter depth were especially important in determining species diversity. Cluster analyses showed similar results. Shoreline length was an important feature influencing total species number, but simple regression analysis showed that the species area relationship occurs in wetlands too. This study concludes that species richness, bird abundance and diversity reach higher values in larger and structurally more heterogeneous wetlands, but with important seasonal dynamics in waterbirds. The relationships between habitat characteristics and community structure did not remain unchanged throughout the year, suggesting that the birds respond differently to one or another habitat characteristic depending on the season. These results show the need for wetland conservation in Chile, paying special attention to the largest and most heterogeneous wetlands to conserve the greatest species richness and bird abundance.

In this study, the distribution of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in reservoir sediments and their pollution assessments were elucidated at different water periods. The average TN (total nitrogen), TP (total phosphorus), and TOM (total organic matter) contents were 794.8 mg/kg, 807.2 mg/kg, and 8.7% in the nonflood season, respectively. When the time comes to flood season, with the large amount of nitrogen pollution inputted from peripheral nonpoint sources and phosphorus released by the accelerated exchange of water bodies, the average TN concentration increased to 1061.2 mg/kg. In addition, the average TP and TOM contents were reduced to 559.5 mg/kg and 6.3%. Nutrient pollution fluctuated between the safe and lowest level. Reservoir eutrophication risk was low. There was a certain nitrogen enrichment in the Danjiangkou Reservoir, and the flood season was the main period of nitrogen pollution input. Water exchange during flood season might accelerate organic matter degradation. Near the dam, sediment organic matter content increased significantly, reaching severe pollution levels. The results of the simulated sediment nutrient release test showed that the nitrogen and phosphorus in the reservoir would release slowly. Moreover, their annual release flux was calculated as 470.4 t and 87.9 t, respectively. It illustrated that the internal pollution of Danjiangkou Reservoir was light, and the release amount was small, so it was not the main pollution source of the reservoir at present.					董, 磊/AAH-4211-2020; Zhang, Yucheng/HGD-8351-2022	Pan, Xiong/0000-0002-7920-4377; Dong, Lei/0000-0001-7877-8937														2073-4441				AUG	2023	15	16							2885	10.3390/w15162885	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15162885													WOS:001055329500001

Knowledge of Spawning Phenology may Enhance Selective Barrier Passage for Wetland Fishes	WETLANDS												Within the Laurentian Great Lakes, many native fishes use wetlands for spawning; however, these areas are also used by non-native common carp (Cyprinus carpio) that may impart negative ecological impacts. There is interest in managing common carp using physical barriers to decrease passage to specific habitats (e.g., their spawning sites), but these barriers could also exclude native wetland spawners such as largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and northern pike (Esox lucius). Our objective was to determine if differences in spawning movements could be exploited in shallow areas to operate seasonal barriers that are opened and closed to promote selective fragmentation. Using a long-term dataset from the Cootes Paradise Marsh Fishway (Hamilton, Ontario), we generated predictive models for spawning movements based on cumulative growing degree day (CGDD) for all three fishes. These models successfully predicted earlier arrival by all species in a warmer year and delayed spawning movements during a cold year, highlighting the role of temperature as a driver of interannual variation in spawning movements. We then compared the Fishway model predictions to spawning movements within nearby Toronto Harbour, which were derived from acoustic telemetry data. We found that the model outputs were correlated with movements of all three species, but performance was weakest for northern pike. Resource managers could use these predictive models to assist in the operation of seasonal barriers to decrease access of common carp to spawning sites, while maximizing passage to native fishes.					; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010	Piczak, Morgan/0000-0002-0816-3221; Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659													0277-5212	1943-6246				AUG	2023	43	6							72	10.1007/s13157-023-01723-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-023-01723-1													WOS:001049770000001

In order to find out whether there is a relationship between the proportion of genes encoding toxic peptide synthesis and population density of Planktothrix spp. we compared the proportion of three gene regions that are indicative of the synthesis of the toxic heptapeptide microcystin (mcyB), and the bioactive peptides aeruginoside (aerB) and anabaenopeptin (apnC) in samples from 23 lakes of five European countries (n=153). The mcyB, aerB, and apnC genes occurred in 99%, 99%, and 97% of the samples, respectively, and on average comprised 60 +/- 3%, 22 +/- 2%, and 54 +/- 4% of the total population, respectively. Although the populations differed widely in abundance (10-3-103 mm3 L-1) no dependence of the proportion of the mcyB, aerB, and apnC genes on the density of the total population was found. In contrast populations differed significantly in their average mcyB, aerB, and apnC gene proportions, with no change between prebloom and bloom conditions. These results emphasize stable population-specific differences in mcyB, aerB, and apnC proportions that are independent from seasonal influences.

The ETM+ images were acquired in May, June, and September 2002 and were corrected for atmospheric disturbance using the simplified method of atmospheric correction (SMAC) model. The in situ measurements consisted of water sampling in the largest lake of the region, routine monitoring results for the whole study area, and Z(SD) observations made by volunteers. The ranges of the water quality variables in the dataset were as follows: turbidity, 0.6-25 FNU; absorption coefficient of CDOM at 400 nm, 1.0-12.2 m(-1); Z(SD), 0.5-5.5 m; and chlorophyll a concentration, 2.4-80 mu g L(-1). The estimation accuracies of the image-specific empirical algorithms expressed as relative errors were 23.0% for turbidity, 17.4% for CDOM, and 21.1% for Z(SD). If concurrent in situ measurements had not been used for algorithm training, the average error would have been about 37%. The atmospheric correction improved the estimation accuracy only slightly compared with the use of top-of-atmospheric reflectances. The accuracy of the water quality estimates without concurrent in situ measurements could have been improved if in-image atmospheric parameters had been available. The underwater reflectance simulations of the ETM+ channel wavelengths using water quality typical for Finnish lakes (data from 1113 lakes) indicated that region-specific algorithms may be needed in other parts of the country, particularly in the case of Z(SD). Despite the limitations in the spectral and radiometric resolutions, ETM+ imagery can be an effective aid, particularly in the monitoring and management of small lakes (< 1 km(2)), which are often not included in routine monitoring programs.

However, our understanding of the corresponding C sequestration capacity and driving mechanisms associated with each individual phytoplankton taxonomic group is limited. Particularly in the hydrologically dynamic system with highly complex surface hydrological processes (floodplain lake systems). Through investigating seasonal monitoring data in a typical floodplain lake system and estimation of primary productivity of each phytoplankton taxonomic group individually using novel equations, this study proposed a phytoplankton C fixation model. Results showed that dominant phytoplankton communities had a higher gross carbon sequestration potential (CSP) (9.50 +/- 5.06 Gg C each stage) and gross primary productivity (GPP) (65.46 +/- 25.32 mg C m(-2) d(-1)), but a lower net CSP (-1.04 +/- 0.79 Gg C each stage) and net primary productivity (NPP) (-5.62 +/- 4.93 mg C m(-3) d(-1)) than rare phytoplankton communities in a floodplain lake system. Phytoplanktonic GPP was high (317.94 +/- 73.28 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) during the rainy season and low (63.02 +/- 9.65 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) during the dry season. However, their NPP reached the highest during the rising-water stage and the lowest during the receding-water stage. Findings also revealed that during the rainy season, high water levels (p = 0.56**) and temperatures (p = 0.37*) as well as strong solar radiation (p = 0.36*) will increase photosynthesis and accelerate metabolism and respiration of dominant phytoplankton communities, then affect primary productivity and CSP. Additionally, water level fluctuations drive changes in nutrients (p = -0.57*) and metals (p = -0.68*) concentrations, resulting in excessive nutrients and metals slowing down phytoplankton growth and reducing GPP. Compared with the static water lake system, the floodplain lake system with a lower net CSP became a heterotrophic C source.					wang, jing/GVT-8700-2022; Jia, Junjie/AAQ-2527-2020; Shi, Kun/O-2638-2013; GAO, Yang/HMO-8142-2023														0269-7491	1873-6424				AUG 1	2022	306								119411	10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119411	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119411		MAY 2022						35525519					WOS:000860792700005

A comparison of the sensitivities of Daphnia magna and Daphnia pulex to six different cyanobacteria	HARMFUL ALGAE												Cyanobacteria have become an important environmental concern due to their ability to produce a wide range of natural toxins. At present, very few studies describe concentration response curves for cyanobacteria other than Microcystis. However, field evidence highlights that both cyanobacterial concentration as well as cyanobacterial species composition vary considerably with season and year. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different cyanobacteria at various concentrations of these cyanobacteria in the diet on the reproduction of Daphnia pulex and Daphnia magna. Those two species were chosen to assess whether the cyanobacteria-daphnid dynamics could be generalized for the Daphnia genus. Results demonstrated that both slope and EC50 of the concentration response curves depend upon the Daphnia species, the cyanobacteria species and the potential interaction between the two. This has two major consequences. First, the differences in sensitivity to cyanobacteria between D. magna and D. pulex depend upon concentration of the specific cyanobacteria. Second, we noted different mechanisms of toxicity for the two zooplankton species, a more general mechanism of toxicity for D. pulex and a more specific one for D. magna. Our data therefore suggest that results of studies investigating effects of cyanobacteria at different concentrations cannot be generalized across species. Furthermore, mechanisms of toxicity are not only cyanobacteria specific, but also dependent on the exposed species, even for rather closely related species such as in the Daphnia genus. Whenever possible, we therefore propose to combine a multi-species approach together with a full concentration response analysis to reach more general conclusions concerning the effects of cyanobacteria on zooplankton.

With global warming, supraglacial lakes may become more extensive on ice sheet surfaces than they currently are. Therefore, accurate estimation of the volume of supraglacial lakes is important for characterizing their impact on ice sheets. In this study, we present a machine learning-based method for estimating the depth of supraglacial lakes through the combination of ICESat-2 ATL03 data with multispectral imagery. We tested this method via Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery and evaluated the accuracy of the algorithm on 7 test lakes on the Greenland Ice Sheet. Our results show that machine learning-based algorithms achieve better accuracy than traditional regression or physics-based methods do, especially for deeper lakes. The best accuracy was achieved when extreme gradient boosting was applied to a Sentinel-2 L1C image, with root mean square error, mean absolute error, and median absolute error values of 0.54 m, 0.43 m, and 0.36 m, respectively. Furthermore, we evaluated the effects of atmospheric corrections of multispectral imagery in the retrieval of supraglacial lake depth. On the basis of our results, we recommend the direct use of top-of-atmosphere reflectance products in mapping supraglacial lake bathymetry because of the low performance of atmospheric corrections for water and snow/ice in both the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 datasets. This study is expected to provide a more efficient method for estimating the depth of supraglacial lakes and laying the foundation for accurately quantifying meltwater volumes over large surface areas in subsequent studies.

Qinghai Lake is experiencing amplified warming under climate change. Based on the MODIS imagery, the spatio-temporal dynamics of the ice phenology of Qinghai Lake were analyzed using machine learning during the 2000/2001 to 2019/2020 ice season, and cloud gap-filling procedures were applied to reconstruct the result. The results showed that the overall accuracy of the water-ice classification by random forest and cloud gap-filling procedures was 98.36% and 92.56%, respectively. The annual spatial distribution of the freeze-up and break-up dates ranged primarily from DOY 330 to 397 and from DOY 70 to 116. Meanwhile, the decrease rates of freeze-up duration (DFU), full ice cover duration (DFI), and ice cover duration (DI) were 0.37, 0.34, and 0.13 days/yr., respectively, and the duration was shortened by 7.4, 6.8, and 2.6 days over the past 20 years. The increased rate of break-up duration (DBU) was 0.58 days/yr. and the duration was lengthened by 11.6 days. Furthermore, the increase in temperature resulted in an increase in precipitation after two years; the increase in precipitation resulted in the increase in DBU and decrease in DFU in corresponding years, and decreased DI and DFI after one year.					; HUANG, CHUNLIN/G-6715-2011; Han, Weixiao/GXI-0039-2022	ying, zhang/0000-0002-1654-4112; HUANG, CHUNLIN/0000-0002-1366-5170; Han, Weixiao/0000-0001-7594-3159; 														2072-4292				MAY	2021	13	9							1695	10.3390/rs13091695	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13091695													WOS:000650737800001

Response of methylmercury, total mercury, iron and manganese to oxygenation of an anoxic hypolimnion in North Twin Lake, Washington	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												This study evaluated the impact of oxygenation on the accumulation of methylmercury (MeHg), total mercury (Hg), iron (Fe), and manganese (Mn) in the anoxic hypolimnion of North Twin Lake, Washington (mean depth = 9.7m). Within 8hours of the start of the oxygenation test, mean hypolimnetic total Fe dropped from 833 to 243 mu g/L (58% dissolved), and Mn decreased from 119 to 32 mu g/L (100% dissolved). After 17days of oxygenation, mean hypolimnetic total Hg decreased from 0.77 to 0.58ng/L, and MeHg decreased from 0.20 to 0.10ng/L. A month after the end of the oxygenation test, MeHg, total Hg, Fe, and Mn concentrations rebounded to pre-oxygenation levels. Metal dynamics were explained by the differing redox characteristics of Fe (fast oxidation kinetics; reduction at lower redox potential) and Mn (slow oxidation kinetics; reduction at higher redox potential) in natural waters, and the tendency for Fe oxides to co-precipitate with reduced Mn, ionic Hg, and MeHg. From a lake management perspective, the study highlights the role that oxidized metals in surfacial sediments play in retaining Hg in profundal sediments and suggests that sorption characteristics of metal oxides could be exploited to manage Hg bioaccumulation in aquatic biota. The study also suggests that for oxygenation to effectively repress the accumulation of redox-sensitive compounds in the hypolimnion, oxygenation systems should (1) start before anoxic conditions are established; (2) operate continuously through the entire stratified season; and (3) maintain oxygen levels at the sediment-water interface to ensure oxygen penetration into surfacial sediments.

J	Williams, MW; Knauf, M; Caine, N; Liu, F; Verplanck, PL				Williams, MW; Knauf, M; Caine, N; Liu, F; Verplanck, PL			Geochemistry and source waters of rock glacier outflow, Colorado Front Range	PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES												We characterize the seasonal variation in the geochemical and isotopic content of the outflow of the Green Lake 5 rock glacier (RG5), located in the Green Lakes Valley of the Colorado Front Range, USA. Between June and August, the geochemical content of rock glacier outflow does not appear to differ substantially from that of other surface waters in the Green Lakes Valley. Thus, for this alpine ecosystem at this time of year there does not appear to be large differences in water quality among rock glacier outflow, glacier and blockslope discharge, and discharge from small alpine catchments. However, in September concentrations of Mg2+ in the outflow of the rock glacier increased to more than 900 mu eq L-1 compared to values of less than 40 mu eq L-1 at all the other sites, concentrations of Ca2+ were greater than 4,000 mu eq L-1 compared to maximum values of less than 200 mu eq L-1 at all other sites, and concentrations of SO42- reached 7,000 mu eq L-1, compared to maximum concentrations below 120 mu eq L-1 at the other sites. Inverse geochemical modelling suggests that dissolution of pyrite, epidote, chlorite and minor calcite as well as the precipitation of silica and goethite best explain these elevated concentrations of solutes in the outflow of the rock glacier. Three component hydrograph separation using end-member mixing analysis shows that melted snow comprised an average of 30% of RG5 outflow, soil water 32%, and base flow 38%. Snow was the dominant source water in June, soil water was the dominant water source in July, and base flow was the dominant source in September. Enrichment of 6180 from -10 parts per thousand in the outflow of the rock glacier compared to -20 parts per thousand. in snow and enrichment of deuterium excess from + 17.5 parts per thousand. in rock glacier outflow compared to +11 parts per thousand in snow, suggests that melt of internal ice that had undergone multiple melt/freeze episodes was the dominant source of base flow.

J	Vilizzi, L; Tarkan, AS				Vilizzi, Lorenzo; Tarkan, Ali Serhan			Bioaccumulation of metals in common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) from water bodies of Anatolia (Turkey): a review with implications for fisheries and human food consumption	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Although fish is widely consumed by humans for its nutritional properties, accumulation of heavy metals can pose serious health hazards. Widespread common carp Cyprinus carpio is cultured worldwide and represents an economically important species for fisheries in several countries. These include Turkey, where C. carpio often makes for a large part of the sales of the locally marketed fish and also for a traditional dish. This study provides a review of bioaccumulation of metals in tissues of C. carpio from water bodies of Anatolia and also includes reference to worldwide studies. From 42 water bodies across the region, 27 metals in total were studied, of which Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn were the most widely analysed, mainly in the muscle, liver and gill tissues. Amongst the potentially toxic metals, Cd, Cr and Pb occurred in several water bodies at concentrations not only above maximum allowed limits but also higher relative to other water bodies worldwide, even though As, Hg and Ni were also sometimes present at potentially hazardous concentrations. The essential metals Cu, Fe, Mn. Se and Zn were detected at various concentrations, with the latter two occasionally above limit. All water bodies flagged as having especially critical (i.e. above limit) concentrations of toxic metals supported C carpio fisheries from highly populated regions, raising concern about food safety and calling for preventative measures. Given the significantly lower bioaccumulation levels in the muscle relative to the liver and gill tissues, it is suggested that consumption of C. carpio as fillets may be safer than after processing into e.g. meat balls and sausages. The limits of 1,0 gig for Cr and 1.15 gig for Se, currently lacking from the Turkish food safety legislation, are proposed, and it is suggested that a similar meta analytical approach as adopted in this study may benefit other countries where C. carpio represents an important fisheries resource.

A long-term study on crustacean plankton of a shallow tropical lake: the role of invertebrate predation	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The primary factor that governs the size and species composition of zooplankton is still a controversial issue and temperature is considered the main factor responsible for latitudinal differences. In waters with a narrow temperature range, such as in the tropics, predation may be a more important factor. Nearly three decades of intermittent studies of the crustacean plankton in a shallow tropical lake revealed that the main event that led to their restructuring was the appearance of a second predator, the water mite Krendowskia sp. The new predator and larvae of the dipteran Chaoborus brasiliensis Theobald exerted a combined, although asymmetrical effect on microcrustaceans. The period when the mite was detected was followed by the restructuring of the crustacean plankton community. Predation by these two invertebrates emerged as the factor responsible for community changes, involving an increased contribution of copepods and decreases in the relative abundance of smaller cladoceran species. In the short term, the mite caused a decrease in species richness and the annual mean instantaneous composition of cladocerans, a predominance of large-sized species (Daphnia ambigua Scourfield and Daphnia gessneri Herbst) and the virtual disappearance of small species (e. g., Bosmina tubicen Brehm). The long-term impact resulted in increased species richness and the dominance of large and medium-sized cladocerans, such as D. gessneri and Ceriodaphnia richardi Sars. The larger body size of three cladocerans, the two Daphnia species and B. tubicen, in the long term, may be a response to the dominant predator, Chaoborus. The seasonal variation in the predator abundance, mainly Chaoborus larvae, allowed the prey to recover during the cool season. The copepods Tropocyclops prasinus meridionalis (Fischer) and Thermocyclops decipiens Kiefer were less affected by predation than the cladocerans; their contribution to the crustacean plankton increased 12-28% after the mite appeared. The top-down effect on crustacean plankton did not affect the phytoplankton, which remained dominated by chlorophyceans and the nanoplankton fraction before and after the zooplankton community restructuring.

Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) were applied to evaluate spatial and temporal variation of water quality in Rio Tercero Reservoir (Argentina). Six sampling sites were surveyed each climatic season for 21 parameters during 2003-2010. The results revealed that PCA showed the existence of four significant principal components (PCs) which account for 96.7% of the total variance of the data set. The first PC was assigned to mineralization whereas the other PCs were built from variables indicative of pollution. Hierarchical CA grouped the six monitoring sites into three clusters and classified the different climatic seasons into two clusters based on similarities in water quality characteristics.

Long-term drivers of change in Polylepis woodland distribution in the central Andes	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question Is the modern patchy distribution of highly biodiverse Polylepis woodlands a consequence of human activity or natural fluctuations in environmental conditions? What are the consequences of changing climate for the tree genus Polylepis? Location High central tropical Andes. Methods We characterized the ecological baseline conditions for Polylepis woodlands over the last ca. 370 000 years through: (i) examination of fossil pollen records (Salar de Uyuni and Lake Titicaca) and (ii) a review of autecological information concerning Polylepis. Results Fossil pollen data revealed fluctuations in the abundance (ca. 0-34%) of Polylepis pollen before the arrival of humans in South America (> 12 000 years ago), indicating that Polylepis did not form permanent continuous woodland before the arrival of humans and that climatic factors can drive rapid vegetation change. Autecological assessment of Polylepis revealed: (i) negative moisture balance, (ii) fire, (iii) waterlogging, and (iv) cloud cover to be critical in determining the niche space available for Polylepis. Conclusions Polylepis niche space in the central Andes was at a maximum during warm and wet conditions in the past, but might be at a minimum during the warmer and drier than modern conditions predicted for later this century. The sensitivity to past global climate change emphasizes the need for conservation planners to consider model predictions of a warmer central Andes in the coming decades when developing planting schemes. Natural fluctuations in woodland abundance suggest the most effective way for conservation efforts to "mimic" the natural baseline would be to develop a reproductively connected patchwork of communities.					; Gosling, William/D-2459-2009; Valencia, Bryan/AEZ-1756-2022	, Jennifer Anne Hanselman/0009-0000-9158-8222; Gosling, William/0000-0001-9903-8401; Valencia Castillo, Bryan/0000-0002-5970-4964; Bush, Mark/0000-0001-6894-8613													1100-9233	1654-1103				DEC	2009	20	6					1041	1052		10.1111/j.1654-1103.2009.01102.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1654-1103.2009.01102.x													WOS:000271189200007

In this study, multivariate statistical analysis and spatial distribution based on geographic information system (GIS) was used to examine the status of pollution and health risk, irrigation water quality, and stochastic geo-environmental risk sources of 16 potentially toxic elements (PTEs: Na, Mg, K, Ca, Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, Hg, and Pb) concentrations from samples in the dam. Also, spatial analyzing of quality indices was used to assess the dam's feasibility for irrigation and drinking. As per the results of the study, the dam water has mild heavy metal (loid) pollution, which is measured at 16 PTE by the heavy metal (loid) pollution index (HPI) and heavy metal (loid) evaluation index (HEI) values. The pollution level is low during the rainy season and moderate during the dry season. The water at sampling station S3 (HPI = 146.50) is unfit for consumption and cannot be used for drinking. The majority of harmful metal species exhibited elevated concentrations (notably Pb: 51.78 mu g/L, Cr: 8.55 mu g/L) in the dam lake water, particularly during the dry season. The toxic metals Pb and Cd account for 15.95% of the total variance, with a high degree of loading. Lead concentrations were found to be above WHO and USEPA limit values only in S2 and S4 during the wet season, but above 0.01 mg/L in all stations except S1 during the dry. Dam water is acceptable for agricultural use, according on the results of the, sodium absorption rate, the percentage of Na and the magnesium damage index, average SAR < 0.9, Na% < 25, and MH < 50, respectively. HQingestion and HI values (all less than 1 in all PTEs) indicate that noncarcinogenic impacts might occur.

Opportunistic feeding habits of two African freshwater clupeid fishes: DNA metabarcoding unravels spatial differences in diet and microbiome, and identifies new prey taxa	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The African Lake Tanganyika clupeids play an important role in the lake's ecosystem and have a high regional economic and nutritional value. Using DNA metabarcoding, we analysed the prey item composition and microbiome of these two clupeid species, Stolothrissa tanganicae and Limnothrissa miodon. We sequenced the mitochondrial COI region of the gut content for prey analysis and the 16S rRNA region of the hindgut content for microbiome analysis of 140 fish sampled at five locations across Lake Tanganyika. Our research confirmed previously reported prey items and discovered prey items that were not reported before, including the jellyfish Limnocnida tanganjicae. The hindgut of the fish harboured 15 bacterial phyla, with the most common being Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. The two clupeid species differed in diet, but not in microbiome. Further, the diet of S. tanganicae, but not its microbiome, varied on a spatial scale, whereas the microbiome, but not the diet, of L. miodon showed spatial variation. Our findings suggest that the Lake Tanganyika clupeids are opportunists, with a diet reflecting the local zooplankton community's composition. These results can serve as a useful reference for monitoring the health status of economically important fish stocks.

This study assessed plankton communities in response to spatial (six sampling sites) and seasonal (wet vs. dry seasons) changes in environmental variables in Lake Kanyaboli, a small satellite lake on the northern shores of Lake Victoria, Kenya. Water quality variables, including pH, conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, Secchi depth (SD), nitrates (NO3-), nitrites (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), were monitored monthly at six sites spread throughout the lake for 1 year. Phytoplankton and zooplankton samples were collected and analyzed for taxon composition and abundance. Two-way ANOVA showed no significant interaction between site and season for all variables. Likewise, there were no significant spatial differences for all variables except Chl-a. A t-test showed significant seasonal differences in SD, DO, NH4+, NO3-, NO2-, and TN. Thirty phytoplankton genera were identified belonging to Bacillariophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Cryptophyceae, Cyanophyceae, Euglenoidae, Trebouxiophyceae, and Zygnematophyceae, with Chlorophyceae being the most dominant (42.30%). Zooplankton comprised of 15 genera, belonging to Copepoda (55.4%), Rotifera (27.9%), and Cladocera (16.7%). Two-way ANOVA for plankton abundance showed no significant interaction between site and season, but there were significant differences in community composition between the wet and dry seasons. Canonical correspondence analysis identified water clarity (Secchi depth) and concentrations of dissolved fractions of nitrogen and phosphorus as the major water quality variables driving variation in the composition of plankton communities in the lake. This study showed that seasonality was a major driver of changes in plankton community composition between dry and wet seasons through changes in the concentrations of nutrients (NH4+, NO3-, NO2-, TN, and TP). Lake Kanyaboli's phytoplankton community indicated a non-equilibrial state, perhaps due to short residence times of water, especially during the wet season, and dense macrophytes fringing the lake that increase nutrient uptake and limit the dominance of select phytoplankton species. This study shows the importance of long-term studies covering dry and wet seasons to understand the dynamics of plankton communities and their drivers in small tropical waterbodies to inform management and conservation.

Medium-term storage volume prediction for optimum reservoir management: A hybrid data-driven approach	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												A hybrid regressive and probabilistic model was developed that is able to forecast, six weeks ahead, the storage volume of Little Nerang dam. This is a small elevated Australian drinking water reservoir, gravity fed to a nearby water treatment plant while a lower second main water supply source (Hinze dam) requires considerable pumping. The model applies a Monte Carlo approach combined with nonlinear threshold autoregressive models using the seasonal streamflow forecasts from the Bureau of Meteorology as input and it was validated over different historical conditions. Treatment operators can use the model for quantifying depletion rates and spill likelihood for the forthcoming six weeks, based on the seasonal climatic conditions and different intake scenarios. Greater utilization of the Little Nerang reservoir source means a reduced supply requirement from the Hinze dam source that needs considerable energy costs for pumping, leading to a lower cost water supply solution for the region.

The aim of the study was to map the spatio-temporal chlorophyll-a concentration changes in Malilangwe Reservoir, Zimbabwe as an indicator of phytoplankton biomass and trophic state when the reservoir was full (year 2000) and at its lowest capacity (year 2011), using readily available Landsat multispectral images. Medium-spatial resolution (30m) Landsat multispectral Thematic Mapper TM 5 and ETM+images for May to December 1999-2000 and 2010-2011 were used to derive chlorophyll-a concentrations. In situ measured chlorophyll-a and total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations for 2011 were employed to validate the Landsat chlorophyll-a and TSS estimates. The study results indicate that Landsat-derived chlorophyll-a and TSS estimates were comparable with field measurements. There was a considerable wet vs. dry season differences in total chlorophyll-a concentration, Secchi disc depth, TSS and turbidity within the reservoir. Using Permutational multivariate analyses of variance (PERMANOVA) analysis, there were significant differences (p<0.0001) for chlorophyll-a concentration among sites, months and years whereas TSS was significant during the study months (p<0.05). A strong positive significant correlation among both predicted TSS vs. chlorophyll-a and measured vs. predicted chlorophyll-a and TSS concentrations as well as an inverse relationship between reservoir chlorophyll-a concentrations and water level were found (p<0.001 in all cases). In conclusion, total chlorophyll-a concentration in Malilangwe Reservoir was successfully derived from Landsat remote sensing data suggesting that the Landsat sensor is suitable for real-time monitoring over relatively short timescales and for small reservoirs. Satellite data can allow for surveying of chlorophyll-a concentration in aquatic ecosystems, thus, providing invaluable data in data scarce (limited on site ground measurements) environments.

A coupled ecological and hydrodynamic model (Dynamic Reservoir Model (DYRESM)-Computational Aquatic Ecosystem Dynamics Model (CAEDYM)) was validated with an extensive field data set to simulate the seasonal dynamics of nutrients, three phytoplankton groups and three zooplankton groups. Parameterization of the model was conducted using field, experimental and literature studies. Sensitivity of simulated output was tested over the full parameter space and established that the most sensitive parameters were related to zooplankton grazing rates, temperature responses and food limitation. The simulated results predict that, on average, 51% of the carbon from phytoplankton photosynthesis is consumed by zooplankton. Excretion of dissolved nutrients by zooplankton accounts for 3-46 and 5-58% of phytoplankton uptake of phosphorus and nitrogen, respectively. Comparison of nutrient fluxes attributable to zooplankton with nutrient loads from inflows and release from bottom sediments shows that the relative contribution by zooplankton to inorganic nutrients in the photic zone varies seasonally in response to the annual hydrodynamic cycle of stratification and mixing. As a percent of total dissolved organic sources relative contributions by zooplankton excretion are highest (62%) during periods of stratification and when inflow nutrient loads are low, and lowest (2%) during the breakdown of stratification and when inflow loads are high. The results illustrate the potential of a lake ecosystem model to extract useful process information to complement field data collection and address questions related to the role of zooplankton in nutrient cycles.

The HPLC analyses showed that more than 98% of the total pigment stocks occurred in the benthos. The phytoplankton contained Chrysophyceae, low concentrations of other protists and Cyanobacteria (notably picocyanobacteria), and the accessory pigments chl c(2), fucoxanthin, diadinoxanthin, violaxanthin, and zeaxanthin. The benthic community contained the accessory pigments chl b, chl c(2), and a set of carotenoids dominated by glycosidic xanthophylls, characteristic of filamentous cyanobacteria. The black surface layer of the mats was rich in the UV-screening compounds scytonemin, red scytonemin-like, and mycosporine-like amino acids, and the blue-green basal stratum contained high concentrations of light-harvesting pigments. In a first bioassay of the benthic mats, there was no significant photosynthetic or growth response to inorganic carbon or full nutrient enrichment over 15 days. This bioassay was repeated with increased replication and HPLC analysis in a subsequent season, and the results confirmed the lack of significant response to added nutrients. In contrast, the phytoplankton in samples from the overlying water column responded strongly to enrichment, and chl a biomass increased by a factor of 19.2 over 2 weeks. These results underscore the divergent ecophysiology of benthic versus planktonic communities in extreme latitudes and show that cold lake ecosystems can be dominated by benthic phototrophs that are nutrient sufficient despite their ultraoligotrophic overlying waters.

Water temperature and organic carbon control spatio-temporal dynamics of particle-attached and free-living bacterial communities in a hypereutrophic urban river network	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Bacteria are an important component of the aquatic ecosystem playing a key role in the transformation and mineralisation of allochthonous organic matter, nutrients and pollutants. However, there is no clear understanding of spatio-temporal patterns of particle-attached versus free-living bacterial abundances, diversities and communities, which limits our in-depth understanding of hypereutrophic urban river ecosystems and the mechanisms regulating nutrient cycling and biogeochemical transformations. In order to investigate spatio-temporal patterns and associated factors for aquatic particle-attached versus free-living bacterial communities, we conducted a 2-year study of four contrasting habitats in a hypereutrophic urban river network of eastern China. Bacterial abundance and community structure in relation to various environmental variables were assessed by epifluorescence microscopy and high-throughput sequencing techniques. Results revealed that particle-attached bacterial abundance depended mainly on suspended particle concentrations, whereas free-living bacterial abundance was correlated with nutrient availability and water temperature. Organic carbon was related to a decrease of free-living and particle-attached bacterial richness, and particulate matter input increased free-living bacterial diversity. Seasonal changes of water temperature were linked to the temporal dynamics of bacterial community composition, and the differences in total organic carbon concentrations contributed to spatial differences in bacterial community composition. There were significant differences in bacterial community composition between particle-attached and free-living assemblages in low-turbidity/low-nutrient rivers found in land areas comprising mainly natural vegetation. These differences were especially prominent for the relative abundances of Cyanobacteria and Actinobacteria, which were higher in the particle-attached and free-living fractions, respectively. However, no significant differences were found in turbid/nutrient-rich rivers. Total organic carbon was the most significant factor shaping the composition similarity between particle-attached and free-living bacterial communities. Our findings indicate that spatio-temporal variations in water temperature, suspended particle and resource availability, especially for organic carbon, appreciably contribute to changes in the abundance, diversity and composition of aquatic particle-attached versus free-living bacterial communities in the hypereutrophic urban river network. Considering that biodiversity is important for supporting ecosystem functioning, this study informs spatio-temporal patterns of particle-attached and free-living bacterial abundance, diversity and composition of communities, and their underlying control mechanisms, thereby providing fundamental knowledge of microbial ecological functions for remediation and sustainable management of hypereutrophic urban river ecosystems.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				SEP	2023	68	9					1627	1645		10.1111/fwb.14159	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.14159		JUL 2023											WOS:001033747100001

In Poyang Lake, the stranding risk of the critically endangered Yangtze finless porpoise are high, due to the significant differences in hydrological and landscape conditions between the flood and dry seasons. However, this stranding information is not well recorded, resulting in poorly guided investigation and rescue efforts. We here employ remote sensing and hydrodynamic modeling to obtain four evaluation indicators in dry, normal, and flood scenarios in Poyang Lake. Results show that nearly 50% of the largest habitat range of the porpoises in the flood season will be land areas during the dry season, and that landscape fragmentation between land and water has increased over the past three decades. In all scenarios, the mean water depth of the habitat varied from 1.77 to 4.89 m from September-February. In the dry scenario, about 59% of the habitat experiences a water depth of <1 m within 15 days. The high stranding risk area is 284.54 km(2) in the dry scenario, >251.04 km(2) in the normal scenario, and >90.12 km(2) in the flood scenario. High-stranding risk areas are located within city boundaries, where porpoise stranding cases have been recorded, especially in Duchang, which has the most high-risk areas in all scenarios. In all scenarios, the high stranding risk area has an average bathymetry of 7.81 m and an average water depth between 1.75 and 5.54 m. Our results can guide future investigations to establish sound stranding networks, and the methods proposed here are also applicable to studies of other freshwater cetaceans facing severe stranding risk.

Evolution of the subglacial hydrologic system beneath the rapidly decaying Cordilleran Ice Sheet caused by ice-dammed lake drainage: implications for meltwater-induced ice acceleration	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												A positive correlation between ice-dammed lake drainage and ice acceleration at Antarctic Ice Sheets (AIS) and land-terminating sections of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) has been implicated in enhanced ice sheet decay. However, the paucity of direct measurements at the ice sheet bed restricts our understanding of subglacial drainage system evolution in response to transient water inputs. We present evidence that two meltwater corridors on the former bed of the thin (similar to 600 m at Last Glacial Maximum over the interior Plateaus of British Columbia) and rapidly decaying Cordilleran Ice Sheet (CIS) were generated subglacially in response to the drainage of an ice-dammed lake and operated as canals (tunnel channels). Geomorphological, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) data reveal a simple event sequence that includes initial propagation of a broad (at least 2.5 km wide) fioodwave (inefficient drainage) from an ice-dammed lake, over relatively short (3-24 km) zones at the corridor heads that collapsed into efficient canals (large (up to 0.25-2.5 km wide) channels incised down into the sediment bed and up into the ice) downglacier. Canal formation on the southern Fraser Plateau involved synchronous (along the full canal length) system development, including elements of headward erosion and plunge pool formation. Our data suggest that ice-dammed lake drainage beneath a rapidly decaying thin ice mass that has an efficient antecedent drainage network is not conducive to large-scale ice acceleration. These data may aid better assessment of the role of ice-dammed lake drainage on the dynamics of former, as well as contemporary, ice sheets. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Hemond, HF; Lin, K				Hemond, Harold F.; Lin, Katherine			Nitrate suppresses internal phosphorus loading in an eutrophic lake	WATER RESEARCH												The presence of nitrate in the hypolimnion of the eutrophic, dimictic Upper Mystic Lake has been previously shown to suppress the release of arsenic from lake sediments during seasonal anoxia, in large part by oxidizing iron (II) and producing iron oxyhydroxides that sorb inorganic arsenic. Because of the importance of internal phosphorus loading in the phosphorus budget of many eutrophic lakes, the chemical similarities between phosphate and arsenate, and the need to account for internal phosphorus loading as part of many lake restoration strategies, we carried out measurements to determine if the presence of nitrate also suppressed the release of phosphorus from the sediments of this lake during anoxia. Observations showed that this was the case. Arsenic, phosphorus, and iron (II) concentrations were strongly correlated in the water column, as expected, and the depths below which phosphorus and iron concentrations increased relative to epilimnetic values was predicted by the depth at which nitrate concentration approached zero. The results suggest that knowledge of a lake's nitrogen budget may be a useful tool in the design of lake remediation efforts, even though phosphorus is typically the limiting nutrient.

In areas with drastic hydrological changes, achieving accurate and rapid mapping of these phenomena in combination with hydrologic variability characteristics is a key of effective emergency management and disaster risk reduction plans. This study presents an automatic method for mapping drought and flood hazards, particularly in regions with significant hydrological changes. We use Sentinel-1/2 and Landsat data to extract surface water and classify permanent and seasonal water bodies in historical periods, which serve as the basis for identifying flood or drought areas. The water extraction method combines index-based analysis for optical data and the region-Otsu method for radar data, ensuring accurate identification of water. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through comparisons with existing products in Poyang Lake (China), the Po River Plain (Italy), and the Indus River Plain (Pakistan). Findings show a high similarity between the two, and our results can provide more specific details. Our method is particularly well-suited for areas with fluctuating hydrological conditions, can also map quickly without optical data. By effectively identifying areas affected by drought and flood hazards while mitigating errors from natural hydrological dynamics, this methodology contributes valuable insights to enhance emergency management and disaster risk reduction plans.

In all seasons, the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA, 89.85-109.11 mg/100g) amount in zanders was higher than saturated fatty acids (SFA, 55.08-81.89 mg/100g) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA, 29.16-78.89 mg/100g). It was determined that EPA, DHA and omega-3 rates were high. The fatty acid quality indices (AI, TI, FLQ, w6/w3, h/H) were found at proper levels for human health.

Muskellunge Population Responses to Angler Catch-and-Release Practices in Escanaba Lake, Wisconsin, 1987-2014	MUSKELLUNGE MANAGEMENT: FIFTY YEARS OF COOPERATION AMONG ANGLERS, SCIENTISTS, AND FISHERIES BIOLOGISTS	American Fisheries Society Symposium				Hugh C Becker Memorial Muskie Symposium: 50 Years of Cooperation - Anglers, Science and Management	MAR 13-15, 2016	Minnetonka, MN	Hugh C Becker Fdn, Muskies Inc, Amer Fisheries Soc, N Central Div, Esocid Tech Comm				Changes in species-specific angler behaviors from harvest oriented to voluntary release have the potential to alter fish population and community characteristics. In Escanaba Lake, Vilas County, Wisconsin, targeted and indirect Muskellunge Esox masquinongy angler behavior changed from harvest-oriented to primarily voluntary catch and release (C&R) during the mid-1990s. Since, the Muskellunge population has been lightly exploited (mean exploitation [u] < 0.05), despite no closed season, bag limit, or minimum length limit for Muskellunge, and can now be characterized as a C&R fishery. We tested for differences in Muskellunge adult density, age-0 relative abundance, and size structure indices as a consequence of changes in angler behavior and the subsequent reduction in exploitation. Prior to the shift in angler behavior, the Muskellunge population exhibited characteristics of an exploited fishery (e.g., lower adult size structure, high and more variable natural recruitment). After C&R practices became prevalent, the Muskellunge population exhibited characteristics of an unexploited fishery (e.g., larger adult size structure, low and less variable natural recruitment). Voluntary release of Muskellunge is an angler behavior that is well recognized and promoted among present-day anglers. We recommend that managers account for these changes in angler behavior and associated population responses and adjust management strategies accordingly. In particular, stocking practices and harvest regulations need to be evaluated to ensure that those strategies are not negatively influencing Muskellunge population dynamics and other associated fish community characteristics.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-46-2				2017	85						337	355																WOS:000422891800031

Changes in LSWT have a huge impact on the water quality, ecosystem function, and biome composition of the entire lake. In this study, we selected Dianchi Lake as the research area, the monthly average LSWT data collected at the monitoring station from 1998 to 2009 were used as the calibration dataset. The error analysis dataset is the average annual temperatures of the Dianchi Lake extracted from MODIS remote sensing images from 2001 to 2017. The daily average LSWT of Dianchi Lake was estimated by the air-water model and the historical changes from 1980 to 2017 of the LSWT were reproduced. The research draws a conclusion that the LSWT of Dianchi Lake has been greatly affected by air temperature over the past 37 years. LSWT and the annual average air temperature correlation coefficient were R > 0.9. Both the air temperature and LSWT assumed an increasing tendency. The annual average LSWT increased with the rate of 0.36 degrees C/decade, and the annual average warming rate of the air temperature was 0.47 degrees C/decade. The monthly average LSWT and air temperature showed a significant correlation at a confidence interval of alpha = 0.001. The LSWT of Dianchi Lake increased significantly in February, March, and December. The periodicity of the seasonal mean air temperature change was consistent with that of the LSWT in Dianchi Lake. The relative lag of the thermal response of the LSWT to climate warming was also observed. This study fills in the gaps in the long-term sequence data on the LSWT of Dianchi Lake and reveals the effect of climate warming on the LSWT of low-latitude plateau lakes.

Seasonal and ontogenetic shifts in the diet of Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus in a subarctic lake	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Seasonal and ontogenetic shifts in the diet of Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus were studied in a deep, ultra-oligotrophic lake in subarctic Finland from both stomach contents and the stable carbon (delta 13C) and nitrogen (delta 15N) isotope compositions of muscle and liver tissues. Both diet and isotope results indicated that the S. alpinus population relied mainly on littoral benthic energy sources. The strong littoral reliance appeared largely independent of season or fish size, although the data lacked small (total length, L-T, < 130 mm) and young (< 3 years) S. alpinus. Liver isotope values of intermediate-sized S. alpinus (200-350 mm), however, suggested exploitation of the increase in the abundance of pelagic zooplankton in the late open-water season. The results suggest that, in general, a strong littoral reliance of fishes can be a feature in subarctic lakes throughout the year. Due to its faster isotopic turnover rate and thus higher resolution for temporal diet changes, liver could be more commonly used in stable-isotope studies of fish trophic niche shifts instead of using only the less responsive muscle tissue.					; Eloranta, Antti/IUM-9302-2023; Jones, Roger/C-7703-2011	Eloranta, Antti/0000-0002-8893-0135; Kahilainen, Kimmo/0000-0002-1539-014X; Jones, Roger/0000-0002-0835-8264													0022-1112	1095-8649				JUL	2010	77	1					80	97		10.1111/j.1095-8649.2010.02656.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.2010.02656.x								20646140					WOS:000279903700006

The Kyagar Glacier is well known for its surge history, andin particular its frequent blocking of the downstream valley, leading to aseries of high-magnitude glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Although the surgedynamics of the Kyagar Glacier have been broadly described in theliterature, there remains an extensive archive of remote sensingobservations that have great potential for revealing specific surgecharacteristics and their relationship with historic lake outburst floods.In this study, we propose a new perspective on quantifying the surgingprocess using successive digital elevation models (DEMs), which could beapplied to other sites where glacier surges are known to occur. AdvancedSpaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer DEMs, High MountainAsia 8-meter DEMs, and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission DEM were used tocharacterize surface elevation changes throughout the period from 2000 to2021. We also used Landsat time series imagery to quantify glacier surfacevelocities and associated lake changes over the course of two surge eventsbetween 1989 and 2021. Using these datasets, we reconstruct the surgingprocess of the Kyagar Glacier in unprecedented detail and find a clear signal ofsurface uplift over the lower glacier tongue, along with uniformlyincreasing velocities, associated with the period of surge initiation.Seasonal variations in surface flow are still evident throughout the surgephase, indicating the presence of water at the glacier bed. Surge activity of theKyagar Glacier is strongly related to the development and drainage of theterminal ice-dammed lake, which itself is controlled by the drainage systembeneath the glacier terminus.					; Li, Guanyu/GZM-9069-2022; Lv, Mingyang/AAZ-7579-2021	Quincey, Duncan/0000-0002-7602-7926; 													1994-0416	1994-0424				JUL 18	2023	17	7					2891	2907		10.5194/tc-17-2891-2023	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2891-2023													WOS:001027326900001

Variance Based Sensitivity Analysis of FLake Lake Model for Global Land Surface Modeling	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Given the ever increasing spatial resolution of climate models and the significant role of lakes on the regional climate, it becomes important to represent water bodies in climate models. Such developments have started in the IPSL (Institut Pierre Simon Laplace) climate model and its land surface component, ORganizing Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic Ecosystems (ORCHIDEE), with the Freshwater Lake model, FLake. To answer the questions raised by these new developments, such as the lake differentiation and related model parameters, we analyze spatial distributions of lake characteristics in the whole world to perform a global sensitivity analysis of the FLake parameters. As a result, three different climates and four lake depth configurations were selected as test cases. The Sobol method as sensitivity analysis based on variance decomposition was chosen to rank parameters impact on the model output, that is, lake surface water temperature, latent and sensible heat fluxes. We focus on the 11 parameters of the FLake model, which are the lake depth, the albedo and light extinction coefficient of water, snow, and ice respectively, the fetch, and the relaxation coefficient of the thermocline shape factor. The results show different sensitivity features according to the lake type and climate. The dominant role and time varying contribution of the lake depth, radiative parameters (albedo, light extinction coefficient) and thermocline relaxation coefficient linked to the atmospheric conditions, were clearly highlighted. These findings will lead us to distinguish between different lake categories in each grid cell of ORCHIDEE in the future implementation. Plain Language Summary Lakes are often neglected in climate modeling because their spatial extent does not exceed 4% of the Earth land area. But given the ever increasing spatial resolution of climate models and the significant role of lakes on the regional climate, it becomes important to represent water bodies in climate models. Such developments have started in the French IPSL climate model with the implementation of a one-dimensional freshwater lake model (FLake). To answer the questions raised by these new developments, such as the lake differentiation and related model parameters, we analyze spatial distributions of lake characteristics in the whole world to perform a global sensitivity analysis of the model parameters. Our results show the respective roles of the depth, fetch, thermocline, sediment, and radiative (albedo and light extinction coefficient) parameters in different climate conditions and at different time scales. Some avenues for further implementation and model parameters calibration are finally given. Key Points Parameters FLake model parameters sensitivities on lake surface temperature and sensible and latent heat fluxes are analyzed Parameter sensitivities to surface variables vary with depth, climate, and season Respective roles of depth, fetch, surface albedo, light extinction, and thermocline shape coefficients are quantified					; OTTLE, Catherine/K-3895-2012	OTTLE, Catherine/0000-0003-1304-6414; Raoult, Nina/0000-0003-2907-9456; Bernus, Anthony/0000-0001-7672-5807													2169-897X	2169-8996				APR 20	2021	126	8							e2019JD031928	10.1029/2019JD031928	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JD031928													WOS:000664863900046

We described the Yacyreta Reservoir and its impact downriver since it started operating in 1994. The spatio-temporal changes of the phytoplankton are associated to the hydrosedimentological regime. Regular variations in the hydrological phases and shorter permanent fluctuations are essential for phytoplankton maintenance, since they allow the lateral exchange with zones of higher algal accumulation in the main channel and with the floodplain. During ordinary hydrological cycles, the mainstem shows a typical potamoplankton, dominated by Aulacoseira granulata and, alternatively, with sub-dominance of Chlorococcales, Cryptophyceae at the Middle and Lower Stretch, Cyanobacteria abound at Yacyreta Reservoir and downriver at the High and the beginning of the Middle Stretch. The disruption of Yacyreta Reservoir produces profound changes in the High Parana phytoplankton evidenced in increased density and replacement of dominant species; Cryptophyceae replaced the Bacillariophyceae. Since 2001, water transparency increased and phosphorus concentration decreased, as well as the density and diversity of phytoplankton. Since 2004, an increase in Cyanobacteria was observed with bloom of Microcystis aeruginosa that extended 220 km downstream of the dam. Anomalous hydrological cycles, related to the ENSO phenomenon produced changes in phytoplankton density and structure. During El Nino, the system maintains a relative homogeneous phytoplankton assemblage, although mean density values are significantly lower than those registered in ordinary hydrological periods. La Nina provokes a more drastic change in the community, due to the disruption in the exchange with the alluvial valley. The river-floodplain connectivity is essential for the maintenance of phytoplankton diversity.

With regard to diurnal changes in energy allocation, the peak of the energy flux to electron transport, J(PSII), occurred in the morning and the peak of the energy flux to heat dissipation associated with non-photochemical quenching of Chl fluorescence, J(NPQ), occurred in the afternoon. With regard to seasonal changes in energy allocation, J(PSII) in the rapidly growing phase was greater than that in the ripening phase, even though the leaves of rice receive less light in the growing phase than in the ripening period in Japan. This seasonal decrease in J(PSII) was accompanied by an increase in J(NPQ). One of the reasons for the lower J(PSII) in the ripening phase might be a more sever afternoon suppression of J(PSII). To estimate energy dissipation due to photoinhibition of PSII, J(NPQ) was divided into J(fast), which is associated with fast-recovering NPQ mainly due to qE, and J(slow), which is mainly due to photoinhibition. The integrated daily energy loss by photoinhibiton was calculated to be about 3-8% of light energy absorption in PSII. Strategies for the utilization of light energy adopted by rice are discussed. For example, very efficient photosynthesis under non-saturating light in the rapidly growing phase is proposed.

L.; Feibel, Craig S.; Kroon, Dick			Environmental and climatic control on seasonal stable isotope variation of freshwater molluscan bivalves in the Turkana Basin (Kenya)	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												We present growth incremental stable isotope records (delta O-18 and delta C-13) of modern and similar to 2 Ma fossil bivalve shells from the semi-arid Turkana Basin (N. Kenya, S. Ethiopia). These data suggest that seasonal cyclicity in delta O-18 and delta C-13 recorded by modern and fossil shells is driven by wet-dry seasonal changes in host water chemistry, forced by monsoonal rainfall over the Ethiopian Highlands. Fully lacustrine shells show lower amplitude, or even absent seasonal cyclicity in comparison with deltaic or riverine shells because of the buffering effect of the large water volume in the lake setting. Riverine shells arguably have the clearest relation to seasonally variable climate parameters. Riverine molluscs thus provide a potentially valuable proxy for varying rainfall delta O-18 values in the Turkana Basin catchment. Cross plots of molluscan delta O-18 and delta C-13 data reveal dominant environmental control on molluscan isotope values with remarkably large isotopic differences between lacustrine, deltaic and riverine environments. We interpret this isotope pattern to directly result from the different mixing proportions of Omo River source water with evaporated lake water in these environments. The interpretation of fossil molluscan delta O-18 and delta C-13 data in a palaeoclimatological context is not straightforward, since the potential influence of temporal changes in lake water temperature, surface evaporation or river discharge on the delta O-18 budget of the lake is smaller than the isotopic shifts caused by shifting facies patterns in the sedimentary record. Even though it is clear from the rich molluscan faunas that the similar to 2 Ma palaeo-Lake Lorenyang must have been significantly less alkaline than modern Lake Turkana and likely provided good drinking water and abundant availability of food for the different species of hominins inhabiting the region at that time, stable isotope values of molluscan bivalves are not suitable to record the difference in alkalinity between these two settings.

Factors controlling seasonal variations in stable isotope composition of particulate organic matter in a soft water eutrophic lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Weekly water samples were taken to measure stable isotope composition (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of particulate organic matter (POM) in Lake Wauberg, Florida, from June 1994 to May 1995. The average delta C-13 of POM was -19.3 parts per thousand, consistent with an autochthonous origin from phytoplankton production, and exhibited a seasonal pattern that coincided with changes in water temperature, pH, CO2 concentration, and phytoplankton biomass in the surface water. The C-13 enrichment in POM was attributed to reduced isotope fractionation due to carbon (C) limitation and the use of an isotopically heavy dissolved inorganic carbon pool supported mainly by atmospheric invasion and anaerobic respiration. Intermittent declines in delta C-13 of POM were related to the frequent collapses of phytoplankton blooms and increases in CO2 concentration resulting from both increased community respiration and terrestrial loading. Average delta N-15 of POM was 1.3 parts per thousand and varied within a narrow range (-0.1 parts per thousand to 2.5 parts per thousand). No significant correlation between phytoplankton biovolume and the delta N-15 of POM was found. The low delta N-15 is indicative of strong N-2 fixation, which is in line with the low concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and the presence of high biovolume of N-2-fixing cyanobacteria in the surface water. This study suggests that stable C isotopes are good proxies for surface water CO2 concentration and primary production, while stable N isotopes can be used to indicate N-2 fixation.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2006	51	6					2837	2848		10.4319/lo.2006.51.6.2837	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2006.51.6.2837													WOS:000242265700029

Estimating ecological thresholds for phosphorus in the Everglades	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The Florida Everglades, a wetland of international importance, has been undergoing a significant shift in its native flora and fauna due to excessive total phosphorus (TP) loadings (an average of 147 t per annum from 1995 to 2004) and an elevated mean TP concentration (69 mu g L-1 of TP in 2004) from agricultural runoff and Lake Okeechobee outflow despite the use of 16000 ha of stormwater treatment areas. Here, we present a Bayesian changepoint analysis of long-term experimental research and show that exceeding a surface water geometric mean TP threshold concentration of 15 mu g L-1 causes an ecological imbalance in algal, macrophyte, and macroinvertebrate assemblages as well as slough community structure. A phosphorus threshold for all trophic levels may be more realistic and protective when presented as a threshold zone (12-15 mu g L-1) because estimates of uncertainty must be utilized to accurately define TP thresholds, which change with seasons and water depths. Most interior areas of the Everglades are currently at or below this threshold zone, but the exterior areas near inflow structures (except for the Everglades National Park) are presently receiving double or triple the proposed threshold. Our Bayesian approach, used hereto address ecological imbalance along nutrient gradients, is applicable to determining thresholds and stable states in other aquatic ecosystems.					; Qian, Song/I-6544-2012; Qualls, Robert/AAB-6116-2021; Stow, Craig/AAG-8109-2020; Richardson, Curtis/A-8202-2009	Stow, Craig/0000-0001-6171-7855; Qian, Song/0000-0002-2346-4903; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				DEC 1	2007	41	23					8084	8091		10.1021/es062624w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es062624w								18186341					WOS:000251305500025

Drought altered trophic dynamics of an important natural saline lake: A stable isotope approach	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Climate change and associated droughts threaten the ecology and resilience of natural saline lakes globally. There is a distinct lack of research regarding their ecological response to climatic events in the Global South. This region is predicted to experience climatic events such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) more often and with greater severity with the potential to alter the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems significantly. From 2015 to 2016 South Africa experienced one of the most severe country-wide droughts as a result of a strong ENSO event. Our study aimed to investigate the effect of this supra-seasonal drought on the trophic structure of fish communities in a naturally saline shallow lake of a Ramsar wetland using stable isotope techniques. Fishes and potential basal sources were collected from the lake, during predrought conditions in 2010 and after severe drought (recovery phase; 2017). The delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of food web elements were determined and analysed using Bayesian mixing models and Bayesian Laymen metrics to establish the proportional contribution of C-3 and C-4 basal sources to the fish (consumer) diets, and examine the fish community in terms of isotopic niche and trophic structure, respectively. Fish consumers relied predominantly on C-3 basal sources in the predrought and shifted to greater reliance on C-4 basal sources, decreased isotopic niche space use and a reduction in trophic length in the recovery phase. Drought altered the type and abundance of the basal sources available by limiting sources to those that are more drought-tolerant, reducing the trophic pathways of the food web with no significant alterations in the fish community. These results demonstrate the resilience and biological plasticity of Lake Nyamithi and its aquatic fauna, highlighting the importance of freshwater inflow to saline lakes with alterations thereof posing a significant threat to their continued functioning.

To examine whether the idealized metacommunity structuring, diversity patterns, and potential driving mechanisms vary among different seasons, we assessed seasonal fish data (i.e., normal, wet, and dry seasons) in the Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, by incorporating the Elements of Metacommunity Structure (EMS), 13-diversity partitioning, and variance partitioning. The results suggested fish metacommunity displayed quasi-structures, with the quasiClemensian paradigm in the normal season and the quasi-Gleasonian paradigm in the wet and dry seasons, indicating the unity of species groups and individualistic species responded weakly to latent environmental gradients, respectively. The highest fish 13-diversity occurred in the normal season and the lowest in the wet season with a humped trend. The species abundance replacement process contributed more to the total 13-diversity than the nestedness-resultant component among seasons. The variation of the highest Local Contribution to Beta Diversity (LCBD) across seasons indicated the significance of protecting unique habitats. The relative importance of environment and spatial factors on fish metacommunity structure depended on discharge alternation, with a more significant role of spatial structuring occurring in the wet season, whereas predominant environmental filtering in the normal and dry seasons. The seasonal shifts in EMS patterns, 13-diversity, and metacommunity assembly rules result from the change in hydrological conditions in the Poyang Lake. This work helps understand seasonal metacommunity dynamics and provides essential information for systematic biodiversity conservation planning in freshwater lakes.

This floral turnover has been confirmed in many regions of the world, except eastern Asia where taxonomic data about early and middle Miocene planktonic diatom assemblages have until recently been scarce. Our analysis of Lower and Middle Miocene lacustrine diatomaceous rocks in Japan confirms that species of nonmarine Actinocyclus were important constituents of lake phytoplankton there as well. The appearance of nonmarine Actinocyclus species near the beginning of the Miocene may have resulted from the introduction of euryhaline species into lacustrine environments during a highstand of sea level at that time. Similarly, it is possible that species of Stephanodiscaceae evolved from marine thalassiosiroid ancestors that invaded high latitude lacustrine environments during multiple Paleogene highstands, resulting in a polyphyletic origin of the family. The turnover from nonmarine Actinocyclus to Stephanodiscaceae genera near the middle/late Miocene boundary may be linked to a contemporaneous increase in silica concentrations in lakes caused by active volcanism, increased weathering of silicate rocks due to orogeny, and the expansion of C-4 grasslands. This turnover may also have been influenced by enhanced seasonal environmental changes in the euphotic zone caused by the initiation of monsoon conditions and a worldwide increase in meridional temperature gradients during the late Miocene. Morphological characteristics of Stephanodiscaceae genera, such as strutted processes and small size, suggest their species were better adapted to seasonal environmental changes than non-marine species of Actinocyclus because of their superiority in floating and drifting capabilities and possibly metabolism, intrinsic growth rate, and reproductivity. As climates deteriorated during the late Miocene, Stephanodiscaceae species may have spread from high latitudes to temperate lakes where they diversified, ultimately displacing Actinocyclus.																			1932-6203					JUN 5	2018	13	6							e0198003	10.1371/journal.pone.0198003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198003								29870528					WOS:000434128400011

Influence of suspended particulate matter on nutrient biogeochemistry of a tropical shallow lagoon, Chilika, India	LIMNOLOGY												The behaviour of suspended particulate matter (SPM), salinity profile, dissolved nutrients, total (T.Chl-a) and size fractionated chlorophyll-a (F.Chl-a) were studied seasonally at Chilika Lagoon, east coast of India, during 2008-2009. The study showed large spatio-temporal variations among these parameters. The concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and inorganic phosphate were found to be maximum during the monsoon, followed by post- and pre-monsoon, although the mean N:P ratios, which indicate the relative availability of N with respect to P, were 9.13 +/- 3.09, 16.57 +/- 11.53 and 5.47 +/- 3.13, respectively. It was evident from the results that during pre-monsoon and postmonsoon, the lagoon exhibits nitrogen limitation. Mean T.Chl-a biomass in the lagoon showed distinct seasonality with maximum values during the pre-monsoon (23.12 +/- 9.75 mg m(-3)) followed by monsoon and post-monsoon. Irrespective of seasons, maximum T.Chl-a was found in the northern part of the lagoon. SPM concentrations during the monsoon were relatively higher in the freshwater dominated zones compared to seawater dominated areas, indicating its riverine sources. The correlation between SPM and various dissolved nutrients (p < 0.05) suggests its influence on the physico-chemical conditions at varying levels. It is summarized that seasonal variation of SPM and nutrients contributed by rivers, wind induced re-suspension events and in situ regeneration processes play a crucial role in the lagoon biogeochemical cycle.

J	Tao, J; Chen, YF; He, DK; Ding, CZ				Tao, Juan; Chen, Yifeng; He, Dekui; Ding, Chengzhi			Relationships between climate and growth of Gymnocypris selincuoensis in the Tibetan Plateau	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												The consequences of climate change are becoming increasingly evident in the Tibetan Plateau, represented by glaciers retreating and lakes expanding, but the biological response to climate change by plateau-lake ecosystems is poorly known. In this study, we applied dendrochronology methods to develop a growth index chronology with otolith increment widths of Selincuo naked carp (Gymnocypris selincuoensis), which is an endemic species in Lake Selincuo (4530 m), and investigated the relationships between fish growth and climate variables (regional and global) in the last three decades. A correlation analysis and principle component regression analysis between regional climate factors and the growth index chronology indicated that the growth of G. selincuoensis was significantly and positively correlated with length of the growing season and temperature-related variables, particularly during the growing season. Most of global climate variables, which are relevant to the Asian monsoon and the midlatitude westerlies, such as El Nino Southern Oscillation Index, the Arctic Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, and North America Pattern, showed negative but not significant correlations with the annual growth of Selincuo naked carp. This may have resulted from the high elevation of the Tibetan Plateau and the high mountains surrounding this area. In comparison, the Pacific Decade Oscillation (PDO) negatively affected the growth of G. selincuoensis. The reason maybe that enhancement of the PDO can lead to cold conditions in this area. Taken together, the results indicate that the Tibetan Plateau fish has been affected by global climate change, particularly during the growing season, and global climate change likely has important effects on productivity of aquatic ecosystems in this area.					; TAO, JUAN/N-1699-2015; Chen, Yifeng/JMR-4435-2023	Tao, Juan/0000-0003-3108-7412; 													2045-7758					APR	2015	5	8					1693	1701		10.1002/ece3.1463	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.1463								25937912					WOS:000354209300013

Moving from the hypothesis that oligotrophication and climate affected the composition of the diatom assemblages by changing the resource ratio, we analysed the vernal diatoms succession in Lake Maggiore, between 1984 and 2007, using multivariate techniques (cluster analysis, canonical correspondence analysis, multivariate regression trees), in order to single out the oligotrophication effects from those attributable to climatic variability. Our results point out that Si, TP, temperature and wind emerged as key explanatory variables in species selection, with a stronger link between trophic and climatic drivers after the lake reached a stable oligotrophic status. Peculiar climate-driven events (deep mixing and floods) affected the in-lake Si:P ratio, giving an advantage to diatoms that are excellent P, but poor Si competitors. The classical role of Fragilaria and Tabellaria as early-warning indicators of eutrophication should be reconsidered, taking into account that both can be useful indicators of climate change, when links between their physiological resource needs and environmental data coming from robust limnological investigations can be established.

J	Ito, Y; Momii, K				Ito, Yuji; Momii, Kazuro			Potential effects of climate changes on evaporation from a temperate deep lake	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: Lake Ikeda, Japan. Study focus: Few previous studies on the contribution of meteorological factors to lake evaporation (E) have been conducted with comprehensive analyses of lake surface temperature (T-s) under different climate scenarios. This study aimed to compute and compare the sensitivities of monthly and annual E to changes in solar (R-s) and atmospheric radiation (R-a), air temperature (T-a), relative humidity (RH), and wind speed (u) under two climate scenarios through a 36-year numerical simulation for Lake Ikeda. New hydrological insights for the region: Where climate shifted unidirectionally, R-s and R-a were the greatest driving forces for E. The mean contributions of Rs and R-a to annual E change were approximated to be 2.4- and 5.4-times larger than that of T-a (or RH), respectively. Thus, under warming or cooling condition around the lake, R-a working with T-a was dominant for E. In contrast, considering seasonal climate variability, a remarkable effect of the seasonal variability in T-a on E, indicating negative correlation, was estimated. E changes were characterized by the dilatory thermal-reaction of T-s, enhanced by the seasonal switching effect of heat conduction between the lake and atmosphere, and seasonal temperature dependency of vapor pressure. The driving factors of E and T-s, correlations between E and meteorological factors, and variabilities of meteorological factors were compared and summarized for lakes located between 30 degrees N 45 degrees N worldwide.																				2214-5818				JUN	2021	35								100816	10.1016/j.ejrh.2021.100816	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2021.100816		APR 2021											WOS:000663484100005

Long-term climate, vegetation and fire regime change in a managed municipal water supply area, British Columbia, Canada	HOLOCENE												Post-glacial climate, vegetation and fire history were reconstructed from a sediment record from Begbie Lake, British Columbia, Canada, located in a municipal water supply area servicing > 350,000 people. Watershed managers have identified wildfire as a threat to water supply and seek to understand how vegetation and fire have varied through time with climate. In the cold late-glacial, open Pinus woodlands, periodically disturbed by fire, transitioned to mixed conifer forests subject to high-severity fire. The early Holocene is of interest to watershed managers because climate was warmer and drier than present. During this interval, low streamflow, abundant fire-adapted taxa, elevated background charcoal and regional increases in biomass burning indicate that fire seasons were longer and that fire was an important disturbance mechanism. Climate moistened in the mid Holocene, facilitating canopy closure and decreased fire disturbance. However, surface fires prevailed in Quercus ecosystems, which were expanding locally. Charcoal increased between 6180-2500 cal yr BP as climate further cooled and moistened, likely reflecting human activity and/or increased climate variability. Modern conditions arose within the last few millennia, impacted most recently by European settlement. In combination with paleoclimate modelling, modern management practices and forecast simulations, the Begbie Lake record informs about ecosystem changes within the watershed, yielding insights for management.					; Schoups, Gerrit/F-8208-2014	Macauley, Kiera/0000-0002-7951-6573; Trofymow, John/0009-0008-7138-8360; Schoups, Gerrit/0000-0002-2552-7293; Hebda, Nicholas/0009-0002-3864-1981; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				SEP	2019	29	9					1411	1424		10.1177/0959683619854523	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683619854523													WOS:000484498100002

All samples were analyzed for major cations (NH4+, Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+) and anions (F-, Cl-, NO3-, and SO42-), electric conductivity (EC), pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and oxygen isotopic composition (delta O-18). The volume-weighted mean (VWM) values of pH and EC in the precipitation samples were 7.2 and 19.0 mu s cm(-1). Ca2+ was the dominant cation in precipitation with a VWM of 116.9 mu eq L-1 (1.6-662.9 mu eq L-1), accounting for 45.7% of total ions in precipitation. SO42- was the predominant anion with a VWM of 32.7 mu eq L-1, accounting for 47.1% of the total anions. The average precipitation DOC was 1.4 mg L-1, and it shows a roughly negative power function with the precipitation amount. The values of delta O-18 in the rainwater in Qinghai Lake varied from -13.5 parts per thousand to -3.9 parts per thousand with an average of -8.1 parts per thousand. The enrichment factor analysis indicates that crustal materials from continental dust were the major sources for Ca2+ in the precipitation samples. The high concentration of Ca2+ in the atmosphere played an important role in neutralizing the acidity of rainwater in Qinghai Lake area. Cluster analysis of air-mass trajectories indicates that the air masses associated with northeast and east had high values of NH4+, SO42-, and NO3-, whereas large Ca2+ loading was related to the air mass from west.

J	Collins-Key, SA; Altman, J				Collins-Key, Savannah A.; Altman, Jan			Detecting tropical cyclones from climate- and oscillation-free tree-ring width chronology of longleaf pine in south-central Georgia	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												The knowledge of past tropical cyclone (TC) activity is vital to understanding patterns of current and future TCs and how they will impact society, infrastructure, and the natural system. Various historical, biological, and geological proxies are commonly used to reconstruct TC behavior; however, these records vary significantly in their temporal resolution. Tree rings are known to provide high-resolution data and have been proven as a valuable proxy record of past TC activity. Here we aim to produce a TC reconstruction based on tree-ring width data of longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) located in Lake Louise near Valdosta, Georgia. Results of growthclimate analysis showed that all climate and oscillation variables influence the tree growth, and removing this climate influence may be necessary to unmask the TC signal. For this purpose, we used stepwise linear regression to iteratively model tree growth with monthly climate factors (precipitation, temperature, drought) and monthly oscillation indices (ENSO, AMO, NAO, PDO) to obtain residual chronologies. Tree-ring chronologies were compared to TC data from the National Hurricane Center's North Atlantic Hurricane Database (HURDAT2) for a 150-km buffer zone around Lake Louise between 1894 and 1999. Of the storms that entered the buffer, 13 of the 17 <-0.3 growth rings and 8 of the 10 <-0.4 growth rings occurred in the year directly after a TC event. Our results revealed the strong climate and oscillation influence in the raw chronology and no significant TC signal. However, the removal of temperature and precipitation influence from raw chronology unmasked the TC signal (p 0.05). The TC signal was even more pronounced if influence of oscillation indices on growth had been also removed. The most pronounced TC signal was identified between most intense TCs ( 33 ms-1) and the climate and oscillation signal-free chronology. We emphasize that future research is needed for validation and elimination of the influence of other external growth drivers, as well as replication studies at multiple sites using similar statistical applications.

Carbon isotopes from soil organic matter and C-14 ages from the humin fraction indicate the dominance of C-3 plants since similar to 17,000 cal BP. Palynological analysis of a sediment core indicates the presence of Atlantic Forest vegetation since 7700 cal BP. Changes in the relative abundance of tree ferns and palms suggest the predominance of a humid period from similar to 7000-4000 cal BP and establishment of the modern seasonal climate at similar to 4000 cal BP. Data indicate maintenance of the regional forest coverage since the late Pleistocene, corroborating previous suggestions that this region was a forest refuge during less humid periods of the late Pleistocene and Holocene. Some plant taxa with currently divided distributions between Amazonia and the Atlantic Forest colonized the region since at least 7500 cal BP, indicating an earlier connection between Amazonia and Atlantic Forest.

The depth of the underground water table of the G-L was -25 to -50 cm, while those of G-ML, G-MH and G-H ranged from -15 to -25 cm, -5 to -15 cm, and -5 to 5, respectively. Additionally, the dry weight loss rate increased gradually with increasing days, with that of G-H being highest, followed by G-MH, G-ML and G-L. The decomposition rate of the four gradients increased rapidly to day 30, then decreased slowly until stabilizing. Additionally, the decomposition rate was highest in G-H, followed by G-MH, G-ML and G-L. The Olson negative exponential model could simulate the decomposition good and predicted the time required for 50% decomposition of the G-H, G-MH, G-ML and G-L gradients was about 166, 197, 205 and 247 days, respectively, while required for 95% was about 1.97, 2.23, 2.43 and 2.92 years, respectively. The overall trend in the relative return index of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus increased with increasing decomposition days, and the order was G-H > G-MH > G-ML > G-L. Differences in soil pH, bulk density, soil total nitrogen, soil organic matter, microbial biomass carbon and soil sand content in the decomposed environment due to groundwater had a significant impact on decomposition and nutrient release. The relative return index of carbon was significantly positively correlated with soil pH, but significantly negatively correlated with soil bulk density, soil nitrogen content, microbial biomass nitrogen and soil organic matter. The above results show that groundwater is the key factor influencing litter decomposition in Poyang Lake wetland during the dry season, with higher groundwater levels promoting the decomposition.					; Zhang, Quanjun/NYT-3493-2025; Yu, Xiubo/A-5875-2016; ya, li/GZM-3782-2022	Zhang, Quanjun/0000-0001-6087-3928; 													0270-5060	2156-6941				JAN 1	2019	34	1					305	322		10.1080/02705060.2019.1584128	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2019.1584128													WOS:000462642100001

The goal was to investigate the feeding patterns of this species in an invaded freshwater habitat, where it first appeared at the beginning of 1990s, with implications for assessing its possible effects on invaded ecosystems. In total, 36 prey items were identified in the diet of S. abaster. The most important prey were zooplanktonic organisms, among which copepods predominated significantly. The second most important prey were cladocerans, represented by 20 species/genera. The diet composition of this species showed clear seasonal dynamics but copepods remained the predominant prey item throughout the year. Significant positive relationships between the abundance of zooplanktonic organisms in the gut contents of S. abaster and their abundance in zooplankton samples were found for copepods and Ceriodaphnia sp. S. abaster showed a significant positive electivity for copepods throughout all months. It also positively selected some large cladocerans, which probably shared the same habitat. S. abaster also consumed fish items including gobiid larvae and its own juveniles, when they were abundant in May and especially in June. The possible effect of S. abaster on native ecosystems may include the shaping of zooplanktonic communities through selective predation on copepods. This species is unlikely to be a serious food competitor for native fish inhabiting European freshwaters, the majority of which are cyprinids. Nevertheless, it can have effects on some native fish through predation on their juveniles, which might share the same habitats.

Stomach contents and stable isotopes analysis indicate Hemimysis anomala in Lake Ontario are broadly omnivorous	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Hemimysis anomala is a recent invader to North American aquatic ecosystems and is spreading rapidly throughout the Great Lakes region. This is the first littoral mysid in the North American Great Lakes; and, as such, the ecosystem effects are unknown and could be substantial. These effects depend on the role of Hemimysis in the food web and, therefore, on its diet. We examined the stomach contents of two life stages of Hemimysis from two sites in Lake Ontario during the growing season (May-November 2010). We also report the relationship between zooplankton hard parts and size for a number of potential prey species to allow the back-calculation of prey lengths from stomach contents. Both juvenile (2-5 mm) and adult Hemimysis (5-11 mm) were omnivorous, consuming phytoplankton, zooplankton, and benthos when available. However, adults appeared slightly more carnivorous and incorporated larger prey in their diets. Hemimysis were able to consume zooplankton prey up to 30% of their own length, including Bythotrephes longimanus and Cercopagis pengoi. Daphnia and Bosmina were selected over other prey by both juvenile and adult Hemimysis and were most common in stomachs during July and September when their abundances in the zooplankton were highest. Measurements of delta C-13 and delta N-15 corroborated stomach content materials, indicating an omnivorous diet which included benthic and pelagic sources. Omnivory by Hemimysis is typical of mysids in general and makes them less sensitive to seasonal dynamics of preferred prey items. (C) 2018 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Trophic compression of lake food webs under hydrologic disturbance	ECOSPHERE												The need to protect biostructure is increasingly recognized, yet empirical studies of how human exploits affect ecological networks are rare. Studying the effects of variation in human disturbance intensity from decades past can help us understand and anticipate ecosystem change under alleviated or amplified disturbance over decades to come. Here, we use stable isotopes and an innovative analytical approach to compare the food webs of two akin lake ecosystems subject to disparate water use regimes, a pervasive, yet unappreciated stressor. We show that intensive water use (persistent, early season, rapid lake-level drawdown) can compress trophic diversity by 46%, necessitating reorganization of biostructural elements configuring lake food webs. Compression occurred over the delta C-13 axis indicating erosion of basal trophic diversity, but food chain length remained intact over the period and intensity of disturbance examined. This study demonstrates the potential for water use, like other disturbances (warming, eutrophication, and invasive species), to mute opportunity for benthic-pelagic coupling and benefits to lake food webs and the inherent capacity of lake ecosystems to adapt to stress. Trophically compressed lakes may be less able to adapt to intensified water use.																			2150-8925					JUN	2018	9	6							e02304	10.1002/ecs2.2304	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2304													WOS:000439997600020

Three priority control phthalates, namely dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), and dibutyl phthalate (DBP), were determined in 45 water samples from the largest drinking water source in Jilin Province. Chromophoric-dissolved organic matter (CDOM), which are composed of complex compounds and are a proxy for water quality, can be monitored using a fluorometer. This study attempted to understand the correlations of the CDOM fluorescence regional integration (FRI) components with PAEs and CDOM characteristics under seasonal and spatial variations in the Erlong Lake. The characteristics of the CDOM absorption parameters in different water samples showed a higher aromatic content and molecular weight in October because of increased terrestrial inputs. The sigma 3PAEs concentrations ranged from 0.231 mg L-1 to 0.435 mg L-1 in water, and DEP contributed to more than 90% of the sigma 3PAEs. The FRI method identified five fluorescence components: one tyrosine-like (R1), one tryptophan-like (R2), one fulvic-like (R3), one microbial protein-like (R4), and one humic-like (R5) component. However, significant relationships exist between DEP and R3 (R-2 = 0.78, p < 0.001), R4 (R-2 = 0.77, p < 0.001), and R5 (R-2 = 0.58, p < 0.001). Quantifying the relationship between CDOM and PAEs was highly significant, because the results will simplify the componential analysis of pollutants from a spatiotemporal perspective as compared to traditional chemical measurements. The human health risk assessment results revealed no human health risk (HQ < 1) in the Erlong Lake basin.

J	Pohl, E; Grenier, C; Vrac, M; Kageyama, M				Pohl, Eric; Grenier, Christophe; Vrac, Mathieu; Kageyama, Masa			Emerging climate signals in the Lena River catchment: a non-parametric statistical approach	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Climate change has far-reaching implications in permafrost-underlain landscapes with respect to hydrology, ecosystems, and the population's traditional livelihoods. In the Lena River catchment, eastern Siberia, changing climatic conditions and the associated impacts are already observed or expected. However, as climate change progresses the question remains as to how far we are along this track and when these changes will constitute a significant emergence from natural variability. Here we present an approach to investigate temperature and precipitation time series from observational records, reanalysis, and an ensemble of 65 climate model simulations forced by the RCP8.5 emission scenario. We developed a novel non-parametric statistical method to identify the time of emergence (ToE) of climate change signals, i.e. the time when a climate signal permanently exceeds its natural variability. The method is based on the Hellinger distance metric that measures the similarity of probability density functions (PDFs) roughly corresponding to their geometrical overlap. Natural variability is estimated as a PDF for the earliest period common to all datasets used in the study (1901-1921) and is then compared to PDFs of target periods with moving windows of 21 years at annual and seasonal scales. The method yields dissimilarities or emergence levels ranging from 0 % to 100 % and the direction of change as a continuous time series itself. First, we show-case the method's advantage over the Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric using a synthetic dataset that resembles signals observed in the utilized climate models. Then, we focus on the Lena River catchment, where significant environmental changes are already apparent. On average, the emergence of temperature has a strong onset in the 1970s with a monotonic increase thereafter for validated reanalysis data. At the end of the reanalysis dataset (2004), temperature distributions have emerged by 50 %-60 %. Climate model projections suggest the same evolution on average and 90 % emergence by 2040. For precipitation the analysis is less conclusive because of high uncertainties in existing reanalysis datasets that also impede an evaluation of the climate models. Model projections suggest hardly any emergence by 2000 but a strong emergence thereafter, reaching 60 % by the end of the investigated period (2089). The presented ToE method provides more versatility than traditional parametric approaches and allows for a detailed temporal analysis of climate signal evolutions. An original strategy to select the most realistic model simulations based on the available observational data significantly reduces the uncertainties resulting from the spread in the 65 climate models used. The method comes as a toolbox available at https://github.com/pohleric/toe_tools.

Poor recruitment is changing the structure and species composition of an old-growth hemlock-hardwood forest	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Anthropogenic factors such as elevated deer populations, invasive earthworms or climate change may alter old-growth forests of the Upper Midwest region of the United States. We examined demographic trends of woody species across all size classes over 35 years in a late-successional forest dominated by hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis) in Michigan's Upper Peninsula using two sets of permanent plots. For the duration of the study period, species that were less-preferred white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) forage, especially sugar maple, comprised a much higher fraction of all seedlings and saplings compared to overstory trees. The density of small sugar maple declined across the study period, but no other species became more abundant, creating a more open forest understory. By the most recent census, preferred species for deer browse had been nearly eliminated from the understory, and declines in unpreferred species such as sugar maple were also apparent. We found small changes in temperature (<0.5-1 degrees C rise in minimum and maximum temperatures depending on season) and precipitation (+/-28 mm depending on season) and little evidence of invasive earthworms impacts. Our results suggest that the sustained elevated deer density is shifting the structure and composition of this old-growth forest. A demographic model showed that if current recruitment, growth and mortality rates were to continue for 500 years the forest would eventually reach a new equilibrium with virtually no hemlock or yellow birch remaining.

This paper reviewed the CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) and its diffusion flux (FCO2) in karst surface aquatic ecosystems, mainly rivers, lakes, and reservoirs, and their influencing factors summarized the methods for monitoring CO2 emissions in karst aquatic ecosystems and discussed their adaptation conditions in karst areas. The pCO(2) and FCO2 decreased in the order of rivers > reservoirs > lakes, and the values in karst lakes were eventually significantly lower than those in global lakes. The pCO(2) and FCO2 of karst aquatic ecosystems had patterns of variation with diurnal, seasonal, water depth and hydrological cycles, and spatial and temporal heterogeneity. The sources of CO2 in karst waters are influenced by both internal and external sources, and the key spatial and temporal factors affecting the CO2 emissions from karst rivers, lakes, and reservoirs were determined in terms of physicochemical indicators, biological factors, and biogenic elements; additionally, the process of human activity interference on CO2 emissions was discussed. Finally, a conceptual model illustrating the impacts of urban development, agriculture, mining, and dam construction on the CO2 emissions at the karst surface aquatic ecosystem is presented. Meanwhile, based on the disadvantages existing in current research, we proposed several important research fields related to CO2 emissions from karst surface aquatic ecosystems.

According to the basal radiocarbon dating of the lake sediment cores, these lakes were formed around 17,000-15,000 cal yr BP. High resolution diatom analyses were carried out together with loss-on-ignition (LOI) and biogenic silica (BiSi) measurements on the lakes. Comparison of the proxy results suggests that despite the different slope aspect, water-depth and basin parameters, diatom assemblage changes show clear synchrony. The most remarkable changes in the aquatic ecosystems were observed around 6500 cal yr BP on the northern slope and around 6100 cal yr BP on the southern slope during the Holocene. Evidences for sharp concomitant shifts were found between 9200-9000 and 3200-3000 cal yr BP in the siliceous algal communities on both slopes. The Late Glacial/Holocene boundary was not pronounced in the shallow lakes, but was significant in a deep lake. The signs of a dry and bipartite Younger Dryas (GS-1) were evident, but floristic changes differed in the lakes. Principal component analyses explained very similar variances along the first and second axes for three lakes, while the fourth lake (Lake Bucura) proved less sensitive to climate change due to the dominance of moss-inhabiting diatom assemblages. Lake level changes have only been reconstructed on the basis of diatom life forms in one of the deep lakes (Lake Gales). High lake levels were inferred between 9300-9000 and 3000-1700 cal yr BP. In addition to LOI, biogenic silica content (BiSi) was measured on the sediments of the northern slope and pointed to different seasonal biological productivities; increasing LOI was often coupled with low BiSi values.

Trophic interrelationships between the exotic Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus and indigenous tilapiine cichlids in a subtropical African river system (Limpopo River, South Africa)	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												The stable isotope ratio and seasonal changes in diet of two indigenous (Oreochromis mossambicus, Tilapia rendalli) and one exotic (Oreochromis niloticus) tilapiine cichlids in the subtropical Limpopo River, South Africa were investigated to determine patterns of resource partitioning. Stomach contents of O. niloticus and O. mossambicus indicated high dietary overlap across size class, habitat and season, with both species primarily feeding on vegetative detritus. However, stable isotope analysis revealed that the two Oreochromis species had different stable isotope ratios derived from different food sources. The relatively delta C-13-depleted O. niloticus indicates a phytoplankton-based diet, while the delta C-13-enriched O. mossambicus indicates a macrophagous diet dominated by vegetative detritus and periphyton. The high similarity in stomach contents and the interspecific differences in isotopic composition reveal fine-scale patterns of food resource partitioning that could be achieved through selective feeding. Tilapia rendalli was largely macrophagous and fed mainly on aquatic macrophytes and had a low dietary overlap with both O. niloticus and O. mossambicus. In the Limpopo River, detritus and algae are probably the most abundant food resources and the causal factors responsible for the observed patterns of resource partitioning among the tilapiines are usually difficult to ascertain. Fish may be able to perceive food resources in terms of the dynamics that determine their availability. Detailed studies of variation in food resource availability and fish habitat use within the system are needed to evaluate this hypothesis.

Spatial, seasonal, and diel forest floor moisture dynamics in Jeffrey pine-white fir forests of the Lake Tahoe Basin, USA	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Variation in consumption of forest floor fuels in temperate coniferous forests have been linked to variation in fire effects, including mineral soil heating, tree mortality, and erosion. Moisture content of forest floor fuels influences consumption and therefore is a primary predictor of fire behavior and effects. To better understand spatial and temporal variability in forest floor moisture, we collected fuels from each forest floor horizon, cones, and woody fuels in four long-unburned Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi) - white fir (Abies concolor) stands within the Lake Tahoe Basin, USA. To isolate the effects of spatial position within a stand, fuel moisture was measured at the base of trees, beneath the crown drip line, and beyond the crown in open gaps across a fire season. We compared spatial moisture dynamics at the m(2), ha, and Basin scales and temporal dynamics at the day (one 24-h sampling period), month, and year scales (one site was measured in 2009 and 2010). Duff moisture varied spatially within stands, whereas moisture in litter, cones, and woody fuels did not. Forest floor moisture differed between years while woody fuel moisture did not. The variability in field results underscore the importance of measuring duff moisture content, as well as 10-h woody fuel moisture. A better understanding of the complexity of forest fuels will help land managers manage fire in Tahoe Basin forests and inform the understanding of fuels dynamics in other temperate coniferous forests.

The relative abundance of major epiphytic algae groups was determined with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the structures and dynamics of epiphytic bacteria were assessed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis. Results showed that the biomass of epiphytic microbes was not significant difference between the two sites, and the analysis of similarity found no significant intra-lake heterogeneity in community structure, but the temporal heterogeneity of epiphytic microbes was significant, which linked to the growth state of submerged macrophytes and water temperature. The difference in community structure between June and August was larger than that between August and November at each site, indicating that the growth status of submerged macrophytes has a greater impact on the community structure of epiphytic microbes than the seasonal variation of environmental conditions.

J	MacKay, M; Seglenieks, F				MacKay, Murray; Seglenieks, Frank			On the simulation of Laurentian Great Lakes water levels under projections of global climate change	CLIMATIC CHANGE												A new method is proposed to estimate future net basin supplies and lake levels for the Laurentian Great Lakes based on GCM projections of global climate change. The method first dynamically downscales the GCM simulation with a regional climate model, and then bias-corrects the simulated net basin supply in order to be used directly in a river-routing/lake level scheme. This technique addresses two weaknesses in the traditional approach, whereby observed sequences of climate variables are perturbed with fixed ratios or differences derived directly from GCMs in order to run evaporation and runoff models. Specifically, (1) land surface-atmosphere feedback processes are represented, and (2) changes in variability can be analyzed with the new approach. The method is demonstrated with a single, high resolution simulation, where small changes in future mean lake levels for all the upper Great Lakes are found, and an increase in seasonal range-especially for Lake Superior-is indicated. Analysis of a small ensemble of eight lower resolution regional climate model simulations supports these findings. In addition, a direct comparison with the traditional approach based on the same GCM projections used as the driving simulations in this ensemble shows that the new method indicates smaller declines in level for all the upper Great Lakes than has been reported previously based on the traditional method, though median differences are only a few centimetres in each case.																			0165-0009	1573-1480				MAR	2013	117	1-2					55	67		10.1007/s10584-012-0560-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-012-0560-z													WOS:000316128700005

Its water quality is mainly affected by the supplying rivers and other water sources. The primary source is the Zala River. The water of this river used to be filtered by the Kis-Balaton wetland (KBW) before entering Lake Balaton at Keszthely Bay. In the course of the nineteenth century, water level modifications at KBW shrank and It lost its full capacity to function as a filter for the Zala's waters, so the nutrient load of Lake Balaton greatly increased, and its water quality started to deteriorate This is the reason an artificial extended wetland called the Kis-Balaton water protection system (KBWPS) had to be constructed-to retain the inorganic nutrients at the mouth of the Zala River and stop the further degradation of Balaton's water quality. In this study. Morlet wavelet spectrum (periodicity) analysis and autocorrelation (memory) analysis were used with weekly chemical, biological and physical data for the KBWPS for the period 1993-2007 We compared the periodicity and the memory of the parameters in the two different habitats of the KBWPS and the Zala River. We also analyzed the tracking capability of the periodical seasons of the two phases (the complete Phase I. and the incomplete Phase II) and the river The results showed that the incomplete Phase II is unable to conserve the periodicity and sustain long memory because of the shading provided by the macrophyte cover and the extra inflows In conclusion, we were able to point out the dependence of the system's processes on temperature and climate conditions with methods that have not yet been used for this kind of purpose.

Morphodynamics of intermittently open-closed coastal lagoon entrances: New insights and a conceptual model	MARINE GEOLOGY												Ocean entrances to coastal lakes and lagoons are a complex, sensitive and important part of the coastal environment. They provide estuarine water exchange between inland waterways and the open ocean, and are increasingly the focus of intense urban and industrial development. Coastal lagoons that are only intermittently connected to the ocean are particularly sensitive. During periods of closure, water quality issues are exacerbated, along with the increased risk of flooding. Mechanical clearance was undertaken in 2006 at the ocean entrance to Narrabeen Lagoon, Sydney, Australia. Historically, this site has intermittently opened and closed (both naturally and mechanically), with the ingress of marine sand into the entrance restricting water exchange between the estuary and the ocean. This 'instantaneous reset' of the system provided a unique opportunity to monitor and quantify generic inlet sedimentation processes and mechanisms. An intensive data collection campaign was undertaken for one entire year following the clearance. This dataset includes current and water level measurements, calculation of the alongshore sediment supply, and regular, highly detailed morphological surveys of the infilling lagoon entrance system. This contribution utilises this unique dataset to quantify the sediment ingress volumes, rates and pathways within the accreting flood-tide delta of the lagoon entrance. It was found that ingress of sand into the system proceeds via a rapid landward infilling process (as opposed to backfilling toward the ocean) with the evolution of the flood-tide delta occurring in distinct phases. The location of the divergence point of the flood tidal current, the amount of available accommodation space within the entrance system and the influence of storm events, were found to be key factors in the evolving morphodynamics of this intermittently open-closed coastal lagoon.

Poyang Lake is one of the largest freshwater lakes globally and is one of the few that remain naturally connected to the Yangtze River. To investigate the full hydrological conditions (extreme high and low discharge) of Poyang Lake outflow under current bathymetric conditions, a large-scale 1D- and 2D-coupled high-resolution hydrodynamic model of the Poyang Lake basin-Yangtze River system was developed. We simulated the outflow and water levels of Poyang Lake under nine different extreme hydrological scenarios with high precision and computational efficiency. We propose (1) a novel partition calibration method to characterize the roughness coefficient of large water bodies in complicated geographical terrain both for wet and dry seasons; (2) a new method for setting initial conditions for hydrodynamic simulation of large water bodies subject to strong hydrological regulation. Results indicated that (1) maximum outflow and water levels will reach 37,200 m(3)/s and 22.28 m when Poyang Lake basin floodwater coincides with flooding on the Yangtze River; (2) precipitation over the lake has increased outflow but this has had very limited influence on its changing hydrological pattern; (3) the effect of hydrological conditions within the system differs for both the lake outflow and water level. The research provides important reference conditions for the application of the InfoWorks ICM model in future applications and studies of large river-lake systems.

These near-closest-approach observations have the highest signal-to-noise, the finest spatial resolution, and the least atmospheric influence of any near-infrared lake observation to date. We use the large, spatially flat, and low-albedo interior of Ontario Lacus as a calibration target allowing LIS to derive ail analytical atmospheric correction for emission angle. The dark lake interior is surrounded by two separate annuli that follow the lake interior's Contours. The inner annulus is uniformly dark, but not so much as the interior lake, and is generally 5-10 kilometers wide at the lake's southeastern margin. We propose that it represents wet lakebed sediments exposed by either tidal sloshing of the lake or seasonal methane loss leading to lower lake-volume. the exterior annulus is bright and shows a spectrum consistent with a relatively low water-ice content relative to the rest of Titan. It may represent fine-grained condensate deposits from a past era of higher lake level. Together, the annuli seem to indicate that the lake level for Ontario Lacus has changed over time.

Water and sediment samples were collected during flood season (from May to September) and non-flood season (from October to April) at 10 representative points along the truck stream. The electron microscope, the laser direct infrared chemical imaging system (LDIR), and the scanning electron microscope (SEM) were used to observe and quantify the colour and shape of the MPs, to identify the number, size, and polymer composition of the MPs, and to observe the microstructures of typical MP particles, respectively. The polymer risk index (RI) model and the pollution load index (PLI) model were used to assess the polymer-related risks and the overall extent of MP pollution in the river, respectively. Analysis of MP abundance for different sampling points showed that the water of Shiwuli River had an average abundance of MPs of 8.4 & PLUSMN; 2.5 particles/L during the flood season and 5.8 & PLUSMN; 1.7 particles/L during the non-flood season; the sediment had an average abundance of MPs of 78.9 & PLUSMN; 8.3 particles/kg during the flood season and 63.9 & PLUSMN; 7.1 particles/kg during the non-flood season. The abundance of MPs of different points was investigated. Result show that the more abundances of MPs were found at confluences with tributaries (S4, S5, and S6), where they are also close to the residential and industrial development, while lower values were found in agricultural areas (S8) and wetland ecological regions (S9 and S10). In water, the maximum appeared at S5 with 21.7 & PLUSMN; 4.6 particles/L during the flood season and 15.9 & PLUSMN; 4.2 particles/L during the non-flood season, respectively; the minimum appeared at S9 with 1.8 & PLUSMN; 1.0 particles/L during the flood season and 2.2 & PLUSMN; 0.4 particles/L during the non-flood season, respectively. In sediment, the maximum appeared at S5 with 174.1 & PLUSMN; 10.1 particles/kg during the flood season and 143.6 & PLUSMN; 10.4 particles/kg during the non-flood season, respectively; the minimum appeared at S8 with 10.3 & PLUSMN; 2.8 particles/kg during the flood season and at S9 with 12.1 & PLUSMN; 3.2 particles/kg during the non-flood season, respectively. MP characteristics were also studied. Results show that the MPs mainly exhibited a fibroid morphology (27.90-34%), and red-coloured particles (19.10%) within the smaller size less than 500 & mu;m (38.60%) were more prevalent. Additionally, the result of LDIR scanning shows that a total of eleven types of MP polymers were found in the river water and sediment, including acrylates (ACR), chlorinated polyethylene (CPE), ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyurethane (PU), polyvinylchloride (PVC), polyamide (PA), and silicon. The most common particle was PE (19.3-21.6%). Furthermore, the environmental risk assessment demonstrated that the PS polymer posed a Level-III risk in the water samples and a Level-II risk in the sediment samples from the Shiwuli River. The remaining polymer types exhibited Level-I risk. The PLIzone value for water was 2.24 during the flood season, indicating heavy pollution, and 1.66 during the non-flood season, indicating moderate pollution. Similarly, the PLIzone value for sediments was 2.34 during the flood season and 1.91 during the non-flood season, both suggesting a heavy pollution. These findings highlight the potential risk posed by MP pollution in the Shiwuli River to the quality of drinking water sources in Chaohu Lake in Hefei. They provide valuable insights into management, pollution control, and integrated management strategies pertaining to MPs in urban inland rivers in Hefei.																				2073-4441				JUL	2023	15	13							2330	10.3390/w15132330	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15132330													WOS:001031080400001
J	Matanzima, J; Marowa, I; Nhiwatiwa, T				Matanzima, Joshua; Marowa, Ivan; Nhiwatiwa, Tamuka			Negative human-crocodile interactions in Kariba, Zimbabwe: data to support potential mitigation strategies	ORYX												Interactions between people and wild animals often result in negative impacts, and different views on the management of such interactions can lead to conflicts. Both intentional and unintentional negative human-wildlife interactions are increasing problems in many places where people share space with wild animals. Here we focus on negative interactions between people and Nile crocodiles Crocodylus niloticus in and around Lake Kariba in Zimbabwe. In the study area, crocodile attacks on people occur frequently, leading to people being injured or killed, which in turn prompts retaliatory actions against crocodiles. However, despite the negative impact of such interactions on both people and crocodiles, little is known about the spatio-temporal patterns of crocodile attacks or environmental conditions under which attacks occur. We collected information about crocodile attacks on people that occurred during 2000-2020, including the date, time, season and location of attacks, the age of victims and the activities they were carrying out when attacks occurred, and water conditions during attacks. We analysed these data to discern patterns and trends of crocodile attacks on people. Attacks occurred in clear as well as turbid water, and nearly half of all reported attacks were at night or in the early morning. The locations with the highest number of recorded attacks were Nyanyana and Charara lakeside, and the fewest attacks occurred at Andora harbour. Most victims were 26-40 years old, and most were attacked in the dry-hot season, while they were fishing. Our findings can be used to design area-specific mitigation strategies to reduce negative human-crocodile interactions.					; Matanzima, Joshua/JBI-9889-2023; Marowa, Ivan/JDC-9546-2023; Nhiwatiwa, Tamuka/KPB-2697-2024	Marowa, Ivan/0000-0002-4119-5807; Matanzima, Joshua/0000-0002-9709-9005; 													0030-6053	1365-3008				JUL	2023	57	4					452	456		10.1017/S003060532200014X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S003060532200014X													WOS:001093462900021

During the past 50 years, the climate in the Siling Co lake area has become continuously warmer and wetter, which may have further caused the increase in Siling Co lake area. Based on the Siling Co lake area (2003 to 2013) and climate data acquired from the Xainza and Baingoin meteorological stations (covering 1966 to 2013), we analyzed the delayed responses of lake area changes to climate changes through grey relational analysis. The following results were obtained: (1) The Siling Co lake area exhibited a rapid expansion trend from 2003 to 2013. The lake area increased to 2318 km(2), with a growth ratio of 14.6% and an annual growth rate of 26.84 km(2).year(-1); (2) The rate of air temperature increase was different in the different seasons. The rate in the cold season was about 0.41 degrees C per ten years and 0.32 degrees C in hot season. Precipitation evidently increased, with a change rate of 17.70 mm per ten years in the hot season and a slight increase with a change rate of 2.36 mm per ten years in the cold season. Pan evaporation exhibited evidently decreasing trends in both the hot and cold seasons, with rates of -33.35 and -14.84 mm per ten years, respectively; (3) An evident delayed response of lake area change to climate change is observed, with a delay time of approximately one to two years.																				1660-4601				NOV	2015	12	11					13886	13900		10.3390/ijerph121113886	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph121113886								26528996					WOS:000365645500016

Indigenous arsenic(V)-reducing microbial communities in redox-fluctuating near-surface sediments of the Mekong Delta	GEOBIOLOGY												Arsenic (As) cycling within soils and sediments of the Mekong Delta of Cambodia is affected by drastic redox fluctuations caused by seasonal monsoons. Extensive flooding during monsoon seasons creates anoxic soil conditions that favor anaerobic microbial processes, including arsenate [As(V)] respirationa process contributing to the mobilization of As. Repeated oxidation and reduction in near-surface sediments, which contain 10-40mgkg(-1) As, lead to the eventual downward movement of As to the underlying aquifer. Amplification of a highly conserved functional gene encoding dissimilatory As(V) reductase, arrA, can be used as a molecular marker to detect the genetic potential for As(V) respiration in environmental samples. However, few studies have successfully amplified arrA from sediments without prior enrichment, which can drastically shift community structure. In the present study, we examine the distribution and diversity of arrA genes amplified from multiple sites within the Cambodian Mekong Delta as a function of near-surface depth (10, 50, 100, 200, and 400cm), where sediments undergo seasonal redox fluctuations. We report successful amplification of 302 arrA gene sequences (72 OTUs) from near-surface Cambodian soils (without prior enrichment or stimulation with carbon amendments), where a large majority (>70%) formed a well-supported clade that is phylogenetically distinct from previously reported sequences from Cambodia and other South and Southeast Asian sediments, with highest sequence similarity to known Geobacter species capable of As(V) respiration, further supporting the potentially important role of Geobacter sp. in arsenic mobilization in these regions.

Adjacent regions concurrently experienced droughts and floods, and individual areas transitioned rapidly from pluvial to drought conditions and vice versa. Such events had major impacts; for example, damages from floods in the Assiniboine River Basin (ARB) have exceeded $1 billion, and forest fires ravaged the town of Slave Lake, Alberta. This study first characterizes, and then assesses, these devastating natural hazards in terms of their physical processes (across multiple spatial and temporal scales) related to both the spatially contrasting precipitation states and rapid temporal transitions between these states. Subtle differences in large-scale atmospheric flow had marked impacts on precipitation. Primary factors controlling the distribution and amount of precipitation included the location and persistence of key surface and upper-air features, as well as their interaction. Additionally, multiple events-rather than individual extremes-were responsible for the flooding over the Saskatchewan River Basin and the ARB. Very heavy rainfall events (a parts per thousand yen25 mm d(-1)) accounted for up to 55 % of warm season rain at some locations, and the frequency of heavy rainfall events was critical for determining whether a region experienced drought or pluvial conditions. This study has increased our knowledge of the characteristics, impacts and mechanisms of rapidly transitioning disparate precipitation states on the Canadian Prairies and will aid in better understanding both past and projected future hydro-climatic extremes in the region.					; Brimelow, Jason/MBG-4021-2025	Kochtubajda, Bohdan/0000-0001-6967-575X; Hanesiak, John/0000-0001-5839-2295													0921-030X	1573-0840				SEP	2014	73	2					761	785		10.1007/s11069-014-1107-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-014-1107-6													WOS:000340490100036
J	Wang, F; Wang, X; Zhao, Y; Yang, ZF				Wang, Fei; Wang, Xuan; Zhao, Ying; Yang, Zhifeng			Temporal variations of NDVI and correlations between NDVI and hydro-climatological variables at Lake Baiyangdian, China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY												In this paper, correlations between vegetation dynamics (represented by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)) and hydro-climatological factors were systematically studied in Lake Baiyangdian during the period from April 1998 to July 2008. Six hydro-climatological variables including lake volume, water level, air temperature, precipitation, evaporation, and sunshine duration were used, as well as extracted NDVI series data representing vegetation dynamics. Mann-Kendall tests were used to detect trends in NDVI and hydro-climatological variation, and a Bayesian information criterion method was used to detect their abrupt changes. A redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to determine the major hydro-climatological factors contributing to NDVI variation at monthly, seasonal, and yearly scales. The results were as follows: (1) the trend analysis revealed that only sunshine duration significantly increased over the study period, with an inter-annual increase of 3.6 h/year (p < 0.01), whereas inter-annual NDVI trends were negligible; (2) the abrupt change detection showed that a major hydro-climatological change occurred in 2004, when abrupt changes occurred in lake volume, water level, and sunlight duration; and (3) the RDA showed that evaporation and temperature were highly correlated with monthly changes in NDVI. At larger time scales, however, water level and lake volume gradually became more important than evaporation and precipitation in terms of their influence on NDVI. These results suggest that water availability is the most important factor in vegetation restoration. In this paper, we recommend a practical strategy for lake ecosystem restoration that takes into account changes in NDVI.

The model was modified, as a fish sub-phase was included. Also the emission flux was added to study the impact of the lindane prohibition in simulation #1. Sensitivity analysis was conducted for both static and dynamic parameters, while in uncertainty analysis, both basic Monte Carlo and Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods were undertaken for simulation #2 and the results were compared. Simulated data were consistent with the observations in simulation #1. Seasonal patterns in various media were also successfully modeled in simulation #2 and factors leading to this seasonality were discussed. Atmospheric advection input was the main source. In simulation #2, approximately 36 kilogram (kg) of gamma-HCH in Lake Chaohu was removed per year. In addition, 31 kg of gamma-HCH was added to Lake Chaohu by air-water interface fluxes, and 13 kg of gamma-HCH was added to the sediment by water-sediment interface. Sensitivity of static and dynamic parameters was discussed. Uncertainty analysis by the basic Monte Carlo method for simulation #1 showed that the dispersion for each media was less than two orders of magnitude. Higher dispersions in fish and two sub-phases of the sediment were attributed to a larger variation in the relevant parameters. The MCMC method for simulation #2 eliminated 77% of the model true uncertainty in water ascertained by basic Monte Carlo method and significant elimination in other phases can be speculated. It is suggested that rather than calibrating the model, the main function of the MCMC for fugacity model should be to avoid overestimating uncertainty in model prediction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Stable isotopes of water show deep seasonal recharge in northern bogs and fens	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Ground water recharge is assumed to occur primarily at raised bog crests in northern peatlands, which are globally significant terrestrial carbon reservoirs. We synoptically surveyed vertical profiles of peat pore water delta O-18 and delta H-2 from a range of bog and fen landforms across the Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatlands, northern Minnesota. Contrary to our expectations, we find that local-scale recharge penetrates to not only the basal peat at topographically high bog crests but also transitional Sphagnum lawns and low-lying fen water tracks. Surface landscape characteristics appear to control the isotopic composition of the deeper pore waters (depths >= 0.5m), which are partitioned into discrete ranges of delta O-18 on the basis of landform type (mean +/- standard deviation for bog crests = -11.9 +/- 0.4%, lawns = -10.6 +/- 0.1%, fenwater tracks= -8.8 +/- 1.0%). Fen water tracks have a shallow free-water surface that is seasonally enriched by isotope fractionating evaporation, fingerprinting recharge to underlying pore waters at depths >= 3m. Isotope mass balance calculations indicate on average 12% of the waters we sampled from the basal peat of the fen water tracks was lost to surface evaporation, which occurred prior to advection and dispersion into the underlying formation. These new data provide direct support for the hypothesis that methane production in deeper peat strata is fuelled by the downward transport of labile carbon substrates from the surface of northern peat basins.

Part I: Unconfined groundwater of the Amu Darya Delta - Interactions with surface waters	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The Aral Sea, which has been affected by lake level lowering of approximately 25 m and a salinity increase from 10 to >100 g/l since 1963, represents, along with the Amu Dary Delta a dynamic hydrological system under an arid climate regime. The system receives river water inflow at high seasonal and inter-annual variability from remote alpine source areas. In the Amu Darya Delta, there is a distinct salinity contrast between the low-salinity river water (similar to 1 g/l) and the salinity of the unconfined GW (GW(unconf): 10-95 g/l). The GW(unconf) levels are predominantly controlled by the seepage of the river water inflow and GW discharge into the shrinking Aral Sea. In June 2009 and August 2009, we sampled water from various sources including surface waters, GW(unconf), lake water and soil leachates for chemical analyses. Evaporative enrichment, precipitation/dissolution of gypsum and precipitation of calcite drive the GW(unconf) to an NaCl(SO4) water type presenting a positive correlation between Na and SO4. We model the hydrochemical evolution of the GW(unconf) in a box model which considers the capillary rise of near-surface GW, the precipitation of minerals in the unsaturated horizon and the seasonal re-flushing of adhesive residual brines and soluble salts. The model documents a rapid increase in salinity over a few annual cycles. Furthermore, the model simulations demonstrate the importance of the aeolian redistribution of soluble salts on the hydrochemical GW evolution. In a lab experiment, halite, hexahydrite and star-keyite are precipitated during the late stages of evaporative enrichment from a representative local brine. Processes specific to different water compartments plausibly explain the variations of selected element ratios. For example, the precipitation of low-Sr calcite in irrigation canals and natural river branches of the delta lowers Ca/Sr. The dissolution of gypsum in soils (Ca/Sr mole ratio similar to 150) and the possible precipitation of SrSO4 associated with Sr-depletion in adhesive residual brines increases Ca/Sr in seepage and re-increases Ca/Sr in the unconfined GW. Aral Sea water, which receives high-Ca/Sr surface and groundwater inflow, developed due to continued precipitation of high-Ca/Sr calcite the almost lowest Ca/Sr ratio (similar to 25) over time. We observed spatial variations in the GW(unconf) composition: (i) ammonium levels increase strongly due to interaction with lake sediments rich in organic matter and (ii) distinct increases in levels of nitrate, U, Mo and Se locally reflect oxygenation when GW levels decrease. The Amu Darya Delta acts as a sink for boron (uptake via terrestrial vegetation) and a source for bromide (release by degradation of organically-bound Br). Our results concerning the hydrochemical evolution of the GW(unconf) and additional data from the Aral Sea constrain the parameter 'GW discharge' in water budget models of the lake and improve the basis for palaeoclimatic interpretations of sediment records from the Aral Sea.

Climate change is expected to increase soil temperature, affecting soil moisture and the carbon storage and sink potential of many Arctic ecosystems. Additionally, increased temperatures can increase thermokarst erosion and flooding in some areas. Our goal was to determine the effects that water table shifts would have on the CO2 sink potential of the Alaskan Coastal Plain tundra. To evaluate the effects of different water regimes, we used a large hydrological manipulation at Barrow, Alaska, where we maintained flooded, drained, and intermediate water levels in a naturally drained thaw lake basin over a period of three seasons: one pretreatment (2006) and two treatment (2007-2008) seasons. To assess CO2 flux components, we used 24 h chamber-based measurements done on a weekly basis. Increased water table strongly lowered ecosystem respiration (ER) by reducing soil oxygen availability. Flooding decreased gross primary productivity (GPP), most likely by submerging mosses and graminoid photosynthetic leaf area. A decrease in water table increased GPP and ER; however, the increase in root and microbial activity was greater than the increase in photosynthesis, negatively affecting net ecosystem exchange. In the short term, ER is the CO2 flux component that responds most strongly to changes in water availability. Our results suggest that drying of the Alaskan Coastal Plain tundra in the short term could double ER rates, shifting the historic role of some Arctic ecosystems from a sink to a source of CO2.					; Oechel, Walter/F-9361-2010; Oberbauer, Steven/JNE-2672-2023	Olivas, Paulo/0000-0002-6308-4470; Oechel, Walter/0000-0002-3504-026X; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				DEC 9	2010	115								G00I05	10.1029/2009JG001254	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2009JG001254													WOS:000285258300002

The identified P-cycling-related microbes include phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria (PSB) (dominant of Bacillus, Thiobacillus and Acinetobacter), sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) (dominant of Sva0081_ sediment_ group, norank_ c__ Thermodesulfovibrionia and Desulfatiglans) and iron-reducing bacteria (FeRB) (dominant of Geothermobacter, Anaeromyxobacter, Thermoanaerobaculum and Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1). Increased PSB and reduced proportions of iron-aluminum-bound P (Fe/Al-P) and calcium-bound P (Ca- P) from the benthic stage to initial cyanobacterial growth indicated that internal phosphorus was released through the solubilization of Fe/Al-P and Ca-P by PSB. Growth of cyanobacteria was accompanied by cyanobacteria death, deposition, and degradation during early algal blooms, which increased SRB caused by high organic matter and the net deposition of phosphorus in the western lake. Conversely, phosphorus release in eastern lake was observed because of organic phosphorus mineralization. High linear discriminant analysis effect size of SRB and FeRB and the decreased Fe/Al-P in sediments indicated sulfide-mediated chemical iron reduction (SCIR) and FeRB-mediated microbial iron reduction mechanisms for internal phosphorus release during late algal blooms. The observed seasonal pattern of P-cycling- related microbes and its mediation on internal phosphorus release provides a foundation for internal P management in Lake Chaohu.<br /> (c) 2025 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Including independent estimates and uncertainty to quantify total abundance of fish migrating in a large river system: walleye (Sander vitreus) in the Maumee River, Ohio	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Walleye (Sander vitreus) in Lake Erie is a valuable and migratory species that spawns in tributaries. We used hydroacoustic sampling, gill net sampling, and Bayesian state-space modeling to estimate the spawning stock abundance, characterize size and sex structure, and explore environmental factors cuing migration of walleye in the Maumee River for 2011 and 2012. We estimated the spawning stock abundance to be between 431 000 and 1 446 000 individuals in 2011 and between 386 400 and 857 200 individuals in 2012 (95% Bayesian credible intervals). A back-calculation from a concurrent larval fish study produced an estimate of 78 000 to 237 000 spawners for 2011. The sex ratio was skewed towards males early in the spawning season but approached 1: 1 later, and larger individuals entered the river earlier in the season than smaller individuals. Walleye migration was greater during low river discharge and intermediate temperatures. Our approach to estimating absolute abundance and uncertainty as well as characterization of the spawning stock could improve assessment and management of this species, and our methodology is applicable to other diadromous populations.					; Vandergoot, Christopher/JAO-1190-2023	DuFour, Mark/0000-0001-6930-7666; 													0706-652X					MAY	2013	70	5					803	814		10.1139/cjfas-2012-0484	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2012-0484													WOS:000319257700015

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate 1) the effect of water level on the brine composition, 2) the effect of gradual lake desiccation on SC formation, mineralogy and stratification and 3) the SC formation and mineral precipitation in a lab-scale experiment. In 2019, brine and SC samples were collected in July and October, and analyzed for the prevailing ions and minerals. For the simulation experiment, brine samples were added in two vessels and the change in pH, ionic composition and SC evolution were investigated. The wet season brine type changed from Mg-Na-Cl to Na-Mg-Cl and remained unchanged throughout the dry season. In vessels, Mg2+ and Na+ became dominant ions in the surface and subsurface layers respectively, while Cl- remained roughly unchanged; and minerals gradually precipitated from the margins to the center of the vessels based on their solubility. Similar to the lake SCs, in the simulation vessels, halite dominated the SCs and bischofite (MgCl2 & BULL;6H2O) was detected in most of the vessels' layers. The formation of oldhamite (CaS) in both in the vessels and the lake SC indicated the prevalence of low oxygen conditions. In the simulation vessel, Calciolangbeinite (K2CaSO4(H2O)4) was one of the first minerals to form along with halite, while Starkeyite (MgSO4 & BULL;(H2O)4) and Kieserite (MgSO4 & BULL;(H2O)) were the latest minerals to precipitate. The absence of magnesium sulfate minerals under natural conditions in both newly formed SCs in 2019 and those dated back to 2005, suggested that if the lake level continues to drop, magnesium sulfate minerals will be the final product of the brine. The existence of a dark silicate layer within SC stratification helped to investigate the evaporate deposition at the early stages of SC formation and after the catastrophic shrink. Based in the precipitation of a new layer on top of the submerged SC samples during 2019, a sedimentation rate between 10 and 30 mm/y is calculated with NaCl and CaS as major precipitants.					; Hamzehpour, Nikou/W-8674-2019	Hamzehpour, Nikou/0000-0001-6100-4644; 													0341-8162	1872-6887				OCT	2023	231								107310	10.1016/j.catena.2023.107310	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2023.107310		JUN 2023											WOS:001030698000001

Efficacy of algaecides for the proactive treatment of overwintering cyanobacteria	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Once established within a water resource, harmful algal blooms (HABs) can occur seasonally with an intense and rapid onset, giving water resource managers limited time to respond to lessen risks. An attractive strategy to decrease human, ecological, and economic risks from HABs is to implement proactive algaecide treatments applied to overwintering cyanobacteria (i.e., akinetes and quiescent vegetative cells) in sediments prior to the formation of a HAB; however, this approach is novel and very limited efficacy data exist. Therefore, the specific objectives of this research were to 1) evaluate copper- and peroxide-based algaecides, applied as single and repeat treatments at the bench scale, to identify effective proactive treatments, and 2) compare correlations between cell density and other response measurements (i.e., in vivo chlorophyll a and phycocyanin concentrations and percent benthic coverage), to identify informative metrics to assess overwintering cyanobacteria responses. Twelve treatment scenarios using copper- and peroxide-based algaecides were applied to sediments containing overwintering cyanobacteria prior to a 14 d incubation under favorable growth conditions. Responses of cyanobacteria in the planktonic (i.e., cell density, in vivo chlorophyll a and phycocyanin concentrations) and benthic (percent coverage) phases after a 14 d incubation were evaluated in treatments and controls. The HABforming cyanobacteria present after a 14 d incubation were: Aphanizomenon, Dolichospermum, Microcystis, Nostoc, and Planktonthrix. Successive treatments of copper sulfate (CuSulfate) followed by sodium carbonate peroxyhydrate (PeroxiSolid) (second algaecide applied after 24 h) as well as repeat applications of a single algaecide, PeroxiSolid (second treatment applied after 24 h) resulted in statistically significant (p & LE; 0.05; & alpha; = 0.05) declines in cell density relative to untreated controls. Planktonic cyanobacteria responses measured in terms of phycocyanin concentrations were strongly correlated with cyanobacteria density measurements (Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) = 0.89). Chlorophyll a concentrations and percent benthic coverage did not correlate with planktonic cyanobacteria density measurements (r = 0.37 and -0.49, respectively) and therefore, were unreliable metrics for cyanobacterial responses in this study. These data provide initial evidence of the efficacy of algaecides for treating overwintering cells in sediments and contribute to our overarching hypothesis that proactive treatments may delay the onset and intensity of HABs in impacted waterbodies.

A national health facility survey of malaria infection among febrile patients in Kenya, 2014	MALARIA JOURNAL												Background: The use of malaria infection prevalence among febrile patients at clinics has a potential to be a valuable epidemiological surveillance tool. However, routine data are incomplete and not all fevers are tested. This study was designed to screen all fevers for malaria infection in Kenya to explore the epidemiology of fever test positivity rates. Methods: Random sampling was used within five malaria epidemiological zones of Kenya (i.e., high lake endemic, moderate coast endemic, highland epidemic, seasonal low transmission and low risk zones). The selected sample was representative of the number of hospitals, health centres and dispensaries within each zone. Fifty patients with fever presenting to each sampled health facility during the short rainy season were screened for malaria infection using a rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Details of age, pregnancy status and basic demographics were recorded for each patient screened. Results: 10,557 febrile patients presenting to out-patient clinics at 234 health facilities were screened for malaria infection. 1633 (15.5%) of the patients surveyed were RDT positive for malaria at 124 (53.0%) facilities. Infection prevalence among non-pregnant patients varied between malaria risk zones, ranging from 0.6% in the low risk zone to 41.6% in the high lake endemic zone. Test positivity rates (TPR) by age group reflected the differences in the intensity of transmission between epidemiological zones. In the lake endemic zone, 6% of all infections were among children aged less than 1 year, compared to 3% in the coast endemic, 1% in the highland epidemic zone, less than 1% in the seasonal low transmission zone and 0% in the low risk zone. Test positivity rate was 31% among febrile pregnant women in the high lake endemic zone compared to 9% in the coast endemic and highland epidemic zones, 3.2% in the seasonal low transmission zone and zero in the low risk zone. Conclusion: Malaria infection rates among febrile patients, with supporting data on age and pregnancy status presenting to clinics in Kenya can provide invaluable epidemiological data on spatial heterogeneity of malaria and serve as replacements to more expensive community-based infection rates to plan and monitor malaria control.					; Macharia, Peter/E-2255-2015; Snow, Robert/AFR-1436-2022	Macharia, Peter M/0000-0003-3410-1881; Snow, Robert/0000-0003-3725-6088; Malinga, Josephine/0000-0003-3266-5042; 														1475-2875				DEC 8	2016	15								591	10.1186/s12936-016-1638-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12936-016-1638-2								27931229					WOS:000390384400003

Major correlates of mercury in small fish and common loons (Gavia immer) across four large study areas in Canada	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												We investigated mercury (Hg) concentrations in small fish (mainly yellow perch, Perca flavescens; similar to 60% of fish collected) and in blood of common loons (Gavia immer) that prey upon them during the breeding season on lakes in 4 large, widely separated study areas in Canada (>13 lakes per study area; total number of lakes = 93). Although surface sediments from lakes near a base metal smelter in Flin Flon, Manitoba had the highest Hg concentrations, perch and other small fish and blood of common loon chicks sampled from these same lakes had low Hg concentrations similar to those from uncontaminated reference lakes. Multiple regression modeling with AIC analysis indicated that lake pH was by far the most important single factor influencing perch Hg concentrations in lakes across the four study areas (R-2 = 0.29). The best model was a three-variable model (pH + alkalinity + sediment Se; Wi = 0.61, R-2 = 0.85). A single-variable model (fish Hg) best explained among-lake variability in loon chick blood Hg (Wi = 0.17; R-2 = 0.53). From a toxicological risk perspective, all lakes posing a potential Hg health risk for perch and possibly other small pelagic fish species (where mean fish muscle Hg concentrations exceeded 2.4 mu/g dry wt.), and for breeding common loons (where mean fish muscle Hg concentrations exceeded 0.8 mu/g dry wt., and loon chick blood Hg exceeded 1.4 gig dry wt) had pH < 6.7 and were located in eastern Canada.

Phosphorus fractions and fluxes in the soils of a free surface flow constructed wetland in Hong Kong	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												This study investigated the distribution of phosphorus (P) fractions in soils, and the magnitude and seasonal variations of P flux across the soil-water interface at the Hong Kong Wetland Park (HKWP), the largest free surface flow constructed wetland in the territory. Iron-bound P was the dominant P form comprising 29-59% of the total soil P, and its concentration was considerably lower than that in a nearby eutrophic marsh. The HKWP soils demonstrated a mean P release of 0.05 +/- 0.01 mg In-2 d(-1), which was very low compared with the range reported for other constructed wetlands. Significantly higher soil P fluxes were obtained under anaerobic conditions that could possibly be attributed to the release of redox-sensitive iron-bound P to the overlying water column. Moreover, soil P flux was significantly higher in the dry season than the wet season, which was likely a result of differences in water column P concentration and hence diffusive flux. These findings suggest that the HKWP soils comprising fishpond bund materials, river sand and decomposed granite would not contribute to significant degradation in water quality.

Bottom sediments and soils samples were analyzed for total mercury and organic matter. Mercury concentrations obtained in bottom sediment were 32.20-146.40 ng g(-1) and organic matter values were 3.5 - 18.0%. The main region for accumulation of mercury and organic matter was in the central and deepest lake area In the rainy season there was a greater distribution of Hg and organic matter, mainly controlled by means of income of the Madeira river water during flooding, while the predominant process in the dry season was the remobilization of total Hg due to the resuspension of bottom sediments.

Although extensive research has been conducted on flood classification, efficiently and automatically processing multi-source imagery to generate reliable flood inundation maps remains challenging. In this study, a new automatic flood monitoring method, utilizing optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, was developed based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. The Normalized Difference Flood Vegetation Index (NDFVI) was innovatively combined with the Edge Otsu segmentation method, utilizing SAR imagery, to enhance the initial accuracy of flood area mapping. To more effectively distinguish flood areas from non-seasonal water bodies, such as lakes, rivers, and reservoirs, pre-flood Landsat-8 imagery was analyzed. Non-seasonal water bodies were classified using multi-index methods and water body probability distributions, thereby further enhancing the accuracy of flood mapping. The method was applied to the catastrophic floods in Poyang Lake, Jiangxi Province, in 2020, and East Dongting Lake, Hunan Province, China, in 2024. The results demonstrated classification accuracies of 92.6% and 97.2% for flood inundation mapping during the Poyang Lake and East Dongting Lake events, respectively. This method offers efficient and precise information support to decision-makers and emergency responders, thereby fully demonstrating its substantial potential for practical applications.						, Yucheng Xu/0009-0002-8548-8756														2073-4441				JAN	2025	17	2							177	10.3390/w17020177	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17020177													WOS:001404717100001

The impact of changes in river system structure on hydrological processes in the plain river network area was analysed against a background of urbanization. An indicator system was built to describe the quantitative, morphological and spatial structure of the river system. Analysis of the change in annual average and extreme water levels revealed the influencing mechanism of the changes in river system structure on the hydrological processes. The results indicate a decreasing tendency in the density of the river system in the study area, with a reduction in water surface ratio by about 20% in the past 50 years. Since the 1960s, the maximum and annual average water levels have increased. The degree of change in the mean monthly, annual lowest and annual highest water levels was great, with that in the non-flood season being higher than in the flood season. The decrease in the number of rivers directly reduced the storage and adjustable capacity of the basin.

A mass balance model of nitrogen loading to the landmass is employed to account for transfers of Nr between atmospheric input sources ( as food and feed products) and subsequent consumer output loads. This calculation produces a gridded surface of nitrogen loading ultimately mobilizable to aquatic systems (Nmob). Compared to the pre-industrial condition, nitrogen loading to the landmass has doubled from 111 to 223 Tg/year due to anthropogenic activities. This is particularly evident in the industrialized areas of the globe where contemporary levels of nitrogen loading have increased up to 6-fold in many areas. The quantity of nitrogen loaded to the landscape has shifted from a chiefly fixation-based system (89% of total loads) in the pre-industrial state to a heterogeneous mix in contemporary times where fertilizer (15%), livestock (24%) and atmospheric deposition ( 15%) dominate in many parts of the industrialized and developing world. A nitrogen transport model is developed from a global database of drainage basin characteristics and a comprehensive compendium of river chemistry observations. The model utilizes constituent delivery coefficients based on basin temperature and hydraulic residence times in soils, rivers, lakes and reservoirs to transport nitrogen loads to river mouths. Fluxes are estimated for total nitrogen, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, and total organic nitrogen. Model results show that total nitrogen fluxes from river basins have doubled from 21 Tg/year in the pre-industrial to 40 Tg/year in the contemporary period, with many industrialized areas of the globe showing an increase up to 5-fold. DIN fluxes from river basins have increased 6-fold from 2.4 Tg/year in the pre-industrial to 14.5 Tg/year in the contemporary period. The amount of nitrogen loading delivered to river mouth as flux is greatly influenced by both basin temperatures and hydraulic residence times suggesting a regional sensitivity to loading. The global, aggregate nitrogen retention on the continental land mass is 82%, with a range of 0 - 100% for individual basins. We also present the first seasonal estimates of riverine nitrogen fluxes at the global scale based on monthly discharge as the primary driver.					; Green, Pamela/JGD-9430-2023; Galloway, James/C-2769-2013; Boyer, Elizabeth/D-6617-2013	Green, Pamela/0009-0006-7803-8182; Boyer, Elizabeth/0000-0003-4369-4201; Galloway, James/0000-0001-7676-8698; 													0168-2563	1573-515X				MAR	2004	68	1					71	105		10.1023/B:BIOG.0000025742.82155.92	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:BIOG.0000025742.82155.92													WOS:000221102100005

Food resources used by riverine fish depend on productivity within the main stem and adjacent floodplains, terrestrial inputs, and longitudinal and lateral hydrologic connectivity. Trophic ecology of puye (Galaxias maculatus Jenyns, 1842) in Chilean river systems remains poorly understood and studies that combine short-term (stomach content) and long-term (stable isotope analyses) analyses have not been performed to date. In this study, we assessed spatial variability in diet of puye based on both stomach content and analyses of stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen in 10 river systems of southern Chile (including main stem, headwater lakes, and estuaries). Fish in the main stems of more northern rivers, with predictable flow regimes, were characterised by the most diverse diets, broad niche space, and high proportion of terrestrial prey items and zooplankton in diet. Fish collected in lakes were characterised by narrow isotopic niche space and diet dominated by zooplankton. Diet of G. maculatus in Chilean river systems is associated with characteristics of riverine habitats within each river system (lentic, lotic, and estuarine) and hydrologic connectivity among them. Indeed, connectivity with floodplain habitats and direct supply from headwater lakes appeared to be primary drivers of fish diet in systems where these are present. These supplies maintain fish populations of good condition and allow freshwater recruitment. Therefore, maintaining seasonal flow dynamics and connectivity is essential to preserve the natural function of these river systems and conserve native fish populations.

Apart from laboratory tests and local observations of natural MSR in, for example, single wetlands, little is known about spatiotemporal characteristics of freshwater MSR from multiple locations within entire hydrological catchments. We here applied an isotopic fractionation (delta S-34 values in SO42-) and a Monte Carlo-based mixing analysis scheme to detect MSR and its variation across two major mining regions (Imetjoki, Sweden and Khibiny, Russia) in the Arctic part of Europe under different seasonal conditions. Results indicate a range of catchment-scale MSR values in the Arctic of similar to 5%-20% where the low end of the range was associated with the non-vegetated, mountainous terrain of the Khibiny catchment, having low levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The high end of the range was related to vegetated conditions provided by the Imetjoki catchment that also contains wetlands, lakes, and local aquifers. These prolong hydrological residence times and support MSR hot spots reaching values of similar to 40%. The present results additionally show evidence of MSR persistence over different seasons, indicating large potential, even under relatively cold conditions, of using MSR as part of nature-based solutions to mitigate adverse impacts of (acid) mine drainage. The results call for more detailed investigations regarding potential field-scale correlations between MSR and individual landscape and hydroclimatic characteristics, which, for example, can be supported by the isotopic fractionation and mixing scheme utilized here.					; Efimov, Vasiliy/C-4485-2016; Chalov, Sergey/K-1847-2012	Fischer, Sandra/0000-0002-1638-0402; , Vasiliy/0000-0001-9231-4493; Jarsjo, Jerker/0000-0003-3407-8618; Chalov, Sergey/0000-0002-6937-7020													0043-1397	1944-7973				APR	2022	58	4							e2021WR031777	10.1029/2021WR031777	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021WR031777													WOS:000786346100001

The archeobotanical study of cereal remains was combined with analytical data obtained from an amorphous organic residue using optical microscopy, SEM-EDS, ATR/FT-IR and Py-GC/MS. The cereal remains of emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccum), barley (Hordeum vulgare), broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum), and foxtail millet (Setaria italica) were identified as the preferred crops used for food and/or fodder at the site. The presence of charred millets, which have been directly dated by AMS, confirms consumption at the site and adds to the little-known background of millet use in central Italy. The find of millets in a perilacustrine pile-dwelling during a period when the water level of the Bolsena Lake was several meters lower than at present, attesting to a general dry period, suggests that the cultivation of millets, complementing more productive crops of wheat and barley, may have been favored by the availability of a large seasonally dry coastal plain, characterized by poor and sandy soils unsuitable for more demanding cereals.

Synoptic and time-series stable isotope surveys of the Mackenzie River from Great Slave Lake to the Arctic Ocean, 2003 to 2006	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												We report oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition of river discharges in the main stem and tributaries in Mackenzie River system, Canada, based upon a synoptic survey and a time-series monitoring program undertaken between 2003 and 2006. The water isotope signals in the Mackenzie River system exhibit distinct geographic variations. Isotopic results from the comprehensive synoptic survey offset from meteoric water lines in delta(18)O-delta(2)H space, and suggest a snowmelt-driven discharge regime with mixing between heavy-isotope depleted discharge from Liard River and Mackenzie Mountains, and evaporatively-enriched water from Great Slave Lake catchment. Based upon these isotopic data in river discharge, we propose an evaporative-mixing line for the Mackenzie River system (delta(2)H = 6.0 x delta(18)O - 40.8), which highlights the integrated effects of the two most important hydrologic processes (i.e., evaporation and mixing). Time-series investigation of water isotope signatures and river discharge at three key hydrometric stations demonstrates the isotopic response to the strong seasonality of river discharge in northern Canada. In general, isotopic compositions in river discharge tend to be negatively correlated with discharge amount, which is a typical snowmelt-driven isotope-discharge pattern. However, low flow conditions are found to be noisy with a wide range of isotopic variability. More importantly, we also observe that extreme high flow events, especially in the Liard River, appear to be unexpectedly enriched in heavy isotopes, which indicate contributions from evaporated water that are probably derived from wetland surface storage. This is a situation, which produces a reversal in the isotope-discharge pattern and marks important episodes that may impact chemical and riverine/estuarine biotic processes at times of extremely high runoff.

Improving Inferences from Fisheries Capture-Recapture Studies through Remote Detection of PIT Tags	FISHERIES												Models for capture-recapture data are commonly used in analyses of the dynamics of fish and wildlife populations, especially for estimating vital parameters such as survival. Capture-recapture methods provide more reliable inferences than other methods commonly used in fisheries studies. However, for rare or elusive fish species, parameter estimation is often hampered by small probabilities of re-encountering tagged fish when encounters are obtained through traditional sampling methods. We present a case study that demonstrates how remote antennas for passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags can increase encounter probabilities and the precision of survival estimates from capture-recapture models. Between 1999 and 2007, trammel nets were used to capture and tag over 8,400 endangered adult Lost River suckers (Deltistes luxatus) during the spawning season in Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon. Despite intensive sampling at relatively discrete spawning areas, encounter probabilities from Cormack-Jolly-Seber models were consistently low (< 0.2) and the precision of apparent annual survival estimates was poor. Beginning in 2005, remote PIT tag antennas were deployed at known spawning locations to increase the probability of re-encountering tagged fish. We compare results based only on physical recaptures with results based on both physical recaptures and remote detections to demonstrate the substantial improvement in estimates of encounter probabilities (approaching 100%) and apparent annual survival provided by the remote detections. The richer encounter histories provided robust inferences about the dynamics of annual survival and have made it possible to explore more realistic models and hypotheses about factors affecting the conservation and recovery of this endangered species. Recent advances in technology related to PIT tags have paved the way for creative implementation of large-scale tagging studies in systems where they were previously considered impracticable.

Water level changes of high altitude lakes in Himalaya-Karakoram from ICESat altimetry	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												Himalaya-Karakoram (H-K) region hosts large number of high altitude lakes but are poorly gauged by in-situ water level monitoring method due to tough terrain conditions and poor accessibility. After the campaigns of ICESat during 2003-2009, now it is possible to achieve lake levels at decimetre accuracy. Therefore, in present study, high altitude lake levels were observed using ICESat/GLAS altimetry in H-K between 2003 and 2009 to generate baseline information. The study reveals that out of 13 lakes, 10 lakes show increasing trend of water levels at different rate (mean rate 0.173 m/y) whereas three lakes unveiled decreasing trend (mean rate -0.056 m/y). Out of five freshwater lakes, four lakes show an increasing trend of their level (mean rate 0.084 m/y) whereas comparatively six salt lakes (out of seven salt lakes) exhibited similar to 3 times higher mean rate of lake level increase (0.233 m/y). These observed lake level rise can be attributed to the increased melt runoffs (i.e., seasonal snow and glacier melts) owing to the enhanced mean annual and seasonal air temperature during past decade in north-western (NW) Himalaya. Further, varied behaviours of lake level rises in inter- and intra-basins suggest that the local climatic fluctuations play prominent role along with regional and global climate in complex geographical system of NW Himalaya.

The interconnected river-lake systems feature multiple lake regions, wherein numerous rivers interconnect various lake regions. Their intricate hydrological conditions and interactions distinguish them from conventional lakes, which typically have a single and relatively static water body. However, the greenhouse gas emission characteristics, as well as the driving forces of the interconnected river-lake systems, are still under-researched. Here, we carried out bi-seasonal in situ surveys across a typical interconnected river-lake system, Dongting Lake, along with a meta-analysis derived from 168 lakes spanning six continents, to elucidate this issue. We found that interconnected river-lake systems exhibit a unique temporal variation in carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide fluxes, with positive fluxes during the wet season but transitioning to sinks during the dry season. Greenhouse gas fluxes in conventional stable lakes are frequently correlated with abiotic factors, such as hydro-climatological conditions and trophic status. While in Dongting Lake, specific microbial species that are important to the cycling of macronutrients and other less common nutrients, alongside microbial predatory behaviour, can better predict greenhouse gas fluxes. Our study highlights the importance of biotic predictors in prospective greenhouse gases flux estimates.

The diversity and distribution of toxigenic Microcystis spp. in present day and archived pelagic and sediment samples from Lake Erie	HARMFUL ALGAE												The reoccurrence of significant cyanobacterial blooms in Lake Erie during the last 13 years has raised questions concerning the long-term persistence of microcystin-producing cyanobacteria and the presence of natural sediment reservoirs for potentially toxic cyanobacteria in this large lake system. To address these questions, we analyzed phytoplankton and sediment samples which were collected and preserved in the 1970s as well as samples collected in 2004 from locations within Lake Erie. The identification of microcystin-producing cyanobacteria in Lake Erie was examined via PCR amplification of the mcyA gene fragment. Based on the high % sequence similarity, the mcyA sequences from all 1970s phytoplankton and sediment samples were determined to belong to Microcystis spp., in spite of reports suggesting that Lake Erie was dominated by filamentous cyanobacteria in the 1970s. In sediment samples from 2004, signature genes for Microcystis were distributed and preserved not only in the surface sediments but also up to 10-12 cm in depth. Based on cell quantities determined by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction(qPCR) method, 0.18% of eubacteria in the sediments were Microcystis cells, of which 4.8% were potential microcystin producers. In combination with experiments showing that Microcystis cells can be cultured from Lake Erie surface sediments, this paper demonstrates the potential for these sediments to act as a reservoir for pelagic Microcystis populations and that the composition of the population of microcystin-producing cyanobacteria in Lake Erie has not changed remarkably since the 1970s.

Fish were collected from the Western basin of Lake Balaton (Hungary) in October 1999 and May 2000. The average metal concentrations of different organs varied in the following ranges: Cd 0.42-2.10; Cu 1.77-56.2; Hg 0.01-0.19; Pb 0.44-3.24; Zn 10.9-82.5 mug g(-1) dry weight. The highest Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn concentrations were detected in the gill or liver of fish, whereas the highest Hg concentrations were measured in the muscle. In the liver of bream for cadmium, copper and mercury the Pearson correlation analysis revealed positive associations related to age and size (length, net weight), as well as for the mercury load of all three investigated organs. In the muscle and gill the copper, lead and zinc concentrations, similarly to the lead and zinc concentrations of the liver, the associations related to age and size were negative. The correlations between the heavy metal concentrations of organs and the individual condition factors of fish samples proved to have opposite trends compared to those related to the age and size of fish. The seasonal variations in the heavy metal load of bream could be attributed rather to the seasonal change in the condition factor of fish than to variations in the pollutant load of the site.

J	Pyle, GG; Rajotte, JW; Couture, P				Pyle, GG; Rajotte, JW; Couture, P			Effects of industrial metals on wild fish populations along a metal contamination gradient	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												The purpose of this study was to examine relationships among water, sediment, and fish tissue metal concentrations as they relate to fish diversity, tissue metal accumulation, and fish morphometric and reproductive condition. Fish were captured in 12 lakes near Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, that ranged in their degree of metal contamination. In general, metal concentrations in water and sediment decreased with increasing distance from industrial operations. However, only Cu and Ni demonstrated this trend in sediments. Although 20 fish species were identified in the 12 lakes, only one species, yellow perch (Perca flavescens), was common to all 12 lakes. Fish diversity was only associated with sediment metals, suggesting that short-term processes are much less important than long-term processes for fish community recovery in metal-contaminated lakes. Multivariate characterization of water metal concentrations resulted in three lake clusters: Group I consisted of reference lakes; Group 2 lakes had high alkalinity, conductivity, hardness, pH, waterborne metals (especially Se), and sediment Cu and Ni concentrations; Group 3 lakes had high pH, waterborne and sediment Cu, and sediment Ni, intermediate alkalinity, conductivity, and waterborne metals (except Al and Fe), and low hardness and waterborne Al and Fe. Liver Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn, muscle Zn, and intestinal Cd and Zn were highest, and muscle Cu and male gonadosomatic index (GSI) were lowest, in Group 3 fish. Liver, muscle, and intestinal Se concentrations, and Fulton's condition factor (FCF), hepatosomatic index (HSI), and male GSI were highest in Group 2 fish. Group I fish had the highest muscle Hg concentrations and female GSI. Muscle Se appeared to have an antagonistic effect on muscle Hg accumulation as a function of distance from smelting operations. Neither Cu nor Ni, both metals of concern in the Sudbury area, was useful for predicting fish condition, probably because of homeostatic regulatory control. Liver Cd accumulation, which was negatively related to FCF (r = -0.16; P < 0.05), exhibited strong, nonlinear inhibition (r(2) = 0.99; P < 0.0001) as a function of water hardness. Because Cd was not detected in water samples in this study, we suspect that branchial Ca2+ uptake may play some role in reducing dietary Cd uptake in hard water lakes. Selenium has received relatively little attention in the contaminated systems around Sudbury, yet our results demonstrated that tissue Se was related to all condition metrics studied. Moreover, evidence was provided that suggests that there is a gender-specific interaction between dietary Se and Cu uptake that may contribute to decreased female reproductive condition in wild yellow perch.

Rain event properties at the source of the Blue Nile River	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												In the present study, spatial and temporal patterns of rain event properties are analysed. These event properties are rain event depth, event duration, mean event rain rate, peak rain rate and the time span between two consecutive rain events which is referred to as inter-event time (IET). In addition, we assessed how rain event properties change when the period over which rainfall data is aggregated changes from 1 to 6 min and when the minimum inter-event time (MIT) changes from 30 min to 8 h. Rainfall data is obtained from a field campaign in two wet seasons of June-August (JJA) of 2007 and 2008 in Gilgel Abbay watershed that is situated at the source basin of the Upper Blue Nile River in Ethiopia. The rainfall data was automatically recorded at eight stations. The results revealed that rain event depth is more related to peak rain rate than to event duration. At the start and towards the end of the wet season, the rain events have larger depth with longer duration and longer IET than those in mid-season. Event rain rate and IET are strongly related to terrain elevation. Sekela which is on a mountain area has the shortest IET while Bahir Dar which is at the south shore of Lake Tana has the longest IET. The period over which rainfall data is aggregated significantly affected the values of rain event properties that are estimated using relatively small value (30 min) of MIT but its effect diminished when the MIT is increased to 8 h. It is shown that increasing the value of MIT has the largest effect on rain event properties of mountain stations that are characterised by high rainfall intermittency.

In the first cyanotoxic analyses conducted in samples from Ethiopia, we found lakes Chamo, Abaya, Awassa, Chitu, Langano, Ziway, and Koka all had concentrations of microcystins (MC) ranging from trace to hazardous, whereas only traces less than limits of detection (LOD) of cylindrospermopsin (CYN) were found. In the December 2006 dry season we sampled the lakes for analyses of MC, CYN, species structures, and calculations of cyanobacteria biomass. We used the Utermol technique to analyse cyanobacterial biomass and monitored MC toxins using HPLC-DAD, LC-ESI-MS-MRM, and ELISA-test and CYN with HPLC-DAD and ELISA. The various toxicity tests coincided well. In 4 of the lakes (Chamo, Langano, Ziway, and Koka), the inter-lake range of total MC concentration was 1.3-48 mu g L-1; in 3 (Abaya, Awassa, and Chitu), we found only traces of MC. Microcystis aeruginosa was the dominant species, with Microcystis panniformis, Anabaena spiroides, and Cylindrospermopsis spp. as subdominants. The MC concentration, especially in Lake Koka, exceeded levels for serious health hazards for humans, cattle, and wildlife.

Soil mineral genesis and distribution in a saline lake landscape of the Pantanal Wetland, Brazil	GEODERMA												The origin of the saline lakes in the Pantanal wetland has been classically attributed to processes occurring in past periods. However, recent studies have suggested that saline water is currently forming from evaporative concentration of fresh water, which is provided annually by seasonal floods. Major elements (Ca, Mg, K) and alkalinity appear to be geochemically controlled during the concentration of waters and may be involved in the formation of carbonates and clay minerals around the saline lakes. The mineralogy of soils associated with a representative saline lake was investigated using XRD, TEM-EDS, and ICP-MS in order to identify the composition and genesis of the secondary minerals suspected to be involved in the control of major elements. The results showed that Ca, Mg, and K effectively undergo oversaturation and precipitation as the waters become more saline. These elements are incorporated in the authigenically formed carbonates, smectites, and micas surrounding the saline lake. The control of Ca occurs by precipitation of calcite and dolomite in nodules while Mg and K are mainly involved in the neoformation of Mg-smectites (stevensitic and saponitic minerals) and, probably, iron-enriched micas (ferric-illite) in surface and subsurface horizons. Therefore, our study confirms that the salinity of Pantanal, historically attributed to inheritance from former regimes, has a contribution of current processes. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Historical (1949) in-lake nutrient levels were targeted to stimulate bottom-up carbon transfer from native plankton communities to planktivorous and piscivorous fish populations that support popular fisheries. Analysis of 24 years of monitoring data assessed the effects of nutrient addition on the phytoplankton and zooplankton communities. Assessment involved comparisons of plankton community metric data from North Arm (1992-2003) and North + South arms (2004-2015) nutrient addition periods. A before-after, control-impact (BACI) analysis adjusted for these effects involved a series of phytoplankton and zooplankton metrics across the two lake arms. Time series analyses revealed significant serial correlation structure, significant increases in phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance and biomass, and increased stability within the phytoplankton and zooplankton communities. Results confirmed that adaptively managed nutrient restoration can effectively restore biological productivity and community structure in a large culturally oligotrophic lake.

Raphidiopsis mediterranea (Nostocales) exhibits a flexible growth strategy under light and nutrient fluctuations in contrast to Planktothrix agardhii (Oscillatoriales)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Raphidiopsis mediterranea is a freshwater cyanobacterium that forms toxic blooms in eutrophic water bodies. Factors controlling its proliferation have not been explored in detail. We investigated R. mediterranea autecology by (i) analyzing its dynamics in a hypertrophic shallow lake dominated by Planktothrix agardhii (Oscillatoriales) and its relationship with environmental factors; and (ii) studying the effect of light intensity and phosphate availability on R. mediterranea isolates growing in mono or in co-cultures with P. agardhii. The redundancy analysis demonstrated that water temperature, light, and phosphate concentrations were important driving factors for the seasonal succession of the two species. When grown together with P. agardhii, R. mediterranea growth was strongly promoted under the highest light intensity treatment. On the other hand, in monoalgal cultures under phosphorus starvation, both strains exhibited a significant increase in total alkaline phosphatase activity, and changes in the expression of homologs to phoA-like and phoD genes (members of the Pho regulon). However, R. mediterranea showed higher phosphatase activity than P. agardhii, suggesting greater tolerance to phosphate limitation. Taken together, we conclude that physiological features of R. mediterranea play an important role in the coexistence with P. agardhii under environmental changes.

To address this issue, the diel-scale characteristics of physio-chemical parameters, delta C-13(DIC), and CO2 emission flux from Dalongdong reservoir (DLD), a karst groundwater-fed reservoir, in southern China were measured covering July, August, and November of 2014 and March and June of 2015. The results showed that the physio-chemical parameters, delta C-13(DIC), and CO2 emission flux displayed significant seasonal variations and intricate diel differences in the DLD reservoir. At the seasonal scale, the DLD reservoir is a CO2 source because the mean value of the CO2 emission flux is higher than zero. The highest CO2 emission flux was in November of 2014 due to reservoir overturn and the lowest flux was in August of 2014 due to reservoir thermal stratification. Diel differences in pH, DO, DIC, and pCO(2) were inconspicuous during the study periods, while the CO2 emission and delta C-13(DIC) showed higher values during the daytime than the nighttime during July of 2014 and March and June of 2015. In August of 2014, mean differences between the daytime and nighttime CO2 emission were inconspicuous due to a negative CO2 emission flux occurrence. Reservoir overturn in November of 2014 resulted in a higher mean CO2 emission flux and larger data range during the daytime than at nighttime. Future studies that calculate CO2 emissions in water reservoirs should consider monitoring temporal frequencies to obtain more accurate estimations of CO2 emission fluxes.

Here, AAP abundance and contribution to total bacterial abundance and biomass were investigated to test whether the trophic status of a lake or content of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) play a role in determining AAP distribution and abundance in shallow inland lakes, with special focus on hypertrophic and polyhumic waters. Twenty-six different shallow lakes in Hungary were monitored. AAP abundance and biomass were determined by epifluorescence microscopy. The lakes exhibit a broad range of CDOM (2-7000 mg Pt L-1) and phytoplankton biomass (2-1200 mu g L-1 chlorophyll a concentration). Very high AAP abundance (up to 3 x 10(7) cells mL(-1)) was observed in polyhumic and hypertrophic shallow lakes. AAP abundance was influenced by phytoplankton biomass and CDOM content, and these effects were interrelated. As determined, 40 mu g L-1 chlorophyll a and 52 mg Pt L-1 CDOM are threshold levels above which these effects have a synergistic relationship. Hence, the observed high AAP abundance in some soda pans is a consequence of combined hypertrophy and high CDOM content. AAP contribution was influenced by total suspended solids (TSS) content: the success of AAP cells could be explained by high TSS levels, which might be explained by the decrease of their selective grazing control.

Large tracts of the Selenga River Basin have been developed for industry, urbanization, mining, and agriculture, resulting in the release of suspended solids (SS) that affect downstream water quality and primary productivity. This study addressed SS as the main factor controlling pollutant transport and the primary indicator of land degradation in the Selenga River system. Tributaries with larger areas dedicated to agricultural use had higher SS concentrations, reaching 862 mg L-1, especially during the high runoff and intensive cultivation season. Although the large SS flux was detected in the main river, the small tributaries were distinguished by high SS concentrations. The high SS concentration corresponded to widespread development in the watershed. Watersheds with high potential of SS release are sensitive to intensive land uses. SS in the river system had a constant elemental composition consisting mainly of Fe and Al oxides, indicating that surface soils were major constituents of the tributary SS. Three heavymetals (Zn, Cu, and Cr) appeared in high concentrations downstream of urban and mining areas (two-to sixfold increases), indicating that these contaminants are carried by SS. At two tributary junctions, the concentration of contaminants on the SS decreased due to a large influx of SS with low heavy metal contents. Changes in electric conductivity and pH at downstream of tributary junctions enhanced the sedimentation of SS and the removal of contaminants from the water phase after aggregation of the SS. Land use changes in the tributary watersheds are major controlling factors for the fate of contaminants in the river system.

Here, we explored the dynamics and driving mechanisms of nitrogen and phosphorus across three major freshwater lakes with different RLC (DRLC) in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River through the Modified Mann-Kendall test, Entropy-weighted water quality index, and multivariate statistical analysis methods. Our results showed that NO3--N and NO2--N in the high RLC lake (Poyang Lake, PYL) exhibited a significantly increasing trend along with water quality deterioration (Z = 2.4312 & lowast;; P = 0.0075 < 0.05), whereas TN, NO3--N, NH3-N, and NO2--N in the low RLC lakes (Chaohu Lake, CHL; Taihu Lake, THL) exhibited a significantly decreasing trend along with water quality improvement. The pollution sources of the lakes were all dominated by external loads, and the continued water quality deterioration in PYL might be attributed to hydrologic conditions change and pollution loads increase. Differently from low RLC lakes, there was no significant spatial heterogeneity in nitrogen and phosphorus of PYL due to strong hydrodynamic mixing. Nitrogen and phosphorus were major contributors to water quality variation in high and low RLC lakes, respectively, controlled by hydrologic conditions and the biogeochemical behavior of nitrogen and phosphorus. An average of 58.2% of TN/TP in three lakes were in the range optimal for phytoplankton growth (10<TN/TP < 30), nevertheless there were different seasonal patterns among DRLC lakes. The regulation of climate conditions and land use on the lake water quality also varied with DRLC lakes. This study would provide essential scientific evidence for water quality management in DRLC lakes contributing to the formulation of effective and targeted water pollution control strategies.

Large parts of the Triassic dolomites in the Austroalpine and the southern Alpine realm are affected by late diagenetic or hydrothermal overprinting, but recent studies from the Carnian Travenanzes Formation (southern Alps) provide evidence of primary dolomite. Here a petrographic and geochemical study of dolomites intercalated in a 100 m thick Carnian sequence of distal alluvial plain deposits is presented to gain better insight into the conditions and processes of dolomite formation. The dolomites occur as 10 to 50 cm thick homogeneous beds, millimetre-scale laminated beds, and nodules associated with palaeosols. The dolomite is nearly stoichiometric with slightly attenuated ordering reflections. Sedimentary structures indicate that the initial primary dolomite or precursor phase consisted largely of unlithified mud. Strontium isotope ratios (Sr-87/Sr-86) of homogeneous and laminated dolomites reflect Triassic seawater composition, suggesting precipitation in evaporating seawater in a coastal ephemeral lake or sabkha system. However, the setting differed from modern sabkha or coastal ephemeral lake systems by being exposed to seasonally wet conditions with significant siliciclastic input and the inhibition of significant lateral groundwater flow by impermeable clay deposits. Thus, the ancient Tethyan margin was different from modern analogues of primary dolomite formation.					; Breda, Anna/V-3283-2017; Preto, Nereo/M-8627-2015; Klötzli, Urs/K-4017-2019; Bernasconi, Stefano/E-5394-2010	Arp, Gernot/0000-0002-0968-7916; Kloetzli, Urs/0000-0003-2743-0281; Breda, Anna/0000-0002-0106-284X; Meister, Patrick/0000-0003-3623-6456; Wegner, Wencke/0009-0006-3844-7723; Preto, Nereo/0000-0001-8757-328X; Bernasconi, Stefano/0000-0001-7672-8856													1869-9510	1869-9529				JUL 31	2019	10	4					1243	1267		10.5194/se-10-1243-2019	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/se-10-1243-2019													WOS:000477978800001

The earliest human immigrants encountered a low-relief lake-margin landscape dominated by moist grasslands with open woodlands in the driest landscape positions. By 1.5 Ma, large streams filled the lake and the landscape became more riverine in nature, with riparian forests, savanna, and open woodland. Paleosol morphology and carbon isotope values of soil organic matter and pedogenic carbonates indicate a long-term shift toward regional drying or increased duration of the annual dry season through the early Pleistocene. This suggests that an annual dry season associated with monsoon conditions was an important aspect of the paleoclimate in which early humans spread from Africa to Southeast Asia.

Little was reported on the seasonal patterns of atmospheric deposition of PAHs under Asian monsoon climate. Bulk (dry + wet) particle deposition, air-water diffusion exchange, and vapour wet deposition of PAHs in a small urban lake in Guangzhou were estimated based on a year-round monitoring. The total PAH particle deposition fluxes observed were 0.44-3.46 mu g m(-2) day(-1). The mean air-water diffusive exchange flux was 20.7 mu g m(-2) day(-1). The vapour deposition fluxes of PAHs ranged 0.15-8.26 mu g m(-2) day(-1). Remarkable seasonal variations of particulate PAH deposition, air-water exchange fluxes and vapour wet deposition were influenced by seasonal changes in meteorological parameters. The deposition fluxes were predominantly controlled by the precipitation intensity in wet season whereas by atmospheric concentration in dry season. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Analytical solutions for the advection-dispersion model for radon-222 production and transport in shallow porewater profiles	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Quantifying the water flux between surface water (SW) and groundwater (GW) bodies is important for determining water balances and understanding controls on surface water quality and sustainable allocation of water resources. Methods that quantify water exchange at point scales are highly desirable due to the heterogeneous nature of SW-GW connectivity. Porewater radon-222 (222Rn) profiles can be easily collected and variations of 222Rn activity within the sediments below SW bodies can be used to infer water flow and residence times. The current models used to interpret these profiles assume downward flows, limiting their use in gaining, or dynamic environments. We investigate the use of a new analytical solution based on a finite solution of the advection dispersion equation to predict bi-directional water fluxes using 222Rn profiles in riverbed sediments. We apply this solution to profiles collected from the Swan Estuary in Western Australia. The estimated fluxes of water from the estuary to groundwater were up to 2.07 m/day, and fluxes from the groundwater to the estuary were up to 1.79 m/day at various times. Estimates made with a previously applied piston-flow model were broadly consistent when predicting fluxes from the estuary to the groundwater; however, the method was unable to predict fluxes from the groundwater to the estuary, as degassing in the surface water meant that all profiles indicated ageing with depth and hence downward flow. The reversal of fluxes was predicted for a period of seasonally high groundwater levels. Our results highlight that not accounting correctly for upward flows can impact predictions of groundwater exchange with surface water bodies such as estuaries. This may lead to errors in water and chemical balances in stream, lake and estuarine environments and sustainable allocation of freshwater resources between ecosystems and human demands.

Based on the detailed facies analysis of the subsurface boreholes, eight facies were identified in the Lower Cretaceous strata of Naiman sag and were grouped into three facies associations, namely fan delta, littoral to sublittoral lacustrine, and deep lacustrine. Based on the depositional characteristics, in combination with lacustrine evaporites and carbonate deposition, organic matter preservation, and lake depth, the Lower Cretaceous strata of the Naiman sag was further subdivided into four lake stages, namely initial formation of lake (Stage 1), sediment-fill shallow lake (Stage 2), rising to a high lake (Stage 3), and lake closure (Stage 4), respectively. The lake evolution in the Naiman sag was driven by both tectonics and climate changes. Fault-driven subsidence was likely contributed to episodic changes in accommodation and lake formation (Stage 1), expansion (Stage 3) and shrinkage (Stage 4). A combination of regional and global climate overprint controlled the sedimentary characteristics, depositional trends, and sediment and water supply. The global climate of ocean anoxic events 1a and 1b (OAE1a and OAE1b) may have effects on anoxic conditions of Stages 1 and 3, respectively. During regional climate changes between arid, hot and humid, seasonal climate tended to form evaporite deposits and multiple layers of oil shale deposits in Stage 1. During the more humid regional climate, steady runoff tended to form fan delta deposits prograding into the lake basin in Stages 2 and 4 and thick-bedded oil shale deposits in Stage 3. The development of source rocks is linked with lake formation and expansion stages (Stages 1 and 3), and the source rocks are mainly preserved in the deep lacustrine and littoral to sublittoral lacustrine environment. The development of reservoirs is associated with lake formation, sediment -fill, and shrinkage stages (Stages 1, 2, and 4), and the reservoirs are mainly preserved in the fan delta environment.

Understanding the traits of revegetation after wildfire is important for sustainable forest management, as these forests not only provide economic resources, but also are home to specialized species, like the Kirtland Warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii). Individual tree detection of jack pine saplings after fire events can provide information about an environment's recovery. Traditional satellite and manned aerial sensors lack the flexibility and spatial resolution required for identifying saplings in early post-fire analysis. Here we evaluated the use of unmanned aerial systems and geographic object-based image analysis for jack pine sapling identification in a region burned during the 2012 Duck Lake Fire in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Results of this study indicate that sapling identification accuracies can top 90%, and that accuracy improves with the inclusion of red and near infrared spectral bands. Results also indicated that late season imagery performed best when discriminating between young (<5 years) jack pines and herbaceous ground cover in these environments.

However, the mechanisms underlying the water use patterns as well as the water sources of Tamarix laxa in the mega-dunes of the Badain Jaran Desert, China, remain unclear. This study investigated the water sources and water use patterns of T. laxa using the stable oxygen isotope method. The O-18 values of xylem water, soil water in different layers (0-200 cm), rainwater, snow water, lake water, atmospheric water vapor, condensate water, and groundwater were measured. The sources of water used by T. laxa were determined using the IsoSource model. The results indicate that T. laxa mainly relies on soil water. At the beginning of the growing season (in May), the species is primarily dependent on water from the middle soil layer (60-120 cm) and deep soil layer (120-200 cm). However, it mainly absorbs water from the shallow soil layer (0-60 cm) as the rainy season commences. In September, water use of T. laxa reverts to the deep soil layer (120-200 cm). The water use patterns of T. laxa are closely linked with heavy precipitation events and soil water content. These findings reveal the drought resistance mechanisms of T. laxa and are of significance for screening species for ecological restoration.					; Dong, Chunyu/P-1741-2019	Dong, Chunyu/0000-0001-5721-9247; 													1674-6767	2194-7783				DEC	2018	10	6					821	832		10.1007/s40333-018-0069-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40333-018-0069-z													WOS:000450507500001

This research developed a three-dimensional eutrophication model to investigate the eutrophication dynamics. The model fully coupled the biological processes and hydrodynamics, and also took into account the effects of sediment release and the external loads from the tributaries. After sensitivity analyses, the key parameters were defined and then calibrated by the field observation data. The calibrated model was applied to study the seasonal primary productions and its regional differences. The comparisons between model results and field data in year 2000 indicated that the model is able to simulate the eutrophication dynamics in Taihu Lake with a reasonable accuracy. From the simulation experiments, it was found that the meteorological forcing have significant influences on the temporal variations of the eutrophication dynamics. The wind-induced circulation and sediment distribution play an important role in the spatial distribution of the algae blooms.																			1001-0742	1878-7320					2008	20	3					278	284		10.1016/S1001-0742(08)60044-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-0742(08)60044-3								18595393					WOS:000254090900005

Regional biogeography versus intra-annual dynamics of the root and soil microbiome	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOME												BackgroundRoot and soil microbial communities constitute the below-ground plant microbiome, are drivers of nutrient cycling, and affect plant productivity. However, our understanding of their spatiotemporal patterns is confounded by exogenous factors that covary spatially, such as changes in host plant species, climate, and edaphic factors. These spatiotemporal patterns likely differ across microbiome domains (bacteria and fungi) and niches (root vs. soil).ResultsTo capture spatial patterns at a regional scale, we sampled the below-ground microbiome of switchgrass monocultures of five sites spanning > 3 degrees of latitude within the Great Lakes region. To capture temporal patterns, we sampled the below-ground microbiome across the growing season within a single site. We compared the strength of spatiotemporal factors to nitrogen addition determining the major drivers in our perennial cropping system. All microbial communities were most strongly structured by sampling site, though collection date also had strong effects; in contrast, nitrogen addition had little to no effect on communities. Though all microbial communities were found to have significant spatiotemporal patterns, sampling site and collection date better explained bacterial than fungal community structure, which appeared more defined by stochastic processes. Root communities, especially bacterial, were more temporally structured than soil communities which were more spatially structured, both across and within sampling sites. Finally, we characterized a core set of taxa in the switchgrass microbiome that persists across space and time. These core taxa represented < 6% of total species richness but > 27% of relative abundance, with potential nitrogen fixing bacteria and fungal mutualists dominating the root community and saprotrophs dominating the soil community.ConclusionsOur results highlight the dynamic variability of plant microbiome composition and assembly across space and time, even within a single variety of a plant species. Root and soil fungal community compositions appeared spatiotemporally paired, while root and soil bacterial communities showed a temporal lag in compositional similarity suggesting active recruitment of soil bacteria into the root niche throughout the growing season. A better understanding of the drivers of these differential responses to space and time may improve our ability to predict microbial community structure and function under novel conditions.

Assessing the reliability and uncertainties of projected changes in precipitation and temperature in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 models over the Lake Chad basin	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Lake Chad lost more than 80% of its surface area over the past decades as a result of environmental change and climate variability. It is not yet known how climate change will affect water resources availability in the basin over the coming decades. In this study, the reliability ensemble averaging (REA) technique was used to evaluate the performance of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) models in simulating present-day precipitation and temperature (1980-2005), and to quantify the uncertainties in future projections (2050-2075) under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs) in the Lake Chad basin (LCB). Analyses were carried out at both annual and seasonal timescales. Overall, the CMIP5 models simulated precipitation better than temperature in the study area. Although the models were able to simulate the annual precipitation cycle in the basin, most models overestimated precipitation during the dry season and underestimated it during the monsoon season. Future annual basin precipitation is projected to increase by 2.5 and 5%, respectively, under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenario by the middle of the century by most of the models and most of the model projections are within the REA uncertainty range. Despite the increase in projected annual precipitation in the basin, most models project a decrease in monsoon precipitation under both RCPs. Although the uncertainty range for future precipitation projections for most models lie within the range of natural climate variability, additional analysis is needed for results to be useful for any future planning in the study area.

PLOS ONE												According to the Climatic Variability Hypothesis [CVH], thermal plasticity should be wider in organisms from temperate environments, but is unlikely to occur in tropical latitudes where temperature fluctuations are narrow. In copepods, food availability has been suggested as the main driver of phenotypic variability in adult size if the range of temperature change is less than 14 degrees C. Leptodiaptomus garciai is a calanoid copepod inhabiting Lake Alchichica, a monomictic, tropical lake in Mexico that experiences regular, narrow temperature fluctuations but wide changes in phytoplankton availability. We investigated whether the seasonal fluctuations of temperature and food produce phenotypic variation in the life-history traits of this tropical species. We sampled L. garcia throughout a year and measured female size, egg size and number, and hatching success, along with temperature and phytoplankton biomass. The amplitude of the plastic responses was estimated with the Phenotypic Plasticity Index. This index was also computed for a published dataset of 84 copepod populations to look if there is a relationship between the amplitude of the phenotypic plasticity of adult size and seasonal change in temperature. The temperature annual range in Lake Alchichica was 3.2 degrees C, whereas phytoplankton abundance varied 17-fold. A strong pattern of thermal plasticity in egg size and adult female size followed the inverse relationship with temperature commonly observed in temperate environments, although its adaptive value was not demonstrated. Egg number, relative reproductive effort and number of nauplii per female were clearly plastic to food availability, allowing organisms to increase their fitness. When comparing copepod species from different latitudes, we found that the magnitude of thermal plasticity of adult size is not related to the range of temperature variation; furthermore, thermal plasticity exists even in environments of limited temperature variation, where the response is more intense compared to temperate populations.					; Ortega-Mayagoitia, Elizabeth/A-3479-2011; Ciros, Jorge/G-5958-2018	Ortega-Mayagoitia, Elizabeth/0000-0002-8892-1888; Ciros, Jorge/0000-0002-4292-7539													1932-6203					APR 30	2018	13	4							e0196496	10.1371/journal.pone.0196496	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0196496								29708999					WOS:000431130100033

Lowland-upland migration of sauropod dinosaurs during the Late Jurassic epoch	NATURE												Sauropod dinosaurs were the largest vertebrates ever to walk the Earth, and as mega-herbivores they were important parts of terrestrial ecosystems. In the Late Jurassic-aged Morrison depositional basin of western North America, these animals occupied lowland river-floodplain settings characterized by a seasonally dry climate(1,2). Massive herbivores with high nutritional and water needs could periodically experience nutritional and water stress under these conditions, and thus the common occurrence of sauropods in this basin has remained a paradox. Energetic arguments and mammalian analogues have been used to suggest that migration allowed sauropods access to food and water resources over a wide region or during times of drought or both(3,4), but there has been no direct support for these hypotheses. Here we compare oxygen isotope ratios (delta O-18) of tooth-enamel carbonate from the sauropod Camarasaurus with those of ancient soil, lake and wetland (that is, 'authigenic') carbonates that formed in lowland settings. We demonstrate that certain populations of these animals did in fact undertake seasonal migrations of several hundred kilometres from lowland to upland environments. This ability to describe patterns of sauropod movement will help to elucidate the role that migration played in the ecology and evolution of gigantism of these and associated dinosaurs.																			0028-0836	1476-4687				DEC 22	2011	480	7378					513	515		10.1038/nature10570	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature10570								22031326					WOS:000298318000058
J	Soylu, E				Soylu, Erhan			Metazoan Parasites of Perch Perca fluviatilis L. From Lake Sigirci, Ipsala, Turkey	PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												There has been no previous parasitological survey of perch Perca fluviatilis in Turkey. Consequently, the objectives of the present study were to investigate the metazoan parasite communities of perch and also to calculate infection parameters of the parasites in a eutrophic lake. A total of 52 perch were collected seasonally from Lake Sigirci in Ipsala, Turkey, between April 2009 and February 2010. Perca fluviatilis specimens were parasitized by eight species. The parasite prevalence and mean intensity (MI), respectively, for the whole material were: Gyrodactylus sp., 5.8%, MI (+/- SD) 2.6 +/- 0.57; Displostomum sp., 71.1%, MI 6.2 +/- 4.64; Tylodelphys clavata, 98.1%, MI 175.7 +/- 62.64; Tetracotyle sp., 3.9%, MI 1.5 +/- 0.70; Clinostomum complanatum, 15.4%, MI 3.5 +/- 4.40; Proteocephalus percae, 55.7%, MI 47.10 +/- 55.67; Eustrongylides excisus, 94.2%, MI 42.2 +/- 62.89; Glochidium sp., 30.8%, MI 23.5 +/- 27.42. From the current results it can be concluded that, in perch from Lake Sigirci, T clavata, E. excisus, Diplostomum sp. and P. percae are the most prevalent parasite species.																			0030-9923					FEB	2013	45	1					47	52																WOS:000315934200007
J	Romshoo, SA; Muslim, M				Romshoo, Shakil Ahmad; Muslim, Mohammad			Geospatial modeling for assessing the nutrient load of a Himalayan lake	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												This research makes use of the remote sensing, simulation modeling and field observations to assess the non-point source pollution load of a Himalayan lake from its catchment. The lake catchment, spread over an area of about 11 km(2), is covered by different land cover types including wasteland (36%), rocky outcrops (30%), agriculture (12%), plantation (12.2%), horticulture (6.2%) and built-up (3.1%) The GIS-based distributed modeling approach employed relied on the use of geospatial data sets for simulating runoff, sediment, and nutrient (N and P) loadings from a watershed, given variable-size source areas, on a continuous basis using daily time steps for weather data and water balance calculations. The model simulations showed that the highest amount of nutrient loadings are observed during wet season in the month of March (905.65 kg of dissolved N, 10 kg of dissolved P, 10,386.81 kg of total N and 2,381.89 kg of total P). During the wet season, the runoff being the highest, almost all the excess soil nutrients that are trapped in the soil are easily flushed out and thus contribute to higher nutrient loading into the lake during this time period. The 11-year simulations (1994-2004) showed that the main source areas of nutrient pollution are agriculture lands and wastelands. On an average basis, the source areas generated about 3,969.66 kg/year of total nitrogen and 817.25 kg/year of total phosphorous. Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients of correlation between the daily observed and predicted nutrient load ranged in value from 0.80 to 0.91 for both nitrogen and phosphorus.

Sediment characteristics and water physicochemical parameters of the Lysimachia Lake, Western Greece	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												In the present paper, we present the sedimentological characteristics and the water physicochemical parameters of Lysimachia Lake, which is one of the most important lakes of Western Greece, as it is protected by international conventions and is listed in the Natura 2000 European Network. Sedimentological analysis involved grain size analyses, moment measures, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) measurements, as well as determination of the clay minerals content. Water physicochemical parameters such as pH, temperature, conductivity and dissolved oxygen were measured in situ with portable equipment, while nutrients such as nitrates, nitrites, phosphates and ammonium ions, as well as TOC and TN were analyzed in a time period of 1 year seasonal monitoring. Geographical distribution of grain size and geochemical parameters indicated a clear partition in the northern and southern parts of the lake. This phenomenon can related to the discharging of a channel into the lake, the discharging of sewage effluents from Agrinio city during the last years as well as the type of clay minerals distribution. Clay minerals analyses indicated that smectite predominates in the northern part of the lake, whereas chlorite is more abundant in the southern parts. This explain the higher amounts of TOC and TN observed in the northern part of the lake and can be correlated with the higher external surface and adsorption capacity of minerals in the smectite-rich sediments. The four seasons monitoring of water physicochemical parameters indicates a relatively higher values of TOC and TN in the northern part of the lake, while nutrient concentrations indicate a uniform geographical distribution along the lake.

Five fire events were recorded and 44 charcoal types were identified. One stratified profile yielded charcoal assemblages around 530 cal yr BP and >43.5 cal ka BP in age. The oldest assemblage precedes the period of recorded anthropogenic burning, illustrating occasional long-term absence of fire but also natural wildfire occurrences within tropical rainforest No other charcoal assemblages older than 2500 cal yr BP were recorded, perhaps due to bioturbation and colluvial reworking. The recorded paleofires were possibly associated with short-lived climate anomalies. Progressively dry climatic conditions since ca. 4000 cal yr BP onward did not promote paleofire occurrence until increasing seasonality affected vegetation at the end of the third millennium BP, as illustrated by a fire occurring in mature rainforest that persisted until around 2050 cal yr BP. During a drought episode coinciding with the 'Medieval Climate Anomaly', mature rainforest was locally replaced by woodland savanna. Charcoal remains from pioneer forest indicate that fire hampered forest regeneration after climatic drought episodes. The presence of pottery shards and oil-palm endocarps associated with two relatively recent paleofires suggests that the effects of climate variability were amplified by human activities.

Current variability in a wide and open lacustrine embayment in Lake Geneva (Switzerland)	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Field measurements and numerical simulations were used to determine the effects of dominant meteorological conditions on the hydrodynamics of a wide (aspect ratio similar to 2), relatively deep (seasonally stratified) and open lake embayment (Vidy Bay, Lake Geneva). A three-dimensional hydrodynamic model (Delft3D-FLOW) was employed to simulate flow in the lake. High-resolution maps of wind, temperature and humidity (over the lake) were applied as input to drive the model. Because wind was the main force driving flow in the lake, currents in the embayment were investigated systematically for different wind conditions and seasonal stratification. Satisfactory model validation was achieved using drifter and moored measurements within the embayment. Markedly different circulation patterns were measured within the embayment, with the transition from one pattern to another occurring abruptly for small changes in wind direction. These distinct patterns resulted from relatively small changes in the large gyre of Lake Geneva's main basin, especially the angle between the current in front of the embayment and the embayment shoreline. The boundary between the embayment and the pelagic zone was defined by the largest gyre within the embayment. This study shows that, (i) in a large lake, complex current patterns can occur even within a minor embayment, and (ii) that these patterns can transition rapidly over a small range of wind directions. Near-shore gyre can occur for lengthy periods, which has implications for flushing of discharges within the embayment. (C) 2013 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Strong seasonality in those environments promotes phenotypic plasticity. To date, no one has investigated whether low-latitude copepods, experiencing continuous stress from UVR and predation threats, exhibit similar inducible defences. We here investigated the pigmentation levels of Bahamian 'blue hole' copepods, addressing this deficit. Examining several populations varying in predation risk, we found the lowest levels of pigmentation in the population experiencing the highest predation pressure. In a laboratory experiment, we found that, in contrast with our predictions, copepods from these relatively constant environments did show some changes in pigmentation subsequent to the removal of UVR; however, exposure to water from different predation regimes induced minor and idiosyncratic pigmentation change. Our findings suggest that low-latitude zooplankton in inland environments may exhibit reduced, but non-zero, levels of phenotypic plasticity compared with their high-latitude counterparts.					; Ekelund Ugge, Gustaf M.O./L-6630-2018; hu, nan/KHE-4563-2024; Pärssinen, Varpu/M-3552-2018; Gollnisch, Raphael/O-4726-2016; Parssinen, Varpu/M-3552-2018; Skerlep, Martin/HSE-7885-2023; Rengefors, Karin/K-5873-2019; Langerhans, R./ABE-6246-2021; Nilsson, Anders/H-6836-2014; Sha, Yongcui/GSJ-2799-2022; Herzog, Simon David/JNS-3603-2023; Hansson, Lars-Anders/HCI-2735-2022; Lee, Marcus/AAH-7907-2020; Johansson, Emma/L-8304-2016; Vinterstare, Jerker/H-5921-2016; Ekelund Ugge, Gustaf/L-6630-2018	Vinterstare, Jerker/0000-0001-6998-4632; Ekelund Ugge, Gustaf M.O./0000-0002-2418-1163; Lee, Marcus/0000-0002-3320-3010; Herzog, Simon David/0000-0003-2504-8070; Skerlep, Martin/0000-0001-5812-2383; Parssinen, Varpu/0000-0002-9189-9765; Johansson, Emma/0000-0001-5300-9672; Nilsson, Anders/0000-0002-3541-9835; Gollnisch, Raphael/0000-0001-6177-8877; Bjorneras, Caroline/0000-0002-3506-0367; Rengefors, Karin/0000-0001-6297-9734													2054-5703					JUL 26	2019	6	7							190321	10.1098/rsos.190321	http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.190321								31417735					WOS:000479146300052

We explored the influence of natural factor (sediment property) and anthropogenic factors (land use composition and landscape configuration) at different buffers (500 m, 1 km and 5 km) on metals in sediment using redundancy analysis (RDA) and variation partitioning analysis (VPA). Results indicated that RGB values can effectively model background values of metals (p < 0.01). Igeo and RI assessment showed that Cd was the primary pollutant, which showed no contamination to moderate contamination (Igeo > 0) and moderate ecological risk (ecological risk factor > 40) in upper downstream of the river. Besides, Cd showed moderate to strong contamination (Igeo > 2) and considerable ecological risk (ecological risk factor > 160) at site 24, which is located in the intersection of Poyang Lake and Yangtze River and strongly affected by natural erosion and human activities of Poyang Lake drainage. THQ assessment indicated low health risk of metals from consuming fish influenced by suspended sediment. RDA and VPA analysis indicated that explanation rate of land use composition, sediment property and landscape configuration on metals was 27.01-55.1 %, 36.66 %, 9.77 %-12.52 %, respectively. The total explanation rate was significantly higher at 1 km scale (82.5 %), which was mainly contributed by land use composition and its interaction with sediment property and landscape configuration (55.11 %). Specifically, percentage of farmland, grassland, wetland and forest, content of TN, TOC, silt and clay in soil and landscape configuration index of NumP were positively correlated with metals, and content of sand in soil and landscape index of MSI negatively correlated with metals in riparian sediment at different buffer scales. Our results offer valuable insights for safeguarding riparian zone.

The Middle Jurassic flora of South Mongolia: Composition, age and phytogeographic position	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												The Nariin-Sukhait Flora from the terrigenous, coal-bearing deposits of the Orgilokhbulag Formation in the Nariin-Sukhait Coalfield, southernmost Mongolia, is documented for the first time. The Nariin-Sukhait Flora contains 57 fossil plant species belonging to liverworts, horsetails, ferns, cycadaleans, bennettitaleans, ginkgoaleans, leptostrobaleans, conifers and plants of an unknown affinity. Its floristic composition allows us to date the Orgilokhbulag Formation as Middle Jurassic. This flora is typical of the West Siberian Province of the Siberian Region. The boundary between this province and the North Chinese Province of the same region should be positioned further south than its previous placement, and the Nariin-Sukhait Flora existed close to this boundary. The parent plants grew in an alluvial plain characterised by rivers, oxbow lakes and swamps. The flora reflects a wet, most probably warm-temperate climate with some seasonality in temperature and/or precipitation.

The lakes were sampled four times during one year, and analyzed on a wide variety of water chemistry parameters. With only one exception, all lakes were supersaturated with CO2 with respect to the atmosphere at all sampling occasions. pCO(2) was closely related to the DOC concentration in lakes, which in turn was mainly regulated by catchment characteristics. This pattern was similar along the latitudinal gradient and at different seasons of the year, indicating that it is valid for a variety of climatic conditions within the boreal forest zone. We suggest that landscape characteristics determine the accumulation and subsequent supply of allochthonous organic matter from boreal catchments to lakes, which in turn results in boreal lakes becoming net sources of atmospheric CO2.

A detailed understanding of these hydro-systems is however essential, both for the consideration of these lakes as sentinels of the regional hydro-climatic changes and for the calibration of palaeoenvironmental proxies. Here, we present a hydrological and geochemical investigation of five of these lakes (Mbalang, Tabere, Tizon, Gegouba and Baledjam) around Ngaoundere on the Adamawa Plateau, based on repeated sampling of water profiles and monthly monitoring of rain and lake water samples over two seasonal cycles. We show that each of these throughflow lakes bears a distinct geochemical and isotopic signature, despite quite similar morphometric characteristics and a common climatic regime, due to varying contribution of the watersheds to the water-mass balance and different partitioning between evaporation (E) and outflow (Inflow minus E). We use these differences as a benchmark for a sensitivity analysis of the classical budget equations of conservative tracers. The results demonstrate that to reconcile chloride and stable isotope data with the standard single-box steady state model would require unusual values of the physical parameters of Craig and Gordon's equation such as the n.theta term that would have to be significantly lower than its usual value (n.theta = 0.5). We also show that the data can be simulated more easily by including the inflow from the watershed while assuming that transpiration exceeds evaporation for this compartment. Using this conceptualization of the throughflow lakes, we were able to constrain the different fluxes. Transpiration from the watershed and evaporation from the lake are on the same order of magnitude, or slightly in favour of transpiration. While providing evaporation and transpiration rates which are in general in the right order of magnitude, the system of equations remains underdetermined at this stage. Only direct measurements of the isotopic composition of the atmosphere, possible by laser mass spectrometry, would allow to reduce the range of under-determination of this problem.

Use of allochthonous resources by zooplankton in reservoirs	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Aquatic food webs are supported by primary production from within the system (autochthony) as well as organic matter produced outside of and transported into the system (allochthony). Zooplankton use allochthonous resources, especially in systems with high terrestrial loading and moderate to low internal primary production. We hypothesized that due to high terrestrial loads and remnant submerged terrestrial material, allochthonous resource use by zooplankton would be significant in all reservoirs and would decline along an increasing reservoir age gradient. Using hydrogen stable isotopes and a Bayesian mixing model, we estimated the contribution of allochthonous sources to organic matter pools and crustaceous zooplankton biomass for ten reservoirs. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in all systems was dominated by allochthonous sources (posterior distribution median > 92% allochthonous), while particulate organic matter (POM) composition varied (2-68% allochthonous) and had a lower allochthonous fraction in older reservoirs. There was no relationship between zooplankton allochthony and reservoir age. Crustaceous zooplankton allochthony varied among systems from 26 to 94%, and Chaoborus allochthony, measured in four reservoirs, was similarly variable (33-94%). Consumer allochthony was higher than POM allochthony in some reservoirs, potentially due to terrestrial DOM pathways being important and/or algal resources being inedible (e.g., cyanobacteria). As with many lakes, in the reservoirs we studied, allochthonous inputs account for a significant fraction of the organic matter of basal consumers.					; Fuentes, José/JZT-9323-2024; Wilkinson, Grace/AAD-3202-2020	Emery, Kyle/0000-0003-0536-317X; Wilkinson, Grace/0000-0003-4051-2249; Pace, Michael/0000-0001-5945-6131; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				OCT	2015	758	1					257	269		10.1007/s10750-015-2338-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-015-2338-6													WOS:000359400700021

Values were compared with n-alkanes in plants from lake drainages, and delta D values of meteoric water, lake water, and mean annual precipitation. The results showed that n-C-23 was predominantly derived from aquatic plants, and n-C-27-n-C-33 from terrestrial higher plants. The average carbon chain length of n-C-27-n-C-33 (ACL(27-33)) was positively correlated with the mean annual precipitation. delta D values of the long-chain n-alkanes n-C-29 and n-C-31 of terrestrial origin (varying between -214 aEuro degrees and -169 aEuro degrees, and -226 aEuro degrees and -185 aEuro degrees, respectively) were inversely correlated with mean annual precipitation; but in accordance with the average annual variations in delta D (OIPC), delta D values of n-C-31 were strongly related to the delta D values of growing season meteoric water (R (2) = 0.74). The large difference between delta D values of n-C-23 of aquatic origin and n-C-31 (an average of about 27 aEuro degrees) demonstrates the enrichment of the lake water delta D compared to precipitation, caused by strong evaporation in the semiarid-arid areas of the southwestern Tibetan Plateau. Average value of (-95 aEuro degrees) is evidently higher than the value observed in European wet regions (-128 aEuro degrees); besides, (about -116 aEuro degrees) is constant along the study transect (SD = 9), which indicates that n-C-31 is a useful proxy for the environment.

J	Rothhaupt, KO; Hanselmann, AJ; Yohannes, E				Rothhaupt, Karl-Otto; Hanselmann, Almut J.; Yohannes, Elizabeth			Niche differentiation between sympatric alien aquatic crustaceans: An isotopic evidence	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												Among the mechanisms that allow competing species to coexist are resource partitioning and dietary segregation. The current study uses multiple stable isotopes, carbon (delta C-13), nitrogen (delta N-15) and sulphur (delta S-34), to test the hypothesis that dietary segregation in cohabiting invasive mysids (Limnomysis benedeni and Katamysis warpachowskyi) and gammarids (Dikerogammarus villosus and Gammarus roeselii) will be reflected by differences in isotope values. Furthermore, IsoError mixing models were used to estimate the relative contributions of periphyton and seston to the invaders' diets. Whole tissue delta C-13, delta N-15 and delta S-34 analysis in L. benedeni and K. warpachowskyi imply that these sympatric, non-native mysids maintain differentiated feeding niches or resource partitioning by feeding on distinct components of the available food resources (predominantly seston by L. benedeni and periphyton by K. warpachowskyi). By contrast, the gammarids D. villosus ('killer shrimp') and G. roeselii exhibited no significant difference in delta C-13 and delta N-15, indicating a considerable overlap between the dietary sources of these sympatric invaders. Feeding niche differentiation, irrespective of season or the nature of habitat invaded (lake or river), might facilitate the coexistence of invasive mysids in their 'new' environment by minimizing direct resource competition. The mutual interaction by the invasive gammarids, coupled with voracious behavior, could assist their success at co-invasion with serious implications for local biodiversity including the potential extinction of native species.

The plankton community structure and physicochemical variables showed substantial changes over the study period. La Salada hosted a plankton community characterized by low diversity and small sized organisms. The nanoplanktonic fraction organisms (2-20 mm) dominate the phytoplankton community. Ochromonas sp. showed the maximum abundance throughout the whole study period. The zooplankton community was dominated by rotifers, with a lack of cladocerans. Halotolerant species, e.g. the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis and the cyclopod Apocyclops sp. were the main species. The seasonal temperature and conductivity dynamics influence the plankton abundance dynamics in La Salada. The increment of nutrients and decrease of conductivity caused by the water input led to an increase in plankton biomass and shaped its composition. These findings emphasize that interactions between plankton, salinity, and nutrients are sensitive to the water input and they improve the understanding of the impact of adequate management decisions.

The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) was applied to the Dakbla watershed from 2000 to 2018. After the calibration and validation processes, dissimilar effects between the input conditions on the flow and sediment simulations were confirmed. It was recognized that the impact of the land use on the sediment simulation was more sensitive than with the flow simulation. Additionally, through monthly evaluation, the effects against the flow and sediment in the rainy season were larger than those in the dry season, especially for sediment simulation in the last three months from October to December. Changing land-use conditions could improve flow and sediment simulation performance better than the performance found with static land-use conditions. Updated land-use inputs should be considered in simulations if the given land-use condition changes in a relatively short period because of frequent land-use policy changes by a local government.					; Somura, Hiroaki/R-4315-2019	Somura, Hiroaki/0000-0002-2592-7174; Tram, Vo Ngoc Quynh/0000-0001-6199-5070; 														2073-4441				MAR	2021	13	5							627	10.3390/w13050627	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13050627													WOS:000628578800001

We observed the seasonal succession of Mesodinium spp. in a Japanese brackish lake, and we analysed the origin and diversity of the various coloured plastids within the cells of Mesodinium spp. using a newly developed primer set that specifically targets the cryptophyte nuclear 185 rRNA gene. Mesodinium rubrum isolated from the lake contained only red plastids originating from cryptophyte Teleaulax amphioxeia. We identified novel Mesodinium sp. that contained only green plastids or both red and green plastids originating from cryptophytes Hemiselmis sp. and Teleaulax acuta. Although the morphology of the newly identified Mesodinium sp. was indistinguishable from that of M. rubrum under normal light microscopy, phylogenetic analysis placed this species between the M. rubrum/major species complex and a wellsupported lineage of M. chamaeleon and M. coatsi. Close associations were observed in cryptophyte species composition within cells of Mesodinium spp. and in ambient water samples. The appearance of suitable cryptophyte prey is probably a trigger for succession of Mesodinium spp., and the subsequent abundance of Mesodinium spp. appears to be influenced by water temperature and dissolved inorganic nutrients.																			2045-2322					NOV 21	2018	8								17189	10.1038/s41598-018-35629-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-35629-4								30464297					WOS:000450767000024

Tropical African lakes are especially sensitive to climate warming as they experience wide fluctuations in the thermocline over a narrow range of high water temperatures. Recent climate warming has reduced phytoplankton biomass and production in the lakes. A decline in the production of palatable chlorophytes and an increase in cyanobacteria has led to reduced zooplankton production and a consequent decline in fish stocks, all of which can be associated with the elevated water temperatures. This indicates that even moderate climate warming may destabilise phytoplankton dynamics in tropical African lakes, thereby reducing water quality and food resources for planktivorous fish, with consequent negative impacts on human livelihoods.					; Murisa, Mzime/H-8882-2019	Murisa, Mzime/0000-0001-8096-2979; 													0038-2353					JAN-FEB	2010	106	1-2					13	18		10.4102/sajs.v106i1/2.64	http://dx.doi.org/10.4102/sajs.v106i1/2.64													WOS:000277370200004

Endocrine disruptors and pharmaceuticals: implications for water sustainability	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The presence of pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in the environment raises many questions about risk to the environment and risk to human health. Researchers have attributed adverse ecological effect effects to the presence of these compounds, particularly EDCs, though there is no consensus on what risk, if any, these compounds pose to human health. The scientific community is in the process of developing a better understanding of the occurrence, fate, and transport of pharmaceuticals and EDCs in the environment, including a better characterization of human exposure via drinking water. This paper provides a brief review of pharmaceuticals and EDCs in drinking water, as well as uses examples from Lake Mead, Nevada, USA, to highlight the issues associated with their fate and transport. Lastly, the effects of natural or anthropogenically driven processes, like natural seasonal flow or climate-change/prolonged drought are discussed as they are factors which can drastically alter environmental concentrations of these compounds. Without question, the propensity for the contamination of fresh water will rise as (1) human population continues to grow or (2) patterns of natural surface water slow and wastewater becomes a larger fraction of flow further highlighting the need for a more comprehensive understanding of their environmental behavior.

Quantifying potential propagule pressure of aquatic invasive species from the commercial shipping industry in Canada	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												We quantify and compare different measures of potential propagule pressure (PPP) of aquatic invasive species (AIS) from commercial vessels in Canada. We used ship arrivals and ballast water discharge volumes as proxies for PPP from ballast water organisms, and wetted surface area (WSA) as a proxy for hull fouling PPP, to determine their relative contributions to total PPP. For three regions studied, PPP proxies correlated significantly across ports and some vessel categories. Relative contributions of ship arrivals, ballast discharge, and WSAs to PPP, evidenced by non-significant correlations across these measures, varied across regions, ports, vessel types, and seasons. Flow-through (dominant on east and west coasts) and empty-refill (in Great Lakes-St. Lawrence region) were the major ballast water exchange methods employed by the vessels surveyed. These methods have different biological efficacy for AIS removal, influencing PPP. Our study illustrates benefits and limitations of using different PPP proxies to estimate invasion risk.

External factors, i.e. increased flow did not play a role in organic pollutant exposure. Levels are a function of the lipid content of the muscle tissue, i.e. 3.8% during low and 9% during high flow, implying that organohalogen exposure remains fairly constant throughout the year.

The reconstructed Total Organic Carbon (TOCflux) and lithogenic (L-flux) fluxes during the last 1200 years show the expected variability as lakes differ in altitude, geological and climate settings, limnological properties and human impact history. However, all show unique patterns after 1850 CE, particularly during the Great Acceleration (after 1950 CE). Recent L-flux increase could be related to higher erodibility by rainfall and run-off during the longer snow-free season in the Pyrenees. In all sites, higher TOCflux and geochemical (lower delta C-13(OM), lower C/N) and biological (diatom assemblages) signatures since 1950 CE suggest an increase in algal productivity, likely favored by warmer temperatures and higher nutrient deposition. These recent, unprecedented L-flux and TOCflux increases, in spite of their diverse history and limnological properties of the lakes, demonstrate the regional impact of the Great Acceleration not only in the ecological dynamics of alpine lakes but also in the hydrological cycle in high altitude mountain watersheds.

Many sub-lakes distributed in the lake basin are seasonal lakes, which have a significant impact on hydro-ecological processes and are susceptible to various changes. In this study, using multi-source remote sensing data, a continuous time-series construction method of water coverage suitable in Poyang Lake was developed. That method combined the downscaling of the MNDWI (modified normalized difference water index) with the ISODATA (iterative self-organizing data analysis technique algorithm), and its accuracy can be up to 97% in the months when Landsat 8 is available or 87% when it is unavailable. Based on that method, the increasing variation in water coverage was observed in the sub-lakes of Poyang Lake during 2013-2020 to be within a range of 200-690 km(2) normally. The center of the sub-lakes always remained inundated (>80% inundation frequency), while the surrounding areas were probably kept dry for seven months (except for June to September). The dominant influencing factors of water coverage variations were different in different hydrological periods (wet season and dry-wet season: discharge; dry season: temperature and wind speed; wet-dry season: temperature and precipitation). In addition, "returning farmland to lakes" affected the increase in the water area in the sub-lakes. This study is helpful for the management of water resources and the protection of migratory birds in the Poyang Lake region.

We investigated the reproductive behaviour of adult sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) and the activity of their principal predator, brown bears (Ursus arctos), on streams in south-western Alaska. Specifically, we continuously monitored movements of salmon between lake habitat, where salmon are invulnerable to bears, and three small streams, where salmon spawn and are highly vulnerable to bears. We conducted our study across 2years that offered a distinct contrast in bear activity and predation rates. Diel movements by adult sockeye salmon between stream and lake habitat were observed in 513%177% (meanSD) of individuals among years and sites. Fish that moved tended to hold in the lake for most of the day and then migrated into spawning streams during the night, coincident with when bear activity on streams tended to be lowest. Additionally, cyclic movements between lakes and spawning streams were concentrated earlier in the spawning season. Individuals that exhibited diel movements had longer average reproductive life spans than those who made only one directed movement into a stream. However, the relative effect was dependent on the timing of bear predation, which varied between years. When predation pressure primarily occurred early in the spawning run (i.e., during the height of the diel movements), movers lived 120-310% longer than non-movers. If predation pressure was concentrated later in the spawning run (i.e. when most movements had ceased), movers only lived 10-60% longer. Our results suggest a dynamic trade-off in reproductive strategies of sockeye salmon; adults must be in the stream to reproduce, but must also avoid predation long enough to spawn. Given the interannual variation in the timing and intensity of predation pressure, the advantages of a particular movement strategy will likely vary among years. Regardless, movements by salmon allowed individuals to exploit fine-scale habitat heterogeneity during reproduction, which appears to be a strategy to reduce predation risk on the spawning grounds.

For this purpose, hydrodynamics and water quality status of Lake Eirdir were investigated by using the Delft3D model. The monthly monitoring of pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and forms of nitrogen and phosphorus was carried out, as was the seasonal monitoring of total organic carbon. In all, seven different sampling points were chosen from the lake and influent streams in order to monitor the lake during the period from December 2010 to November 2011, with the aim of calibrating the model. The performance of the dynamic water quality model was evaluated using the relative root mean square error (RRMSE) values for both the calibration and the validation periods. The results of the model showed that the DO had the lowest, and Chl-a had highest associated RRMSE value. The simulation results showed that Segments 1 and 7 of the system had relatively high concentrations of almost all the pollutants. It was also found that increasing the nonpoint nutrient loads from agricultural sources has a greater effect than increasing the nonpoint nutrient loads from the inhabited areas around the lake.					; kaçıkoç, meltem/HTT-1826-2023; Beyhan, Mehmet/R-2051-2019	BEYHAN, MEHMET/0000-0003-2312-2249; 													1863-0650	1863-0669				NOV	2014	42	11					1573	1582		10.1002/clen.201300455	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/clen.201300455													WOS:000344777700012

We hypothesized that there is a self-organizing management system of open access to common-pool grazing resources and predicted that we would find an Ideal Free Distribution (IFD) of mobile pastoralists within seasonal grazing areas. In this paper we used mobility data and remote sensing data from two seasonal grazing areas at the end of the dry season in three consecutive years to evaluate that hypothesis. We found evidence of an IFD in the two seasonal grazing areas of the Logone Floodplain and the Lake Maga area. These findings offer further support for our hypothesis that there is a complex adaptive system in which pastoralists distribute themselves effectively over available grazing resources.

Monitoring fluvial pollen transport, its relationship to catchment vegetation and implications for palaeoenvironmental studies	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												Despite being the most important source of pollen and spore input into most lakes and near-shore marine sediments, we know very little about fluvial (waterborne) pollen and spore transport. This paper presents the results of a dedicated monitoring programme conducted over 2 years and at a catchment scale in South West England. The land use of the nine sub-catchments monitored was determined using Landsat Thematic Data. At two stations, pollen and spore sampling through storm hydrographs was undertaken whilst at the other 7 sub-catchments only peak flow samples were collected. Samples were also collected from re-suspended bed material, riverbanks and at low flows. Airborne pollen flux was monitored using modified Tauber traps. The results support previous research illustrating how the vast majority of fluvial pollen and spores are transported during floods (in this case 9 1 %) and that the main control on waterbome pollen and spore assemblages is the catchment vegetation. However, strong seasonal effects are shown as well as the importance of distinctive sources, such as the riparian input, bed re-suspension and overland flow into drains and tributaries. Fine sediment in river pools appears to act as a selective store of damaged cereal-type pollen grains in arable catchments and this can reduce the inherent underestimate of arable land from pollen diagrams with a high fluvial input and increase the visibility of early agriculture. in order to simulate the likely result of a flood-dominated influx to a small lake scenario, modelling was undertaken whereby different sub-catchments were substituted in order to represent changes in catchment vegetation under a constant hydrological regime. The results show the dampened response of land use groups to catchment land use change, and the frequent occurrence of anomalous single-level peaks due to seasonal flushes from specific near-stream vegetation types. Both these features are commonly seen in lake pollen diagrams. Fluvial pollen and spore loading is dependant upon discharge and so concentrations in laminated or varved sediments could be regarded as a proxy for flood magnitude. The implications for this study on the interpretation of lake and near-shore marine pollen and spore diagrams are discussed and it is argued that a more quantitative approach to waterbome pollen could improve the estimation of land use from lakes in the temperate zone.

J	Missaghi, S; Hondzo, M				Missaghi, Shahram; Hondzo, Miki			Evaluation and application of a three-dimensional water quality model in a shallow lake with complex morphometry	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Fundamental hydrodynamic and ecological processes of a lake or reservoir could be adequately depicted by one-dimensional (1D) numerical simulation models. Whereas, lakes with significant horizontal water quality and hydrodynamic gradients due to their complex morphometry, inflow or water level fluctuations require a three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamics and ecological analyses to accurately simulate their temporal and spatial dynamics. In this study, we applied a 3D hydrodynamic model (ELCOM) coupled with an ecological model (CAEDYM) to simulate water quality parameters in three bays of the morphologically complex Lake Minnetonka. A considerable effort was made in setting up the model and a systematic parameterization approach was adopted to estimate the value of parameters based on their published values. Model calibration covered the entire length of the simulation periods from March 29 to October 20, 2000. Sensitivity analysis identified the top parameters with the largest contributions to the sensitivity of model results. The model was next verified with the same setup and parameter values for the period of April 25 to October 10, 2005 against field data. Spatial and temporal dynamics were well simulated and model output results of water temperature (T), dissolved oxygen (DO), total phosphorus (TP) and one group of algae (Cyanobacteria) represented as chlorophyll a (Chla) compared well with an extensive field data in the bays. The results show that the use of the model along with an accurate bathymetry, a systematic calibration and corroboration (verification) process will help to analyze the hydrodynamics and geochemical processes of the morphologically complex lake Minnetonka. An example of an ecological application of the model for Lake Minnetonka is presented by examining the effect of spatial heterogeneity on coolwater fish habitat analysis in 3D and under a scenario where horizontal spatial heterogeneity was eliminated (1D). Both analyses captured seasonal fish habitat changes and the total seasonal averages differed moderately. However, the 1D analysis did not capture local and short duration variabilities and missed suitable fish habitat variations of as much as 20%. The experiment highlighted the need for a 3D analysis in depicting ecological hot spots such as unsuitable fish habitats in Lake Minnetonka. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Seasonal stability of Cladophora-associated Salmonella in Lake Michigan watersheds	WATER RESEARCH												The bacterial pathogens Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, and shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) were recently found to be associated with Cladophora growing in southern Lake Michigan. Preliminary results indicated that the Salmonella strains associated with Cladophora were genetically identical to each other. However, because of the small sample size (n = 37 isolates) and a lack of information on spatial-temporal relationships, the nature of the association between Cladophora and Salmonella remained speculative. In this study, we investigated the population structure and genetic relatedness of a large number of Cladophora-borne Salmonella isolates from Lake Michigan (n = 133), as well as those isolated from stream and lake water (n = 31), aquatic plants (n = 8), and beach sands and sediments (n = 8) from adjacent watersheds. Salmonella isolates were collected during 2005-2007 between May and August from Lake Michigan beachsheds in Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana. The genetic relatedness of Salmonella isolates was examined by using the horizontal, fluorophore-enhanced rep-PGR (HFERP) DNA fingerprinting technique. While the Salmonella isolates associated with Cladophora exhibited a high degree of genetic relatedness (>= 92% similarity), the isolates were not all genetically identical. Spatial and temporal relationships were evident in the populations examined, with tight clustering of the isolates both by year and location. These findings suggest that the relationship between Salmonella and Cladophora is likely casual and is related to input sources (e.g. wastewater, runoff, birds) and the predominant Salmonella genotype surviving in the environment during a given season. Our studies indicate that Cladophora is likely an important reservoir for Salmonella and other enteric bacterial pathogens in Lake Michigan beachsheds, which in turn may influence nearshore water quality.

We recorded eight taxa of parasites in Lviv water bodies. The monogenean Gyrodactylus perccotti and the cestode Nippoteania perccotti were recorded in all five lakes studied. These parasites represent Far East species introduced together with their host. Also the copepod Neoergasilus japonicus is a Far East parasite introduced to Europe with its aquaculture vector. Differences between the surveyed bodies of water were mainly related to their local seasonal conditions and watershed characteristics. The current data confirm the presence of co-introduced populations of G. perccotti and N. perccotti, which probably affects the future invasiveness of their host. Due to low acquisition of local parasites, we cannot confirm any significant effect of invasive fish on local parasite assemblages in this region. However, the presence of the non-indigenous copepod, N. japonicus, requires additional attention in the future.

The Early Permian Krkonose Piedmont Basin exhibits striking similarities-in terms of tectonostratigraphic evolution, depositional patterns, and volcanism-to other early post-Variscan, near-equatorial intermontane basins. This work focuses on sedimentological analysis of the Vrchlabi Formation using outcrop data, combined with borehole and newly acquired field gamma spectrometry data. The formation consists predominantly of fluvial deposits in the southern part of the basin that pass laterally into deltaic and lacustrine deposits of the Rudnfk Member, located in the central part of the basin. Fluvial deposits are formed by sandstone and conglomeratic bodies, decimeters to several meters thick, interpreted as single-story and multi-story channel fills as well as various macroforms (e.g., bars) deposited by a low-sinuosity fluvial system. Channel fills intercalate with floodplain deposits centimeters to few meters thick. Vertically, the studied fluvial succession is divided into five intervals based on i) variable preservation ratio between channel fill and floodplain deposits and ii) external and internal geometries of sandstone and conglomerate channel bodies. In order to explain the observed vertical changes in fluvial style and to determine the main controlling factors, the interaction of the fluvial system with the contemporaneous lake was investigated by interpreting base-level changes of the fluvial system and their correlation with lake level changes. In the central part of the basin the transition from fluvio-deltaic to lacustrine deposits is represented by alternating beige to gray sandstones centimeters to few meters thick and by dark gray mudstones up to several meters thick that pass northwards into shales. At the outcrop scale, the new sedimentological data in combination with newly acquired gamma-ray logs enabled tracing the lateral extent of individual fluvial bodies. The integration of the new data with older borehole data leads to a substantially better understanding of lateral and vertical relationship between the fluvio-deltaic and the lacustrine facies at the basin scale. Tectonic subsidence played a substantial role during the initial deposition of the Vrchlabi Formation. However, the external geometries, the internal architecture of fluvial channel bodies, and the variable degree of floodplain preservation throughout the entire Vrchlabi Formation cannot be explained by tectonics only, but requires the consideration of climatic controls. The Early Permian fluvial system is interpreted to reflect seasonal discharge variability with dry and wet periods under long-term subhumid climatic conditions that shifted towards more arid conditions during the latest depositional stage of the Vrchlabi Formation.					; Nádaskay, Roland/AAB-9051-2020; Martinek, Karel/B-6482-2008	Nadaskay, Roland/0000-0002-7466-231X; Martinek, Karel/0000-0001-9857-8510													1527-1404	1938-3681				MAR	2022	92	3					275	303		10.2110/jsr.2020.137	http://dx.doi.org/10.2110/jsr.2020.137													WOS:000787774000004

Detectability of historical trends in station-based precipitation characteristics over the continental United States	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The goal of this paper is to detect secular trends in observed, station-based precipitation variations and extreme event occurrences over the United States. By definition, detectable trends are those that are unlikely to have arisen from internal variability alone. To represent this internal variability, we use station-specific, seasonally varying, daily time scale stationary stochastic weather modelsmodels in which the simulated interannual-to-multidecadal precipitation variance is purely the result of the random evolution of daily precipitation events within a given time periodto first estimate the trends in various means and extremes that can occur even with fixed, climatological daily precipitation characteristics. Detection of secular trends in the observed climatewhether naturally or anthropogenically inducedcan then be defined relative to this stochastic variability, i.e., as trends in the means and/or extremes that are likely to have occurred only through a change in the underlying precipitation characteristics. The derived results have two important ramifications. First, they identify hot spot regions in which trends in precipitation characteristics are already emerging from within the envelope of stochastic variability, including (but not limited to) positive trends in annual occurrence across most of the U.S. and positive trends in annual intensity and heavy-event accumulations across the Interior Plains and around the Great Lakes. Further, they identify sentinel metrics which show the greatest detectabilitye.g., annual precipitation occurrence and intensityas well as those which show the least detectability and hence are unlikely to produce any statistically meaningful signalse.g., seasonal total precipitation and extremes.

ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Flood pulse and biotic interrelationships control the food web dynamics of river floodplain systems. The Pantanal Plain in the Paraguay River Basin (Brazil) occupies 140,000 km(2) of periodically flooded areas and is divided into 12 subregions with different characteristics related to the flood pulse duration, the vegetation, the type of soil, and the resources used in activities, particularly fishing. In this study, we used Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) to model three oxbow lakes in the South Pantanal Plain, where there is no fishing activity, to test the similarity of the ecosystems, to identify the keystone species and the types of food web controls, and to determine whether these environments can support moderated fishing pressure. We found that the food webs of the oxbow lakes are similar to each other because, although they depend mainly on the presence or absence of predators, flood pulses similarly homogenize the lakes. The results highlight the importance of detritus in these food webs. In addition, the highest values of the keystoneness species index in the three models highlight the role of top predators (Hoplias malabaricus, Serrasalmus spp., Pseudoplatystoma reticulatum, birds, and mammals). Therefore, we suggest that the food webs in the three systems are subjected to an alternated control process: detritus controls the food web during the flood season and by the top predators during the dry season. The simulation outputs indicate that these oxbow lakes can sustain only moderate fishing because increasing the fishing pressure reduces the biodiversity and can negatively impact the top predators.

J	Muellegger, C; Weilhartner, A; Battin, TJ; Hofmann, T				Muellegger, Christian; Weilhartner, Andreas; Battin, Tom J.; Hofmann, Thilo			Positive and negative impacts of five Austrian gravel pit lakes on groundwater quality	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Groundwater-fed gravel pit lakes (GPLs) affect the biological, organic, and inorganic parameters of inflowing groundwater through combined effects of bank filtration at the inflow, reactions within the lake, and bank filtration at the outflow. GPLs result from wet dredging for sand and gravel and may conflict with groundwater protection programs by removing the protective soil cover and exposing groundwater to the atmosphere. We have investigated the impact on groundwater of five GPLs with different sizes, ages, and mean residence times, and all having low post-excavation anthropogenic usage. The results revealed highly active biological systems within the lake water, in which primary producers significantly reduced inflowing nitrate concentrations. Decalcification also occurred in lake water, reducing water hardness, which could be beneficial for waterworks in hard groundwater areas. Downgradient groundwater nitrate and calcium concentrations were found to be stable, with only minor seasonal variations. Biological degradation of organic material and organic micropollutants was also observed in the GPLs. For young GPLs adequate sediment deposits may not yet have formed and degradation processes at the outflow may consequently not yet be well established. However, our results showed that within 5 years from the cessation of excavation a protective sediment layer is established that is sufficient to prevent the export of dissolved organic carbon to downgradient groundwater. GPLs can improve groundwater quality in anthropogenically (e.g., pesticides and nitrate) or geologically (e.g., hardness) challenging situations. However, post-excavation usage of GPLs is often dominated by human activities such as recreational activities, water sports, or fish farming. These activities will affect lake and groundwater quality and the risks involved are difficult to predict and monitor and can lead to overall negative impacts on groundwater quality.

J	Chappaz, A; Gobeil, C; Tessier, A				Chappaz, Anthony; Gobeil, Charles; Tessier, Andre			Geochemical and anthropogenic enrichments of Mo in sediments from perennially oxic and seasonally anoxic lakes in Eastern Canada	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												We measured the vertical distributions of Mo, Fe; Mn, sulfide, sulfate, organic carbon, major ions, and pH in sediment porewater from one perennially oxic and three seasonally anoxic lacustrine basins in Eastern Canada, as well as those of Mo, acid volatile sulfide, Fe, Mn, Al, organic C, (210) Pb and Cs-137 in sediment cores from the same sites. The only input of anthropogenic Mo to these lakes comes from atmospheric deposition. The relatively monotonous distribution of Mo in the porewater of three seasonally anoxic basins suggests that Mo is not redistributed in the sedimentary column during periods of anoxia. In contrast, porewater Mo profiles obtained at three sampling dates in a perennially oxic basin display sharp Mo peaks below the sediment-water interface, indicating redistribution subsequent to deposition. Modeling of these latter porewater Mo profiles with a diagenetic reaction-transport equation coupled to comparisons among the various porewater and solid phase profiles reveal that Mo is released at 1-2 cm depth as a consequence of the reductive dissolution of Fe oxyhydroxides and scavenged both at the vicinity of the sediment-water interface, by re-adsorption onto authigenic Fe oxyhydroxides, and deeper in the sediments where dissolved sulfide concentrations are higher. The estimated rate constant for the adsorption of Mo onto Fe oxyhydroxides is 36 +/- 45 cm(3) mol(-1) s(-1). Diagenetic modeling indicates that authigenic Mo in sediments of the perennially oxic basin represents about one-third of the total solid phase Mo in the first cm below the sediment-water interface and only one tenth below this horizon. If we assume that no authigenic Mo is accumulated in the seasonally anoxic lake sediments we conclude that the sediment Mo concentrations, which are up to 3-16 times higher than the average lithogenic composition, depending on the lake, are mainly due to atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic Mo and not to the formation of authigenic Mo phases. Reconstructed historical records of the atmospheric Mo deposition indicate maximum values in the 1970s and 1980s and significant decreases since then. Emissions to the atmosphere associated with the smelting of non-ferrous ores and coal combustion appear to be the most important sources of anthropogenic Mo. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A case study of illegal fishing causes during seasonal fishery closure in Kaptai Lake, Bangladesh	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												Growing evidence shows that conservation strategies such as fishing bans may adversely affect the livelihoods of low-income communities, which often encourages community members to fish illegally. In this study, we determined the underlying factors that influenced fishermen to engage in illegal fishing during the closed season in the largest lake of Bangladesh, Kaptai Lake. Out of 231 fishermen interviewed, 46.8% were engaged in illegal fishing during the closed season. Engagement in illegal fishing was positively related to receipt of a financial loan and negatively related to receipt of a government subsidy and secondary occupation of the fishermen. Financial gain by selling the fish was the prime motive for illegal fishing. Surprisingly, fishermen received a 36% lower price for illegally harvested fish during the closed season (mean price +/- SD, BDT 95.8 +/- 64.9), when compared to that during the open fishing season (BDT 151.5 +/- 64.9). Mid-level actors secured 99%-154% more profit during the closed season. This study shows that multiple factors are important for the engagement of fishermen in illegal fishing, and therefore, an integrated conservation policy considering all causative factors should be employed to achieve more effective conservation in the region's inland waters.

Both from the wild (Poyang Lake) and seminatural (TianE-Zhou Oxbow) populations, individual blood samples from 188 animals were collected from 2009 to 2017 and from 2002 to 2015, respectively. For reference interval determination, we used a non-parametric bootstrap-based procedure to determine the 95th percentiles and the associated 90% confidence interval for each analyte. Our results indicated a need to partition the analyte concentrations by sex, age group, or pregnancy; however, we did not find a need to partition results by location. We then used a linear mixed model to determine if evidence existed for mean differences between location with sex and season as covariates and age group as the clustered random variable on mean hematological parameters in the YFP. We found that 88% of the analytes were significantly different between locations. Within the covariates, sex and season showed 31 and 69% significant difference in mean distributions, respectively. Additionally, age group provided a significant source of variation in 25% of the analytes. In summary, our finding suggests that analytes should be grouped according sex, age, and reproductive status (non-pregnant and non-lactating, pregnant and lactating). Furthermore, we have provided the first set of reference intervals for 49 clinicopathological parameters that could provide guidelines for the initial evaluation of individuals during health assessments.					; Nabi, Ghulam/AGQ-2183-2022	Nabi, Ghulam/0000-0001-5256-0083; 													1664-042X					JUL 11	2019	10								792	10.3389/fphys.2019.00792	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.00792								31354505					WOS:000475484600001

A simple model applied to upland rice in Madagascar	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Family farms in the tropics mainly rely on rainfed agriculture. Water availability is limited to rainfall and is one of the main constraints to crop productivity. Conservation agriculture (CA) is promoted as an alternative that, among other functions, enhances water infiltration and limits evaporation from the soil thanks to a mulch of crop residues left on the soil surface. These functions are assumed to reduce the water availability constraint by limiting water stress during crop growth. But the variability of rainfall distribution combined with the wide range of agroecological conditions and the variety of crop husbandries in the tropics makes it difficult to evaluate the efficiency of mulching. The aim of this study was to capture the variability through a simple modeling approach using the crop growth model PYE-CA, which requires a limited set of parameters and a virtual experiment (VE). We applied our approach to a case study of upland rice in the Lake Alaotra region in Madagascar, where rainfall distribution is highly variable. The VE used a 17-year series of weather data with a range of soil water conditions, sowing dates, and growth and yield limitations that cover the variability of agroecological conditions and management systems in the study area. The VE revealed that variable successions of wet and dry episodes during the rainy season resulted in both water stress and an increase in deep drainage. In the majority of conditions simulated, enhancing water infiltration through CA mainly increased water loss through drainage. However, better water infiltration may also reduce the production risks involved in early sowing or crop intensification, thereby offering new opportunities to farmers. As an alternative to time consuming and labor intensive experimentation, we propose a suitable modeling approach to identify the main drivers of rainfall x crop interactions that could be extrapolated to other regions in the tropics.

The current study was designed to probe FR concentrations and distribution pattern in indoor and outdoor air at different altitudinal zones (DAZs) of Pakistan with special emphasis on their risk to the exposed population. In this study, passive air samplers for the purpose of FR deposition were deployed in indoor and outdoor air at the industrial, rural, and background/colder zones/sites. All the indoor and outdoor air samples collected from DAZs were analyzed for the target FRs (9.30-47230 pg/m(3)), showing a decreasing trend as follows: Sigma NBFRs > Sigma PBDEs > Sigma DP. However, significant correlations among FRs in the indoor and outdoor air at DAZs signified a similar source of FR origin that is used in different consumer goods. Furthermore, air mass trajectories revealed that movement of air over industrial area sources influenced concentrations of FRs at rural sites. The FR concentrations, estimated daily intake (EDI) and the hazard quotient (HQ), were recorded to be higher in toddlers than those in adults. In addition, indoor air samples showed higher FR levels, EDI and HQ than outdoor air samples. An elevated FR concentrations and their prevalent exposure risks were recorded in the industrial zones followed by rural and background zones. The HQ for BDE-47 and BDE-99 in the indoor and outdoor air samples at different industrial and rural sites were recorded to be >1 in toddlers and adults, this further warrants a health risk in the population. However, FR investigation in indoor and outdoor air samples will provide a baseline data in Pakistan to take further steps by the government and agencies for its implementations.

A floating eddy-covariance platform yielded total CH4 and CO2 emission rates at high temporal resolution, while hydroacoustic surveys provided no indication of CH4 ebullition. Higher CH4 fluxes (2.9 + 0.1 mg CH4 per m(2) per day) occurred during the day when surface water temperatures were warmer and wind speeds higher than at night. Piston velocity estimates (k(600)) showed an upper limit at high wind speeds that may be more generally valid also for other lakes and reservoirs with limited CH4 dissolved in the water body: above 2.0 m s(-1) a further increase in wind speed did not lead to higher CH4 fluxes, because under such conditions it is not the turbulent mixing and transport that limits effluxes, but the resupply of CH4 to the lake surface. Increasing CH4 fluxes during the warm season showed a clear spatial gradient once the reservoir started to fill up and flood additional surface area. The warm period contributed 27% of the total CH4 emissions (2.6 t CH4 per year) estimated for the full year and CH4 accounted for 63% of carbonic greenhouse gas emissions. Overall, the average CH4 emissions (1.7 to 2.2 mg CH4 per m(2) per day determined independently from surface water samplings and eddy covariance, respectively) were small compared to most tropical and some temperate reservoirs. The resulting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in CO2-equivalents revealed that electricity produced in the Lake Klontal power plant was relatively climate-friendly with a low GHG-to-power output ratio of 1.24 kg CO2,eq per MW h compared to 6.5 and 8.1 kg CO2,eq per MW h associated with the operation of solar photovoltaics and wind energy, respectively, or about 980 kg CO2,eq per MW h for coal-fired power plants.

Glyphosate, steam and cutting for non-native plant control in Alberta fescue grassland restoration	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												QuestionWhat are the effects of cutting, glyphosate application and steam application on abundance and diversity of non-native grasses and forbs and non-target native grasses and forbs in restoration of a complex disturbed fescue grassland? LocationWaterton Lakes National Park, Alberta, Canada. MethodsCutting, glyphosate application and steam application treatments were implemented at three disturbed sites in an incomplete block design with a control. Plant communities were evaluated for four growing seasons, one before and three after management treatment implementation. ResultsGlyphosate reduced non-native grass cover for three growing seasons following application and non-native forbs for one growing season. Glyphosate led to significant increases in non-native forb cover, more than double pre-existing values 2 and 3yr after application. Native species abundance and diversity were more negatively impacted by glyphosate on sites with higher abundance and diversity prior to management treatments. Low frequency cutting over 2yr did not consistently control non-native species, steam reduced non-native grass cover at the most heavily invaded site. ConclusionsSite-specific conditions must be considered to develop effective control methods for non-native species. No treatment effectively re-established native grassland communities. Glyphosate application reduced non-native grasses, but not non-native forbs. When native forbs were abundant prior to management, glyphosate reduced them. Steam may have potential and should be further investigated. This is one of only a few studies to investigate methods to manage multiple non-native species occurring with native species, rather than management of a single undesirable species, and is the first to assess steam as a management option for native grasslands.

The first is an approximate to 2-km, four-lane floating freeway that deforms daily in response to temperature and traffic loads and seasonal lake-level variation. The second is a 6-lane elevated freeway approximate to 1 km in length that has subsided unevenly and discontinuously since it was damaged by the 2001 (M-W 6.8) Nisqually earthquake. Two additional structures comprise approximate to 300-m-long, earth-filled dams forming major reservoirs (Howard A. Hanson and Tolt dams). Real-time kinematic processing of high rate (1s or 5-s epochs) GPS observations over short baselines (0.1 to approximate to 1 km) permits continuous deformation monitoring at centimeter-level accuracy, whereas long-term deformation was measured at subcentimeter accuracy through postprocessing of 24-h observations. The floating freeway showed 60 cm of annual vertical displacement and a 1.4-+/- 0.4-cm short-period oscillation that correlates with traffic and temperature but no response to bridge-perpendicular winds gusting to 74 km/h (40 knots). Along the elevated freeway, 4-7 mm/year of lateral displacement and 4.3 +/- 14 mm/year of subsidence is observed. At Howard A. Hanson Dam, daily measurements show a slow response at the southernmost portion of the dam to the filling with water of a 30-m-deep pit excavated adjacent to the dam. The fourth structure, Tolt Dam, is stable but shows a vertical response to reservoir level and appears to isolate its GPS receivers from a well-documented regional hydrological signal.

Therefore, it represents a special ecological niche for the study on microbial ecology in the process of urbanization. In this study, we investigated outdoor microbial communities in four campuses in Wuhan, China. We obtained 284 samples from 55 sampling sites over six seasons, as well as their matching climatic and environmental records. The structure of campus outdoor microbial communities which influenced by multiple climatic factors featured seasonality. The dispersal influence of human activities on microbial communities also contributed to this seasonal pattern non-negligibly. However, despite the microbial composition alteration in response to multiple stressors, the overall predicted function of campus outdoor microbial communities remained stable across campuses. The spatial-temporal dynamic patterns on campus outdoor microbial communities and its predicted functions have bridged the gap between microbial and macro-level ecosystems, and provided hints toward a better understanding of the effects of climatic factors and human activities on campus micro-environments.					; Zhang, Zhonghua/HDO-2400-2022; Han, Maozhen/AAQ-1047-2021; Ning, Kang/ABD-3446-2020	han, mao zhen/0000-0002-5958-1941; Ning, Kang/0000-0003-3325-5387; Zha, Yuguo/0000-0003-3702-9416; Cheng, Zhangyu/0000-0002-6131-1414; chen, chaoyun/0000-0002-5270-5278													1664-302X					JUL 10	2019	10								1579	10.3389/fmicb.2019.01579	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01579								31354673					WOS:000474751500003

However, studies so far have focused on the comparison of leaf wax isotopic differences in bulk leaf samples between different plant species. We sampled three different varieties of tall grasses (Miscanthus sinensis) in six segments from base to tip and determined hydrogen and carbon isotopic ratios of leaf waxes, as well as hydrogen and oxygen isotopic ratios of leaf water samples. We found an increasing, base-to-tip hydrogen isotopic gradient along the grass blades that can probably be attributed to active leaf wax regeneration over the growth season. Carbon isotopic ratios, on the other hand, show opposite trends to hydrogen isotopic ratios along the grass blades, which may reflect different photosynthetic efficiencies at different blade locales.

Understanding the role of microbial communities for ecosystems with changing flow regimes is still incomplete and remains at the frontier of aquatic microbial ecology. In particular, influences of riverine backward flow on the aquatic biota remain largely unknown. Therefore, we examined the impact of backward flow on the cyanobacterial, total prokaryotic, and eukaryotic communities in the Changdougang River, which naturally flows into Lake Taihu, through environmental DNA metabarcoding. We analyzed the differences in community diversity, assembly, and ecological network stability among groups under backward, weak, and forward flow direction conditions. Non-metric multidimensional scaling showed higher variations in communities of groups across flow direction conditions than seasonal groups. Variations in alpha and beta diversity showed that cyanobacterial and total prokaryotic communities experienced strong homogenization under backward flow conditions, whereas the ecological uniqueness of the eukaryotic community decreased. Assembly of the three flow-related communities was primarily governed by drift and dispersal limitation in stochastic processes. However, in the cyanobacterial community, homogeneous selection in deterministic processes increased from 22.79 % to 42.86 % under backward flow, aligning with trends observed in the checkerboard score (C-score). More importantly, the topological properties of ecological networks and the degree of average variation revealed higher stability in the cyanobacterial community compared to total prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities. Considering the variations in cohesion, the network stability in the cyanobacterial community decreased under backward flow. Our findings emphasize the distinct and sequentially diminishing responses of cyanobacterial, total prokaryotic, and eukaryotic communities to backward flowing rivers. This knowledge is crucial for maintaining ecological health of rivers, assessing the complex ecological impacts on hydrological engineering, and formulating sustainable water management strategies.

Effects of Roundup formulations, nutrient addition, and Western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) on aquatic communities	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Aquatic communities can be affected by herbicides, nutrient addition, and non-native fish species. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to examine the direct and interactive effects of three stressors: (1) Roundup formulations (Roundup Weed and Grass Killer(A (R)) and Roundup Poison Ivy and Tough Brush Killer Plus(A (R))), (2) nutrient addition, and (3) the presence of the non-native Western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), on experimental pond communities. Roundup formulations had the most widespread effects on the zooplankton community, but effects varied between formulations and among taxa. The only significant effect of nutrient addition was a lowering of Daphnia abundance in the nutrient addition treatments. The abundances of Daphnia, mid-sized cladocerans, and total zooplankton were lowered by mosquitofish, but no other taxa showed significant mosquitofish effects. We found several two-way and three-way interactions among the stressors, but these varied among zooplankton taxa. Chlorophyll a levels were higher with nutrient addition but were not significantly affected by Roundup formulation or mosquitofish. Our results suggest toxicity of Roundup formulations varies among taxa, and Roundup formulations differ in their toxicity to zooplankton, but with no cascading effects on primary producers. In addition, interactions among stressors affected the zooplankton community.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2016	23	12					11729	11739		10.1007/s11356-016-6381-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6381-2								26944427					WOS:000377476700028
J	Jorgensen, JG; Dinan, LR; Brown, MB				Jorgensen, Joel G.; Dinan, Lauren R.; Brown, Mary Bomberger			Flight initiation distances of nesting Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) in response to human disturbance	AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY												Birds frequently interact with people when they occur in coupled human-ecological or anthropogenic environments, which makes the protection of legally protected species a challenge. Flight initiation distances (FIDs) are often used to inform development of appropriate buffer distances required for human exclusion zones used to protect birds nesting in anthropogenic landscapes. Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) are protected by the Endangered Species Act in the United States and often nest in areas used by humans. Studies evaluating Piping Plover FIDs are limited and implementation of exclusion zones has been inconsistent across the species' range. We measured Piping Plover response and FIDs to naturally occurring stimuli on public beaches at Lake McConaughy, Nebraska, USA. Piping Plover FIDs differed most by stimulus class (vehicle, human, dog, human with dog), Julian day, and hour of day. Piping Plover FIDs were greatest for dog and human with dog compared to humans and vehicles. For all types of stimuli, Piping Plover FIDs decreased over time during the nesting season and increased slightly during each day. In the majority of instances in which Piping Plovers left their nests, return times to the nest were relatively short (less than three minutes). These results suggest Piping Plovers become habituated to the presence of human-related stimuli over the course of a nesting season, but other explanations such as parental investment and risk allocation cannot be excluded. Additional research and improved guidance regarding the implementation of exclusion zones is needed so managers can implement effective protection programs in anthropogenic landscapes.																			1712-6568					JUN	2016	11	1							5	10.5751/ACE-00826-110105	http://dx.doi.org/10.5751/ACE-00826-110105													WOS:000379869400005
J	Zhang, QY; Liu, HP				Zhang, Qianyu; Liu, Heping			Interannual variability in the surface energy budget and evaporation over a large southern inland water in the United States	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Understanding how the surface energy budget and evaporation over inland waters respond to climate change and variability remains limited. Here we report 2 year measurements of the surface energy budget using the eddy covariance method over Ross Barnett Reservoir, Mississippi, USA, for 2008 and 2009. Annual mean sensible (H) and latent (LE) heat fluxes in 2008 were 9.5%, and 10.0% greater than in 2009, respectively. Most of the interannual variations in the surface energy fluxes and meteorological variables primarily occurred in the cool seasons from October to March, which was enhanced by frequent large wind events associated with cold front passages. These large wind events greatly promoted H and LE exchange and produced H and LE pulses that increased variations in H and LE between these two cool seasons. In the warm seasons from April to September, H and LE pulses were also present, which largely increased variations in LE and dampened those in H between the two warm seasons. The H and LE pulses contributed to approximately 50% of the annual H and 28% of the annual LE, although they only covered about 16% of the entire year. The interannual variations in H and LE pulses contributed to about 78% of the interannual variations in H and 40% of those in LE. Our results imply that the increased interannual variability in cold front activities as a result of climate change would amplify interannual variations in the evaporation and the surface energy exchange over inland waters in this region.																			2169-897X	2169-8996				MAY 27	2013	118	10					4290	4302		10.1002/jgrd.50435	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jgrd.50435													WOS:000325272000027

The Aral Sea experience has proven that dust from saline soil is a serious health issue. Various stabilization techniques to reduce wind erosion have been used in the past. However, in recent years, a potentially viable method has been developed; microbial induced calcite precipitation (MICP) has been introduced as a method of soil stabilization, though its effectiveness in saline soils remains to be examined. The effect of salt content in loose sandy soil on calcite precipitation of calcite through stimulation of native bacteria is investigated in this article. Samples with salinity up to 30% salt content were prepared and treated with different culture medium compounds. A number of tests were used to evaluate the effect of the mentioned parameters. The results show that improvement increases with increasing salinity up to 5% salt, and further increase in salinity reduces the effectiveness of improvement. It is also shown that the addition of urea in the culture medium has a significant effect on the urea hydrolysis which resulted in a five-fold increase in compressive strength. Four native strains of halotolerant urease-positive bacteria were also identified.					; Kalantary, Farzin/AEP-2422-2022; Safdari, Mahdi/KUF-1578-2024	Kalantary, Farzin/0000-0001-6391-5679; Safdari Seh Gonbad, Mahdi/0000-0003-0612-535X; 													0149-0451	1521-0529				JUL 3	2019	36	6					533	542		10.1080/01490451.2019.1579876	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490451.2019.1579876													WOS:000467885400006

JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Parallel evolution of a dwarf and normal whitefish has been documented in six post-glacial lakes. Here, we relate the structure and seasonal variations of the epibenthic invertebrate communities to the extent of phenotypic differentiation in these species pairs. The highest phenotypic differentiation occurs in lakes characterized by less overlap in size distribution between limnetic and epibenthic prey which could represent enhanced ecological opportunities for trophic specialization and adaptive divergence. Differences in community assemblages and seasonal variation of biotic and abiotic conditions may also play a role. Accumulating evidence indicates that strong directional selection acting on dwarf whitefish may be more important than divergent selection acting on both sympatric forms in driving whitefish phenotypic divergence and ultimately, ecological speciation. Along with Landry et al. (2007), this study supports the general hypothesis that parallelism in divergence among sympatric dwarf and normal whitefish is associated with parallelism in limnological adaptive landscape.

With obtained time series of annual highest water level (HWL), annual lowest water level (LWL) and the corresponding river discharges from three gauging stations in MLYR that covering the period 1987-2011, the current study evaluated the change characteristics of annual extreme water levels and the correlation with river discharges by using the methods of trend test, Mann-Whitney-Pettitt (MWP) test and double mass analysis. Major result indicated a decreasing/increasing trend for annual HWL/LWL of all stations in MLYR during the study period. A change point in 1999 was identified for annual HWL at the Hankou and Datong stations. The year 2006 was found to be the critical year that the relationship between annual extreme water levels and river discharges changed in the MLYR. With contrast to annual LWL in MLYR, further investigation revealed that the change characteristics of annual HWL were highly consistent with regional precipitation in the Yangtze River Basin, while the linkage with Three Gorges Dam (TGD) operation is not strong. Our observation also pointed out that the effect of serious down cutting of the riverbed and the enlargement of the cross-section area during the initial period of TGD operation caused the downward trend of the relationship between annual LWL and river discharge. Whereas, the relatively raised river water level before the flood season due to TGD regulation since 2006 explained for the changing upward trend of the relationship between annual HWL and river discharge.

Additionally, the uptake of warnings may be hampered by difficulties in translating the scientific information to the local context and experiences. Here we use social science methods to characterise local knowledge of flash flooding among vulnerable communities along the flat Lake Malawi shoreline in the district of Karonga, northern Malawi. This is then used to guide a scientific analysis of the factors that contribute to flash floods in the area using contemporary global datasets, including geomorphology, soil and land-use characteristics, and hydro-meteorological conditions. Our results show that communities interviewed have detailed knowledge of the impacts and drivers of flash floods (deforestation and sedimentation), early warning signs (changes in clouds, wind direction, and rainfall patterns), and distinct hydro-meteorological processes that lead to flash flood events at the beginning and end of the wet season. Our analysis shows that the scientific data corroborate this knowledge and that combining local and scientific knowledge provides improved understanding of flash flood processes within the local context. We highlight the potential of linking large-scale global datasets with local knowledge to improve the usability of flash flood warnings.					van den Homberg, Marc/AGY-9332-2022; Werner, Micha/C-8144-2009	Bucherie, Agathe/0000-0001-7764-3061; Werner, Micha/0000-0003-4198-5638; van den Homberg, Marc/0000-0003-1436-254X													1561-8633	1684-9981				FEB 16	2022	22	2					461	480		10.5194/nhess-22-461-2022	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-461-2022													WOS:000760374200001

The infestation has an impact on the lake's ecological and socioeconomic systems. Early detection of the spread of water hyacinth using geospatial techniques is crucial for its effective management and control. The main objective of this study was to examine the spatiotemporal distribution of water hyacinth from 2016 to 2022 using a random forest machine learning model. The study used 16 variables obtained from Sentinel-2A, Sentinel-1 SAR, and SRTM DEM, and a random forest supervised classification model was applied. Seven spectral indices, five spectral bands, two Sentinel-1 SAR bands, and two topographic variables were used in combination to model the spatial distribution of water hyacinth. The model was evaluated using the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient. The findings demonstrated that the overall accuracy ranged from 0.91 to 0.94 and kappa coefficient from 0.88 to 0.92 in the wet season and 0.93 to 0.95 and 0.90 to 0.93 in the dry season, respectively. B11 and B5 (2022), VH, soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and normalized difference water index (NDWI) (2020), B5 and B12 (2018), and VH and slope (2016) are the highly important variables in the classification. The study found that the spatial coverage of water hyacinth was 686.5 and 650.4 ha (2016), 1,851 and 1,259 ha (2018), 1,396.7 and 1,305.7 ha (2020), and 1,436.5 and 1,216.5 ha (2022) in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The research findings indicate that variables derived from optical (Sentinel-2A and SRTM) and non-optical (Sentinel-1 SAR) satellite imagery effectively identify water hyacinth and display its spatiotemporal spread using the random forest machine learning algorithm.

Climate Change Risks to Freshwater Subsistence Fisheries in Arctic Alaska: Insights and Uncertainty from Broad Whitefish Coregonus nasus	FISHERIES												Arctic freshwater ecosystems and fish populations are largely shaped by seasonal and long-term watershed hydrology. In this paper, we hypothesize how changing air temperature and precipitation will alter freeze and thaw processes, hydrology, and instream habitat to assess potential indirect effects, such as the change to the foraging and behavioral ecology, on Arctic fishes, using Broad Whitefish Coregonus nasus as an indicator species. Climate change is expected to continue to alter hydrologic pathways, flow regimes, and, therefore, habitat suitability, connectivity, and availability for fishes. Warming and lengthening of the growing season will likely increase fish growth rates; however, the exceedance of threshold stream temperatures will likely increase physiological stress and alter life histories. We expect these changes to have mixed effects on Arctic subsistence fishes and fisheries. Management and conservation approaches focused on preserving the processes that create heterogeneity in aquatic habitats, genes, and communities will help maintain the resilience of Broad Whitefish and other important subsistence fisheries. Long-term effects are uncertain, so filling scientific knowledge gaps, such as identifying important habitats or increasing knowledge of abiotic variables in priority watersheds, is key to understanding and potentially mitigating likely impacts to Arctic fishes in a rapidly changing landscape.					; Leppi, Jason/GZM-9521-2022	Leppi, Jason/0000-0002-6970-6402; Liljedahl, Anna/0000-0001-7114-6443; Rinella, Daniel/0000-0002-3327-1320; Wipfli, Mark/0000-0002-4856-6068													0363-2415	1548-8446				JUL	2023	48	7					295	306		10.1002/fsh.10918	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/fsh.10918		MAY 2023											WOS:000983745500001

Influence of freshwater flows on the distribution of eggs and larvae of black bream Acanthopagrus butcheri within a drought-affected estuary	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												This study tested the hypothesis that variable freshwater flow in the Gippsland Lakes, Australia, influences the location and extent of environmental conditions suitable for spawning and larval development of black bream, Acanthopagrus butcheri. Freshwater flow had a large influence on the salinity and level of stratification (difference between bottom and surface salinity) in the Gippsland Lakes. Freshwater flows throughout this study varied from no or low flows through to major flooding in 2007. Eggs of A. butcheri were found in similar concentrations throughout the lakes and rivers. More than 99% of larvae, however, were collected from within rivers, with very few larvae being collected from the lakes. A comparison of two spawning seasons revealed that the year with higher freshwater flows also had greater spawning activity and higher concentrations of larvae. Interestingly, there was a significant relationship between the distribution of eggs and larvae with the level of stratification. The highest concentrations of larvae occurred at sites with a difference in bottom and surface salinities of 1520. This study demonstrates that despite A. butcheri spawning in the lakes and rivers, it is only locations with a halocline that function as larval nursery habitat.

We investigate the evolution of SGLs as reported in three datasets, each based on automated classification of satellite imagery. Although the datasets span the period 2001-10, there are differences in temporal sampling, and only the years 2005-07 are common. By subsampling the most populous dataset, we recommend a sampling frequency of one image per 6.5 days in order to minimize uncertainty associated with poor temporal sampling. When compared with manual classification of satellite imagery, all three datasets are found to omit a sizeable (29, 48 and 41%) fraction of lakes and are estimated to document the average size of SGLs to within 0.78, 0.48 and 0.95 km(2). We combine the datasets using a hierarchical scheme, producing a single, optimized, dataset. This combined record reports up to 67% more lakes than a single dataset. During 2005-07, the rate of SGL growth tends to follow the rate at which runoff increases in each year. In 2007, lakes drain earlier than in 2005 and 2006 and remain absent despite continued runoff. This suggests that lakes continue to act as open surface bed conduits following drainage.					; Selmes, Nick/N-3634-2013; Leeson, Amber/JFA-1001-2023	Johansson, Malin/0000-0003-0129-2239; Shepherd, Andrew/0000-0002-4914-1299; Fettweis, Xavier/0000-0002-4140-3813; Selmes, Nick/0000-0002-6557-1379; Leeson, Amber/0000-0001-8720-9808													0022-1430	1727-5652					2013	59	218					1179	1188		10.3189/2013JoG13J064	http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/2013JoG13J064													WOS:000329013700017

Understanding the spatial scale effects and driving mechanisms of BLLP changes on water quality in large river basins is a challenging research topic and an international frontier in the interdisciplinary fields of geography and environment. This study analyzes the spatial variations of BLLP and water quality throughout the Yellow River Basin (YRB) during the rainy seasons from 2019 to 2021 (4 h scale). Utilized the random forest model to quantitatively separates the contributions of rainfall processes to surface runoff and water pollution, revealing the scale effects and non-linear driving mechanisms of BLLP impacts on water environment changes. The results indicate that: 1) The YRB exhibits great spatial heterogeneity in terms of both BLLP and water quality, with places with lower water quality displaying bigger areas and higher degrees of BLLP fragmentation. 2) The patch density and built-up land area (PD.B and CA.B) have a major impact on changes in water quality in the YRB, with notable impacts noted in circular buffer zones with radii of 20 km and 5 km, respectively. 3) PD.B is sensitive to water quality in the YRB, explaining 39.1%-49.5% of the variance under different rainfall conditions, and exhibits a significant non-linear relationship, with an impact threshold of 0.38 (n/100 ha). The study suggests that for large-scale regions like the YRB, the degree of BLLP fragmentation is more likely to lead to degradation of water environmental quality compared to its area. BLLP fragmentation due to higher PD.B and CA.B disrupts the original ecosystem and hydrological connectivity, resulting in poorer retention and filtration of pollutants carried by rainfall runoff, while increasing the export of other pollutants. However, once urbanization surpasses a certain threshold, the BLLP fragmentation can enhance water quality by reducing the impermeable surface connectivity, as they are no longer impacted by expanding areas. To achieve ecologically sustainable development, it is necessary to apply rational landscape management and water resource management policies that consider the dual process of how BLLP fragmentation affects the water environment.					hou, xikang/ABF-9017-2021; Dou, Jinghui/MFJ-5096-2025														0301-4797	1095-8630				DEC	2024	371								123232	10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.123232	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.123232		NOV 2024						39531767					WOS:001396331100001

Above- and below-ground biomass of P. australis, water and sediment were sampled monthly for 1 year at six sites of Lake Burullus (three sites represent each of the northern and southern parts of the lake) using six randomly distributed quadrats (each of 0.5 x 0.5 m) at each sampling site. Significant variation was detected for Ni and Pb concentrations in the sediments and waters between the northern and southern sites of the lake. The biomass of P. australis in the southern sites was greater than that in the northern sites; in addition, the above-ground biomass was higher than the below-ground biomass. The above-ground organs accumulated higher concentrations of Ni and Pb than the below-ground organs. The Ni and Pb standing stocks data indicated that the organs of P. australis extracted higher amounts of Ni and Pb per its area from the southern rather than the northern sites. In the current study, the Ni and Pb above-ground standing stocks increased from the early growing season (February) and reached its peak during August and then decreased. The highest monthly Ni and Pb standing stock (18.2 and 18.4 g m(- 2), respectively) was recorded in the above-ground organs of plants in the southern sites in August. The bioaccumulation factor of Ni was 157.6 and 153.4 in the northern and southern sites, respectively, whereas that of Pb was 175.3 and 158.3. The translocation factor of Ni and Pb from the below- to above-ground organs was generally > 1. Thus, this reed species is a potential candidate for Ni and Pb phytoextraction. Based on our results, P. australis could be used for the extraction of Ni and Pb to reduce the pollution in Lake Burullus, if the above-ground biomass is harvested at its maximum value in August, as was the case regarding the maximum standing stock of Ni and Pb.					; Ayed, Hamdi/AAX-4754-2020; Eid, Ebrahem/O-2723-2013; Haroun, Soliman/AAS-2869-2020; Jensen, Kai/L-6657-2015; Galal, Tarek/AAF-7604-2019; Al-Sodany, Yassin/AAJ-7411-2020; Khedher, Khaled/AFC-9108-2022	Eid, Ebrahem/0000-0003-2452-4469; Al-Sodany, Yassin/0000-0002-8417-9129; Jensen, Kai/0000-0002-0543-070X; ayed, hamdi/0000-0001-6108-5093; Khedher, Khaled/0000-0002-4167-1690													0007-4861	1432-0800				MAR	2021	106	3			SI		516	527		10.1007/s00128-021-03120-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-021-03120-y		FEB 2021						33547904					WOS:000615549200002

Effect of Climate Change on Runoff Generation: Application to Rift Valley Lakes Basin of Ethiopia	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING												In this paper, an attempt has been made to investigate the potential impact of climate change on runoff generation at two agricultural watersheds. Climate change and key future signals of its variability were assessed using general circulation models (GCMs). Given that GCMs are operating at coarser resolution, the statistical downscaling model was applied to reduce large-scale atmospheric variables into localized weather variables from the Bjerknes Center for Climate Research-Bergen Climate Model 2.0 and Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) Mark (MK) 3.0 GCM outputs. As precipitation variables are composed of biases, both linear and power transformation bias correction methods were applied to obtain bias-corrected daily precipitation. Bias-corrected daily precipitation and temperature variables were used to simulate runoff for current and future climate scenarios using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The statistical downscaling model, followed by bias correction, effectively reproduced the current weather variables. Increased extreme daily precipitation and temperature events prevailed for future scenarios. Dry spell length increased during the driest months and remained stable during wet seasons. There was no defined future precipitation change pattern. At two watersheds in the Rift Valley Lakes Basin in Ethiopia, the simulated runoff varied from to 18% and and 14%, respectively. Simulated average annual runoff showed slight variation between the GCMs at both watersheds.

Using stable isotopes to track hydrological processes at an oil sands mine, Alberta, Canada	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: This study was conducted at an oil sands operation in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR), northeastern Alberta, Canada. The mine comprises open pit excavation of bituminous sands at two sites (Mildred Lake, ML, and Aurora North, AN), with a single hot-water extraction circuit connecting extraction plants at each mine.Study focus: Water samples were collected and analyzed regularly over an eight-year period to establish inventories of site-wide water isotope signatures including seasonal and interannual changes in the recycle water circuit, and to permit future application of an isotope balance model to constrain poorly quantified processes such as evaporation losses, dewatering of tailings, and tailings pond connectivity of the recycle water circuit.New hydrological insights for the region: Sampling of precipitation inputs over an 8-year period was used to constrain a local meteoric water line for the area. Differences in evaporative isotopic enrichment of tailings ponds at ML and AN are attributed to use of Athabasca River makeup water at the former site versus basal dewatering sources at the latter, with similar atmospheric controls at both. A conceptual model is developed summarizing temporal variations in water balance and isotopic signatures within the recycle water circuit, including accurate simulation of the unique isotopic enrichment of cooling tower blowdown. This study provides foundational evidence for application of stable isotope mass balance to monitor and improve industrial water use efficiency and management.

Annual patterns of phytoplankton density and primary production in a large, shallow lake: the central role of light	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												We studied the seasonal dynamics of suspended particulate matter in a turbid, large shallow lake during an annual period (2005-06). We relate the patterns of seston concentration (total suspended solids), phytoplankton biomass and water transparency to the seasonal pattern of incident solar radiation (I-0). We also report the seasonal trends of phytoplankton primary production (PP) and photosynthesis photoinhibition due to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) (I-beta and UV50). We first collected empirical evidence that indicated the conditions of light limitation persisted during the study period. We found that the depth-averaged irradiance estimated for the time of the day of maximum irradiance (Imean-noon) was always lower than the measured onset of light saturation of photosynthesis (I-k). We then contrasted the observations with theoretical expectations based on a light limitation scenario. The observed temporal patterns of seston concentration, both on a volume and area basis, were significantly explained by I-0 (R-2 = 0.39 and R-2 = 0.37 respectively). The vertical diffuse attenuation coefficient (kd(PAR)) (R-2 = 0.55) and the depth-averaged irradiance (I-mean) (R-2 = 0.66), significantly increased with the I-0; while the irradiance reaching the lake bottom (I-out) significantly decreased with the incident irradiance (R-2 = 0.49). However, phytoplankton biovolume maxima were not coincident with the time of the year of maximum irradiance. A significant positive relationship was observed between PP estimated on an area basis and I-0 (R-2 = 0.51, P < 0.001). In addition, the parameters describing the photosynthetic responses to high irradiances displayed marked seasonal trends. The photosynthesis photoinhibition due to PAR as well as to UV were significantly related to incident solar radiation (PAR: R-2 = 0.73; UV: R-2 = 0.74). These results suggest adaptation of the phytoplankton community in response to changes in incident solar radiation.					; Torremorell, Ana/AAS-3083-2021	Llames, Maria Eugenia/0000-0001-6984-8016; Zagarese, Horacio/0000-0001-6588-5960; Torremorell, Ana/0000-0003-3903-6863													0046-5070	1365-2427				MAR	2009	54	3					437	449		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.02119.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.02119.x													WOS:000263245000001

Exploring the environmental context of recent Didymosphenia geminata proliferation in Gaspesie, Quebec, using paleolimnology	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Management authorities often perceive Didymosphenia geminata (didymo) as an invasive, nuisance diatom species that has been introduced to eastern Canada; however, observations from early 20th century diatom surveys challenge this characterization. We apply paleolimnological techniques to place recent didymo blooms from Gaspesie, Quebec, into historical and environmental context. Sedimentary diatom assemblages were examined from Lac Humqui (a headwater lake) and Lac au Saumon (a lake with an inflowing river currently supporting blooms). The Lac Humqui assemblage experienced a broad-scale shift in their dominant life strategy with declines in fragilarioid taxa and increases in planktonic diatoms (i.e., Cyclotella-Discostella species) that began similar to 1970 and increased to modern abundances similar to 1990. Strong relationships between this diatom shift and increases in regional air temperatures and earlier river ice-out dates are consistent with longer growing seasons and enhanced thermal stability in Lac Humqui. Didymo was observed throughout the Lac au Saumon core, demonstrating that it has been present in the region since at least similar to 1970. Our paleolimnological evidence indicates that blooms likely form in response to regional consequences of climate warming, rather than human introduction.					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Pisaric, Michael/0000-0003-3806-8986; Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696; Lavery, Jacqueline/0000-0003-1179-1445													0706-652X	1205-7533				APR	2014	71	4					616	626		10.1139/cjfas-2013-0442	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2013-0442													WOS:000333412000012

Detailed intrabasin comparison of these layers enabled identification of (i) different source areas of detrital sediments, (ii) flood-triggered sediment flux and local erosion events, and (iii) seasonal differences of suspended flood sediment distribution within the lake basin. Additional calibration of the detrital layer record with river discharge and precipitation data reveals different empirical thresholds for flood layer deposition for different parts of the basin. At proximal locations detrital layer deposition requires floods exceeding a daily discharge of 40 m(3) s (1), whereas at a location 2 km more distal an hourly discharge of 80 m(3) s(-1) and at least 2 days of discharge above 40 m(3) s(-1) are necessary. Furthermore, we observe a better correlation between layer thickness and flood amplitude in the depocentre than in distal and proximal areas of the basin. Although our results are partly site-specific, the applied dual calibration approach is suitable to precisely decipher flood layer formation processes and, thereby, improve the interpretation of long flood time series from lake sediments.

This study aims to investigate the trace elements (TEs) content and their health risk assessment in the Badigad River Basin in the lesser Himalayas of Nepal. In total, 44 water samples were collected from 22 different sites during the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons, and 25 TEs were analyzed. Correlation matrix and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to analyze the potential relationship between the measured TEs and their source tracking. Furthermore, the water quality index (WQI), metal index (MI), and cancer index (CI) were evaluated. The TEs content in all samples were found to be within the WHO recommended guideline for drinking and domestic purposes. The dominancy order of the TEs was observed as Sr > Ba > Li > Rb > Zn > Cr > Sc > Mn > Ti > Cu > As > Ni > Co > U > V > Pb > Cs > Ga > Y > Tl > Th > Zr > Bi > Cd > Nb. The PCA analysis suggested that TEs could have natural, anthropogenic, and mixed origins. The WQI indicated that the river water is safe from a human health perspective. The MI suggested that Badigad River can be considered safer for drinking purposes, and the cancer index (CI) showed that all the reported TEs are at low-risk levels. The findings of this study could be useful for government agencies in developing more sustainable water management policies in the region. However, it is suggested that further investigations should be conducted in terms of other hydrogeochemical variables, including major ions, at spatiotemporal levels for the sustainability of the river basin.					; Neupane, Bhanu/AAN-5876-2020; Bishwakarama, Kiran/LNP-6428-2024; Kandel, Kshitiz/ODL-7936-2025; Ramesh, Pant/AAC-9696-2020	Kandel, Kshitiz/0000-0001-7461-613X; Singh, Virendra/0000-0002-4819-8330; Bishwakarma, Kiran/0000-0002-0947-4697; 													2096-0956	2365-7499				AUG	2023	42	4					689	703		10.1007/s11631-023-00611-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11631-023-00611-z		APR 2023											WOS:000978499100001

Temporal and spatial variations of CO2 diffuse volcanic degassing on Cuicocha Caldera Lake - Ecuador	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Cuicocha Caldera is the youngest eruptive center of Cotacachi-Cuicocha Volcanic Complex, located at the north of Ecuador. The caldera contains a lake of 3.95 km(2) surface, and a maximum depth of 148 m. Cuicocha Lake is characterized by the presence of CO2 gaseous diffuse emissions, perceptible as bubbling zones. Since 2011, CO2 diffuse flux measurements have been performed in this lake using the accumulation chamber method. The data obtained from twenty surveys were processed by means of the Graphical Statistical Approach and the Sequential Gaussian Simulation. The results reveal that Cuicocha lake has released a total estimated amount of similar to 400 kt of CO2 in the period between March 2011 and May 2019, with an average rate of 135 t/day. Furthermore, the spatial and temporal analysis of the data made possible the understanding of the processes occurring in the lake: 1) Lake stratification caused by the seasons seem to favor CO2 accumulation in the hipolimnion and its posterior releasing. Minimum total flux values of similar to 50 t/day have been estimated during "warm" stratified periods and maximum flux values of similar to 170 t/day have been recorded during "cold" overturn periods. Additionally, at least two anomalous degassing episodes were identified in 2012-2013, seemingly associated to changes in the volcanic activity also detected through seismicity. 2) Cuicocha CO2 degassing seems to be controlled by the existence of diffuse degassing structures at the lake bottom, which correspond to high permeability zones resulting from the intersection between similar to NE-SW and similar to WNW-ESE oriented structures. We propose a conceptual model to explain the systematic apparition of CO2 anomalies on specific areas of the lake surface.

Pollen-based differentiation of Amazonian rainforest communities and implications for lowland palaeoecology in tropical South America	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												An ongoing controversy in Amazonian palaeoecology is the manner in which Amazonian rainforest communities have responded to environmental change over the last glacial-interglacial cycle. Much of this controversy results from an inability to identify the floristic heterogeneity exhibited by rainforest communities within fossil pollen records. We apply multivariate (Principal Components Analysis) and classification (Unweighted Pair Group with Arithmetic Mean Agglomerative Classification) techniques to floral-biometric, modern pollen trap and lake sediment pollen data situated within different rainforest communities in the tropical lowlands of Amazonian Bolivia. Modern pollen rain analyses from artificial pollen traps show that evergreen terra firme (well-drained), evergreen terra firme liana, evergreen seasonally inundated, and evergreen riparian rainforests may be readily differentiated, floristically and palynologically. Analogue matching techniques, based on Euclidean distance measures, are employed to compare these pollen signatures with surface sediment pollen assemblages from five lakes: Laguna Bella Vista, Laguna Chaplin, and Laguna Huachi situated within the Madeira-Tapajos moist forest ecoregion, and Laguna Isirere and Laguna Loma Suarez, which are situated within forest patches in the Beni savanna ecoregion. The same numerical techniques are used to compare rainforest pollen trap signatures with the fossil pollen record of Laguna Chaplin. Pollen assemblages of pollen traps situated within riparian forest communities are most similar to surface sediment samples from Lagunas Bella Vista and Chaplin. Pollen derived from terra firme forests also comprises a significant proportion of these assemblages. Together, these pollen spectra successfully identify riparian and terra firme rainforest communities surrounding the two lakes today. Close similarity between terra firme liana pollen trap assemblages and surface samples obtained from Laguna Huachi, a lake surrounded by relatively undisturbed liana forest, suggests liana forest pollen rain may also be identified within lake sediment records. Pollen spectra obtained from surface sediment samples from lakes situated within gallery forests of the Beni savanna ecoregion are significantly different to those obtained from the Madeira-Tapajos ecoregion, reflecting their different floristic compositions. By applying our findings to the previously published Laguna Chaplin Quaternary pollen record, we show that differentiation between riparian and terra firme rainforest pollen assemblages can lead to more robust and detailed palaeovegetation reconstructions than has hitherto been possible.

Northern Delta Lakes as Summertime CO2 Absorbers Within the Arctic Landscape	ECOSYSTEMS												The vast majority of lakes examined worldwide emit CO2 to the overlying atmosphere, through a process by which catchment-derived subsidies of terrigenous C, often in the form of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), augment within-lake CO2 production above the level consumed via photosynthesis. We show that shallow, macrophyte-rich lakes of the Mackenzie Delta, western Canadian Arctic, do not follow this pattern. These lakes are strong summertime CO2 absorbers, despite DOC concentrations at or above levels commonly shown to produce CO2 emission. Paradoxically, CO2 levels were lowest where DOC was greatest, in lakes which appear to be annual net CO2 absorbers, and have poor hydrologic connection to the terrestrial landscape. CO2 in these lakes is depleted by high macrophyte productivity, and although catchment-derived C subsidies are low, within-lake DOC generation appears to occur as a byproduct of macrophyte photosynthesis and evapoconcentration. Additionally, after accounting for DOC and macrophytes, lakes that were least connected to the larger terrestrial landscape remained weaker CO2 absorbers, suggesting that CO2 balance may also be affected by DOC quality, foodweb structure, or inputs of pCO(2)-rich riverwater to connected lakes. In contrast, a small subset of Delta lakes that were strongly affected by permafrost melting were CO2 emitters, suggesting future permafrost degradation could engender a change in the overall CO2 balance of these lakes from near-CO2 neutral over the ice-free season, to clear CO2 emission. Our work suggests that the current paradigm of lakewater CO2 regulation may need to specifically incorporate shallow, productive lakes, and those that are poorly connected to their surrounding landscape.

Urban host plant utilisation by the invasive Halyomorpha halys (Stal) (Hemiptera, Pentatomidae) in northern Utah	NEOBIOTA												The invasive and highly polyphagous brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Stal), is a severe agricultural and urban nuisance pest in North America. Since its initial invasion into Utah in 2012, H. halys has become well established in urban and suburban locations along the western foothills of the Wasatch Front in northern Utah. Bordering the Great Basin Desert, this area is unique from other North American locations with H. halys due to its high elevation (> 1200 m), aridity (30-year mean RH = 53.1%; dew point = -1.9 degrees C) and extreme temperatures (the 30-year mean minimum and maximum in January and July in Salt Lake City range from -3.1 to 3.6 degrees C and 20.3 to 32.4 degrees C, respectively). To document which plant species harbour H. halys, surveys were conducted in 17 urban/suburban sites in four counties during 2017 and 2018. Halyomorpha halys was more abundant in Salt Lake and Utah counties than in the more northern counties of Davis and Weber and was found on 53 plant species, nine of which hosted two or more developmental stages in both years. The majority of hosts were in the families Fabaceae, Rosaceae and Sapindaceae. Northern catalpa, Catalpa speciosa (Warder), was the most consistent host, supporting a majority of H. halys detections in all life stages; thus we identify it as a sentinel host. Twenty-nine species were novel hosts for H. halys in North America; of these, Acer ginnalaMaxim, Populus tremuloides Michx., Prunus armeniaca X domestica 'Flavor King' and Prunus virginiana 'Schubert' were detected with two or more life stages of H. halys in both years. Peak populations of H. halys occurred from mid-June to midSeptember. We describe H. halys plant utilisation by life stage and seasonal period to aid future detection and management of this invasive insect in the greater Intermountain West region.																			1619-0033	1314-2488				JAN 28	2021		64					87	101		10.3897/neobiota.64.60050	http://dx.doi.org/10.3897/neobiota.64.60050													WOS:000613756600001

Ellen			Differences in seasonal distribution of wild and stocked juvenile lake trout by depth and temperature in Lake Champlain	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) reared in hatcheries are exposed to an environment and feeding regime that is different from wild lake trout, and are stocked at substantially larger sizes with higher lipid reserves. In addition to differences in diet and growth, this early experience may alter habitat use compared to the wild cohort. We used seasonal data on the depth and temperature distribution of wild and stocked juvenile lake trout to test for differences in habitat use and inform sampling strategies to evaluate annual recruitment. Bottom trawling was conducted from 2015 to 2019 in the central basin of Lake Champlain every two to four weeks during the ice-free season. Differences in distribution of wild and stocked lake trout were most pronounced during thermal stratification, when wild juveniles were more abundant than stocked juveniles at shallower depths and warmer temperatures and stocked juveniles were more abundant at deeper depths and colder temperatures. Temperature preferences may be a consequence of different early rearing environments; wild lake trout are acclimated to lake temperatures and forage, whereas stocked fish entered the lake with high lipid content and little foraging experience. Unbiased assessment of the proportion of wild lake trout and growth and survival of the entire juvenile lake trout population using bottom trawl sampling should either take place in the preand post stratification seasons when wild and stocked fish are at the same depths, or include the full range of depths and temperatures that wild and stocked fish occupy during the stratified period.

Seasonal and Diel Bathythermal Distributions of Lake Whitefish in Lake Huron: Potential Implications for Lake Trout Bycatch in Commercial Fisheries	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Depths and temperatures recorded during 2003-2005 by archival tags implanted in Lake Whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis and in Great Lakes origin (GLO) and New York Finger Lakes origin (FLO) strains of Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush were used to compare seasonal diel depth and temperature distributions in Lake Huron. Seasonal depth distributions were examined to determine if species differences could be exploited to reduce bycatch of Lake Trout in commercial Lake Whitefish gill-net fisheries. Both GLO and FLO Lake Trout used deeper and colder waters than Lake Whitefish during daylight and dark. Temperature differences between species were greatest during periods of stratification when behavioral thermoregulation was possible. Other than during spawning periods, the greatest depth and temperature separation occurred in late July between FLO Lake Trout (37.0 m; 6.5 degrees C) and Lake Whitefish (25.1 m; 10.2 degrees C). If maximum depths of gill nets were regulated seasonally to between 25 and 35 m,>= 50% of the Lake Whitefish population would be vulnerable while avoiding 89% or more of Lake Trout. Lake Trout percentages targeted under such regulations would be lowest in late July (GLO=8% and FLO=11%) and early August (GLO=4% and FLO=7%). However, archival tags measure fish depth and not location or bottom depth, and modal depths of gill-net effort for Lake Whitefish (38 to 57 m) exceeded those from the Lake Whitefish archival tag data. This discrepancy suggests that many Lake Whitefish might be pelagic above the reach of bottom-set gill nets, so depth restrictions could be less effective in reducing Lake Trout bycatch than suggested by our data. A further implication is that use of gill nets suspended above the bottom to target pelagic Lake Whitefish could also reduce bycatch while potentially increasing Lake Whitefish harvest.																			0275-5947	1548-8675					2016	36	4					705	719		10.1080/02755947.2016.1165771	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2016.1165771													WOS:000381683600001
J	Gao, Q; Rioual, P; Chu, GQ				Gao, Qiang; Rioual, Patrick; Chu, Guoqiang			Lateglacial and early Holocene climatic fluctuations recorded in the diatom flora of Xiaolongwan maar lake, NE China	BOREAS												A palaeolimnological study of the annually laminated sediment sequence of Lake Xiaolongwan, a small maar lake in northeastern China, revealed distinct diatom responses to Lateglacial and early Holocene climate change between c. 19 700 and c. 10 700 a BP. In addition to analyses of diatom assemblage composition and of the bio-volume accumulation rate of planktonic diatoms, geochemical (total nitrogen, total organic carbon) and physical (varve type and thickness) indicators were used to assess past environmental change. The diatom assemblages reveal a complex interplay between direct climate effects on the seasonal lake conditions (timing of ice cover break-up, water column mixing and thermal stratification), catchment-mediated effects on the concentrations of nutrients and dissolved organic carbon and, possibly, biotic interactions between the different algal groups present in the phytoplankton of Lake Xiaolongwan (diatoms, Chrysophyceae and Dinophyceae). The most remarkable changes in the aquatic system were: (i) a sharp increase in Asterionella formosa and the collapse of Handmannia balatonis at c. 14 780 a BP, corresponding with the onset of the Bolling - Allerod interstadial; (ii) a sharp rise in Stephanodiscus minutulus at c. 12 840 a BP, marking the start of the Younger Dryas event and (iii) when the lake phytoplankton became dominated by Dinophyceae instead of diatoms at c. 11 170 a BP, after the Pre-Boreal oscillation. Two diatom assemblage zones characterize the Younger Dryas at Lake Xiaolongwan, suggesting a bipartite division of this stadial event as in several records from eastern Asia and Europe. The quasi-synchronicity of these events with the oscillations described in the North Atlantic realm demonstrates that during the Lateglacial, North Atlantic dynamics at centennial and millennial time scales had a strong control upon the climate in northeastern China.

Although the diffusion at the air-water interface is the most studied pathway, its spatial and temporal variations are poorly documented. We measured temperature and O-2 and CH4 concentrations every 2 weeks for 3.5 years at nine stations in a subtropical monomictic reservoir which was flooded in 2008 (Nam Theun 2 Reservoir, Lao PDR). Based on these results, we quantified CH4 storage in the water column and diffusive fluxes from June 2009 to December 2012. We compared diffusive emissions with ebullition from Deshmukh et al. (2014) and aerobic methane oxidation and downstream emissions from Deshmukh et al. (2016). In this monomictic reservoir, the seasonal variations of CH4 concentration and storage were highly dependent on the thermal stratification. Hypolimnic CH4 concentration and CH4 storage reached their maximum in the warm dry season (WD) when the reservoir was stratified. Concentration and storage decreased during the warm wet (WW) season and reached its minimum after the reservoir overturned in the cool dry (CD) season. The sharp decreases in CH4 storage were concomitant with extreme diffusive fluxes (up to 200aEuro-mmolaEuro-m(-2)aEuro-d(-1)). These sporadic emissions occurred mostly in the inflow region in the WW season and during overturn in the CD season in the area of the reservoir that has the highest CH4 storage. Although they corresponded to less than 10aEuro-% of the observations, these extreme CH4 emissions (> aEuro-5aEuro-mmolaEuro-m(-2)aEuro-d(-1)) contributed up to 50aEuro-% of total annual emissions by diffusion. During the transition between the WD and WW seasons, a new emission hotspot was identified upstream of the water intake where diffusive fluxes peaked at 600aEuro-mmolaEuro-m(-2)aEuro-d(-1) in 2010 down to 200aEuro-mmolaEuro-m(-2)aEuro-d(-1) in 2012. The hotspot was attributed to the mixing induced by the water intakes (artificial mixing). Emissions from this area contributed 15-25aEuro-% to total annual emissions, although they occur in a surface area representative of less than 1aEuro-% of the total reservoir surface. We highly recommend measurements of diffusive fluxes around water intakes in order to evaluate whether such results can be generalized.

Changes in water quality and trophic status associated with cage aquaculture in Lake Maninjau, Indonesia	WORKSHOP AND INTERNATIONAL SEMINAR ON SCIENCE OF COMPLEX NATURAL SYSTEMS	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science				International Seminar on Science of Complex Natural Systems (ISS-CNS)	OCT 09-10, 2015	Bogor, INDONESIA	Bogor Agr Univ, Fac Math & Nat Sci				The cage aquaculture unquestionably has been degrading lake water quality by increasing nutrients and organic carbon in lake water and sediments. The question is to what extend this condition affects other key indictors such as the temporal changes in trophic status and the thickness of anoxic hypolimnion layer where the anoxic water column is moving upward pushing up the oxic epilimnion layer. The condition in Lake Maninjau could be worse since the lake is steadily producing sulfide which can cause not only oxygen depletion in the water column but also the phosphate release from the sediments. The study is based on the long term monitoring data from on going research for about 8 years observation. The results indeed show the anoxic water column is moving upward increasing the thickness of anoxic hypolimnion layer and decreasing epilimnion layer from 30 m to 10 m depth. The trophic status of the lake also has changed from mesotrophic to eutrophic decreasing the water transparency to even a critical level < 1m. The months of July to September with prolonged hot season could be the critical time for trophic condition for the lake. The results suggest that determination of these conditions further could help identify and predict the critical time for possibility of fish kill.

B	Mengistou, S		Schagerl, M		Mengistou, Seyoum			Invertebrates of East African Soda Lakes	SODA LAKES OF EAST AFRICA												Soda lakes are among the world's most productive natural ecosystems, but the fauna consists of only a few specialized groups which can attain high biomass, seasonally or throughout the year. The invertebrate fauna is generally poor in species diversity. Protozoa are restricted to a few ciliates dominated by Condylostoma and Frontonia spp. The zooplankton biomass is dominated by a calanoid, Paradiaptomus africanus, with a maximum value of 1.17 g m(-3) reported in Lake Nakuru, Kenya. Rotifers dominate in terms of species diversity, with six species/lake being the highest recorded number at six. Cladocerans are rare and include some euryhaline forms also common in other Rift Valley lakes, such as Alona sp., Macrothrix triseralis, Moina and Ceriodaphnia spp. Rotifera are represented by a few euryhaline and halobiontic species such as Brachionus dimidiatus, B. plicatilis and Hexarthra jenkinae. At times, B. dimidiatus can attain extremely high abundances (800 million m (-3)). The major food sources for zooplankton grazers are the large cyanoprokaryote Arthrospira fusiformis, Bacteria and detritus. Larger rotifers such as B. plicatilis obtain 48 % of their diet from fragments of A. fusiformis, whereas the smaller B. dimidiatus remove particles < 2 mu m. Assimilation of this cyanoprokaryote was low. Despite this food constraint, secondary production of rotifers can exceed that of calanoids by a factor of 100x in soda lakes and over 600x in freshwater lakes. The macroinvertebrate community of soda lakes is dominated by insects of the order Heteroptera, Family Corixidae (water boatmen), genera Micronecta and Sigara and Family Notonectidae (backswimmers), genus Anisops. Other taxa include nematodes, oligochaetes, chironomids (non-biting midges), culicine mosquitoes, an anostracan (Branchinella spinosa) and ostracods (mussel shrimp). The chironomid community consists of halobiontic forms such as Microchironomus deribae, Kiefferulus disparilis and Tanytarsus minutipalpis. M. deribae can increase to enormous numbers seasonally and become a nuisance for lakeshore residents around soda lakes. In Lake Nakuru, Kenya, a high secondary production of 120 mg dry mass m(-2) day(-1) was recorded for M. deribae, but this is lower than the highest secondary production value of 182 mg dry mass m(-2) day(-1) for chironomids reported from the saline Australian Lake Werowrap. Secondary production can be high seasonally in soda lakes, but the biomass turnover rate (P/B ratio) of zooplankton and macroinvertebrates is low, probably because of the seasonal food limitations (e.g. Anisops is predatory on calanoids and fish) or the poor food quality of detritus and decomposing cyanoprokaryotes in the system. Soda lakes have simple food chains and are ideal as natural experimental models to study food web dynamics and energy flow in lakes.

Concentrations of 17 macro- and microelements were determined in roots and shoots of European frogbit as well as in water and bottom sediments from 30 study sites. Plants differed in concentrations of elements and bioaccumulation capacity depending on the characteristics of dominant anthropogenic activities in the vicinity of the sampling site. Shoots of H. morsus-ranae growing in the vicinity of organic chemistry plants and automotive industry contained particularly high levels of Cd, Co, and S. Plants from area close to heat and power plant, former ferrochrome industry and new highway, were distinguished by the highest concentrations of Cr, Cu, and Pb. European frogbit from both these regions contained more Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, and Zn than plants from agricultural and recreational areas. The concentrations of alkali metals and Co, Fe, and N in H. morsus-ranae were elevated in relation to the natural content in macrophytes irrespectively to their content in the environment. Based on the values of Bioaccumulation and Translocation Factors, European frogbit is an accumulator for Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn and a good candidate for phytoremediation of water polluted with Co, Cu, Hg, K, Mn, and Ni. The amount of Co and Mn removed from water and accumulated in the plant biomass during the vegetation season was considerably high.

The colonies were collected in Lake Taihu, kept under 25 degrees C on a 12h:12h light/dark cycle at a light density of about 45 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). M. novacekii-type colonies were detected on the 10th day and their percentage of the population tended to increase until the 60th day. With M. novacekii-like colonies increased, the proportion of M. aeruginosa colonies decreased and reached almost zero by the end of the experiment. M. novacekii-like colony size (D-50; this value indicates that particles below D-50 accounts for 50%) was greater than 500 mu m when these colonies first appeared and was similar to that of M. aeruginosa in the experiment. No differences in cell size were found between these two Microcystis morphotypes either collected from Lake Taihu or cultured in the laboratory. Through molecular tools (16S rDNA, 16S-23S ITS and cpcBA-IGS), there were strong evidences to claim that the original M. aeruginosa colonies isolated from Lake Taihu and the later M. novacekii-like colonies in our cultures were the same species. We suggest that M. aeruginosa colonies consistently changed their colonial morphology to that of a typical M. novacekii.

Factors influencing emigration of Ross's and snow geese from an Arctic breeding area	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Emigration is one of the most difficult demographic rates to estimate, yet understanding movement among populations has important consequences for wildlife conservation. We studied factors that affected emigration by adult Ross's geese (Chen rossii) and lesser snow geese (C. caerulescens caerulescens) during a demographic study from 1997 to 2013 of nesting geese at the Karrak Lake colony south of Queen Maud Gulf in the Central Canadian Arctic. Rising abundance of both species in recent decades has led to concerns about their impacts on Arctic ecosystems. We used Burnham's model to estimate true survival and fidelity (i.e., the complement of emigration). Mean estimates of fidelity were higher for Ross's geese (male=0.91 +/- 0.02, female=0.95 +/- 0.01) than for snow geese (male=0.76 +/- 0.02, female=0.90 +/- 0.02). Fidelity declined with prior nesting season abundance in both species with evidence that a reduction in population size led to greater fidelity in the following year. Fidelity was positively influenced by mean nest success in the previous year with similar responses by both species. However, years of low nest success were more frequent for snow geese resulting in higher emigration. We expected that deeper snow before nesting would motivate greater emigration but found the opposite effect in both species, suggesting that individuals may be discouraged from dispersing in snow-covered landscapes. We also tested whether a large decline in the number of snow geese nesting at Karrak Lake in 2007-2008 was related to a mass emigration event but found no evidence for a change in fidelity in these years. Moreover, survival of both species showed an increasing trend from 1997 to 2013 so the decline in nesting snow geese likely was an outcome of temporary non-breeding, rather than emigration or death. The destination of emigrants remains unknown, but we expect this movement has broader consequences for metapopulation dynamics of light geese across the central Arctic.

J	Lombardo, U				Lombardo, U.			Neotectonics, flooding patterns and landscape evolution in southern Amazonia	EARTH SURFACE DYNAMICS												The paper examines the role of neotectonic activity in the evolution of the landscape in southern Amazonia during the Holocene. It uses both new and published data based on the analysis of remote sensing imagery and extensive field work in the Llanos de Moxos, Bolivian Amazon. The study of the region's modern and palaeorivers, ria lakes, palaeosols and topography provides a strong case in favour of the thesis that the northern part of the Llanos de Moxos constitutes the southern margin of the Fitzcarrald Arch and that it has experienced uplift during the Holocene. The paper assesses the extent and timing of the neotectonic activity in light of the new data and reconstructs the evolution of the landscape since the late Pleistocene. The evidence suggests that at least two uplift events took place: a first uplift in the late Pleistocene, which caused the formation of Lake Oceano, and a second uplift during the mid-Holocene, which formed Lake Rogaguado. These two uplifts appear to be linked to the knickpoints observed close to the towns of Guayaramerin and Puerto Siles respectively. The backwater effect due to these uplifts transformed the region's major rivers in seasonal ria lakes, causing the deposition of thick organic clay layers along the Beni, Mamore and Madre de Dios river banks. I argue that neotectonic episodes could have dramatically changed the drainage of the Llanos de Moxos, determining its flooding regime, soil properties and forest-savannah ecotone. These results stress the need for geomorphologists, palaeo-ecologists and archaeologists to take into account neotectonics when reconstructing the region's past.

Impact of Exogenous Abscisic Acid on Vine Physiology and Grape Composition of Cabernet Sauvignon	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ENOLOGY AND VITICULTURE												In the Niagara Peninsula, cool years delay veraison, thus shortening the growing season and adversely affecting grape maturity. Exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) could potentially hasten veraison, and improve grape composition in cool and wet years. Two experiments were conducted in a Cabernet Sauvignon block in Niagaraon-the-Lake, Ontario, in 2008 and 2009. Both years were characterized by higher than average rainfall and lower temperatures. The first experiment was initiated one week preveraison and consisted of four treatments applied three times at two-week intervals: an untreated control and 300 mg ABA/L applied to the full canopy, clusters only, and leaves only. The second experiment had three treatments: 0 (control), 150, and 300 mg ABA/L applied to clusters only. In both years, the control still had clusters with 20% green berries two to four weeks after experiment initiation. Following treatment, berries had a lower ABA uptake rate than leaves. Both ABA rates hastened the onset of veraison. In both years the transpiration rate, leaf., and fruit composition were most affected in the leaves-only and whole canopy treatments. At harvest, Brix was higher and the berry weight was lower in the ABA treatments than the control. Total anthocyanins and total phenols also increased in most ABA treatments. Berries from clusters treated with the highest ABA rate showed a higher red-blue color intensity and also had highest anthocyanins and phenols content compared to berries from other treatments. The treated vines showed enhancement in individual anthocyanins and acetylated anthocyanins, with significant changes in the ratios of cyanidin, petunidin, and malvidin occurring among the treatments. Exogenous ABA was effective in accelerating onset of veraison and improving the grape composition of Cabernet Sauvignon.

Simulating the growth of supraglacial lakes at the western margin of the Greenland ice sheet	CRYOSPHERE												We present a new method of modelling the growth of supraglacial lakes at the western margin of the Greenland ice sheet, based on routing runoff estimated by a regional climate model across a digital elevation model (DEM) of the ice sheet surface. Using data acquired during the 2003 melt season, we demonstrate that the model is 19 times more likely to correctly predict the presence (or absence) of lakes than it is to make incorrect predictions, within an elevation range of 1100 to 1700 metres above sea level (ma.s.l.), when compared with MODIS satellite imagery. Of the 66% of observed lake locations which the model correctly reproduces, the simulated lake onset day is found to be correlated with that observed with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.76. Our model accurately simulates maximum cumulative lake area with only a 1.5% overestimate. However, because our model does not simulate processes leading to lake stagnation or decay, such as refreezing or drainage, at present we do not simulate absolute daily lake area. We find that the maximum potential lake-covered ice sheet area is limited by topography to 6.4%. We estimate that this corresponds to a volume of 1.49 km(3), 12% of the runoff produced in 2003. This can be taken as an upper bound given uncertainty in the DEM. This study has proved a good first step towards capturing the variability of supraglacial lake evolution with a numerical model. These initial results are promising and suggest that the model is a useful tool for use in analysing the behaviour of supraglacial lakes on the Greenland ice sheet in the present day and potentially beyond.					; Palmer, Steven/D-5170-2013; Leeson, Amber/JFA-1001-2023	Shepherd, Andrew/0000-0002-4914-1299; Leeson, Amber/0000-0001-8720-9808; Fettweis, Xavier/0000-0002-4140-3813; Palmer, Steven/0000-0003-3977-8509													1994-0416	1994-0424					2012	6	5					1077	1086		10.5194/tc-6-1077-2012	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-6-1077-2012													WOS:000310465500011

A field experiment in the humid Ethiopian Highlands	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Land degradation in developing countries is exacerbating hardpan development that causes the formation of perched watertable, which in turn results in increased runoff and erosion. To reduce overland flow and erosion, percolation through the hardpan needs to be improved. One successful way to achieve this is ripping off the hardpan and plausibly liming. However, in the highlands of Ethiopia, there is little information available on these two techniques. The objectives of this study were, therefore, to determine the effects of ripping off degraded soils on runoff and erosion rates and whether liming would improve the effectiveness of ripping. A field study was conducted in the Anjeni watershed. Thirty-two experimental runoff plots were installed across the watershed. Conventional tillage at 15 cm depth and ripping to 30, 45, and 60 cm depths were applied with and without lime amendments. Results showed that ripping to 60 cm depth resulted in a significant reduction of runoff. However, liming increased runoff response, on average by 10%. In contrast to the reduction in runoff amounts, an increase in ripping depth increased the amount of soil loss especially during the first storms at the beginning of the monsoon rainy season. Liming significantly decreased soil loss by up to 35%. Although plots with deep ripping plus liming had greater runoff production than other plots, soil loss was less. Overall, the findings suggest that deep ripping has promise but more research is needed before widely implemented.

The variables such as pH, temperature, salinity, turbidity and chlorophyll-a contents of water were found to be high during pre-monsoon season and the dissolved oxygen content was minimal. The concentration of nutrients viz., nitrate, phosphate, silicate varied independently. In the study a total of 53 species of phytoplankton were recorded. Their density was higher during the post-monsoon season than during other seasons and the diatoms were found to be the dominant species. The major phytoplankton in terms of frequency and abundance were the species namely, Biddulphia mobiliensis, Chaetoceros curvisetus, Licmophora abbreviata, Skeletonema costatum, Prorocentrum micans and Oscillatoria sp. They showed significant positive correlation with pH, temperature, salinity, nitrate, phosphate and chlorophyll-a contents, whereas turbidity, dissolved oxygen and silicate exhibited significant negative correlation. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) developed two principal components with 84.74% of total variability in the water quality which separated pre- and post-monsoon periods from the monsoon season on axis I, and pre- monsoon and monsoon periods from post-monsoon on axis II.																			1679-8759	1982-436X				OCT-DEC	2014	62	4					279	293		10.1590/S1679-87592014069906204	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1679-87592014069906204													WOS:000344325500005

The innovative and efficient use of wavelet analysis has been able to identify significant interactions in the spatial and temporal domains and to estimate the recharge travel time. In this paper, a wavelet analysis was utilized to analyse 43 years of monthly, and 2 years of daily, precipitation, river level and groundwater level data in the Yoshino River Basin, Japan. There were two main results: (1) There was a significant influence of precipitation and river on groundwater, with a periodicity of 4-128 days, 1 year and 2-7 years. The periodicity of 1 year was correlated with seasonal variability. The significant interaction at 4-128 days mainly occurred in the rainy season. The 2-7-year oscillation of aquifer water levels was determined by precipitation. (2) The recharge-water travel times in the study area estimated from the arrow patterns in the precipitation-groundwater wavelet coherence (WTC) were consistent for each observation well. The response times of the aquifer to precipitation were 1 day and 3-6 days in 2013 and 2014, respectively. The different time lags were likely determined by the timing of maximum daily precipitation.

However, the fundamental assembly mechanisms of microeukaryotic communities in thermokarst lakes are unknown. In this study, we examined the assembly processes and co-occurrence networks of microeukaryotic communities in sediment and water of thermokarst lakes in the Yellow River Source Area. Sediment microeukaryotic communities had a significantly lower alpha-diversity but higher beta-diversity than water microeukaryotic communities. pH, sediment organic carbon, and total phosphorus significantly affected taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of sediment communities, while conductivity was a significant driver for water communities. Both sediment and water microeukaryotic communities were strongly governed by dispersal limitation. However, deterministic processes, especially homogenous selection, were more relevant in structuring microeukaryotic communities in water than those in sediment. Changes in total nitrogen and phosphorus in sediment could contribute to shift its microeukaryotic communities from homogeneous selection to stochastic processes. Co-occurrence networks showed that water microeukaryotic communities are more complex and interconnected but have lower modularity than sediment microeukaryotic communities. The water microeukaryotic network had more modules than the sediment microeukaryotic network. These modules were dominated by different taxonomic groups and associated to different environmental variables.					; Ren, Ze/AAB-2920-2019; Wang, Qing/HKN-3460-2023	Ren, Ze/0000-0002-1473-2697; Li, Xia/0000-0003-4595-9170; Wang, Qing/0000-0002-8806-6228														2076-2607				FEB	2022	10	2							481	10.3390/microorganisms10020481	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms10020481								35208934					WOS:000764349500001

The aim was to identify the importance of this water bodys natural components (S and P-s) on E-p. Measured E-p together with reference E of Shuttleworth (E-0) and the FAO-56 equation ET were also derived. Pan coefficient, K-a for filled in pans with S and P-s were computed as the ratio of E-p of the planted pan (P-s/S) and E-p.K-a values determined on-site were tested in the estimation of E for an open water body, namely Keszthely Bay of Lake Balaton. Overall seasonal mean evaporation rate was lower for E-p (3.2 +/- 1.05 mm day(-1)) than the seasonal daily average E-p of S (3.7 +/- 1.16 mm day(-1)) and the E-p of P-s (4.0 +/- 1.28 mm day(-1)). Interannual variation of E-p was controlled by variations in seasonal air temperature, T-a. Data of the wet 2014 season showed a significant suppression of E-p, and this was related to humid and cooler weather conditions causing late emergence and early senescence of the submerged macrophytes (Potamogeton perfoliatus L., Myriophyllum spicatum L. and Najas marina L.) at Keszthely Bay. Overall seasonal mean K-a was greater than 1.0 as determined for the three-season time period in pans with S and P-s (K-as: 1.14 +/- 0.04; K-ap: 1.20 +/- 0.05). Except for a previous study from our group (Anda et al., 2016, J Hydrol 542: 615-626) over a two-season period, no such ratio or coefficients have been published, until now. The dominant component of the energy balance was latent heat flux, which accounted for more than 60% of net radiation in Keszthely Bay, depending on Class A pan filling (S and P-s). Diurnal variation in heat storage of the pan also changed due to the occurrence of sediment cover and macrophytes inside the evaporimeters. The most important daily meteorological variables were used to develop the E-p model and to validate S and P-s. Our results show that linear models, even with more input variables, performed better than tree-based models with respect to mean absolute errors (MAE), root mean square errors (RMSE) and determination coefficient (R-2) in predicting daily E-p of S and P-s. The use of pan coefficients K-as and K-ap increased seasonal E of Keszthely Bay by 4.2, 14.4 and 17.1% during the 2014-2016 seasons, respectively. Total seasonal increments for Keszthely Bay (surface area is about 39 km(2)) accounted for 0.97, 4.31 and 3.91 million m(3) throughout 2014-2016, respectively. In the warmer seasons, an increasing trend in the growth of Keszthely Bays E was detected. These results indicate that Class A pan E-p rates need to be modified to take into account sediment cover and submerged macrophytes to derive open water E. This approximation may lend additional credit to the estimation of E in lakes. Given that appropriate estimation of E can effectively impact the management of an ecologically functional lakes water, maintaining the proper water level and quality can contribute to the sustainability of lakes in the long run.					; Teixeira da Silva, Jaime/N-9198-2015	Menyhart, Laszlo/0000-0002-3198-1759; Simon-Gaspar, Brigitta/0000-0001-7982-8940; Soos, Gabor/0000-0003-0053-9447													0168-1923	1873-2240				MAR 15	2018	250						277	289		10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.01.001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.01.001													WOS:000427338400023
J	Huggett, JM; Cuadros, J				Huggett, J. M.; Cuadros, J.			Glauconite formation in lacustrine/palaeosol sediments, Isle of Wight (Hampshire Basin), UK	CLAY MINERALS												The clay mineralogy and chemistry of a green lacustrine marl that has been pedogenically modified in the upper part was investigated in order to better understand the formation of low-temperature Fe-rich 10 angstrom clay. Twelve samples in a vertical sequence have been investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), chemical analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and laser particle size analysis. The clay assemblage has a range of overall illite-smectite (I-S) compositions (64-100%) resulting from several I-S phases that, for the sake of modelling, have been simplified to one to three I-S phases of increasing illitic content. Where the lacustrine marl has been pedogenically modified, the smectite-rich I-S is much reduced in abundance or absent and the 10 angstrom-rich component is both more abundant and more illitic. These assemblages are a consequence of illitization of detrital I-S in the lake and soil, and dissolution of other clays (kaolinite and chlorite) in the hypersaline lake. Interlayer K, octahedral Fe and octahedral + interlayer Mg increase with intensity of illitization (increase range 0.32-0.63, 0.68-1.67, 0.18-0.24 per O-10(OH)(2), respectively), first in the increasingly saline lake, and latterly as a result of wetting and drying in a gley soil. In the soil environment, reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) resulted in increased layer charge but, as by this stage very few smectite intedayers remained, this did not result in an equivalent increase in illite. Laser particle-size analysis, supported by SEM observation, shows the existence of a bimodal distribution of clay particle size (maxima at 0.2 and 1.5-1.8 mu m) in which the finer fraction increases largely in the pedogenically affected samples, probably due to particle break-up caused by seasonal wetting and drying. This 'dual action' illitization, first in a hypersaline lake and latterly through wetting and drying, may be responsible for both the intensity of illitization and exceptionally high (for the Solent Group) Fe content of the authigenic illite. The chemical characteristics of the illitic I-S and the illite end-member correspond to glauconite. Hence, this is an example of onshore, non-pelletal glauconite formation.																			0009-8558	1471-8030				MAR	2010	45	1					35	49		10.1180/claymin.2010.045.1.35	http://dx.doi.org/10.1180/claymin.2010.045.1.35													WOS:000277478500004

Inferring biogenic and anthropogenic carbon dioxide sources across an urban to rural gradient	OECOLOGIA												We continuously monitored CO2 concentrations at three locations along an urban-to-rural gradient in the Salt Lake Valley, Utah from 2004 to 2006. The results showed a range of CO2 concentrations from daily averages exceeding 500 p.p.m. at the city center to much lower concentrations in a non-urbanized, rural region of the valley. The highest values were measured in the wintertime and under stable atmospheric conditions. At all three sites, we utilized weekly measurements of the C and O isotope composition of CO2 for a 1-year period to evaluate the CO2 sources underlying spatial and temporal variability in CO2 concentrations. The results of an inverse analysis of CO2 sources and the O isotope composition of ecosystem respiration (delta O-18(R)) showed large contributions (> 50%) of natural gas combustion to atmospheric CO2 in the wintertime, particularly at the city center, and large contributions (> 60%) of biogenic respiration to atmospheric CO2 during the growing season, particularly at the rural site. delta O-18(R) was most enriched at the rural site and more isotopically depleted at the urban sites due to the effects of irrigation on ecosystem water pools at the urban sites. The results also suggested differences in the role of leaf versus soil respiration between the two urban sites, with seasonal variation in the contribution of leaf respiration at a residential site and relatively constant contributions of leaf respiration at the city center. These results illustrate that spatial and temporal patterns of urban CO2 concentrations and isotopic composition can be used to infer patterns of energy use by urban residents as well as plant and soil processes in urban areas.					; Ehleringer, James/G-1780-2010; Luo, Yiqi/C-3991-2008; Pataki, Diane/F-9732-2011	Pataki, Diane/0000-0001-7209-514X; 													0029-8549	1432-1939				MAY	2007	152	2					307	322		10.1007/s00442-006-0656-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-006-0656-0								17479298					WOS:000246276200013

Understanding these changes requires palaeoecological studies at temporal resolutions comparable to the time window at which modern climate change is occurring. Here we present a multi-proxy, high-resolution record of forest and lake ecosystem change that occurred during the last 1100 years at middle elevations in Panama. From similar to 900 to 1400 CE, regional forest and lake ecosystems were characterized by high seasonality, probably associated with both high El Nino activity and higher global temperatures. At similar to 1400 CE, an abrupt transition marked the decoupling of forest and lake responses, with forest responding mostly to local patterns of human occupation, and lake trophic status being controlled mostly by the regional precipitation-evaporation balance, possibly associated with solar irradiance. Factors that played important roles in shaping regional ecosystems during the last 1100 years will probably again play critical roles within the coming decades, i.e. higher precipitation seasonality and higher temperatures. Past responses of the system, together with pervasive human activities, suggest that future conditions will simplify mid-elevation forests. Given the importance of these geographical locations as hotspots of biological diversity, substantial losses of global biodiversity are foreseen.

Zambia is not an exception. Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), rainfall anomaly and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) are robust indicators for drought studies due to their distinct and complementary roles. Our results reveal severe meteorological drought conditions in Zambia using SPI and rainfall anomaly. VCI values have declined in the cropping season due to vegetation stress induced by water deficit conditions. Low rainfall leads to widespread deterioration of crop production, with approximately 40.46% of the country experiencing drought conditions in 2023-2024. The Central, Eastern, Southern, Lusaka, and Copperbelt provinces showed lower VCI values in March and April 2024, indicating poor crop health and drought-like conditions. On the other hand, low rainfall has substantially influenced hydropower reservoirs. Significant surface water loss is observed in the hydropower reservoirs such as Itezhi Tezhi Dam (117.40 sq. km), Mita Hills Dam (25.72 sq. km) and in parts of Lake Kariba (58.72 sq. km) between December 2023 and April 2024. This loss has disrupted industries relying on water resources and hindered hydropower generation, leaving substantial portions of the population without electricity for extended periods. The present study aims to explore the power of open access Earth Observation data and cloud analytics to evaluate the extent and multi-sectoral impact of the recent drought in Zambia. Results highlight the upcoming challenges the country might face in food and nutrition and the critical need for stakeholder involvement and policy design to mitigate future crises and strengthen vulnerable communities.					; Ghosh, Surajit/S-9693-2017; ghosh, surajit/S-9693-2017	Kour, Sneha/0000-0003-3984-1723; Ghosh, Surajit/0000-0002-3928-2135; 													0921-030X	1573-0840				MAR	2025	121	4					4505	4530		10.1007/s11069-024-06976-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-024-06976-5		OCT 2024											WOS:001341170400001

In freshwater ecosystems, numerous fish species migrate between mainstream rivers or lakes and their tributaries, providing resources and nutrients during their spawning migrations. Multiple migratory species travel to the same destinations and contribute such nutrients, but knowledge remains limited about how the diversity of migratory animals influences the recipient ecosystem. We investigated how migrations of diverse fish community from Lake Biwa, Japan contribute to nutrient inputs in one of the lake's tributary rivers and how they influence the ecosystem. Sequential migration of six fish species continued for 8 months of a year, causing high-level nutrient concentration and primary production. The fish-derived resources were taken up by diverse members of the river community. Our results emphasize the extent to which migrations of diverse animals seasonally extend and stabilize the resource subsidy and how they extend pronounced effects on the recipient ecosystems.

Bacterial diversity, as determined by the Shannon index, the Simpson's index, and the Richness, dramatically changed in between the dry and wet seasons. The changes in the diversity and relative abundance of microbial populations among the five sites during the wet season have become more marked than those observed during the dry season. Furthermore, cluster analysis also showed these changes. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that Betaproteobacteria is the dominant population, followed by Actinobacterium, in both the wet season and dry season. The water quality parameters were quite stable at all five sites during the same season but noticeably varied from season to season. Canonical correspondence analysis also indicated that the changes in the bacterial community composition were primarily correlated with the variations in temperature, transparency, and the concentrations of NH4 (+)-N. Slight changes in bacterial community composition among the five sites during the dry season were correlated with different environments. However, during the wet season, major changes were correlated not only with environments, but also it may be associated with the bacterial populations from the surrounding areas and tributaries of the Three Gorges Reservoir.																			0959-3993	1573-0972				MAY	2013	29	5					841	853		10.1007/s11274-012-1239-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-012-1239-3								23283690					WOS:000317174200009
J	Rogora, M; Arisci, S; Marchetto, A				Rogora, Michela; Arisci, Silvia; Marchetto, Aldo			The role of nitrogen deposition in the recent nitrate decline in lakes and rivers in Northern Italy	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Deposition of inorganic nitrogen (N) in north-western Italy is around 20-25 kg N ha(-1) y(-1), and has remained constant during the last 30 years. This flux of N caused saturation of terrestrial catchments and increasing levels of nitrate (NO3) in surface waters. Recently, monitoring data for both rivers and lakes have shown a reversal in NO3 trends.This change was widespread, affecting high-altitude lakes in the Alps and subalpine lakes and rivers, and occurred at almost the same time at all sites. The seasonal pattern of NO3 concentrations in running waters has shown a change in the last few years, with a tendency towards slightly lower leaching of NO3 during the growing season. Atmospheric input of N has also shown a recent decrease, mainly due to decreasing emissions and partly to the lower amount of precipitation occurring between 2003 and 2009. Surface waters are probably responding to these changing N inputs, but a further decrease of N deposition, especially reduced N, will be required to achieve full recovery from N saturation.

The abundances and, for the first time, biomasses and secondary production rates of these communities were examined. The experimental set-up consisted of 300 brown plastic cups placed in temperate mixed forests and sampled five times over a period of 16 months to determine the impact of (i) seasonal events, (ii) physicochemical parameters, and (iii) food resources on the tree hole metazoans. Outcomes Metazoan organisms, especially the meiofauna (rotifers and nematodes) occupied nearly all of the cups (> 99%) throughout the year. Between 55% and 99% of themetazoan community was represented by rotifers (max. 557,000 individuals 100 cm(-2)) and nematodes (max. 58,000 individuals 100 cm(-2)). Diptera taxa, particularly Dasyhelea sp. (max. 256 individuals 100 cm(-2)) dominated the macrofaunal community. Macrofauna accounted for the majority of the metazoan biomass, with a mean dry weight of 5,800 mu g 100 cm(-2) and an annual production rate of 20,400 mu g C 100 cm(-2), whereas for meiofauna mean biomass and annual production were 100 mu g 100 cm(-2) and 5,300 mu g C 100 cm(-2), respectively. The macrofaunal taxa tended to show more fluctuating population dynamic while the meiofaunal dynamic was rather low with partly asynchronous development. Seasonality (average temperature and rain intervals) had a significant impact on both meiofauna and macrofauna. Furthermore, bottom-up control (chlorophyll-a and organic carbon), mainly attributable to algae, was a significant factor that shaped the metazoan communities. In contrast, physicochemical water parameters had no evident influence. 23.7% of organism density distribution was explained by redundancy analysis (RDA) indicating a high dynamic and asynchrony of the systems.					; Traunspurger, Walter/KGL-7190-2024	Ptatscheck, Christoph/0000-0002-2079-4130; Traunspurger, Walter/0000-0002-9828-8430													1932-6203					AUG 18	2015	10	8							e0133447	10.1371/journal.pone.0133447	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0133447								26284811					WOS:000359666100003

They are also important economic resources for humans. However, little information is available on eutrophication of West African coastal rivers due to costly analytical instruments and socio-economic difficulties. In this study, the spatial distributions of chlorophyll-abiomass in the Comoe, Bandama, and Bia Rivers (Cote d'Ivoire) were mapped during the dry, rainy and flood seasons, and chlorophyll-adynamics were simulated using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models. The results showed a state of advanced eutrophication during the three sampling seasons. The best generalizable models obtained from the data collected during 2 years and covering three hydrological seasons of the rivers forecasted between 76% and 85% of present chlorophyll-aconcentrations (static approach), and between 73% and 84% of future chlorophyll-aconcentrations (both dynamic t and t + 1 approaches). These models achieved satisfactory accuracy with low relative mean errors (MRE) ranging from 3.22% to 7.71%. The results of this study suggest that ANN model could be an original and less expensive tool for monitoring river water eutrophication in developing countries.					; Yao, Koffi/W-6948-2019	Yao, Koffi Marcellin/0000-0002-7520-2585; Kouassi, N'Guessan Louis Berenger/0000-0003-1819-7633; SORO, MALEY-PACOME/0000-0002-4133-3755; 													0277-5212	1943-6246				OCT	2020	40	5					939	956		10.1007/s13157-020-01284-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-020-01284-7		MAR 2020											WOS:000562566600001
S	Assine, ML		Vieira, BC; Salgado, AAR; Santos, LJC		Assine, Mario Luis			Brazilian Pantanal: A Large Pristine Tropical Wetland	LANDSCAPES AND LANDFORMS OF BRAZIL	World Geomorphological Landscapes											The Pantanal is a Quaternary sedimentary basin located in the central-west region of Brazil. Its origin has been linked to stresses transmitted from the western margin of the South American continent into the interior of the craton. Therefore, the Pantanal is part of the Andean foreland system. It presents alluvial plain morphology with altitudes between 80 and 200 m surrounded by desiccated plateaus. Northeast-southwest-aligned faults, many associated with the Trans-brasiliano Lineament, control part of the drainage network within the Pantanal Basin. The Paraguay River meanders through an extensive fluvial plain, bordering Precambrian terrains at the western edge of the basin. The Paraguay River is the main river of a depositional system characterized by fluvial megafans, among which the Taquari River megafan stands out. Since the Late Pleistocene, the Pantanal landscape has been changing in response to a climate shift from colder and drier to wetter and warmer conditions. These climate changes are recorded in the Pantanal landscape, which is marked by relict depositional landforms of varying ages formed in environmental and climatic conditions differing from the present. The thousands of Nhecolandia lakes located in the southern sector of the Taquari megafan are examples of relict landforms. These lakes are mostly freshwater lakes connected through rainwater runoff, forming wide and shallow channels (locally called "vazantes") that drain the fluvial plain during and after the wet season. In contrast, some saline lakes (locally called "salinas") remain isolated from the surface drainage and are relict landforms of a degrading landscape. The Pantanal is a large tropical wetland exhibiting mostly native vegetation, where wildlife is preserved in its natural habitats. The rivers building the fluvial megafans are prone to frequent avulsions, shifting their channels according to sediment infilling dynamics in the fluvial plain. These shifts in river courses result in considerable changes in the hydrography and geography of the flood plain.					; Assine, Mario/S-6150-2019	Assine, Mario Luis/0000-0002-3097-5832; 													2213-2090	2213-2104	978-94-017-8023-0; 978-94-017-8022-3				2015							135	146		10.1007/978-94-017-8023-0_12	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-8023-0_12	10.1007/978-94-017-8023-0												WOS:000372460900013
J	Degefu, F; Schagerl, M				Degefu, Fasil; Schagerl, Michael			Zooplankton abundance, species composition and ecology of tropical high-mountain crater Lake Wonchi, Ethiopia	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The highlands of Ethiopia represent some of the remnants of undisturbed aquatic ecosystems; they are however highly threatened by significant socio-economic developments and associated anthropogenic impacts. Lake Wonchi is one of the few remaining fairly pristine high-mountain crater lakes in the central highlands and has never been investigated in detail. We present a first study on zoo-plankton taxa composition, abundance and biomass conducted over more than one year including the underlying environmental drivers. The lake is basic (pH 7.9-8.9), dilute (specific conductivity 185-245 mu S cm(-1)) and oligotrophic with mean trophic status index of 36. The zooplankton community composition showed low species richness comprising a total of fourteen taxa with six cladocerans, one copepod and seven rotifers. Simpson's index of diversity with values between 0.6 and 0.8 pointed towards a homogenous taxa occurrence within the single sample units. The overall mean (+/- SD) standing biomass of zooplankton was 62.02 +/- 25.76 mg dry mass m(-3), which is low compared to other highland and rift valley lakes in Ethiopia. Cyclopoid copepods, in particular Thermocyclops ethiopiensis were the most abundant group and contributed 50% to the total zooplankton abundance followed by cladocerans (38%) and rotifers (12%). Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling resulted in a 3-dimensional model, which revealed similar community composition on successive sampling dates except in December/January and May. Temperature, alkalinity, conductivity and nitrate-N had significant influence on this seasonal pattern. A weak, but significant positive correlation (r= 0.482, N= 20, P= 0.037) between Chlorophyll a and zooplankton biomass mirrors a bottom-up effect of phytoplankton biomass on zooplankton dynamics. The zooplankton of Lake Wonchi displayed some degree of segregation along the epi-and metalimnion during this study, but diel vertical migration was not observed. The results show that fish predation is not the key factor in structuring the vertical distribution of zooplankton in Lake Wonchi.

A Reappraisal of Reproduction in Anadromous Alewives: Determinate versus Indeterminate Fecundity, Batch Size, and Batch Number	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Innovative methods for analysis of reproduction may provide more information that can be used to conserve species of concern. We present data on oocyte development, batch size, and batch number of anadromous Alewives Alosa pseudoharengus in a lake-spawning population located in Connecticut. We sampled female Alewives as they arrived at the spawning habitat (uprunners) and females as they were leaving (downrunners). We estimated batch size by weighing all oocytes and performed image analysis on oocytes in subsamples of some ovaries, thereby estimating oocyte size-frequency distribution to define the number of batches. We performed both whole-mount and histological analysis on other ovaries to compare gravimetric and stereological estimates of batch size and to precisely characterize oocyte developmental stages. Uprunners had advanced oocytes at the ultimate stage of vitellogenesis and usually three additional less-developed batches. Postovulatory follicles and oocytes that were being resorbed were prevalent in downrunners but were absent in uprunners. Females spawned at least three batches in a season; however, downrunners had nearly as many batches as uprunners in their ovaries, indicating there was continuing recruitment and maturation of fresh batches. A numerical model of oocyte growth indicated that there is sufficient time for batches recruited at the beginning of the spawning season to develop and be spawned in the same season, indicating that fecundity is indeterminate. Accurate assessments of individual reproductive performance will require detailed consideration of within-season oocyte dynamics as opposed to relying on enumerating oocytes in prespawners.

However, few, if any, studies have examined whether results obtained in a given model species can be generalized across bird species. Therefore, we compared potential differences in egg PFAA profile and concentrations between two widely studied passerine species, great tit (Parus major) and blue tit ((Cyanistes caenileus), which arc similar in many aspects of their ecology and life history. Whole clutches of both species were collected from the same breeding season and at the same place (Antwerp, Belgium), enabling us to study laying order effects. Additionally, we evaluated how egg PFAA concentrations for both species changed along a distance gradient from a PFAA point source. Although the sum PFAA concentrations did not significantly differ between great tits and blue tits, large differences in PFAA profile and laying order effects were observed. Great tits showed a more diverse PFAA detection profile, including periluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and various long-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) but no short-chain compounds. Contrarily, short-chain PFCAs (periluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA)) were only detected in blue tit eggs. The variation of perfluoroocianuic acicl (PFOA) concentrations within clutches was large in both species, although laying order effects on PFOA concentrations were only found in blue tits. Although egg PFOA concentrations of both species decreased similarly from the fluorochemical point source onwards, more variation in egg PFOA concentrations could be explained by distance from the fluorochemical plant in great tits (60%) than in blue tits (15%). Results showed that both species markedly differed in terms of egg PFAA profile and concentrations, must likely reflecting differences in diet, foraging habits and egg protein composition. Finally, biumonituring results of PFAAs in eggs arc likely not generalizable across bird species. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Reptile road mortality around an oasis in the Illinois Corn Desert with emphasis on the endangered Eastern Massasauga	COPEIA												Roads have numerous negative ecological effects on terrestrial fauna, and vehicular mortality can have significant demographic consequences for some species. We studied road mortality of reptiles around Carlyle Lake, Clinton County, Illinois, USA, from April 2000 through November 2002, to assess the impact of vehicular traffic and identify influential factors. Carlyle Lake, a popular tourism/recreation area, is situated in a larger agricultural landscape and is home to the largest Illinois population of the endangered Eastern Massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus). We documented 321 cases of reptile road mortality (84 individuals of six turtle species and 237 individuals of nine snake species) while driving our approx. 46 km study route roundtrip daily. Turtle road mortality was highest in May and June, and positively associated with precipitation and minimum daily temperature. Colubrid snake road mortality was highest in April and October, and positively associated with minimum daily temperature. We recorded 42 cases of road mortality of S. catenatus with the highest number occurring from mid-August to mid-September. Road mortality in S. catenatus was biased toward adult males, which show an increase in movement in August, coinciding with the peak of the mating season and a period of high tourist visitation. The traffic intensity on a road segment did not significantly affect the level of road mortality, but segments through high quality habitats had higher levels of mortality than segments through lower quality habitats. Based on our study on the ecology of S. catenatus, we make recommendations to reduce road mortality that should aid in the conservation of the Carlyle Lake population.					; Dreslik, Michael/G-5325-2012	Shepard, Donald/0000-0002-1762-6283; 													0045-8511	1938-5110				JUN 4	2008		2					350	359		10.1643/CE-06-276	http://dx.doi.org/10.1643/CE-06-276													WOS:000256579500012

However, the dynamics of water use patterns by coexisting plants that respond to soil moisture pulses are scarcely known in the semiarid alpine ecosystems of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, particularly for deep-rooted grasses such as Achnatherum splendens in the Qinghai Lake watershed. Hence, we used the stable deuterium isotope method to detect the potential water sources for A. splendens during two growing seasons of 2013 and 2014. Our results indicate that SWC and delta D values of shallow soil layer (0-10 cm) showed the highest variations in comparison with those in other soil layers during the growing seasons due to the combined effect of evaporation and precipitation inputs. A. splendens depended largely on shallow soil water availability at the early growing season. At the peak of the growing season, this deep-rooted grass A. splendens and shallow-rooted grass Leymus chinensis showed a high degree of response in the water use source to the changes in soil moisture pulses and shifted their water source from shallow to deep soil layer because water in the shallow soil layer became less available due to a long-time rainless days with strong evaporation effect on the shallow soil layer. In contrast, shallow soil water was utilized by all coexisting plants owing to an abrupt increase in shallow SWC with large events or long-lasting small events. At the late growing season, A. splendens used water from the shallow (0-10 cm) and middle soil layer (10-30 cm), while L. chinensis mainly relied on the shallow soil layer water. Comparatively, shallow-rooted herbs (Heteropappus altaicus and Allium tanguticum) predominantly used water from the shallow soil layer (0-10 cm) over the entire growing seasons regardless of soil water availability. Overall, the contrasting water use patterns by coexisting plants demonstrate their adaptations to the fluctuations of soil moisture pulses in water-limited ecosystems.

However, the management and conservation of marine ecosystems must recognize the interdependence in the coupled human and natural systems. In this study, we employed satellite remote sensing to map the spatial and temporal distribution of Secchi disk depth (SDD) in Hainan coastal waters, China for the first time, and quantitatively revealed the impacts of environmental investments on the coastal water environment in the context of global climate change. Based on the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) in situ concurrent matchups (N = 123), a simple green band (555 nm)-based quadratic algorithm was first developed to estimate the SDD for the coastal waters of Hainan Island in China (R2 = 0.70, root mean square error (RMSE) = 1.74 m). The long time-series SDD dataset (2001-2021) for Hainan coastal waters was reconstructed from MODIS observations. Spatially, SDD showed a pattern of high water clarity in eastern and southern coastal waters and low water clarity in the western and northern coastal areas. This pattern is attributed to unbalanced distributions of bathymetry and pollution from seagoing rivers. Seasonally, the humid tropical monsoon climate drove the SDD into a general pattern of high in the wet season and low in the dry season. Annually, the SDD in Hainan coastal waters improved significantly (p < 0.1), benefiting from environmental investments over the last 20 years. However, the increasing global oceanic wind speed in recent years has exacerbated sediment resuspension and deep ocean mixing, counteracting approximately 14.14% of the remedial management's effectiveness in protecting and restoring the coastal ecosystem. This study offers ways to improve the ecological and environmental regulations under global changes and to strengthen the public service capacity for aquatic management authorities with methods that support the sustainable development of coastal areas.

Radiation dose reconstruction for higher aquatic plants and fish in Glyboke Lake during the early phase of the Chernobyl accident	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY												This study deals with an assessment of radiation dose dynamics to fish and higher aquatic plants (helophytes) in Glyboke Lake (10-km exclusion zone) during the early phase of the Chernobyl accident. Models of radioactive contamination of water and sediment and models of radioactive contamination and radiation dose to fish and aquatic plants were developed. It was found that, in 1986, the total dose rate to fish reached 0.25 Gy d-1. Within 6 months after the accident, the dose rate due to 90Sr, 134Cs and 137Cs had increased. The absorbed dose to prey fish of Glyboke Lake for this period was estimated as being 27???81 Gy of which 4???40 Gy was formed by 131I exposure. The radiation dose rate due to 90Sr, 106Ru, 134+137Cs and 144Ce to aquatic plants reached its quasiequilibrium values approximately 50 days after the accident and remained virtually unchanged until the end of the 1986 growing season. The highest levels of 89Sr, 91Y, 95Zr, 103Ru, 141Ce exposure were observed between 30 and 50 days with a decrease by 2???3 times at the end of the growing season. Radiation exposure of the shortlived 131I, 140Ba, 140La, 239Np reached its maximum within 5???15 days after the accident. The absorbed dose rate to aquatic plants reached 0.69 Gy d-1, while the contribution of cerium radionuclides to the total dose rate formed 50% in the initial period and reached 90% at the end of the growing season. The magnitude of the radiation dose rate to plant roots was 2.4 times higher than aboveground organs, and that of rhizomes was 1.6 times higher. During the growing season of 1986 the total dose of exposure of plants in Glyboke Lake was about 78 Gy. The results of this study emphasise the necessity to consider the history of exposure of past generation of living organisms as part of the assessment of current radiation effects.					; Gudkov, Dmitri/D-1111-2017	Belyaev, Vladimir/0000-0003-4465-7816; Gudkov, Dmitri/0000-0002-5304-7414; Skyba, Volodymyr/0000-0002-3605-1147													0265-931X	1879-1700				APR	2023	263								107169	10.1016/j.jenvrad.2023.107169	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2023.107169		APR 2023						37043841					WOS:001029194700001

As a result, Cd was not detected in any river and lake water samples. Al, Fe and Mn in lake water exceeded the regulation limits of Cambodia, USEPA and WHO. Health risk assessment using the USEPA model indicated that male and female Cambodian residents are at minimal risk of non-carcinogenic effects from single and mixed trace elements through lake and river water consumption. Nevertheless, As, Tl, Co, Ba, Mn and Cr might pose high potential health risks to consumers which required more attention. Therefore, regular monitoring and further studies are required to investigate the pollution trends and toxic behavior of these trace elements in this Tonle Sap Great Lake system.

J	Wei, M; Zhou, H; Luo, ZC; Dai, M				Wei, Min; Zhou, Hao; Luo, Zhicai; Dai, Min			Tracking inter-annual terrestrial water storage variations over Lake Baikal basin from GRACE and GRACE Follow-On missions	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission and its follow-on mission (GRACE Follow-On) can accurately track the Earth's mass variations, which have been successfully used in various geoscience researches related to global and regional hydrological process. In this study, satellite gravimetry (GRACE and GRACR Follow-On) and hydrological model (GLDAS) are used to estimate the TWS variations over LBB in 2003-2020. As the world's largest freshwater lake by volume, the terrestrial water storage (TWS) variations in Lake Baikal basin (LBB) significantly affect the surrounding ecological environment. However, the spatial scale of LBB is relatively small when compared to approximately 300 km spatial resolution of GRACE and GRACE Follow-On mission. Therefore, the forward modeling method is used to alleviate the leakage errors during satellite gravimetry data processing. To assess the performance of forward modeling method, a close-loop simulation study is designed in noise-contaminated condition. The simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of forward modeling method in accurately estimating TWS variations over LBB. After appropriate leakage correction, the inter-annual TWS from satellite gravimetry agrees well with GLDAS. The TWS variations over LBB demonstrate that (1) there are drastic variations and periodic characteristics around 4-5 years, and the drought events are observed in 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2015 as relatively smaller TWSs. (2) The soil moisture and groundwater are the major contributors to TWS variations (with the correlation coefficient of 0.88 and 0.89), and the surface water is the main contributor to the seasonal variations over LBB. (3) The TWS presents about 6 moths delay to precipitation variations, while the precipitation is still the major driver to affect the hydrological processes over this region.

Coastal floodplains are prone to river overflow and groundwater upwelling, so climate change may increase the vulnerability of people and infrastructure. This study was carried out on the coastal plain of Veracruz, Mexico where, in 2010, Hurricane Karl produced a river flood and the coastal city of Veracruz-Boca del Rio suffered many losses. The objective was to understand river-groundwater flooding and how seasonality in local groundwater flow is related to flood type, site topography and the wetland vegetation in this coastal zone. To this end, 31 piezometers and time series flow data from two hydrometric stations were monitored monthly, and remote images were used to classify land use and vegetation. The frequency and extent of an extreme river flood (caused by Hurricane Karl in 2010) and groundwater flood were documented. The results show that the 2010 river flood can be classified as an extreme flood with a return period of 50-100 years, inundating 60.5% of the rural area, 39.5% of the natural vegetation and roads, and 4.8% of the city. Groundwater floods occur every year in the low-lying areas of the floodplain, which correspond to discharge zones covered by wetlands. Different flood types require different solutions; i.e. the identification of areas that can serve as river buffers to divert water during extreme events, and allowing wetlands to function as natural defenses to reduce flood impact. These solutions can reduce floods, as can proper city planning. Management plans should include both engineering solutions and should make use of the ecological functions of wetlands and floodplains.

J	Tassone, SJ; Bukaveckas, PA				Tassone, Spencer J.; Bukaveckas, Paul A.			Seasonal, Interannual, and Longitudinal Patterns in Estuarine Metabolism Derived from Diel Oxygen Data Using Multiple Computational Approaches	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Twenty-three station-years of diel oxygen data for the James River Estuary were analyzed to characterize longitudinal, seasonal, and interannual patterns of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER). We compared two commonly used methods for deriving metabolism (bookkeeping and Bayesian) to determine whether the observed patterns were robust with respect to computational methodology. The two methods revealed similar longitudinal patterns of increasing GPP and ER, and decreasing net ecosystem metabolism (NEM), with increasing salinity. Seasonal patterns in GPP and ER tracked water temperature and solar radiation, except during high discharge events when metabolism declined by 40%. The bookkeeping method yielded higher estimates of GPP and ER in the higher end of the range, and smaller estimates in the low end of the range, thereby accentuating seasonal and longitudinal differences. Inferences regarding net autotrophy and heterotrophy were robust, as both methods yielded positive estimates of NEM at the chlorophyll maximum (tidal fresh segment) and negative values for the saline portion of the estuary. Inferences regarding the relative importance of allochthonous inputs (based on inferred ER at GPP=0) differed between the two methods. Values derived by the bookkeeping method indicated that respiration was largely supported by autochthonous production, whereas the Bayesian results indicated that autochthonous and allochthonous inputs were equally important. Overall, our findings show that methodological differences were small in the context of longitudinal, seasonal, and interannual variation but that the bookkeeping method yielded a wider range of values for GPP and ER relative to the Bayesian estimates.

Species composition and body size spectrum of zooplankton assemblage are sensitive to the changes of physico-chemical variability and fish feeding stress, and thus have in turn a prime bearing on water quality and cultured fishes. To study the response of zooplankton community to the introduction of planktivorous carps, monthly surveys were conducted in 2015 at six traditionally monitored locations in Miyun Reservoir, the unique surface drinking water of Beijing. There was a decrease in species richness, diversity, density and biomass, suggesting simplification of the community structure. Species diversity, density, and biomass declined significantly through the growth season, illustrating the great pressure imposed on the zooplankton. Regression and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed low relationships between community traits and environmental variables. Zooplankton biomass had a significantly negative relationship with the stocking intensity of the filter-feeding carp. The different responses of the subgroups of Protozoa, Rotifera, Cladocera and Copepoda indicated that they responded differently to environmental stress. Seasonal variations in the density and biomass of the four subgroups and biomass size spectrum (BSS) indicated that planktons with medium and large body sizes were more sensitive and suffered more stress from the filter-feeding carp. The filter feeding by the silver and bighead carp disrupted the natural equilibrium of the zooplankton community, decreased diversity and stocks, altered the seasonal dynamics of all quantitative traits and suppressed the dominance of medium- and large-sized species or functional groups. The impacts of the fishery mode and the responses of different functional groups of zooplankton must be considered in ecological assessments and biomanipulation studies based on the zooplankton community structure and dynamics.

J	Niedda, M; Pirastru, M				Niedda, Marcello; Pirastru, Mario			Hydrological processes of a closed catchment-lake system in a semi-arid Mediterranean environment	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Data collected in 4years of field observations were used in conjunction with continuous simulation models to study, at the small-basin scale, the water balance of a closed catchment-lake system in a semi-arid Mediterranean environment. The open water evaporation was computed with the Penman equation, using the data set collected in the middle of the lake. The surface runoff was partly measured at the main tributary and partly simulated using a distributed, catchment, hydrological model, calibrated with the observed discharge. The simplified structure of the developed modelling mainly concerns soil moisture dynamics and bedrock hydraulics, whereas the flow components are physically based. The calibration produced high efficiency coefficients and showed that surface runoff is greatly affected by soil water percolation into fractured bedrock. The bedrock reduces the storm-flow peaks and the interflow and has important multi-year effects on the annual runoff coefficients. The net subsurface outflow from the lake was calculated as the residual of the lake water balance. It was almost constant in the dry seasons and increased in the wet seasons, because of the moistening of the unsaturated soil. During the years of observation, rainfall 30% higher than average caused abundant runoff and a continuous rise in the lake water levels. The analysis allows to predict that, in years with lower than the average rainfall, runoff will be drastically reduced and will not be able to compensate for negative balance between precipitation and lake evaporation. Such highly unsteady situations, with great fluctuations in lake levels, are typical of closed catchment-lake systems in the semi-arid Mediterranean environment.

An analysis of phylogeographic population structure and demography and Bayesian inference methods were conducted on P. mayanus from 16 localities across the range of the species. To assess the historical processes and changes through the Pleistocene climatic cycles that may have affected the distribution and demographic history of the species, the current potential distribution of the species was modelled using ecological niche modelling (ENM) and projected onto the mid Holocene (MH), Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and Last Inter Glacial (LIG). Psittacanthus mayanus exhibited higher haplotype and nucleotide diversity in the southern part of its distribution than in the northern part. Two divergent lineages were revealed in the phylogenetic and phylogeographical analyses of ribotypes and haplotypes. Populations from the northern portion of the Yucatan Peninsula probably experienced a recent population growth, whereas populations from the southern portion of the Peninsula and Chiapas are marked by historical demographic stability and isolation. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) analyses strongly supported a scenario of post-glacial population growth. ENM results indicate that the distribution of P. mayanus expanded and was connected into the southern portion of the Yucatan Peninsula during LGM conditions and colonized the northern portion of the Peninsula and fragmented during MH conditions. According to the ABC and ENM results, the genetic differentiation of P. mayanus may be linked to the effects of the glacial/interglacial cycles and environmental factors, in which populations of P. mayanus expanded during the LGM into the Pet,n province currently covered with semideciduous tropical rain forest followed by northward expansion, southwards contractions and post-glacial colonization of the northernmost portion of the Yucatan province, a region currently covered with seasonally dry tropical deciduous forest. Our results highlight the influence of Pleistocene events in shaping the geographical distribution of genetic variation in Neotropical lowland forest. The phylogeographic and environmental patterns in P. mayanus provide an opportunity to investigate further the evolution of Mexican lowland forest biodiversity.					; Ornelas, Juan/A-2250-2014	Licona-Vera, Yuyini/0000-0001-6616-361X; Vasquez-Aguilar, Antonio Acini/0000-0002-4920-7278; Ornelas, Juan Francisco/0000-0002-1124-1163													0024-4074	1095-8339				MAR	2018	186	3					334	360		10.1093/botlinnean/box098	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/botlinnean/box098													WOS:000426813300004

For this reason, the necessity to carry on research on the existence of contaminants, specifically heavy metals, has emerged. In this study, heavy metal concentrations in muscle tissues of Aegean chub, which was an endemic species of south western part of Turkey, gathered from Tersakan River were examined. Heavy metal concentrations of the samples were analyzed with ICP-MS. Estimated daily intakes (EDI), target hazard quotient (THQ), and carcinogenic risk (CR) of elements were calculated. The heavy metals detected in muscle tissues were Zn > Cu > Cr > Mn > Pb > Cd, consecutively. According to the results of the applied health risk assessment (EDI, THQ and CR) for heavy metal exposure from fish consumption in children and adults, it was determined that there was no any significant threat to human health.

J	Griffiths, D				Griffiths, David			Pattern and process in the ecological biogeography of European freshwater fish	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												Species lists for regions of Europe defined by Illies (1978, Limnofauna Europaea, 2nd edn. Gustav Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart), and augmented by information from Maitland (2000, Guide to Freshwater Fish of Britain and Europe. Hamlyn, London), are used to describe patterns in freshwater fish species richness and to examine the contribution of habitat preference, migration, body size and glacial history to these patterns. The number of non-endemic species declines to the north and west, with increasing distance from the Ponto-Caspian region, the main source area, whereas endemic species richness declines only with latitude. Habitat generalists tend to be migratory while riverine specialists are usually resident. Similar numbers of riverine species and generalists occur in Europe as a whole but generalists dominate in regional faunas and, to an increasing extent, in more isolated, formerly glaciated areas. Very few lacustrine specialists were found, reflecting the geologically ephemeral nature of lakes. Only 8% of riverine species have colonized glaciated areas, compared with more than half the generalist species, and the number declines rapidly with increasing distance from the source area. Diadromous species show no geographical variation in species richness but potamodromous and resident species are affected by glaciation and by mountain and marine barriers. The mean body size of regional faunas increases with latitude because there are relatively fewer small species in more distant, glaciated areas. About half the species occurring in Europe are restricted to one region and the majority of these endemics occur in barrier regions with Mediterranean climates. Species in glaciated regions have much larger range sizes. Habitat preference and migration type, not body size, are the main determinants of range size. Freshwater habitat availability varies across Europe with glaciated areas having more lakes of a given size than unglaciated areas. Catchment size is greatest at mid-latitudes. For a given catchment size rivers in glaciated areas are shorter. The results support the notion that habitat variability, on both short and long time scales, favours colonization ability, which requires large body size. As a result of their limited vagility northern fish faunas are depauperate, show high levels of plasticity and polymorphism and may show elevated speciation rates. The isolated southern faunas of the Iberian and Italian peninsulas and the Balkans are rich in endemic species but may be subject to extinctions because of the spread of the highly seasonal Mediterranean climate.																			0021-8790	1365-2656				MAY	2006	75	3					734	751		10.1111/j.1365-2656.2006.01094.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2006.01094.x								16689956					WOS:000237517000012

The Kluane Lake region in particular has been identified previously as an analogue for Late Pleistocene eastern Beringia. All topsoils have higher average total nitrogen delta N-15 and organic carbon delta C-13 than plants from the same sites with a positive shift occurring with depth in two soil profiles analyzed. All plants analyzed have an average whole plant delta C-13 of -27.5 +/- 1.2 parts per thousand and foliar delta C-13 of -28.0 +/- 1.3 parts per thousand, and average whole plant delta N-15 of -0.3 +/- 2.2 parts per thousand and foliar delta N-15 of -0.6 +/- 2.7 parts per thousand. Plants analyzed here showed relatively smaller variability in delta C-13 than delta N-15. Their average delta C-13 after suitable corrections for the Suess effect should be suitable as baseline for interpreting diets of Late Pleistocene herbivores that lived in eastern Beringia. Water availability, nitrogen availability, spacial differences and intra-plant variability are important controls on delta N-15 of herbaceous plants in the study area. The wider range of delta N-15, the more numerous factors that affect nitrogen isotopic composition and their likely differences in the past, however, limit use of the modern N isotopic baseline for vegetation in paleodietary models for such ecosystems. That said, the positive correlation between foliar delta N-15 and N content shown for the modern plants could support use of plant delta(15) N as an index for plant N content and therefore forage quality. The modern N isotopic baseline cannot be applied directly to the past, but it is prerequisite to future efforts to detect shifts in N cycling and forage quality since the Late Pleistocene through comparison with fossil plants from the same region.

Overall, 22 ciliate morphotypes were detected. Cyclidium glaucoma was the most abundant, whereas Frontonia sp., Condylostoma sp. and Holophrya sp. dominated in terms of biovolume. Further, the assignment of ciliates to nutritional modes indicated that the abundance of bacterivorous ciliates was not related to bacterial abundance, most likely because of the very high bacterial food concentrations (83.0 10(6) cells mL(1) on average). The abundance of Frontonia sp. was positively correlated with chlorophyll a in Lake Bogoria, but not in Lake Nakuru. Morphometric measurements of Frontonia sp. indicated significant intraspecific differences in mean cell length, i.e. 116.1 2.3 vs. 139.0 2.7 m in Lake Bogoria and Lake Nakuru, respectively. Sequences of the 18S SSU rRNA, however, turned out to be identical for individuals of the two lakes. Phylogenetic relationships of the subclass Peniculia based on the 18S rRNA genes revealed that Frontonia from these lakes rather clustered with Apofrontonia and Paramecium than with other Frontonia species, indicating that the genus Frontonia is paraphyletic. With the exception of C. glaucoma and Euplotes moebiusi, the ciliate taxa from the two lakes could be identified only down to the genus level. We assume that these taxa are still not yet described and thus highlight the unique character of these ecosystems and the need for more studies.

J	Vári, A				Vari, Agnes			Colonisation by fragments in six common aquatic macrophyte species	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Vegetative reproduction is the most common form of propagation in aquatic macrophytes. Fragmentation and consecutive re-rooting of the fragments is one way in which new macrophyte colonies may establish. The success and frequency of this strategy depends on the species and the environment. This study tested how well six species are capable of colonising this way. Tested species are five of the most abundant species of Lake Balaton, where macrophyte recolonisation is still to take place after improving water quality and one potentially invasive species. Fragments of standardized length were examined for survival, rooting rates and length growth during five to six week experiments under laboratory conditions. Effects of species, shoot part (apical or mid-stem part) and seasonality on rooting probability were analysed with logistic regression. Effects on life-cycle were also examined, in terms of continuation of growth and of flowering or seed-set. Species differed significantly in rooting rates and growth, but not in survival rates. Egeria densa, Myriophyllum spicatum and Potamogeton perfoliatus showed the best colonisation properties (survival rates: 95 %, 84 % and 84 %; rooting rates: 88 %, 45 % and 65 %, respectively), while Potamogeton pectinatus colonised less successfully (survival rate: 91 %, rooting rate: 38 %). The annual Najas marina was the only species which frequently reached flowering (61 %), while fragmenting further, without much rooting (rooting rate: 5 %). The non-rooting Ceratophyllum demersum was least impacted by fragmentation and continued growth best, with survival rates of 100 %. Shoot part had a significant influence on rooting rate and length growth. Apical fragments had higher rooting rates and greater length growth than stem fragments, probably due to the action of their meristematic tissue. Differences in the three repetitions of the experiment may be attributable to seasonal changes in colonisation features. It is concluded that recolonisation by fragments might be an effective way for macrophyte populations to recover in Lake Balaton.					; Vari, Agnes/KHV-5849-2024	Vari, Agnes/0000-0001-5285-847X; 													1863-9135					JUL	2013	183	1					15	26		10.1127/1863-9135/2013/0328	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1863-9135/2013/0328													WOS:000322771700002

Over the last decades, various approaches have been used to model lake thermodynamics and dynamics in standalone mode or coupled to numerical atmospheric models. We assess a turbulence-closure k - epsilon multi-column lake model in standalone mode as a computationally-efficient alternative to a full three-dimensional hydrodynamic model in the case of Lake Geneva. While it struggles to reproduce some short-term features, the multi-column model reasonably reproduces the seasonal mean of the thermal horizontal and vertical structures governing heat and mass exchanges between the lake surface and the lower atmosphere ( stratified period, thermocline depth, stability of the water column). As it requires typically two orders of magnitude less computational ressources, it may allow a two-way coupling with a RCM on timescales or spatial resolutions where full 3D lake models are too demanding.

Population and breeding patterns of the pest rodent: Mastomys natalensis in a maize dominated agroecosystem in Lake Victoria crescent zone, Eastern Uganda	AFRICAN ZOOLOGY												Multimammate mice (Mastomys natalensis) are a key rodent pest species to cereal crop production in Sub-Saharan Africa. This study aimed at generating information on the population fluctuation and breeding patterns of M. natalensis in a maize dominated agro-ecosystem in the Mayuge district, Eastern Uganda. The area is characterised by a bimodal rainfall pattern with rains in the periods March to May and August to November. A Capture-Mark-Recapture study was established in cultivated and fallow field habitats with, in each habitat, two plots of 60 m by 60 m with 49 evenly spaced trapping points. Trapping was conducted monthly for three consecutive nights, and the study extended from January 2016 to June 2018. A Generalised Linear Mixed Model analysis showed significantly higher population density estimates (beta = 0.69, p < 0.0001) in fallow land compared to cultivated fields, and also significantly higher density estimates( beta = 0.75, p = 0.006) in the first wet season and lowest in the first dry season. The percentage breeding females differed significantly across months (chi (2) = 27.05, df = 11, p = 0.003) and seasons (chi (2) = 17.64, p = 0.0003). Breeding females occurred throughout all the months of trapping, but with significantly higher percentages in the months of March to July (i.e. first wet season extending to second dry season) and generally lowest in the first dry months (i.e. January and February in 2017, and February 2018). The results of this study have important consequences for the timing of control efforts, and recommends that control should be initiated during the dry seasons prior to wet seasons to counteract potential damaging population build up in later wet seasons when crop planting is expected.

The objective of this work was to investigate the mineralogy of smectites in the soils surrounding a representative alkaline-saline lake of Nhecolandia, a sub-region of the Pantanal wetland, Brazil, and then to identify the mechanisms of their formation. Soils were sampled along a toposequence and analyzed by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray analysis, and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Water was collected along a transect involving the studied toposequence and equilibrium diagrams were calculated using the databases PHREEQC and AQUA. The fine-clay fraction is dominated by smectite, mica, and kaolinite. Smectites are concentrated at two places in the toposequence: an upper zone, which includes the soil horizons rarely reached by the lake-level variation; and a lower zone, which includes the surface horizon within the area of seasonal lake-level variation. Within the upper zone, the smectite is dioctahedral, rich in Al and Fe, and is classified as ferribeidellite. This phase is interstratified with mica and vermiculite and has an Fe content similar to that of the mica identified. These characteristics suggest that the ferribeidellite originates from transformation of micas and that vermiculite is an intermediate phase in this transformation. Within the lower zone, smectites are dominantly trioctahedral, Mg-rich, and are saponitic and stevensitic minerals. In addition, samples enriched in these minerals have much smaller rare-earth element (REE) contents than other soil samples. The water chemistry shows a geochemical control of Mg and saturation with respect to Mg-smectites in the more saline waters. The REE contents, water chemistry, and the presence of Mg-smectite where maximum evaporation is expected, suggest that saponitic and stevensitic minerals originate by chemical precipitation from the water column of the alkaline-saline lake.					; BARBIERO, Laurent/D-4168-2009; Barbiero, Laurent/D-4168-2009; Furquim, Sheila/I-7131-2015; Valles, Vincent/ADZ-5583-2022	VALLES, vincent/0000-0003-4591-1206; BARBIERO, Laurent/0000-0002-7285-4270; Furquim, Sheila/0000-0001-7050-275X; 													0009-8604	1552-8367				OCT	2008	56	5					579	595		10.1346/CCMN.2008.0560511	http://dx.doi.org/10.1346/CCMN.2008.0560511													WOS:000261979800011

Mozammel; Musonda, Bathsheba; Fang, Cao			The long-term spatial and temporal distribution of aerosol optical depth and its associated atmospheric circulation over Southeast Africa	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Recent studies have revealed significant impact of anthropogenic aerosols to both climate and human health. Even though significant efforts have been made across the globe, studies related to aerosols over Southeast Africa remain scanty, hence causing high uncertainty in predicting and understanding the impacts of these aerosols. The present study therefore analyzed long-term spatial and temporal distribution of aerosol optical depth at 550 nanometer wavelength (AOD(550)) over the entire Southeast Africa. Relatively low AOD(550) has been detected over the region in comparison to highly polluted regions across the globe. The highest annual average (>0.2) was observed over Lake Malawi, Zambezi valley, and the coastal areas of Central Mozambique while low annual values were recorded over northeast of Mozambique, and the eastern areas of Zimbabwe. In terms of seasonality, AOD(550) was observed to be high (>0.3) during the dry months of September-October-November (SON) while being low (<0.1) during March-April-May (MAM) and June-July-August (JJA) in most areas. The seasonality of AOD(550) was observed to be highly influenced by changes in seasonal biomass burning and seasonal atmospheric circulation. Statistical analyses revealed an insignificant change of AOD(550) between 2002 and 2020 in most areas of the study domain. Regional open burning of biomass like bush fires and burning of crop residues during the dry months are the main sources of aerosol concentration.

J	Iwahana, G; Busey, RC; Saito, K				Iwahana, Go; Busey, Robert C.; Saito, Kazuyuki			Seasonal and Interannual Ground-Surface Displacement in Intact and Disturbed Tundra along the Dalton Highway on the North Slope, Alaska	LAND												Spatiotemporal variation in ground-surface displacement caused by ground freeze-thaw and thermokarst is critical information to understand changes in the permafrost ecosystem. Measurement of ground displacement, especially in the disturbed ground underlain by ice-rich permafrost, is important to estimate the rate of permafrost and carbon loss. We conducted high-precision global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning surveys to measure the surface displacements of tundra in northern Alaska, together with maximum thaw depth (TD) and surface moisture measurements from 2017 to 2019. The measurements were performed along two to three 60-200 m transects per site with 1-5 m intervals at the three areas. The average seasonal thaw settlement (STS) at intact tundra sites ranged 5.8-14.3 cm with a standard deviation range of 2.1-3.3 cm. At the disturbed locations, averages and variations in STS and the maximum thaw depth were largest in all observed years and among all sites. The largest seasonal and interannual subsidence (44 and 56 cm/year, respectively) were recorded at points near troughs of degraded ice-wedge polygons or thermokarst lakes. Weak or moderate correlation between STS and TD found at the intact sites became obscure as the thermokarst disturbance progressed, leading to higher uncertainty in the prediction of TD from STS.

J	Leis, E; Chi, TK; Lumme, J				Leis, Eric; Tran Kim Chi; Lumme, Jaakko			Global Phylogeography of Salmonid Ectoparasites of the Genus Gyrodactylus, with an Emphasis on the Origin of the Circumpolar Gyrodactylus salmonis (Platyhelminthes: Monogenea)	COMPARATIVE PARASITOLOGY												The wageneri species group of Gymdactylus contains the following molecularly confirmed salmonid parasites in Asia: Gyrodactylus taimeni Ergens, 1971, Gyrodactylus magnus Konovalov, 1967, Gyrodactylus brachymystacis Ergens, 1978, and Gyrodactylus derjavini Mikhailov, 1975; in Europe it contains the following: Gyrodactylus derjavinoides Malmberg, Collins, Cunningham, and Jalali, 2007, Gyrodactylus truttae Glaser, 1974, Gyrodactylus teuchis Lautraite, Blanc, Thiery, Daniel, and Vigneulle, 1999, Gyrodactylus lavareti Malmberg, 1956, Gyrodactylus salvelini Kuusela, Zietara, and Lumme, 2008 (presented herein as a junior synonym of Gyrodactylus salmonis Yin and Sproston, 1948), and Gyrodactylus salaris Malmberg, 1957, with the lone confirmed North American exception being G. salmonis. The mitochondrial DNA (cox1, 1545 bp) of this group shows a star-like phylogenetic expansion that began 2.05 +/- 0.4 million years ago (mya), estimated from the mean distance of the cox1 gene (d(MCL )= 0.267) using a tentative, potentially high-end, divergence rate of 0.13/Myr. European G. salaris on Thymallus thymallus and Asian G. magnus on Thymallus arcticus have been separated for 1.95 Myr (d(MCL) = 0.253). The nuclear ITS rDNA region (1,245 bp) of G. salmonis was nearly uniform among North American populations of Oncorhynchus mykiss, Oncorhynchus clarkii, Oncorhynchus nerka, Salvelinus fontinalis, and Salmo salar (and non-native Salmo trutta) as well as on Salvelinus alpinus (under the synonym G. salvelini) from Lake Mari, Finland. Gyrodactylus salmonis is distal in a monophyletic subclade labeled by an apomorphic 56 bp insertion in the ITS1, shared by the European parasites G. lavareti (host: Coregonus lavaretus), Gyrodactylus pomeraniae Kuusela, Zietara, and Lumme, 2008 (host: Rutilus rutilus), and Gyrodactylus bliccensis Glaser, 1974 (host: Alburnus alburnus). This subphylogeny suggests that a particular host switch from cyprinids to salmonids may have occurred less than 1.8 mya in the Old World [d(MCL) = 0.234 G. pomeraniae vs (G. salmonis, G. lavareti)] and possibly again among coregonine hosts and Salvelinus 1.2 mya (d(MCL )= 0.156). Although hypothetical, a transition from coregonines to chary (notably the widely distributed and adaptable Salvelinus alpinus) potentially could have occurred in a proglacial refugium leading to circumpolar distribution of G. salmonis and a secondary transition to other North American hosts. The maximum cox1 genetic distance within G. salmonis on all hosts was dMCL = 0.032, at the same level as in multihosted European G. salaris (d(MCL) = 0.032), suggesting circa 250,000 yr of population expansion with these parasites since a temporal, coinciding bottleneck.																			1525-2647	1938-2952				JAN	2021	88	1					130	143		10.1654/1525-2647-88.1.130	http://dx.doi.org/10.1654/1525-2647-88.1.130													WOS:000685268900017

The Palaeoproterozoic (Orosirian-Rhyacian, 1.86-2.1 Ga) Chaibasa Formation in the Dhalbhumgarh area, eastern India, represents sedimentation in an ice-contact proglacial lagoon affected by iceberg (bits and growlers) calving and lake-ice rafting. Ice scouring, both on muddy and sandy substrates, as well as ice "rosettes" developed as consequence of the ploughing action of floating icebergs that were moved by wind, meltwater floods and tidal currents on soft sediments. Muddy flats surrounding the proglacial lagoon underwent seasonal deep freezing conditions developing cryogenic patterned ground containing reticulate ice, ice veins and sand wedges, suggesting the occurrence of proglacial permafrost areas coeval with Proterozoic glaciers. The central part of the proglacial lagoon was characterized by deposition of glacial varves punctuated by pebble and cobble size angular dropstones accumulated in the basin as ice-rafted debris from floating ice. Evidences provided in this paper reinforced the idea that 1.86-2.1 Ga ago glacial conditions prevailed after the supposed ending of the Huronian glaciation. This paper provides detailed examples that can be used to recognize possible floating/drifted ice scours in other Precambrian successions, as these elements have largely passed undetected, being probably widely reported in the literature as generic soft-sediment deformation structures. Similar soft-sediment deformations from Precambrian clastic depositional systems should be re-evaluated as there is a significant possibility that most of the Precambrian iceberg-related structures had escape notice, as originally suggested Eyles et al. in 1997.

SALINE-ALKALINE SOIL BACTERIAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND DIVERSITY ANALYSIS UNDER DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF LAND-USE IN A LAKE WETLAND IN SONGNEN PLAIN, CHINA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												In this study, the saline-alkaline soil samples were collected from Gudahu Wetland in Songnen Plain, China, in May (dry season) and July (rainy season), 2018. The soil bacterial community structure and diversity in the original meadow, lake dam, cropland, and woodland were analyzed using high-throughput sequencing technology. The results showed that Proteobacteria were the dominant bacterial phylum during the two seasons. Except for an unclassified group at the generic level, Pseudomonas showed the highest relative abundance. The lake dam's soil bacterial community diversity was the lowest, followed by the original meadow, while those of cropland and woodland were higher. The soil bacterial community structures differed among the four land-use patterns. Cropland and woodland showed the highest differences in soil bacterial community structure compared to the original meadow than the lake dam. In contrast to cropland and woodland, soil bulk density, electrical conductivity, and pH had a higher impact on the bacterial community diversities of the original meadow and the lake dam. Dam construction, cultivation, and afforestation in the saline-alkaline lake wetland of Songnen Plain changed the physicochemical properties of soil from the original meadow. It affected the bacterial community structure and diversity.					; Ding, Junnan/AAF-8782-2021; Liu, Jing-Xin/G-5151-2016; liang, xiongwei/NXX-8012-2025	Ding, Junnan/0000-0002-6722-5314; 													1589-1623	1785-0037					2021	19	2					1337	1352		10.15666/aeer/1902_13371352	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1902_13371352													WOS:000637972000033

As such, lacustrine studies by highly skilled professionals and managers with water resources at home and abroad have focused on assessing the aquatic ecosystem health status of lakes. In this study, the health status of the aquatic ecosystem in the largest freshwater lake in China (Poyang Lake) was assessed, and its temporal and spatial characteristics were illustrated. The index contained three element layers, including hydrologic characteristics, trophic status, and aquatic organisms. The health status of the aquatic ecosystem was classified into three categories: 'good', 'moderate' (subhealthy), and 'bad'. It was examined through extension evaluation method. Results showed 'moderate' health status, whereas remarkable seasonal and spatially variations. The annual changes in the health status were remarkably due to the influence of complex hydrological and hydrodynamic conditions. This study provides an overall understanding of the aquatic ecosystem evaluation in Poyang Lake. Such an understanding is vital for environmental conservation and identification of causes of the aquatic ecosystem degradation in Poyang Lake.																				2073-4441				JAN	2021	13	2							211	10.3390/w13020211	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13020211													WOS:000611748400001

Despite the importance of groundwater resource in semi-arid areas, limited information exists on the recharge amount and potential recharge zones in Tanzania in the context of climate change which could result in unsustainable withdrawals. This study aimed to estimate the potential impact of climate change on groundwater recharge and identify potential recharge zones in the Lake Manyara catchment using Water and Energy Transfer between Soil, Plants and Atmosphere under the quasi-steady State (WetSpass) model. The WetSpass model was setup and calibrated using hydro-meteorological data (rainfall, temperature, wind speed, potential evapotranspiration, and groundwater depth) and biophysical data (soil, land use, topography, and slope). Simulated rainfall, temperature and potential evapotranspiration from an ensemble of four CORDEX-Africa regional climate models for the period 2021-2050 under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP 8.5) scenario (hereafter referred as business as-usual scenario) were used as input in the WetSpass model for the climate change impact assessment. WetSpass model calibration using the water balance equation showed a coefficient of determination (R-2) value of 0.9 and Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) of 0.49 mm/yr between the simulated and calculated recharge. It was determined that the mean annual recharge of 53.9 mm/year (149 MCM/year) for the period 1989-2018 would increase by 7.9% in the future (2021-2050) under the business-as-usual climate scenario, due to the increase in rainfall. Seasonality and spatial differences in recharge amount were observed, with recharge projected to increase in the dry season and at areas that receive high amount of rainfall. Potential recharge zones in the catchment were found mostly around the northern part near Ngorongoro, the south-western part, and around Mbulu region. Findings from this study would help policymakers, and local stakeholders in planning and management of the groundwater resources for sustainable development.

The three fish stocks were reared under common garden conditions, and ion homeostasis, seawater tolerance, activities of gill and kidney Na,K-ATPase and [H-3]ouabain binding of gill and kidney tissues were determined at different phases of smoltification. Activity of gill Na,K-ATPase and number of gill [H-3]]ouabain binding sites reached peak values in May and were strongly suppressed in July. Osmolality and Na+, Cl-, and Me2+ ion concentrations of blood plasma decreased during smoltification. alpha la and alpha lb isofoims of gill Na,KATPase decreased and increased, respectively, during smoltification. Although small differences appeared at some points in time, the seasonal pattern and magnitude of changes in smolt characteristics were generally similar in the Saimaa salmon and in the anadromous stocks of the Neva and Teno salmon. It is suggested that the strong smoltification process of the landlocked Saimaa salmon is somehow necessary for migration of the young salmon from river to lake and therefore has been retained in evolution.

The current study reports the spatial distribution and seasonal variation of trophic status in Danjiangkou Reservoir (DJKR), which is a large water supply reservoir of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project in central China. The calculation of TSICHL indicated a mesotrophic state (40 <= TSICHL < 50) for most regions of the reservoir, whereas a eutrophic state was indicated if the assessment was based on either TSITP (calculated from total phosphorus) or TSISD (calculated from Secchi depth). As indicated by Carlson's two-dimensional deviations, factors other than phosphorus limited algal growth in January and May when non-algal particles affected light attenuation. However, phosphorus was the controlling factor of large algae blooms in July and November in 2007. TSISD had positive correlations with TSICHL and TSITP. It was found that total phosphorus, SiO2-Si and SD were the major factors regulating the trophic state (TSICHL) of DJKR. Light attenuation and SD were mainly affected by non-algal particles.					; Cai, Qinghua/F-8176-2015	Cai, Qinghua/0000-0002-0224-7256; Shen, Henglun/0000-0003-3235-4041													0270-5060	2156-6941				APR 3	2015	30	2					249	261		10.1080/02705060.2014.935748	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2014.935748													WOS:000353953700004

The pterosaur tracks are assigned to the ichnogenus Pteraichnus based on the triangular overall-shape, the four elongate digit traces and the robust manual digit trace III. Supposed trackmakers were dsungaripterid pterodactyloids whose skeletal remains are well known from the Tugulu Group. The bird tracks that occur on the same surface, are those of typical shorebirds, known from different other localities in southeast Asia. The congruence with Koreanaornis dodsoni described from the same stratigraphic level justifies an assignment to this ichnospecies. This is a further evidence of the co-occurrence of pterosaurs and birds in a typical lakeshore environment with possible seasonal alteration of water supply and aerial exposure indicated by wave ripples, mudcracks and repeated cycles of coarse to fine sediment. Pterosaurs and birds frequented the shoreline and may have fed also on the numerous invertebrates such as the Scoyenia tracemaker that left abundant burrows.

This paper presents the control measures taken to manage aquifer recharge (MAR) and also to overcome the problem of seawater intrusion into the coastal aquifer along the Kalangi river, Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh, India having connectivity with Pulicat (saltwater) lake estuary. Due to overexploitation of groundwater and less rainfall in past years, adjacent seawater has started intruding in the Kalangi river sub-surface and deteriorating groundwater quality up to 11.6 km from the confluence of the river with Pulicat lake. To prevent this situtation, subsurface dams were constructed in traditional manner using local earth material in three different places across the Kalangi river near Sullurpet town. The water storage capacities calculated after the sub-surface dams' construction are 1.28 mcft at GK Engineering College, 6.23 mcft at Challamagudi and 3.143 mcft at Holy Cross School sites. The Holy Cross School sub-surface dam is the first full scale dam-cum-check dam constructed to prevent salt water intrusion in the Kalangi river at Sullurpet, Nellore district, Andhra Pradesh. At the Kalangi river estuary portion (at the mouth of sea) a groyne was reconstructed over old groyne site with the introduction of clay bed and wooden sheet piles at down stream. Apart from prevention of sea water entry into Kalangi river sub-surface (during seasons) the groyne top level was raised to prevent mixing of high sea water tides with fresh water and ensuring additional storage of fresh water at upstream side. The reconstructed groyne was serving the purpose of obstructing the surface seawater entry in the Kalangi river and water quality has improved in the river as well as in the wells. After construction of sub-surface dam, as per the Simpson ratio classification, there is substantial improvement of water quality in the SHAR infiltration well situated near the Holy Cross School sub-surface dam.

Complex seasonality observed amongst diverse phytoplankton viruses in the Bay of Quinte, an embayment of Lake Ontario	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												To initiate research on algal viruses (viruses that infect eukaryotic algae) and cyanophages (viruses that infect cyanobacteria) in the Bay of Quinte, a Lake Ontario embayment, samples of viruses free in the water (i.e. not associated with particulate material) were collected throughout 2011 with the goals of examining the diversity of phytoplankton viruses and monitoring their dynamics. PCR and sequencing of DNA polymerase (polB) and major capsid protein (MCP) genes from algal viruses, and sheath protein genes from cyanophages, revealed diverse phytoplankton viruses in the bay. Specifically, polB sequences from the bay were most closely related to sequences from viruses that infect prasinophyte algae, MCP sequences were related to sequences from viruses that infect prasinophytes and from Mimivirus-like viruses that infect prymnesiophytes and prasinophytes, whilst sheath protein sequences were related to sequences from the phage Ma-LMM01 that infects M.aeruginosa. The abundances of 10 distinct viral genes monitored using quantitative PCR ranged from exceptionally high values (e.g. 256441 gene copies mL(-1) for a putative M.aeruginosa phage) to values that were just above detection limits (e.g. a putative Prasinovirus never exceeded 20 gene copies mL(-1)). Patterns of abundance included genes that were seasonally sporadic or geographically patchy, as well as some that were stable throughout the bay over the entire year. Despite the heterogeneity of viral abundance across the bay, gene abundance clustered by sampling date and geographical location. Even for closely related viruses, seasonality and geographical distribution were distinct. By providing evidence for the complex seasonality of diverse phytoplankton viruses, this work highlighted significant gaps in knowledge of aquatic virus ecology that can be extrapolated from this one system to most aquatic environments.					; Short, Steven/F-5578-2011	Short, Steven/0000-0002-6576-4883; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				DEC	2013	58	12					2648	2663		10.1111/fwb.12241	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12241													WOS:000326021800016

Assessment of farming practices and uses of agrochemicals in Lake Manyara basin, Tanzania	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												This study was conducted to assess farming practices, agrochemical usage and environmental pollution in Manyara basin, Tanzania. Field surveys, interviews, questionnaires and Lake Manyara nutrient analysis were used in data collection. The highest number (95%) of households grew crops, namely, maize, rice, banana and vegetables with median farm size of 3 ha. Irrigated farming was common (75%) which enhanced cultivation on same piece of land up to 6 times a year. Farmers indiscriminately used pesticides, namely, insecticides (50%), fungicides (37.5%) and herbicides (12.5%). Uses of endosulfan in vegetable farms poses public health threats to consumers. Most respondents (85%) applied insecticides in vegetables up to 4 times per cropping season. Excessive use of pesticides and haphazard disposal of pesticide remnants and containers caused environmental pollution. The average amount of acaricides used was 1109 +/- 915 ml (mean +/- SD) per livestock keeper per month per. Most farmers (78%) used inorganic fertilizers and animal manure (43.4%). Low levels of ammonium (3.6 +/- 3.1 mu g/L), nitrate (1 +/- 0.8 mu g/L) and phosphate (36.1 +/- 42 mu g/L) were recorded in the lake. Easy access to agrochemicals, limited knowledge of pesticide on environmental health and limited extension services were factors for indiscriminate uses of agrochemicals. Increasing farmers awareness and training aimed at sustainable agriculture, agrochemical uses and integrated pest management is suggested.																			1991-637X					MAY 18	2011	6	10					2216	2230																WOS:000292269500012

We explicitly demonstrated the heterogeneity of the in-lake P cycles between basins with distinct morphological features. Enhanced interactions between waters and sediments occur in shallow and non-stratified areas, as evidenced by the magnitudes of gross sedimentation and total internal P loading. In such shallow areas, sediment resuspension contributes over 60% of the total internal P loading throughout the entire open water season. In contrast, sedimentary P cycling is less intensive in deep and stratified areas, where diffusive fluxes account for an average of 70% of total internal P loading. We show that sedimentary P burial plays a key role in controlling the in-lake P cycle. Permanent burial of P showing higher rates and efficiencies tends to occur in deeper areas. Overall, sediments in Lake Hiidenvesi act as a net P sink under modern biogeochemical settings; the lake is in the process of long-term recovery from eutrophication due to the larger annual P output than external loading.

The following hypothesis was tested: the quantity and quality of suspended sediment yields in agricultural settings controls nutrient transfer from surface runoff. Stream discharge and water quality were monitored at three locations along a tributary reach within the Rondeau Bay basin during the 2013 growing-harvest season (May-October). Water samples were analyzed in the laboratory for suspended sediment concentration, particle size, and sediment-assisted nitrogen and phosphorus content. Estimated total sediment yield over the 6-month monitoring period was similar to 50 t (0.13 t ha(-1)). A mid-season change in contributing sediment sources was inferred based on the observations of suspended sediment transfer and particle size following a 92 mm rainfall event. This extreme runoff event marked a change in the discharge-suspended sediment response seen in the catchment, which included a July-September abrupt decrease in suspended sediment concentration and a coincident increase in fine-grained particle abundance. Clockwise event hysteresis suggested adjacent and/or likely channel derived sediment sources. Finally, there was a positive relationship between suspended sediment concentration and phosphorus (R-2 = 0.86, n = 63) and orthophosphate (R-2 = 0.75, n = 63). Estimated nutrient concentrations exceeded provincial load guidelines, which suggests that present land management efforts to minimize nutrient loading via surface runoff require further evaluation. This research concludes that agricultural-based nutrient loading into Lake Erie is sediment-assisted and that this sediment potentially derives from in-channel and tile drain sources. The findings have important implications for future soil loss and thus nutrient loading from agricultural settings, especially during extreme events. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Poyang Lake, the most typical river-connected lake and the largest freshwater lake in China, was selected as the research area. Based on field investigations and numerical simulation, the monthly pollutant degradation coefficients and non-fully mixed coefficients of different lake regions were determined to explore the WECCs of COD, TN and TP of Poyang Lake in a common water year. It was found that under the hydrological conditions of a common water year the total WECCs of COD, TN and TP in the lake were respectively 181.9 x 10(4) t, 33.3 x 10(4) t and 1.86 x 10(4) t. Due to the varied lake water volume and self-purification ability, an evident temporal fluctuation of WECCs in Poyang Lake was observed. The dry seasons were characterized by a higher NFMCs but lower WECCs owing to the lower water level and degradation ability. Variation coefficients of COD and TN WECC were close to each other, of which the average level was about 58.5%, a little higher than that of TP.																			1660-4601					APR	2015	12	4					3564	3578		10.3390/ijerph120403564	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph120403564								25830284					WOS:000353488500012

However, the total impact of extreme drought on wetland vegetation remains poorly understood. This study determined the standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and analysed drought trends within the Poyang Lake Basin. Additionally, spatiotemporal variations in wetland vegetation under drought conditions were examined by analysing the mean normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) values and categorising NDVI classifications. The key factors affecting wetland vegetation and its respective thresholds were determined. The Poyang Lake Basin has experienced increasing aridity over the past 3 years. In response to this trend, the wetland vegetation area in Poyang Lake expanded, whereas vegetation greenness declined. Notably, in the year following an extreme drought, Poyang Lake's vegetation greenness was lower than that during the same period in previous years. Regardless, the correlation analysis showed no significant relationship between the SPEI values and the wetland vegetation greenness; however, water level changes significantly impacted the wetland vegetation, with a correlation coefficient of -0.89 (p < 0.001). A critical water level of 14 m was identified as the threshold at which sudden changes in the mean NDVI were observed. This research offers valuable insights into hydrological management strategies to protect Poyang Lake Wetland's vegetation under drought conditions. Future studies should enhance the differentiation of drought tolerance among different wetland plant species, thereby achieving differentiated hydrological management.

In this study, the effects of climate models from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Product (CMIP5) on Crop Water Requirement (CWR), Length of Growth Period (LGP), and drought conditions were quantified for Lake Hawassa watershed in Ethiopia. In this study, two regional climate models were selected that showed better performance on the evaluation criteria after applying a quantile mapping bias correction procedure. The impact analysis was conducted for two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) (RCP4.5 and RCP 8.5). Drought analysis was performed using the standardized anomalies of rainfall (S-index). The future growing season of the area is projected to be between April 15 and May 1 on average for all years. The total crop water requirement was projected to increase to a value of 3,258.7 mm on average under both the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios for all the stages at the end of 2080s from its baseline value of 3,180.4 mm. In addition, the drought forecast analysis shows extreme drought with S-index values <-1.6 in the 2050s and 2080s under RCP 8.5. Of all the time periods, the 2050s recorded the smallest number of years (10 out of 30 years) with a positive S-index value, indicating projected precipitation shortages during these time periods under RCP 8.5. With this result, the combined impacts of climate change on crop production factors are expected to be high in the region. The results suggest an early warning for the study region considering low economic and technological development as in many developing parts of the world. Therefore, understanding the future changes in climate variables and their impacts can be an important input for developing a better plan for adaptation and mitigation measures.					; Abraham, Tesfalem/GZN-0775-2022	ABRAHAM, TESFALEM/0000-0003-1509-2967; Muluneh, Alemayehu/0009-0002-7192-7965													1178-6221						2022	15									10.1177/11786221221135151	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/11786221221135151													WOS:000904612400005
J	Aljabryn, DH				Aljabryn, Dalal Hamad			Heavy metals in some commercially fishery products marketed in Saudi Arabia	FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Seven major commercially important marine fisheries species, Fenneropenaeus indicus, Chaceon quinquedens, Lethrinus nebulosus, Scomberomorus commerson, Plectropomus pessuliferus, Pampus argenteus, and Epinephelus summana were seasonally sampled from Jeddah main local fisheries market, Saudi Arabia. The heavy metals, namely arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), lead (Pb), nickel (Ni), and zinc (Zn) were assessed. Except for arsenic, the results indicated that the levels of tested heavy elements were within the standard limits. The levels of arsenic were high in F. indicus, C. quinquedens, L. nebulosus, P. pessuliferus and E. summana. In addition, Pb showed higher mean levels of 0.89 +/- 0.14 mg/kg and 5.05 +/- 0.86 mg/kg in S. commerson and P. pessuliferus, respectively, compared to the permissible standard limits. Cd was not found in most samples, except for F. indicus and C. quinquedens where its detected levels exceeded the acceptable standards. Our results may prove the significant roles of seasonal impacts and species variations in the acquisition mechanisms of heavy metals in marine environments. Therefore, the application of a detection program for cumulative residual levels of heavy metals in marine fisheries products is recommended before marketing to ensure the safety of these products.

Acoustic monitoring and occupancy analysis: cost-effective tools in reintroduction programmes for roroa-great spotted kiwi	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Monitoring the response of wildlife populations to conservation management, such as translocations, is crucially important for assessing its effectiveness. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is an emerging tool for monitoring cryptic and elusive species and is increasingly used in the management of kiwi. Inferences from data collected by PAM can be largely improved by occupancy analysis. By modelling occupancy, we overcome the issue of incomplete detectability, which would otherwise lead to underestimating actual site occupancy. Here we demonstrate the utility of occupancy analysis in a reintroduction programme for roroa-great spotted kiwi (Apteryx maxima, formerly known as A. haastii) in the Nina Valley, Lake Sumner Forest Park. We analysed PAM data from two survey years, 2012-2013 and 2017-2018 from the Nina Valley and the Hawdon Valley, Arthur's Pass National Park, which was the source population of the translocated birds. Occupancy estimates increased significantly between the two survey years at both study areas, despite the translocation of approximately 20% of known territorial adults (four pairs) from the Hawdon Valley to the Nina Valley in 2015. Moreover, at least three out of four territories, where adult birds were removed, were re-occupied by new pairs within three years. Site occupancy increased in the Nina Valley from 0.20 (SE 0.10) to 0.72 (0.10), and in the Hawdon Valley from 0.63 (0.10) to 0.95 (0.04). Detectability varied significantly between study areas and was influenced by the length of survey night, breeding/non-breeding season, and also wind speed. The differences between the naive and estimated occupancy values underscore the benefits of occupancy modelling for measuring population response to conservation management. This study highlights the utility of using PAM in monitoring translocation outcomes: to track changes in occupancy and local distribution, as well as assessing impacts on the source population following the birds' removal for translocation.

A comparison of feeding rates between invasive sticklebacks and whitefish	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Invasion of non-native species might alter food web structure and the strength of top-down control within lake ecosystems. As top-down control exerted by fish populations is often dominated by young of the year fish, the impact of new fish species might depend on the feeding rates of the juvenile fish. Here we provide comparative analyses of feeding rates of juvenile whitefish (Coregonus wartmanni) - a native and specialised planktivore and an invasive generalist (sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus). We studied feedings rates of whitefish and sticklebacks in aquaria experiments using 2 cm to 8 cm fish feeding on seven zooplankton species common to Lake Constance. As whitefish hatch several months earlier than sticklebacks, 0+ whitefish are larger than 0+ sticklebacks throughout the year and hence are predicted to have higher feeding rates on especially large zooplankton species. We show that sticklebacks as small as 2 cm were able to feed on the largest zooplankton species of Lake Constance. Further, stickleback feeding rates were similar to both the same size 0+ whitefish and the larger 0+ whitefish co-occurring with smaller 0+ sticklebacks. Hence, 0+ sticklebacks will compete with 0+ whitefish for the same zooplankton species, therefore the invasion of sticklebacks is unlikely to change the relative feeding pressure by individual 0+ fish on zooplankton species.					; Straile, Dietmar/A-4065-2008; Ogorelec, Žiga/HKN-6411-2023	Rudstam, Lars/0000-0002-3732-6368; Straile, Dietmar/0000-0002-7441-8552; Ogorelec, Ziga/0000-0001-7635-0128													2045-7758					JAN	2022	12	1							e8486	10.1002/ece3.8486	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.8486								35127021					WOS:000747845400036
J	Yang, ZW; Chen, KL; Liu, FM; Che, ZH				Yang, Ziwei; Chen, Kelong; Liu, Fumei; Che, Zihan			Effects of Rainfall on the Characteristics of Soil Greenhouse Gas Emissions in the Wetland of Qinghai Lake	ATMOSPHERE												Niaodao, a lakeside wetland, was used as the focus of this study to investigate the effect of rainfall changes on the greenhouse gas fluxes of wetland ecosystems. Wetland plots with different moisture characteristics (+25%, -25%, +75%, and -75% rainfall treatments and the control treatment (CK)) were constructed to observe in situ field greenhouse gas emissions at 11:00 and 15:00 (when the daily mean values were similar) in the growing season from May to August 2020 by static chamber-gas chromatography and to investigate the responses of wetland greenhouse gases to different rainfall treatments. The results showed the following: (1) The carbon dioxide (CO2) flux ranged from -49.409 to 374.548 mg center dot m(-2)center dot h(-1). The mean CO2 emission flux was greater at 11:00 than at 15:00, and the +25% and +75% treatments exhibited substantially higher CO2 emissions. In addition, the CO2 flux showed a small peak at the beginning of the growing season when the temperature first started to rise. All treatments showed the effect of the CO2 source, and their effects were significantly different. (2) The methane (CH4) flux ranged from -213.839 to 330.976 mu g center dot m(-2)center dot h(-1) and exhibited an absorption state at 11:00 and an emission state at 15:00. The CH4 emission flux in August (the peak growing season) differed greatly between treatments and was significantly negatively correlated with the rainfall amount (p < 0.05). (3) The nitrous oxide (N2O) flux ranged from -10.457 to 16.878 mu g center dot m(-2)center dot h(-1) and exhibited a weak source effect throughout the growing season, but it was not significantly correlated with soil moisture; it was, however, negatively correlated with soil temperature. (4) The different treatments resulted in significant differences in soil physical and chemical properties (electrical conductivity, pH, total soil carbon, and total soil nitrogen). The rainfall enhancement treatments significantly improved soil physical and chemical properties.						yang, ziwei/0000-0001-7869-3079														2073-4433				JAN	2022	13	1							129	10.3390/atmos13010129	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13010129													WOS:000758577100001

Linking angling catch rates and fish learning under catch-and-release regulations	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Many recreational fisheries are subject to varying degrees of catch-and-release fishing through regulations and conservation-minded anglers. Clearly, releasing a proportion of the catch improves conservation of the fishery, yet it is not clear how the released catch contributes to angling quality. If fish change their behavior to lower their individual catchability after they have been caught, then angler catch rates may not be proportional to fish density. Therefore, even catch-and-release fisheries could exhibit poor angling quality if there is sufficiently high angler effort. We tested this idea by experimentally fishing five small lakes that contained rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss in the interior of British Columbia. We found that with sustained effort of 8 angler-hours . d(-1) . ha(-1) and complete release of the catch, catch rates quickly dropped within 7-10 d. Given the individual capture histories of tagged fish, the most parsimonious catchability model incorporated learning and heterogeneity into intrinsic catchability. The best-fit parameter values suggest that the population contained a group of highly catchable fish that were quickly caught and then learned to avoid hooks. There was a seasonal decrease in catchability that was independent of angling; however, it was not sufficient to explain the data. Our results indicate that catch rates may decline because of high angling effort even when the number of fish remains constant. Therefore, management goals that go beyond conservation issues and attempt to maximize angler satisfaction must account for effort density on a recreational fishery.

MERCURY TROPHIC TRANSFER IN A EUTROPHIC LAKE: THE IMPORTANCE OF HABITAT-SPECIFIC FORAGING	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Mercury (Hg) trophic transfer and bioaccumulation in fish from a mine-impacted, eutrophic lake were examined in relation to foraging habitat, trophic position, and size. Diet analysis indicated that there were clear ontogenetic shifts in foraging habitats and trophic position. Pelagic diet decreased and benthic diet increased with increasing fish length in bluegill, black crappie, inland silverside, and largemouth bass, whereas there was no shift for prickly sculpin or threadfin shad. Stable carbon isotope values (delta C-13) were inversely related to the proportion of pelagic prey items in the diet, but there was no clear relationship with benthic foraging. There were distinct differences between pelagic and benthic prey basal delta C-13 values, with a range of approximately -28 parts per thousand in pelagic zooplankton to approximately -20 parts per thousand in benthic caddisflies. Profundal prey such as chironomid larvae had intermediate delta C-13 values of approximately -24 parts per thousand, reflecting the influence of pelagic detrital subsidies and suppressing the propagation of the benthic carbon isotope signal up the food chain. Fish total mercury (TotHg) concentrations varied with habitat-specific foraging, trophic position, and size; however, the relationships differed among species and ages. When controlling for the effects of species, length, and trophic position, TotHg and delta C-13 were positively correlated, indicating that Hg trophic transfer is linked to benthic foraging. When examined on a species-specific basis, TotHg was positively correlated with delta C-13 only for bluegill, largemouth bass, and threadfin shad. However, diet-based multiple regression analyses suggested that TotHg also increased with benthic foraging for inland silverside and black crappie. In both species, benthic prey items were dominated by chironomid larvae, explaining the discrepancy with delta C-13. These results illustrate the importance of foraging habitat to Hg bioaccumulation and indicate that pelagic carbon can strongly subsidize the basal energy sources of benthic organisms.					; Eagles-Smith, Collin/T-8580-2019	Eagles-Smith, Collin/0000-0003-1329-5285; 													1051-0761	1939-5582				DEC	2008	18	8			SI		A196	A212		10.1890/06-1476.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/06-1476.1								19475925					WOS:000262606500012

Dissolved organic carbon as a driver of seasonal and multiyear phytoplankton assembly oscillations in a subtropical monomictic lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Phytoplankton assembly dynamics in lakes are highly sensitive to variability in climate drivers and resulting physicochemical changes in lake water columns. As climate change increases the frequency of major precipitation events and droughts, many lakes experience increased inputs of colored dissolved organic carbon (CDOC) and nutrients. How these CDOC-related changes in resources, transparency, and thermal stability affect phytoplankton assemblages, succession, and resilience is understudied, particularly in subtropical lakes. Here, we used time series, multivariate, and trait-based functional redundancy analyses to elucidate the roles of phytoplankton in ecosystem resilience and determine potential drivers of assemblage shifts in a subtropical monomictic lake with fluctuating CDOC inputs (Lake Annie, Highlands County, Florida, USA). We found that phytoplankton assemblages and successional patterns differed between two dark-water states (late 2005-mid-2007, late 2012-2019) bracketing a clear-water state (mid-2007-late 2012), caused by shifting CDOC and nutrient concentrations associated with oscillating groundwater levels. Diatoms (Bacillariophyta), which were dominant during the two dark-water states, nearly disappeared and were replaced by synurophytes during the clear-water state. Assemblages had greater interannual consistency in the dark-water states, while mean functional redundancy decreased in the clear-water state. Seasonal phytoplankton successional changes were also more pronounced and synchronized with seasonal hydrologic shifts in the dark-water states. Multiyear assemblage shifts occurred more quickly in clear-to-dark than dark-to-clear state transitions, suggesting phytoplankton in dark-water states may be more resistant to state transitions or even contribute to dark-water state resilience via feedback loops.					; Gaiser, Evelyn/ABG-2507-2020	Gaiser, Evelyn/0000-0003-2065-4821; Swain, Hilary/0000-0001-7291-2218; Sullivan, Kristy/0000-0003-1139-1222; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				FEB	2022	67			1	SI		S416	S429		10.1002/lno.12004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.12004		DEC 2021											WOS:000735411700001

Among the 418 patients admitted to medical clinics due to arthropod bites in the years 2003-2005, 184 people (44%) had been bitten by ticks. As shown by the research, high-risk groups include people whose stay in tick habitats is connected with their occupational work (54.5%) as well as recreation and tourism (45.5%). As many as 78.7% of the patients were attacked by Ixodes ricinus ticks in forests, and much fewer (31.3%) in other habitats located in urban and rural areas. In one case, a Dermacentor reticulatus female was attached to the skin. Ticks were most commonly located on the upper (28.8%) and lower (27.2%) extremities, and on the abdomen (15.8%). Local skin reactions (57.6%) with predominance of erythema were the most prevalent. Combined local and systemic symptoms were reported less frequently (20.1%). The general symptoms were headache (10.8% of patients), fever (5.4%), lymphadenitis (5.9%) and arthralgia (4.3%). No lesions produced by tick bites were reported in 22.3% of the patients. Field studies conducted in 2003-2004 demonstrated that I. ricinus is a common species in the southern part of the Lublin province, where the density of nymphs and adult forms in various localities during the period of peak seasonal activity (in May) ranges from 18.5-26 specimens/I h of collection. Two tick species, I. ricinus and D. reticulatus, occur in the northern part of the province. The density of I. ricinus nymphs and adult forms as well as D. reticulatus adults is in the range of 2.5-42 specimens/1 hr of collection and 19.5-64.0 speciments/1 hr of collection, respectively. Due to the high risk of tick attacks in the study area, there arises the necessity to permanent the monitoring of ticks numbers and tick-borne diseases.					; Sitarz, Monika/GOE-4909-2022; Sitarz, Monika/ABE-9311-2022	Buczek, Alicja/0000-0001-8032-9495; Szymanska, Jolanta/0000-0002-9917-2907; Sitarz, Monika/0000-0001-9884-3142; Bartosik, Katarzyna/0000-0002-4527-9012													1232-1966	1898-2263					2011	18	1					151	157											21736280					WOS:000292436800022

Flood inundation mapping helps us to better understand the variation in flooding and its impact on dynamic coupled human and natural systems in the Logone floodplain. We generated flood maps from 33 multi-temporal Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images acquired during three years from 2006 to 2008. Flooded area is classified using a short-wave infrared band whereas open water is classified by Iterative Self-organizing Data Analysis (ISODATA) clustering. The maximum flooding area in the Logone floodplain reached up to similar to 5.8 K km(2) in late October 2008. A second polynomial regression model showed a strong correlation between the flooding areas and water height variations in both the floodplain and the Logone River. The water heights stem from ENVISAT altimetry in the floodplain and gauge measurements in the river. Coefficients of determination between flooding areas and water height variations are greater than 0.91 with 4-36 days in time lag between the two measurements.

The movement of pre-adapted cool taxa in north-central Amazonia during the last glacial	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The effects of climate change on the lowland vegetation of Amazonia during the last glacial cycle are partially known for the middle and late Pleniglacial intervals (late MIS 3, 59-24 ka and MIS 2, 24-11 ka), but are still unclear for older stages of the last glacial and during the last interglacial. It is known that a more seasonal dry-wet climate caused marginal forest retraction and together with cooling rearranged forest composition to some extent. This is observed in pollen records across Amazonia depicting presence of taxa at glacial times in localities where they do not live presently. The understanding of taxa migration is hindered by the lack of continuous interglacial-glacial lowland records. We present new data from a known locality in NW Amazonia (Six Lakes Hill), showing a vegetation record that probably started during MIS 5 (130-71 ka) and lasted until the onset of the Holocene. The vegetation record unravels a novel pattern in tree taxa migration: (1) from the beginning of this cycle Podocarpus and Myrsine are recorded and (2) only later do Hedyosmum and Alnus appear. The latter group is largely restricted to montane biomes or more distant locations outside Amazonia, whereas the first is found in lowlands close to the study site on sandy soils. These findings imply that Podocarpus and Myrsine responded to environmental changes equally and this reflects their concomitant niche use in NW Amazonia. Temperature drop is not discarded as a trigger of internal forest composition change, but its effects are clearer later in the Pleniglacial rather than the Early Glacial. Therefore early climatic/environmental changes had a first order effect on vegetation that invoke alternative explanations. We claim last glacial climate-induced modifications on forest composition favoured the expansion of geomorphologic-soil related processes that initiated forest rearrangement. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

River level fluctuations influenced the lake water level. The study investigated the abundance, biomass, species composition, and functional groups of phytoplankton. The observations were made for four years during the growing season at two-week intervals. We identified a total of 304 taxa of algae. Species with the highest biomass belonged to 16 functional groups (FGs). Although the trophic state of the lake did not change (eutrophy), dominant algal species varied between stages. During limnophase the phytoplankton was dominated by coccal chlorophytes, mainly from FG J, while during potamophase, by centric diatoms from FG C and D (mainly by Cyclotella nieneghiniana, Actinocyclus normanii and Stephanodiscus hantzschii). Our results indicate that hydrological conditions affect the water transparency as well as the predominance of certain algal species in the oxbow lake, periodically connected with the river.

The hypothesis that subsoil pedoclimatic factors (soil moisture and soil temperature) and nutrients (extractable N-NH4+, N-NO3-, DON, DOC, N-micr and C-micr) can differ significantly from those of the topsoil was tested for 3 snow-free seasons at 3 study sites (site 1, 3 and 5) in the alpine tundra of the NW Italian Alps. In addition, the intraseasonal variability of both topsoil and subsoil extractable N and C forms was checked monthly from July to October, and they were related to those measured in the surface water of an alpine lake (Cimalegna Lake). The soil moisture did not show significant differences between topsoil and subsoil, with the exception of site 5, and was strictly correlated with the N and C forms studied at both soil depths, except for N-NO3-. The soil temperature was always slightly higher in the topsoil than in the subsoil, due to the incident solar irradiance, and was positively correlated with topsoil DON and C-micr, At all study sites, N-NH4+ and N-NO3- showed no significant differences between topsoil and subsoil, while subsoil DON, DOC, N-micr, and C-micr, significantly differed from those in the topsoil, especially at site 5. Only N-NO3- had a significant intraseasonal variability reaching the highest values in October at both soil depths, mainly due to the end of the plants growing season. The temporal variation of N-NO3- concentration observed in the lake strictly reflects the temporal changes occurred in the soils underling the fundamental role of soil biocenosis in limiting leaching losses of nitrates.

Landsat imagery reveals declining clarity of Maine's lakes during 1995-2010	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Water clarity is a strong indicator of regional water quality. Unlike other common water-quality metrics, such as chlorophyll a, total P, or trophic status, clarity can be accurately and efficiently estimated remotely on a regional scale. Satellite-based remote sensing is useful in regions with many lakes where traditional field-sampling techniques may be prohibitively expensive. Repeated sampling of easily accessed lakes can lead to spatially irregular, nonrandom samples of a region. Remote sensing remedies this problem. We applied a remote monitoring protocol we had previously developed for Maine lakes >8 ha based on Landsat satellite data recorded during 1995-2010 to identify spatial and temporal patterns in Maine lake clarity. We focused on the overlapping region of Landsat paths 11 and 12 to increase availability of cloud-free images in August and early September, a period of relative lake stability and seasonal poor-clarity conditions well suited for annual monitoring. We divided Maine into 3 regions (northeastern, south-central, western) based on morphometric and chemical lake features. We found a general decrease in average statewide lake clarity from 4.94 to 4.38 m during 1995-2010. Water clarity ranged from 4 to 6 m during 1995-2010, but it decreased consistently during 2005-2010. Clarity in both the northeastern and western lake regions has decreased from 5.22 m in 1995 to 4.36 and 4.21 m, respectively, in 2010, whereas lake clarity in the south-central lake region (4.50 m) has not changed since 1995. Climate change, timber harvesting, or watershed morphometry may be responsible for regional water-clarity decline. Remote sensing of regional water clarity provides a more complete spatial perspective of lake water quality than existing, interest-based sampling. However, field sampling done under existing monitoring programs can be used to calibrate accurate models designed to estimate water clarity remotely.																			2161-9549	2161-9565				SEP	2013	32	3					741	752		10.1899/12-070.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1899/12-070.1													WOS:000322828300005

Acoustic surveys conducted during the stratified and isothermal periods on tropical Lake Victoria indicated that stratification of temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) affected vertical distribution of Nile perch. There was higher mean temperature (25.6 +/- 0.5 C) and lower DO (6.4 +/- 1.8 mg/l) during stratified period compared to the isothermal period (mean temperature 24.9 +/- 0.3 degrees C; mean DO 73 +/- 0.6 mg/l). Higher mean densities of Nile perch were recorded in the coastal (0.44 +/- 0.03) and deep (0.27 +/- 0.02 g/m(3)) strata during the stratified compared to the isothermal season (coastal: 0.24 +/- 0.01; deep: 0.12 +/- 0.02 g/m(3)). In addition, Nile perch density in the upper 0-40 m depth layers in the coastal and deep strata increased by over 50% from the isothermal to the stratified season. Daily landings from 65 motorised fishing boats between October 2008 and September 2010 show higher mean catch (26.29 +/- 0.17 kg/boat/day) during stratified compared to the isothermal (23.59 +/- 0.15) season. Thermal stratification apparently compresses the habitat available to Nile perch and can potentially result in higher exploitation. Managers should evaluate the potential benefits of instituting closed seasons during the stratified period, and stock assessment models should take into account the seasonal niche compression.

Empirical evidence of alternative stable states in an estuary	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Due to human activity, ecosystems are exceeding their ecological thresholds and shifting into undesired alternative stable states with new ecological configurations. Despite their purported ubiquity, it is uncertain whether estuaries can exist in multiple stable states. We use data from a 3.5-year study of invertebrate communities in an Australian estuary that is usually closed to the ocean to test for their existence. Sampling spanned a 1.5-year period of hypersalinity (>40 ppt) during a prolonged estuary closure, where salinity reached 122 ppt, and for two years during and after the estuary opened to the ocean when salinities were mesohaline (5-19 ppt). Two distinct community states occurred before and after the sandbar breached, with an intermediary period of invertebrate community impoverishment due to sediment scouring. During the closure, the community was simple (average of one taxa 100 cm(-2)) and dominated by larvae of terrestrial insects, most notably the halotolerant, non-biting midge Tanytarsus barbitarsis. After opening, the richness and abundance of invertebrates increased (average of four taxa and 84 individuals 100 cm(-2)) as polychaetes, molluscs and crustaceans colonised the estuary, although recovery was incomplete according to previous species records. Duration of estuary closure and salinity were the strongest drivers of composition. This study, together with evidence from the literature, suggests a salinity threshold of 60-65 ppt between states. These empirical data meet key criteria of alternative states, i.e. a clear transition between two distinct self-sustaining communities, indicating a regime shift triggered by an exogenous event. Our findings suggest that temporarily open and closed estuaries can exist in alternative stable states, with prolonged closures, hypersalinity, and sandbar breaching being key determinants of the switch between states. This situation may apply to other low-inflow estuarine systems, particularly in arid, semi-arid, or seasonally arid climates, and may become more frequent with human-induced climate change.

Here, we explored the characteristics of N2O concentrations and emissions from various typical ponds (village, tea, forested, and aquaculture ponds) in a hilly watershed and examined the specific controls influencing N2O production. Our findings revealed that tea ponds exhibited the highest N2O flux (8.42 +/- 8.23 mu mol m(-2) d(-1)), which was 2.8 to 3.3 times greater than other types of ponds. Remarkable seasonal variations were observed in tea and forested ponds due to the seasonality of nutrient-enriched runoff, whereas such variations were less pronounced in village and aquaculture ponds. Key factors such as nitrogen levels, temperature, and dissolved oxygen (DO) emerged as the primary controls of N2O concentrations in ponds, heavily influenced by land use and human activities in their drainage areas. Specifically, N2O production in tea and aquaculture ponds was driven by N inputs from fertilization and feed, respectively, while DO levels governed the process in village and forested ponds, influenced by abundant algae and forest vegetation. This study emphasizes that environmental factors predominantly drive N2O production in ponds within hilly watersheds, but land use in the pond drainages acts as an indirect yet crucial influence. This highlights the need for future research to develop targeted emission reduction strategies based on land use to effectively mitigate N2O emissions, promising a path toward more sustainable and climate- friendly watershed management.

Therefore, an innovative approach to assess the risk of nitrogen loss to surface waters from crop production at the watershed scale was established, with nitrogen surplus, a more accurate indicator, as a major source factor introduced to the traditional index method. Furthermore, this approach was applied in the Baiyangdian Lake Watershed, a typically agricultural-dominated watershed in China, and the control strategies for farmland nitrogen loss reduction were investigated with scenario analysis. The major results included: (1) Areas with high (2-4 for risk to river, 1.6-3.2 for risk to lake) and very high (>4 for risk to river, >3.2 for risk to lake) risks of nitrogen loss in crop production were relatively small. For example, in the wheat-maize rotation system, these areas accounted for only 2.1-3.5 % and 0.9-1.8% of the total study area, respectively. Additionally, the critical source areas of nitrogen loss were concentrated around the receiving water bodies. (2) The nitrogen surplus in wheat season increased the nitrogen loss to surface waters. Compared to the maize season, the area with high and very high risk for nitrogen loss to the nearby river in wheat-maize rotation system increased by 58.3% and 141.4%. Furthermore, the areas with high and very high risk for nitrogen loss to the lake in wheat- maize rotation system were 129.6% and 220.6% more than that during maize season. (3) Nitrogen loss risk to the nearby rivers was correlated with nitrogen surplus, but nitrogen loss risk to the lake was related to the transport coefficient. (4) The optimized scenario for nitrogen loss reduction in crop production was the combination of nitrogen surplus being less than 20 kg/ha and 500 m banning area around the river with no fertilizer application, which reduced the nitrogen loss risk to the nearby river and to the lake by 94-95% and 89-95%. The results of this a scientific basis for nutrient resource and non source control.

Moisture source temperatures and precipitation δ18O-temperature relationships across the United States	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Understanding and modeling precipitation isotope (delta O-18 and delta D) patterns for large regions of the globe requires quantifying processes governing continental-scale climatology and hydrology. In this study, we have evaluated the extent to which inclusion of monthly moisture source temperature and moisture source locations in the Rayleigh distillation model aid in reproducing the relationships between monthly time series of precipitation isotope (delta O-18) values and temperature across the contiguous United States. The steepest isotope-temperature slopes (0.5%-0.6% delta O-18/degrees C) and greatest delta O-18 value correlations with temperature (r(2) = 0.5-0.8), derived from 5 continuous years of the data from the United States Network for Isotopes in Precipitation, occurred in the high altitudes of the Rocky Mountains and the upper Great Lakes region. The isotope-temperature slopes derived from the site-specific time series were consistently lower along the coastal regions of the United States as were the coefficients of determination. The low coastal isotope-temperature slopes are not easily explained by the simple Rayleigh model that uses condensation temperatures as the primary driver of precipitation isotopes. However, the Raleigh model equipped with moisture source temperatures defined by seasonal temperature oscillations and migrating moisture source locations provides a robust replication of the delta O-18-temperature slopes along coastal regions. These findings emphasize the importance of moisture sources conditions when interpreting palaeoclimate proxies (i.e., tree rings, ice cores, etc.), and argue that moisture source dynamics should always be included in models that use isotopes as diagnostic tools in testing hydrologic models.

However, the abstraction amount and its impact are not well understood. In this study, a new methodological approach was utilized to estimate the irrigation water abstraction amount, which is based on groundwater level monitoring before, during, and at the end of the irrigation season (2021/2022). The monitoring was conducted on 361 hand-dug wells distributed throughout the sub-basin, which is subdivided into East, Southwest, and North zones. New hydrological insights for the region: Groundwater abstraction for irrigation and associated groundwater level decline estimates are 10.6 x 106 m3 and 2.43 m in the East, 4.2 x 106 m3 and 3.23 m in the Southwest, and 0.6 x 106 m3 and 1.32 m in the North. These abstractions account for 103%, 97%, and 62% of the mean annual groundwater recharge in the East, Southwest, and North zones, respectively. Groundwater is overexploited in the East and Southwest zones although, at the sub-basin scale, the amount of groundwater used for irrigation is small compared to the renewable groundwater resource. However, if groundwater-based irrigation continues to expand especially in the East and Southwest zones, groundwater scarcity at the local scales will worsen. Adaptive management strategies are required to minimize the potential adverse effects on groundwater resources.

In our study, we observed variations in wetland soil fauna on the shores of Lake Taihu, China. We examined the relationships between fauna and major environmental factors, and looked at the short-and long-term changes in reed wetlands under restoration and in the natural reed lakeshore. Outcomes: We identified 93 groups of soil fauna in different wetlands and found significant differences in the lakeshore wetlands' soil fauna assemblages, depending on the length of the restoration period. By analyzing the soil fauna community evenness, dominance, number of taxa, and diversity, we found minimal seasonal variation in the soil fauna community diversity and abundance. The abundance of soil fauna in the sites under restoration decreased with depth below the soil surface. The reed restoration was obvious in the succession of the soil fauna groups in the long-term site. Although the restoration had an overall positive long-term effect on the soil fauna communities, there were no obvious short-term changes in the number of individuals. Conclusion: The study explored various potential measures to restore soil fauna in the Lake Taihu wetland and developed a theoretical basis for restoring the lakeshore wetland ecosystem.					cui, lijuan/AAX-7996-2021; Dou, Zhiguo/AAX-8059-2021; Zhang, Manyin/AAK-5171-2020; Pan, Xu/W-1607-2017	Dou, Zhiguo/0000-0001-8031-4330; LI, WEI/0000-0002-2133-9287													2096-4129	2332-8878				DEC 16	2020	6	1							1722034	10.1080/20964129.2020.1722034	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20964129.2020.1722034													WOS:000514379300001

Studying LoCo over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is of great significance for understanding the TP's role in the Asian water tower. A series of real-case simulations, using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with different combinations of land surface model (LSM) schemes and PBL schemes, has been carried out to investigate the LoCo characteristics over a typical underlying surface in the central TP in the rainy season. The LoCo characteristics in the study area are analyzed by applying a mixing diagram to the simulation results. The analysis indicates that the WRF simulations, using the Noah with BouLac, Mellor-Yamada Nakanishi and Niino Level-2.5 PBL (MYNN), and Yonsei University (YSU) produce closer results to the observation in terms of curves of C-p . theta and L-v.q, surface fluxes (H-sfc and LEsfc), entrainment fluxes (H-ent, and LEent) at site BJ of Nagqu Station (BJ/Nagqu) than those using the Community Land Model (CLM) with BouLac, MYNN, and YSU. The frequency distributions of H-sfc, LEsfc, H-ent, and LEent in the study area confirm this result. The spatial distributions of simulated H-sfc, LEsfc, H-ent, and LEent, using WRF with Noah and BouLac, suggest that the spatial distributions of H-sfc and LEsfc in the study area are consistent with that of soil moisture, but the spatial distributions of H-ent and LEent are quite different from that of soil moisture. A close examination of the relationship between entrainment fluxes and cloud water content (Q(Cloud)) reveals that the grids with small H-ent and large LEent tend to have high Q(Cloud) and H-sfc, suggesting that high H-sfc is conducive to convective cloud formation, which leads to small H-ent and large LEent. A sensitivity analysis of LoCo to the soil moisture at site BJ/Nagqu indicates that, on a sunny day, an increase in soil moisture leads to an increase in LEsfc but decreases in H-sfc, H-ent, and LEent. The sensitivity of the relationship between simulated maximum daytime PBL height (PBLH) and mean daytime evapotranspiration (ET) in the study area to soil moisture indicates the rate at which the maximum daytime PBLH decreases with the mean ET increase as the initial soil moisture goes up. The analysis of simulated H-sfc, LEsfc, H-ent, and LEent under different soil moisture conditions reveals that the frequency of H-ent ranging from 80 to 240 W m(-2) and the frequency of LEent ranging from -240 to -90 W m(-2) both increase as the initial soil moisture increases. Coupled with the changes in Q(Cloud), the changes in H-ent and LEent as the initial soil moisture increases indicate that the rise in soil moisture leads to an increase in the cloud amount but a decrease in Q(Cloud).

However, the mechanisms by which environmental heterogeneity influences microbial community structure, network patterns, and interactions remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we collected 84 water samples from four typical lakes in China (Fuxian, Tianmu, Taihu, and Xingyun) representing a range of trophic levels, across wet and dry seasons. We assessed environmental heterogeneity using 14 water quality parameters, analyzed community structure with Jaccard and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity indices, and developed a comprehensive index to elucidate microbial network complexity. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Environmental heterogeneity was significantly greater in dry season compared to wet season across all lakes (P < 0.05). (2) Increased environmental heterogeneity led to higher bacterioplankton community dissimilarity, with greater beta-diversity observed in dry season (P < 0.05). (3) Shifts in community structure due to increased environmental heterogeneity further enhanced microbial interactions, as evidenced by more complex and interconnected co-occurrence networks in the dry season. In summary, our study demonstrates that environmental heterogeneity significantly impacts bacterioplankton community structure and subsequently enhances microbial interactions. These findings underscore the importance of considering environmental heterogeneity in lake ecosystem management, as it plays a crucial role in regulating microbial community dynamics and interactions.

Effects of fisheries zoning and environmental characteristics on population parameters of the tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) in managed floodplain lakes in the Central Amazon	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												Fisheries zoning and the influence of biotic and abiotic factors in the spatial distribution of Colossoma macropomum (Cuvier) in the Piagacu-Purus Sustainable Development Reserve, Central Amazon, during 2012-2013 were evaluated. The relative abundance and population parameters of the C.macropomum were compared between conservation (no-take zone) and fishing (open to fishing zone) lakes. The fish were collected by experimental fishing in 2012 and 2013. A total of 296 individuals were captured, most of which were from the conservation lakes (62.8%). Higher proportions of larger adults and individuals were found in the conservation lakes, although no significant difference in the average C.macropomum catch-per-unit-effort was found between the lake categories. Abundance was positively influenced by zooplankton density (r(2)=0.53, P<0.03). Therefore, it is hypothesised that conservation lakes may serve as refugia for juveniles due to the high availability of planktonic food available during the dry season. Although there were environmental differences between the two lake types, the relative success of management models that use no-take zones in freshwater habitats was highlighted. Finally, the importance of zooplankton as a factor in the distribution of C.macropomum among floodplain lakes was emphasised.

Hepatic transcript levels for vitellogenin (Vtg), zona pellucida (ZP) and ER alpha (also in gonads) were analyzed using real-time PCR. Plasma estradiol-17 beta (E2), testosterone (T) and 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) were analyzed using enzyme immunoassay. Gonadal aromatase and hepatic testosterone metabolism (6 beta-hydroxylase (6 beta-OHase)) were analyzed using biochemical methods. Overall, there is high and abnormal number (%) of infertile and banded eggs during the studied reproductive seasons, showing up to 57 and 34% of infertile eggs in the 2009/2010 and 2013/2014 seasons, respectively. In addition, the percentage of banded eggs ranged between 10 and 19% during the period of 2009-2014 seasons. While hepatic ER alpha, Vtg, ZP mRNA and testosterone 6 beta-OHase, were equally expressed in female and male crocodiles, gonadal ER alpha mRNA and aromatase activity were significantly higher in females compared to male crocodiles. On the other hand, plasma T and 11-KT levels were significantly higher in males, compared to female crocodiles. Principal component analysis (PCA) produced significant grouping that revealed correlative relationships between reproductive/endocrine-disruptive variables and liver contaminant burden, that further relates to measured contaminants in the natural environment. The overall results suggest that these captive pre-slaughter farm crocodiles exhibited responses to anthropogenic aquatic contaminants with potentially relevant consequences on key reproductive and endocrine pathways and these responses may be established as relevant species endocrine disruptor biomarkers of exposure and effects in this threatened species.

The under-ice soundscape in Great Slave Lake near the city of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Most recent research and monitoring of under-water "soundscapes" has focused on marine systems in open water conditions. Here we present the first long-term assessment of the diel and seasonal patterns of a freshwater aquatic soundscape under-ice cover. Acoustic data recorded in Yellowknife Bay, Great Slave Lake in Canada's Northwest Territories, measured the under-ice soundscape near an ice road and airport. From December to late January, the soundscape consisted of geophony from ice cracking and anthrophony from snowmobiles, aircraft, and road vehicles. In late January, burbot spawning calls began and added a localized biophony source to the soundscape that increased the total sound pressure level due to an increase in sound levels in the 10-425 Hz frequency band. The median 1 min root-mean-square sound pressure level (rms SPL) in the period without burbot biophony was 903 dB re 1 mu Pa. The measured hourly rms SPL was negatively correlated with air temperature in the 200-800 Hz band but positively correlated with average hourly wind speed in the 800-8000 Hz band. The nightly mean rms SPL was 88 dB re 1 mu Pa and increased to 96 dB re 1 mu Pa in late afternoon. This diel cycle had a strong positive correlation with the number of minutes per hour where ice-road vehicles were detected. Further work is recommended to quantify the soundscape in deep-water areas of large lakes and to include particle motion. Such information will enable the assessment of cumulative impacts of anthrophony and geophony on aquatic biota. (C) 2015 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Variability of rainfall over Lake Kariba catchment area in the Zambezi river basin, Zimbabwe	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												In this study, average monthly and annual rainfall totals recorded for the period 1970 to 2010 from a network of 13 stations across the Lake Kariba catchment area of the Zambezi river basin were analyzed in order to characterize the spatial-temporal variability of rainfall across the catchment area. In the analysis, the data were subjected to intervention and homogeneity analysis using the Cumulative Summation (CUSUM) technique and step change analysis using rank-sum test. Furthermore, rainfall variability was characterized by trend analysis using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall statistic. Additionally, the rainfall series were decomposed and the spectral characteristics derived using Cross Wavelet Transform (CWT) and Wavelet Coherence (WC) analysis. The advantage of using the wavelet-based parameters is that they vary in time and can therefore be used to quantitatively detect time-scale-dependent correlations and phase shifts between rainfall time series at various localized time-frequency scales. The annual and seasonal rainfall series were homogeneous and demonstrated no apparent significant shifts. According to the inhomogeneity classification, the rainfall series recorded across the Lake Kariba catchment area belonged to category A (useful) and B (doubtful), i.e., there were zero to one and two absolute tests rejecting the null hypothesis (at 5 % significance level), respectively. Lastly, the long-term variability of the rainfall series across the Lake Kariba catchment area exhibited non-significant positive and negative trends with coherent oscillatory modes that are constantly locked in phase in the Morlet wavelet space.

While a large number of modern pollen assemblages exist from Yunnan Province, SW China, few are derived from lake surface sediments with depositional environments similar to those of fossil pollen records. In this study, we present modern pollen assemblages from lake surface sediments across 36 lakes in Yunnan, spanning spatially from the southeast to the northwest of the region. These lakes encompass a range of vegetation types, varying from alpine meadow grasslands to tropical seasonal and montane rainforests. Our findings demonstrate that modern pollen assemblages from lake surface sediments can effectively identify various vegetation zones. Redundancy analysis (RDA) reveals a strong correlation of pollen assemblages with climate factors (e.g., temperature and precipitation) but a weak correlation with human activities. This study suggests that modern pollen assemblages from lake surface sediments in Yunnan can be used not only to reflect changes in vegetation and climate, but also as reliable indicators for reconstructing the history of human activities to some extent.																			0034-6667	1879-0615				DEC	2024	331								105205	10.1016/j.revpalbo.2024.105205	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.revpalbo.2024.105205		SEP 2024											WOS:001321168900001
J	Mary, AK; Gomes, C				Mary, Ahurra Kulyaka; Gomes, Chandima			Lightning safety of under-privileged communities around Lake Victoria	GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK												This is one of the first studies on lightning incidents that take place in the neighbourhood of Lake Victoria, the largest tropical lake in the world that borders Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya. Lightning accident statistics in the region have been documented segment wise. The number of lightning occurrences in the north-western shore and that in the north-eastern shore were compared. The region has a distinctly recognizable season with high lightning accident density which runs from May to November and low lightning accident period from December to April. August peaks in lightning incidents. Lightning-related incidents are very much prevalent during the period between May and August due to the dominant south easterlies. The study reveals that the north-western part has slightly higher lightning accidents than the north-eastern part. North-eastern part records relatively high number of lightning accidents in the morning hours whereas the north-western sector experiences the same in the afternoon hours. Many features of lightning accidents and their locations have features that are in agreement with the same observed in other parts of East Africa. Following the statistics collected and incidents observed, suitable safety measures have been recommended for the communities that reside in the shores and nearby areas of Lake Victoria.

We studied the migratory Kentish Plover, Charadrius alexandrinus, which breeds in coastal northern/central China and the inland Qinghai Lake, and the White-faced Plover C. dealbatus, a year-round resident of coastal southern China. We measured total mercury (THg) concentrations in feather and blood samples of breeding females. We expected low levels at the remote Qinghai Lake, but we found instead that feather THg concentrations were highest there (3.89 +/- 1.53 [SD] mu g/gDW[n = 34]; compared to 1.29 +/- 0.61 mu g/g of Kentish Plover elsewhere [n = 35] and 2.08 +/- 1.45 mu g/g for White-faced Plover [n = 56]), a result is consistent over 2 years. When including only coastal populations in the analysis, there were no differences in THg concentrations between the two species, although White-faced Plover had more variation. Feather THg concentrations for the coastal populations are similar to other studies on plovers and sandpipers globally, with most birds under the threshold of adverse effects (3 mu g/g, an estimate that itself may be too low). Nevertheless, the Qinghai Kentish Plover population has mean feather concentrations above this threshold, indicating high exposure during the nonbreeding season, and some individuals have extreme values (e.g., a bird with a blood level of 7.63 mu g/g DW from Zhanjiang, south China), so further research and monitoring are needed.

Temporal coherence among tropical coastal lagoons: a search for patterns and mechanisms	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												Temporal coherence (ie the degree of synchronicity of a given variable among ecological units within a predefined space) has been shown for several limnological features among temperate lakes, allowing predictions about the structure and function of ecosystems However, there is little evidence of temporal coherence among tropical aquatic systems, where the climatic variability among seasons is less pronounced Here, we used data from long-term monitoring of physical chemical and biological variables to test the degree of temporal coherence among 18 tropical coastal lagoons The water temperature and chlorophyll-a concentration had the highest and lowest temporal coherence among the lagoons respectively whereas the salinity and water colour had intermediate temporal coherence The regional climactic factors were the main factors responsible for the coherence patterns in the water temperature and water colour, whereas the landscape position and morphometric characteristics explained much of the variation of the salinity and water colour among the lagoons These results indicate that both local (lagoon morphometry) and regional (precipitation) air temperature) factors regulate the physical and chemical conditions of coastal lagoons by adjusting the terrestrial and marine subsidies at a landscape-scale On the other hand the chlorophyll a concentration appears to be primarily regulated by specific local conditions resulting in a weak temporal coherence among the ecosystems We concluded that temporal coherence in tropical ecosystems is possible, at least for some environmental features and should be evaluated for other tropical ecosystems Our results also reinforce that aquatic ecosystems should be studied more broadly to accomplish a full understanding of their structure and function					Guariento, Rafael/Q-3602-2019; Pires, Aliny/Z-2023-2019; Farjalla, Vinicius/G-4945-2010; Quesado, Leticia/L-3110-2013; Marinho, Carolina/B-1867-2013; Carneiro, Luciana/A-8675-2008; Suhett, Albert/J-5454-2014; Farjalla, Vinicius/V-4351-2019; Santangelo, Jayme/B-5922-2011; Caliman, Adriano/A-8668-2008; Bozelli, Reinaldo/S-6414-2019	P.

Process-based forecasts of lake water temperature and dissolved oxygen outperform null models, with variability over time and depth	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Near-term iterative ecological forecasting has great potential for providing new insights into our ability to predict multiple ecological variables. However, true, out-of-sample probabilistic forecasts remain rare, and variability in forecast performance has largely been unexamined in process-based forecasts which predict multiple ecosystem variables. To explore how forecast performance varies for water temperature and dissolved oxygen, two freshwater variables important for lake ecosystem functioning, we produced probabilistic forecasts at multiple depths over two open-water seasons in Lake Sunapee, NH, USA. Our forecasting system, FLARE (Forecasting Lake And Reservoir Ecosystems), uses a 1-D coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical process model, which we assessed relative to both climatology and persistence null models to quantify how much information process-based FLARE forecasts provide over null models across varying environmental conditions. We found that FLARE water temperature forecasts were always more skillful than FLARE oxygen forecasts. Specifically, temperature forecasts outperformed both null models up to 11 days into the future, as compared to only two days for oxygen. Across different years, we observed variable forecast skill, with performance generally decreasing with depth for both variables. Overall, all temperature forecasts and surface oxygen, but not deep oxygen, forecasts were more skillful than at least one null model >80 % of the forecasted period, indicating that our process-based model was able to reproduce the dynamics of these two variables with greater reliability than the null models. However, process-based oxygen forecasts from deeper waters were less skillful than both null models during a majority of the forecasted period, which suggests that deep-water oxygen dynamics are dominated by autocorrelation and seasonal change, which are inherently captured by the null forecasts. Our results highlight that forecast performance varies among lake water quality metrics and that process-based forecasts can provide important information in conjunction with null models in varying environmental conditions. Altogether, these process-based forecasts can be used to develop quantitative tools which inform our understanding of future ecosystem change.

In this study, the spatio-temporal variations in terminal lakes of the lower Heihe River Basin were investigated for the first time since the Ecological Water Diversion Project commenced in 2000. The lake area and corresponding water consumption were determined with 248 Landsat images. Vital recovery of lakes occurred two years after the implementation of the project, and the total lake area increased by 382.6%, from 30.7 to 148.2 km(2), during 2002-2017. East Juyan Lake (EJL) was first restored as a project target and subsequently reached a maximum area of 70.1 km(2). Water dispersion was initiated in 2003, with the East river prioritized for restoration. Swan Lake in the East river enlarged to 67.7 km(2) by 2017, while the other four lakes temporarily existed or maintained an area < 7 km(2), such as West Juyan Lake. Water consumed by lakes increased synchronously with lake area. The average water consumption of the six lakes was 1.03 x 10(8) m(3)/year, with 63% from EJL. The increasing terminal lakes; however, highlight the seasonal competition for water use between riparian vegetation and lake ecosystems in water-limited areas.					; Wang, Ping/ACH-8897-2022; , Ping/ACH-8897-2022	Zhang, Yichi/0000-0002-6990-8055; , Ping/0000-0003-2481-9953														2072-4292				MAY 2	2019	11	10							1164	10.3390/rs11101164	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11101164													WOS:000480524800022

Estimating lake-climate responses from sparse data: An application to high elevation lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Although many studies demonstrate lake warming, few document trends from lakes with sparse data. Diel and seasonal variability of surface temperatures limit conventional trend analyses to datasets with frequent repeated observations. Thus, remote lakes, including many high elevation lakes, are underrepresented in trend analyses. We used a Bayesian technique to analyze sparse data that explicitly incorporated diel and seasonal variability. This approach allowed us to estimate lake warming in a region of limited knowledge: high elevation lakes (> 2100 m ASL) of the Southern Rocky Mountains, U.S.A. The analysis allowed for inclusion of lakes with few repeated measurements, and observations made before 1980 when more intensive lake monitoring began. We accumulated the largest dataset of high elevation lake temperatures analyzed to date. Data from 590 high elevation lakes in the Southern Rocky Mountains showed a 0.13 degrees C decade(-1) increase in surface temperatures and a 14% increase in seasonal degree days since 1955. This result is lower than other regional and global estimates of lake warming; however, it is similar to other high elevation lake studies. Our approach can be applied to other understudied regions, increasing our overall understanding of the effects of climate change on lakes and their temporal dynamics.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				MAY	2019	64	3					1371	1385		10.1002/lno.11121	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11121													WOS:000467593600035

This study aims at establishing a long-term, high-quality, monthly LST dataset within the European Alps reaching back to 1880, which is provided to the scientific community for further research. Therefore monthly temperature records from Austrian lakes covering a period of about six decades are digitized from hydrological yearbooks. Clustering techniques (rotated empirical orthogonal functions and hierarchical cluster analysis) are used to identify groups of lakes signified by inner similarity and outer separation. These are not only used for an overall quality assessment, but also provide optimal starting conditions for the application of a homogenization procedure, warranting homogeneous LST data from 1950 onwards. LST reconstructions back to 1880 are derived from atmospheric covariates (provided by HISTALP) via sets of transfer-functions. Applied transfer-functions have passed a selection process ensuring mathematical, physical and quality requirements. They are selected from about 160 million candidates according to skill, which is determined through a comprehensive assessment based on validation experiments and several performance measures. Results show overall high skill following a seasonal cycle. From 1880 to 1950 LSTs feature generally slight increases accompanied by a succession of climate states. These are in alignment with outstanding climate periods and sustained, far-reaching repercussions triggered by significant events, which are known from historical documents. LST developments throughout the second half of the twentieth century up to date are characterized by a decline until the mid-1980s, indicating the impact of industrial aerosols. This behaviour is superseded by a steep increase, revealing the gradual unmasking of the anthropogenic greenhouse effect by the continuous reduction of aerosol loads in the atmosphere. The latter substantiates man-made climate change, whose prove is based on atmospheric variables by different data pertaining to the hydrosphere. Potential research hypotheses corresponding to various fields of science that may be investigated by using the here established LST dataset are considered. We hope that these data sets and associated findings will make a contribution to the broader research community.					; Schlogl, Matthias/AAE-3266-2022; Schlögl, Matthias/AAE-3266-2022	Chimani, Barbara/0000-0003-0298-4181; Schlogl, Matthias/0000-0002-4357-523X; 													0930-7575	1432-0894				MAY	2019	52	9-10					5673	5689		10.1007/s00382-018-4479-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-018-4479-6													WOS:000465441400033

In turbid rivers, as in other aquatic systems, phytoplankton structure plays an important role in structuring aquatic food webs. Worldwide, phytoplankton is less studied in turbid, large tropical rivers compared to temperate river systems. The present study aimed to describe the phytoplankton diversity and abundance in a turbid tropical river (the Red River, northern part of Vietnam from 20 degrees 00 to 25 degrees 30 North; from 100 degrees 00 to 107 degrees 10 East) and to determine the importance of a series of environmental variables in controlling the phytoplankton community composition. Phytoplankton community was composed of 169 phytoplankton taxa from six algal groups including Bacillariophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Cryptophyceae, Euglenophyceae, Dinophyceae and Cyanobacteria. Community composition varied both spatially and with season. Sixteen measurement environmental variables were used as input variables for a three-layer backpropagation neural network that was developed to predict the phytoplankton abundance. Phytoplankton abundance was successfully predicted using the tagsig transfer function and the Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation algorithm. The network was trained to provide a good overall linear fit to the total data set with a slope (R) and mean square error (MSE) of 0.808 and 0.0107, respectively. The sensitivity analysis and neutral interpretation diagram revealed that total phosphorus (TP), flow discharge, water temperature and P-PO43- were the significant variables. The results showed that the developed ANN model was able to simulate phytoplankton abundance in the Red River. These findings can help for gaining insight into and the relationship between phytoplankton and environmental factors in this complex, turbid, tropical river.					; Bui, Ha/ABA-9312-2021; Nguyen, Nguyen/D-1480-2010; Duong, Thi Thuy/ABA-9024-2021; Kim, Dang/AAT-2975-2020; Rochelle-Newall, Emma/AEU-2465-2022; Lu, Xi/C-5609-2008	Thi Thuy, Duong/0000-0003-1796-3850; Rochelle-Newall, Emma/0000-0003-0951-8650; Hai Van, Dinh Thi/0000-0001-9091-0718; Dang Dinh, Kim/0000-0003-2588-8467; Bui, Ha/0000-0002-0647-3111													0075-9511	1873-5851				MAY	2019	76						82	93		10.1016/j.limno.2019.04.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2019.04.003													WOS:000468883700010

Assessment of Water Quality Parameters in Mangrove Ecosystems Along Kerala Coast: A Statistical Approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Water samples were collected from five selected mangrove ecosystems along Kerala coast, North of Cochin, on seasonal basis and analysed for various hydrographic parameters. To explain spatio-temporal variations and the processes controlling their distribution, ANOVA (two factor without replication), correlation and principal component analysis were carried out. Concentration of total nitrogen varied from 10.26 to 188.38 mu M and total phosphorous from 1.53 to 22.88 mu M, with comparatively higher concentration in monsoon season which could be attributed by land run off. Chlorophyll pigments recorded significant seasonal variation ranging from ND to 40.86 mu g/L (chlorophyll a), ND to 6.00 mu g/L, (Chlorophyll b) and ND to 13.80 mu g/L (Chlorophyll c). Both monsoon and post monsoon seasons recorded higher concentration of pheophytin compared to Chlorophyll a and the maximum concentration of chlorophyll was observed during pre monsoon. Station 2 (Pappinissery) exhibited elevated concentration of nutrients (especially NH4+) and lower DO content which pointed towards the reducing environment by anthropogenic stress. Factor analysis revealed six components which explained 92.77% of the total variance. It also described the processes like diagenesis, sediment remineralisation, anthropogenic activities, tidal and river influx which make the ecosystem highly complex.

During the study period, Ca2+ and HCO (3) (-) have the highest concentrations among ions and are the dominant cation and anion in precipitation, taking 27.46 % and 30.84 % to the total ions respectively. Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) analyses reveal that crustal aerosol inputs significantly contributed to the loading of Ca2+, Mg2+, SO (4) (2-) and HCO (3) (-) in precipitation, while lake salt plays a major source of K+ and Cl-. Seasonal variations of ionic wet deposition fluxes show high values during monsoon seasons due to large precipitation amount. Among the cations, annual Ca2+ flux is the largest (86.26 eq hm(-2)), Na+ and NH (4) (+) fluxes are following. Among anions, HCO (3) (-) has the highest flux (98.66 eq hm(-2)) while that of NO (3) (-) is the lowest. Annual wet deposition of nitrogen has varied considerably with the average value of 0.70 kg ha(-1) a(-1) at Nam Co Station. About 80 % of total nitrogen flux occurs during the monsoon seasons when precipitation is concentrated, in which NH (4) (+) and NO (3) (-) contributed to 61 % and 39 % of the total nitrogen deposition. Thus, our ionic concentrations and wet deposition fluxes in precipitation can provide a useful dataset to assess atmospheric environment and its impacts on ecosystem in the inland TP.					丛, 志远/E-5237-2012; 张, 玉兰/B-4778-2015; Kang, Shichang/I-6830-2018	li, chao liu/0000-0003-2092-2435; Kang, Shichang/0000-0003-2115-9005													0167-7764	1573-0662				SEP	2012	69	3					187	200		10.1007/s10874-012-9236-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10874-012-9236-3													WOS:000309867600001

Furthermore, reservoir fish production could potentially compensate for the loss of fish yields due to habitat fragmentation and alterations caused by damming and impoundment. We monitored primary production, identified environmental factors responsible for its variability, and examined the relationship between primary production and fish production in nine large water bodies of the Lower Mekong Basin for 2 years. The estimated primary production ranged from 40 to 302 g C/m(2)/y and was generally greater in the wet season than in the dry season. Linear mixed-effects modelling identified the concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon as a significant fixed-effect variable regulating primary production, after variability due to random and fixed effects of water body and seasonality, respectively, were taken into account. Fish yields marginally increased with increasing primary production across the water bodies, with the estimated energy transfer efficiency ranging from 0.004 to 0.009. Dissolved inorganic carbon was partly determined by the lithological composition of the water body catchment, suggesting that the geographic locations of proposed dams determine the magnitude of primary production and hence future fish production.

The study uses high-resolution Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission 3B42 V7 satellite estimate for the years 1998-2015. The diurnal signal in the initiation time for the land and the lake shows a difference in amplitude and phase with a peak in the late afternoon to evening over the land and late night to early morning over the lake. The rainfall maximum first appears over the highlands on the northeast of the lake around 1500 local standard time (LST) then intensifies and migrates westwards. Around 0300 LST the rainfall is observed ubiquitously over the lake before localizing in the western half of the lake around 1100 LST. There exists an enhanced rainfall amplitude of about 50% of the daily rainfall mean over the northeastern sector of the basin and the western half of the lake. By comparison, the amplitude of the semi-diurnal cycle is weaker and in the range of 1-30% of the daily mean. Rainfall amount (RA) values are higher over the lake and the highlands on the east of the basin while lower on southeastern and western parts of the basin. The distribution of RA, rainfall intensity (RI) and rainfall frequency revealed high peak of RA over the eastern part of the basin that may be attributed to the high incidence of moderate rainfall. The peak over the western half of the lake may be ascribed to the enhanced RI over the lake.

The results revealed that there was a sharp decline in total culturable fungal abundance between 9 and 11 m lake depth with a concurrent shift in diversity. A total of 29 species were identified from all three water sources with near even distribution between Ascomycota and Basidomycota (15 and 14 respectively). The most abundant taxa isolated from Lake Fryxell in 2008 were Glaciozyma watsonii (59%) followed by Penicillium spp. (10%), both of which were restricted to 9 m and above. Although seven species were found below the chemocline of 11 m in 2008, their abundance comprised only 10% of the total culturable fungi. The taxa of isolates collected from glacial source input streams had little overlap with those found in Lake Fryxell. The results highlight the spatial discontinuities of fungal populations that can occur within connected oligotrophic aquatic habitats.

However, this lake was an iron ore mining site with the remaining contaminants and heavy metal of the lake can harm the people who directly get into contact with the lake water. The present study focused on investigating the phytoremediation potential of locally available floating aquatic plants in the treatment process of water from Tasik Puteri, which was contaminated with mining effluent. The effluent was treated with water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) and water lettuces (Salvinia molesta and Pistia stratiotes) in a constructed wetland for a period of 28 days. The effluent treatment efficiency was determined by measuring the effluent quality over the experimental period. Five water parameters such as the total iron (TI), total phosphorus (TP), chemical oxygen demand (COD), electrical conductivity (EC) and turbidity were examined using standard laboratory procedures. The results indicated that the three plants were able to remove the contaminants. After 28 days, the physical observation shows that the water hyacinth was healthier than the water lettuces. Considerable decrements in concentration were recorded in TI, TP and EC, but fluctuation in COD and turbidity value were observed. Comparison results by the plants indicated that after 28 days, water hyacinth was the most effective plant in removing phosporus, COD and EC of the mining lake with 97.3%, 70.5% and 22.2% removal, respectively. Furthermore, water lettuce (P. stratiotes) was the most effective plant in removing Iron (96.0%) and the turbidity (50.0%) of the mining lake. S. molesta showed the lowest removal capability for all experimental parameters. In conclusion, water hyacinth and water lettuces had shown better capability in removing heavy metals and other contaminants with E. crassipes has the highest survivability in the lake water.

The site has a hummocky terrain and is underlain by clay-rich glacial tills. Though the site is only 4 km(2) it contains hundreds of wetlands containing ponds which range in size, in permanence (from ephemeral to permanent), and in their interactions with groundwater (recharge and discharge ponds are present). The site was established as a research area in 1968 and has long-term records of hydrological observations, including meteorological, snow, soil moisture, surface water (ponds) and groundwater data. Some records, notably the pond level and chemistry data, span the period 1968 to present. Other datasets, notably water level observations from networks of piezometers, have been collected sporadically at different locations and times. Some datasets are collected manually on an annual basis, including pond surveys and snow surveys. Meteorological data have been collected by automatic weather stations since 1989 and have been maintained and upgraded over time, with a flux tower added to the site in 2011. Automatically logged soil moisture profiles and collocated piezometers have been running since 2013. A lidar survey from 2005 provides a 1 m resolution digital elevation map (DEM) of the site and surrounding landscape. The compiled data are available at https://doi.org/10.20383/101.0115 (Bam et al., 2018).

A White Nile megalake during the last interglacial period	GEOLOGY												The eastern Sahara Desert of Africa is one of the most climatically sensitive areas on Earth, varying from lake-studded savannah woodland to hyperarid desert over the course of a glacial-interglacial cycle. In currently semiarid Sudan there is widespread evidence that a very large freshwater lake once filled the White Nile River valley. Here we present the first quantitative estimate for the dimensions of the lake and a direct age for the emplacement of its shoreline. Using a profile dating approach with the cosmogenic nuclide Be-10, we estimate an exposure age of 109 +/- 8 ka for this megalake, indicating that it probably formed during the last interglacial period. This age is supported by optically stimulated luminescence dating of Blue Nile paleochannels associated with the lake. Using a high-resolution digital elevation model, we estimate that the lake was more than 45,000 km(2) in area, making it comparable to the largest freshwater lakes on Earth today. We attribute the lake's existence to seasonal flood pulses as a result of local damming of the White Nile by a more southern position of the Blue Nile and greatly increased precipitation associated with an enhanced monsoon.					; Barrows, Timothy T/E-8471-2011; Tims, Stephen/P-6505-2015; Barrows, Timothy/E-8471-2011; Duller, Geoffrey/AAR-7494-2020; Duller, Geoffrey/D-5110-2015	Williams, Frances/0009-0005-3752-8356; Barrows, Timothy T/0000-0003-2614-7177; Tims, Stephen/0000-0001-6014-0126; Duller, Geoffrey/0000-0002-2694-4590													0091-7613	1943-2682				FEB	2014	42	2					163	166		10.1130/G35238.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/G35238.1													WOS:000333243700020

An Age-Structured Integrated Assessment of Chinook Salmon Population Dynamics in Lake Huron's Main Basin since 1968	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We conducted a statistical catch-at-age (SCAA) assessment, also known as an integrated assessment, of the Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha population in Lake Huron's main basin to describe the dynamics and assess population abundance since the species began being stocked in 1968. The purpose of this assessment was to determine whether recent declines in Chinook salmon recreational harvest were indicative of an overall decrease in population abundance, and to estimate the magnitude of that decline. Data sources integrated into the assessment model included recreational harvest and effort, returns to the Swan River weir by year-class, age composition of recreational harvest (overall and of mature fish), and proportion mature by age. Parameters estimated included time-varying age-0 natural mortality rates and recreational fishing catchabilities, age-specific recreational fishing selectivities, and the parameters of a logistic function relating maturation probability to fish age and weight. The fitted model did a reasonable job of predicting recreational harvest, Swan River weir returns, age composition of recreational harvest, and proportion mature by age. The model predicted that abundance of age-1 and older Chinook salmon has declined by approximately 98% since the mid-1980s, with an estimated abundance of age-1 and older fish of approximately 65,000 in 2009. The primary cause for this decline has been a substantial increase in age-0 natural mortality rates, which peaked at an instantaneous rate of around 6.3 in the late 2000s, although fishing mortality rates have also been quite high. Initially, declines in survival were associated with increases in overall predator abundance in the lake. The most recent and large declines were associated with a decrease in the abundance of alewives Alosa pseudoharengus. We suspect that declines in age-0 survival reflect both direct effects of food limitation and increased predation mortality by larger fish, and are consequences of decreased abundance of other prey fishes.

We present a spatially distributed modelling routine for predicting the location and timing of delivery of surface-derived meltwater to the ice/bed interface through moulins and supraglacial lake drainage. The model is explained as it is applied to the Croker Bay glacial catchment of Devon Ice Cap, Canada. The formation of moulins, drainage of lakes, and the transfer of meltwater through the full ice thickness are modelled for the 2004 and 2006 ablation seasons. Through this case study we assess the model's sensitivity to degree-day factors, fracture toughness, tensile strength and crevasse width, and confirm that parameters influencing the rate at which water fills a crevasse are the most significant controls on the ability of a crevasse to reach the bed. Increased surface melt production, therefore, has the potential to significantly influence the spatial and temporal transfer of meltwater through surface-to-bed connections in a warmer climate.

ENSO/SAM interactions during the middle and late Holocene	HOLOCENE												A new chronology of large magnitude rainfall events derived from the continuous high-resolution Lake Tutira storm sediment record covers the last 6800 years and provides the first insight into changes in El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) teleconnections to the higher southern latitudes to be obtained from New Zealand. Synthesis with independent paleoclimate records from the tropical Pacific and Antarctica also reveals a millennial-scale waxing and waning of the teleconnections that were not visible in the narrow historical window previously used to view interactions between ENSO and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Consistent with modern ENSO behaviour, we find teleconnections to the Southwest Pacific varied throughout the middle and late Holocene, depending on the strength and phase of ENSO and the phase of the SAM. We suggest that precession-driven changes in the seasonal cycle of solar radiation exert a first-order control on the interaction between the two climate modes. Consequently, their present status may neither be indicative of conditions that prevailed earlier in the Holocene, nor of those that might be associated with future climate changes in the Southern Hemisphere extratropics.					; Stuart, Andrew/C-4445-2016	Gomez, Basil/0000-0002-5762-3183; Cobb, Kim/0000-0002-2125-9164; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				JAN	2012	22	1					23	30		10.1177/0959683611405241	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683611405241													WOS:000298353900003

Bacterial infections of Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (Walbaum), returning to gamete collecting weirs in Michigan	JOURNAL OF FISH DISEASES												Herein, we describe the prevalence of bacterial infections in Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (Walbaum), returning to spawn in two tributaries within the Lake Michigan watershed. Ten bacterial genera, including Renibacterium, Aeromonas, Carnobacterium, Serratia, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Hafnia, Salmonella, Shewanella and Morganella, were detected in the kidneys of Chinook salmon (n = 480) using culture, serological and molecular analyses. Among these, Aeromonas salmonicida was detected at a prevalence of similar to 15%. Analyses revealed significant interactions between location/time of collection and gender for these infections, whereby overall infection prevalence increased greatly later in the spawning run and was significantly higher in females. Renibacterium salmoninarum was detected in fish kidneys at an overall prevalence of > 25%. Logistic regression analyses revealed that R. salmoninarum prevalence differed significantly by location/time of collection and gender, with a higher likelihood of infection later in the spawning season and in females vs. males. Chi-square analyses quantifying non-independence of infection by multiple pathogens revealed a significant association between R. salmoninarum and motile aeromonad infections. Additionally, greater numbers of fish were found to be co-infected by multiple bacterial species than would be expected by chance alone. The findings of this study suggest a potential synergism between bacteria infecting spawning Chinook salmon.

Seasonal abundance and movement of the invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) on rocky substrate in the Duluth-Superior Harbor of Lake Superior	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Despite its small size [adult: 60130 mm, total length (TL)] and limited home range, the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) has quickly become established throughout the Laurentian Great Lakes. Little information is available, however, on the natural dispersal pattern of this species. This capturemarkrecapture study utilised alphanumeric tags subcutaneously inserted into round gobies (n = 1228) along a 550-m stretch of the DuluthSuperior Harbor shoreline to observe their movement over a 13-month period. Recaptured round gobies (n = 415) exhibited highly leptokurtic movement distributions, and movement events were not correlated with fish size, gender or month. Our work indicates that round gobies >50 mm (TL) generally occupy an area less than the minimum sampling interval (25 m); however, occasional movement up to 50 m per day could facilitate range expansion in the Laurentian Great Lakes.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				JAN	2012	21	1					64	74		10.1111/j.1600-0633.2011.00524.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2011.00524.x													WOS:000297634700007

Titan's Methane Weather	ANNUAL REVIEW OF EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCES, VOL 40	Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences											Conditions in Titan's troposphere are near the triple point of methane, the second most abundant component of its atmosphere. Our understanding of Titan's lower atmosphere has shifted considerably in the past decade. Ground-based observations, Hubble Space Telescope images, and data returned from the Cassini and Huygens spacecraft show that Titan's troposphere hosts a methane-based meteorology in direct analogy to the water-based meteorology of Earth. What once was thought to be a quiescent place, lacking in clouds or localized weather and changing only subtly on long seasonal timescales, is now understood to be a dynamic system with significant weather events regularly occurring against the backdrop of dramatic seasonal changes. Although the observational record of Titan's weather covers only a third of its 30-year seasonal cycle, Titan's atmospheric processes appear to be more closely analogous to those of Earth than to those of any other object in our solar system.

In this paper, we describe conifer-dominated palynofloras in a fades context from the early to mid-Moscovian (Middle Pennsylvanian) interval of the De Lutte-6 borehole (the Netherlands) that shed light on this issue. Our data suggest that, in the upper Bolsovian-lowermost Asturian part of the borehole succession, F/orinites-producing cordaitaleans with subordinate tree-ferns, pteridosperms, calamiteans, and lycopsids, covered low-lying braidplains draining the rising Variscan Orogen, while Cordaitina/Latensina-producing cordaitaleans, walchian conifers and enigmatic pteridosperms mostly grew in hinterland regions (Assemblage I). At one relatively brief interval, a mire dominated by calamiteans and arborescent lycopsids developed within this braidplain complex (Assemblage II). In the mid-Asturian part of the borehole succession, following a switch from humid to seasonally-dry climates (indicated by paleosols), palynofloras associated with a shallow, but extensive, lake deposit imply that communities of walchian conifers, Cordaitina/Latensina-producing cordaitaleans, and engimatic pteridosperms covered low-lying drylands, but were cyclically replaced by lycopsid 'ephemerals' during short-term pluvial events (Assemblage III). Across tropical Pangaea, the climate-driven migration of diverse conifers from Bolsovian hinterlands to mid-Asturian basins coincides with (1) the more frequent appearance of conifer megafloral remains in the fossil record, (2) a gradual increase in the frequency of tree-ferns in clastic swamps, (3) a decline in the abundance of arborescent lycopsids in mires, and (4) a change from perhumid raised mires to humid planar mires in cratonic areas. We therefore highlight that the mid-Asturian (mid-Moscovian) interval is an under-appreciated event in the evolution of Pennsylvanian tropical vegetation, on a par with the better-known climate-driven floral change-overs that occurred in the earliest Kasimovian and Gzhelian-Asselian. Our palaeoecological findings also clarify a long-running biostratigraphic controversy by showing that conifer dominance in the De Lutte-6 borehole is completely consistent with its Bolsovian-Asturian age, and does not require the invocation of an unconformity separating an inferred Westphalian part of the succession from an inferred upper Stephanian/Permian part of the succession, as suggested by some earlier workers. This, in turn, emphases the importance of selecting isotaphonomic (isoclimatic) samples for biostratigraphic purposes. (C) 2012 Elsevier am. All rights reserved.

Methods for Estimating Surface Water Storage Changes and Their Evaluations	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												Developing effective methods for estimating regional-scale surface water storage change (ASW) has be-come increasingly important for water resources studies and environmental impact assessment. Three methods for estimat-ing monthly ASW are proposed in this study, of which one is based on land surface runoff and two that use water body water budgets. Water areas observed by Landsat satellites for Canada's entire landmass are used for evaluation of the re-sults. The surface runoff method achieved the least satisfactory results, with large errors in the cold season or dry regions. The two water-budget methods demonstrated significant improvements, particularly when water area dynamics is consid-ered in the estimation of the water body water budget. The three methods performed consistently across different climate regions in the country and showed better correlations with observations over wet climate regions than over dry regions with poorly connected hydrological system. The results also showed the impact of glacier and permanent snow melts over the Rocky Mountains on basin-scale surface water dynamics. The methods and outputs from this study can be used for cali-brating and validating hydrological and climate models, assessing climate change and human disturbance impacts on regional water resources, and filling the ASW data gaps in GRACE-based total water storage decompositions studies.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate methods for estimating re-gional-scale surface water storage change. This is important because information on surface water dynamics is limited for water resources studies and environmental impact assessment. Our study makes available two new methods which significantly improve on surface water storage estimation from the traditional runoff model. A guide on controls of sur-face water dynamics is provided for regions under various hydroclimate and physiographic-hydraulic conditions and reveals the influence of glacier melt on surface water variations.

A combination of sediment trap data, hydmmeteorological data and hydrodynamic modelling provided a unique set-up to discover differences in sedimentation rates and compositions. Our study shows that the averaged sedimentation accumulation rate (SAR) was nearly three times higher during warmer cold season (30.9 g m(-2) day(-1)), characterised by higher precipitation, especially rain and discharge, as well as snowless and open water conditions, compared to regular cold season (10.6 g m(-2) day(-1)). While sedimentation was higher during the warmer season, the mean sediment grain size (D-50) was higher during the regular cold season with permanent snow and ice cover. Similarly, while sediments of the regular cold season were organically rich, the total amount of organic matter accumulation was larger during the warmer cold season. Sediments consisted mostly of elastic matter (85-89%), of which the mean grain size varied from clay to fine silt (0.3-3.0 mu m). Sedimentation differences between the cold seasons can be explained by differences in precipitation, river flow, wind-induced resuspension and a low air pressure system forcing sea level changes. Sedimentation differences along the study bay were found to be connected to channel cross-sectional area and flow conditions caused by river input and sea level changes.					; Alho, Petteri/B-7989-2013	Blafield, Linnea/0000-0002-9126-2000; Saarni, Saija/0000-0003-2050-3062; Alho, Petteri/0000-0001-5252-9609; Salmela, Jouni/0000-0001-7786-3064													0025-3227	1872-6151				JAN	2022	443								106701	10.1016/j.margeo.2021.106701	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.margeo.2021.106701		DEC 2021											WOS:000748969300001

Here, we present new data on copper (Cu) isotopic composition of waters and solids collected along a continuum Mine (Tharsis)-River (Meca)-Lake (Sancho) in the Iberian Pyrite Belt. Our results show that the isotopic signature of pit lakes is spatially variable, but remains stable over the seasons; this signature seems to be controlled by water-rock interaction processes. The data obtained on the Meca River imply a number of attenuation processes such as decrease in the metal concentration by precipitation of secondary minerals. This is accompanied by preferential retention of the heavy isotope (Cu-65) with a possibility of living organisms (e.g., algae) participation. The terminal Sancho lake demonstrated constant isotopic signature over the entire depth of the water column despite sizable variations in Cu concentrations, which can be tentatively explained by a superposition of counter-interacting biotic and abiotic processes of Cu fractionation. Overall, the understanding of the isotopic variations along the hydrological continuum is useful for a better understanding of metal element transfer within mining environments and surrounding surface waters.

Here, we describe two new free-living heteroloboseans. One belonging to the Pharyngomonas genus and the other, whose 18S rRNA gene sequence shares only 85% homology to its closest relatives Euplaesiobystra hypersalinica, was proposed as a new species of this genus being called Euplaesiobystra dzianiensis. Both strains were salt tolerant to 75%o and grew between 25 and 37 degrees C. Their distribution patterns varied seasonally and depended also on depth. Noticeably, both free-living amoebae isolates were able to graze on Arthrospira filaments, which are found within the same water layer.

The proposed method aimed to develop a practical and rapid countermeasure, enabling preemptive responses to massive algal blooms, through which prior to the algal bloom season we can identify HAB-prone regions based on estimations of where harmful algae initiates and develops significantly. The HAB-prone regions were derived from temperature, depth, flow velocity, and sediment concentration data based only on acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs) without relying further on supplementary data collection, such as the water quality. For HAB-prone regions, we employed hot-spot analysis using K-means clustering and the Getis-Ord G*, in conjunction with the spatial autocorrelation of Moran's I and the local index of spatial association (LISA). The validation of the derived HAB-prone regions was conducted for ADCP measurements located at the downstream of Nam and Nakdong River confluence, South Korea, which preceded three months of algal bloom season monitored by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The visual inspection demonstrated that the comparison resulted in an acceptable range of agreement and consistency between the predicted HAB-prone regions and actual UAV-based observations of actual algal blooms.					; Kim, Soojeong/LEL-8750-2024	Lyu, Siwan/0000-0003-1727-7172; Kim, Dongsu/0000-0002-4536-767X; Kim, Young Do/0000-0002-2177-5847; 														2073-4441				DEC	2020	12	12							3488	10.3390/w12123488	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12123488													WOS:000602874900001
J	Ureta, G; Németh, K; Aguilera, F; Gonzalez, R				Ureta, Gabriel; Nemeth, Karoly; Aguilera, Felipe; Gonzalez, Rodrigo			Features That Favor the Prediction of the Emplacement Location of Maar Volcanoes: A Case Study in the Central Andes, Northern Chile	GEOSCIENCES												Maar volcanoes are monogenetic landforms whose craters cut below the pre-eruptive surface and are surrounded by a tephra ring. Both the maar crater and the surrounding tephra rim deposits are typically formed due to magma-water explosive interactions. Northern Chile is located in the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes where, in literature, 14 maars have been recognized as parasite (6) and individual (8) volcanoes. Amongst these individual maars, 3 of them, namely the Tilocalar Sur, Cerro Tujle, and Cerro Overo volcanoes, are not related to calderas and were emplaced <1 Ma ago by magmatic explosive-effusive and phreatomagmatic eruptions. Based on the evolution and control of the volcanic eruptive styles of these three maars, which have been determined in previous research through fieldwork, stratigraphic, morphometric, textural (density and vesicularity), petrographic, and geochemical analyses, a set of key features that favor a prediction of the emplacement location of maar volcanoes in Central Andes, northern Chile are proposed. The set of features that permit and favor the growth mechanisms for maar formations corresponds to (i) a compressive tectonic setting (e.g., ridge structures), (ii) groundwater recharge (e.g., snowmelt and seasonal rainfall), (iii) the lithological setting (e.g., layers of low permeability), (iv) the presence of aquifer and/or endorheic basins (e.g., lakes or salars), and (v) a period of stress relaxation that permits magma ascent to the surface in volcanically active areas. Considering these characteristics, it is possible to identify places where phreatomagmatic eruption can occur. If the magma ascent flux is lower than the groundwater flux, this can lead to a phreatomagmatic eruption because of groundwater coming into contact with the magma. These eruptive features evidence internal-and external-factors that play an essential role in the transition from explosive-effusive magmatic to phreatomagmatic volcanic eruption styles during the same eruptive period that is one of the biggest challenges in volcanic hazard evaluations. Although, in this contribution, a set of features that permit and favor the growth mechanisms for a prediction of the emplacement location of maars in northern Chile is proposed, these considerations could also be applied to identify potential locations in other parts of the world where magma-water interaction eruption could occur. Therefore, this approach could be useful in the prediction of hydromagmatic volcanic eruptions and, thus, in mitigating the impact of volcanic hazard for the inhabitants of the surrounding areas.					; Gonzalez T., Rodrigo/O-4251-2015; Tapia, Rodrigo/O-4251-2015; Nemeth, Karoly/V-7614-2017	Ureta, Gabriel/0000-0003-4205-5213; Gonzalez T., Rodrigo/0000-0001-7553-9404; Nemeth, Karoly/0000-0003-1026-0407; Aguilera, Felipe/0000-0003-1135-9978														2076-3263				DEC	2020	10	12							507	10.3390/geosciences10120507	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/geosciences10120507													WOS:000602136200001

Based on analysis of water isotope compositions and water chemistry at 56 lakes across Old Crow Flats (Yukon), a large thermokarst landscape, we assess if differences in source water inputs (snowmelt versus rainfall) affect limnological conditions during the ice-free season of 2007 and explore influences of catchment features. Results demonstrate that lakes with snowmelt-dominated source waters, situated in catchments that support tall shrub and woodland vegetation, possess significantly higher (p < 0.05) nutrient (N, P, SiO2) and dissolved organic carbon concentrations than lakes with rainfall-dominated source waters. Conversely, rainfall-dominated lakes, located in catchments dominated by dwarf shrubs and sparse vegetation, have significantly higher concentrations of major ions (Mg2+, Na+, SO42-) and pH. These limnological differences persisted throughout the ice-free season. We suggest that interaction of snowmelt with organic-rich detritus raises nutrient concentrations in snowmelt-dominated lakes and that evaporative-concentration, shoreline erosion and possibly rainfall runoff are processes that raise the ionic content of lakes with rainfall-dominated source waters. Knowledge of these relations improves the ability to anticipate limnological responses to ongoing and future climate and hydrological change in Arctic and subarctic regions.					; Sweetman, Jon/A-6457-2011; Hall, Roland/K-3165-2019	Hall, Roland/0000-0002-0314-6449; Sweetman, Jon/0000-0002-9849-7355; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				JUL	2015	72	7					1058	1072		10.1139/cjfas-2014-0340	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2014-0340													WOS:000358607900010

Taphonomy story of a modern African elephant Loxodonta africana carcass on a lakeshore in Zambia (Africa)	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					5th International Conference on Mammoths and their Relatives	AUG 30-SEP 04, 2010	Le Puy-en-Velay, FRANCE					A modern African elephant carcass was monitored taphonomically on a shallow lakeshore during dry and wet seasons of 2010-2011. The young adult female died on the lakeshore during the hot dry season of early October 2010. African lions were first to scavenge on the carcass, feeding on the intestines and inner organs that were accessed through the anus. Spotted hyenas also scavenged on the fresh carcass, with an emphasis on the feet and leg bones: one foot was scavenged with the toes eaten and metapodials half chewed. In addition, hyenas chewed on exposed leg bones resulting in bite mark damages in the softer bone spongiosa and bite scratches on one humerus joint. Following an initial scavenging phase by large and small carnivores where the fresh meat and softer material was eaten and the majority of the bone damage occurred, the desiccated remains were abandoned on the lakeshore as a more or less intact carcass with the thick hide covering the mostly articulated skeletal elements. The carcass was briefly revisited and secondarily scavenged by hyenas in mid-November 2010 when the first rains softened the remains. During the seasonal flood from December 2010 through May 2011, the carcass was submerged. By the beginning of the following dry season in June 2011, the remaining skeletal material lay scattered over an area of 20 x 25 m. The main concentration of bones, however, including most of the larger bones and two articulated sections of the vertebral column, remained within a 10 x 10 m area where the carcass had last been scavenged. Although the elephant died of natural causes, the skull was damaged on Day 2 post-mortem when wildlife authorities removed the single tusk. In late September 2011, nearly one year post-mortem, no additional bone damage attributable to scavenging by large predators could be found, although some of the smaller bones were missing. Following the scavenging period, environmental factors e.g., flooding, temperature and humidity changes resulted in additional carcass scattering and damage, including cracks and flaking in some bones.

Age, growth, maturity and mortality of the tapetail anchovy Coilia brachygnathus (Engraulidae) in Lake Honghu, China	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The tapertail anchovy Coilia brachygnathus, a commercially important species mainly distributed along the mid-lower Chang-Jiang basin, is by far the most dominant species in Lake Honghu. To figure out its success in this semiclosed lake, some basic biological parameters of this anchovy were analysed based on samples seasonally collected from October 2020 to December 2021. The results demonstrated that the age classes of fished individuals varied from 0.5 to 3.5, with the majority (97.36%) being between 0.5 and 3 years old. The size at 50% maturity of 17.2 cm total length (TL) for females and 19.0 cm TL for males corresponded to 1 and 1.6 years, respectively. Coilia brachygnathus has a short life span, early sexual maturity and a relatively fast growth rate. The flourishing of the fish in the lake is mainly attributed to its short life span, early maturity, fast growth rate, closed fishing, pelagic spawners, the availability of plenty of food and low predation effect on it. Age 3.5 year occurs in an extremely small percentage of the total (< 3%), indicating that a large number of larger-sized or older fish died after spawning, which is probably one of the major sources of water pollution if the closed fishing measure is adopted in Lake Honghu. Thus, individuals older than 2 years or more than 20.0 cm TL should be harvested. These findings have important management implications for the fish resources in Lake Honghu and beyond.

A dynamic graphical interface for visualizing projected, measured, and reconstructed surface water elevations on the earth's largest lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												There is a growing need within the international water research and water resources management community, and the general public, for easy access to time-series of projected, measured, and reconstructed marine and freshwater coastal surface water elevations. There is also a need for effectively communicating variability among different surface water elevation data sets, as well as the intrinsic uncertainties in surface water elevation forecasts. Here, we introduce an interactive web-based interface, the Great Lakes Water Level Dashboard (GLWLD), designed to address this need for the North American Laurentian Great Lakes, the largest assemblage of unfrozen fresh surface water bodies on planet Earth, and one with a coastline of over 16,000 km (roughly 10,000 miles). The GLWLD is a Flash-based tool that can simultaneously display time-series of measured monthly and annual water level data and seasonal forecasts for each of the Great Lakes, reconstructed lake levels from paleoclimate research, and decadal lake level projections under alternative climate scenarios. By employing a suite of novel data transfer, processing, and visualization tools, the GLWLD allows users to seamlessly transition not only between alternate displays of Great Lakes water levels over different temporal scales, but between different data sets and forecasts as well. Furthermore, the unique GLWLD interface can help users understand the extent to which decisions regarding the use of the lakes depend on an appreciation of uncertainty and variability within, and between, different sources of Great Lakes water level information.

How do UV radiation, temperature, and zooplankton influence the dynamics of alpine phytoplankton communities?	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Plankton in mountain lakes are confronted with generally higher levels of incident ultraviolet radiation (UVR), lower temperatures, and shorter growing seasons than their lower elevation counterparts. The direct inhibitory effects of high UVR and low temperatures on montane phytoplankton are widely recognized. Yet little is known about the indirect effects of these two abiotic factors on phytoplankton, and more specifically whether they alter zooplankton grazing rates which may in turn influence phytoplankton. Here, we report the results of field microcosm experiments that examine the impact of temperature and UVR on phytoplankton growth rates and zooplankton grazing rates (by adult female calanoid copepods). We also examine consequent changes in the absolute and relative abundance of the four dominant phytoplankton species present in the source lake (Asterionella formosa, Dinobryon sp., Discostella stelligera, and Fragilaria crotonensis). All four species exhibited higher growth rates at higher temperatures and three of the four species (all except Dinobryon) exhibited lower growth rates in the presence of UVR versus when shielded from UVR. The in situ grazing rates of zooplankton had significant effects on all species except Asterionella. Lower temperatures significantly reduced grazing rates on Fragilaria and Discostella, but not Dinobryon. While UVR had no effect on zooplankton grazing on any of the four species, there was a significant interaction effect of temperature and UVR on zooplankton grazing on Dinobryon. Discostella and Dinobryon increased in abundance relative to the other species in the presence of UVR. Colder temperatures, the presence of zooplankton, and UVR all had consistently negative effects on rates of increase in overall phytoplankton biomass. These results demonstrate the importance of indirect as well as direct effects of climate forcing by UVR and temperature on phytoplankton community composition in mountain lakes, and suggest that warmer climates and higher UVR levels may favor certain species over others.

J	Gross, M; Böhme, M; Prieto, J				Gross, M.; Boehme, M.; Prieto, J.			Gratkorn: A benchmark locality for the continental Sarmatian s.str. of the Central Paratethys	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												This paper presents one of the richest and most complete vertebrate faunas of the late Middle Miocene (similar to 12 Ma) of Central Europe. Up to now, sixty-two vertebrate taxa, comprising all major groups (fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals), have been recorded. Based on sedimentological and palaeobiological evidences, this Fossillagerstatte is assumed to originate from a floodplain paleosol formed on top of a braided river sequence. The fauna points to a highly structured, somewhat vegetated landscape with a wide array of habitats (e. g., fluvial channels, sporadically moist floodplains, short-lived ponds, savannah-like open areas and screes). It was preserved due to a rapid drowning and the switch to a freshwater lake environment. Palaeoclimatological data, derived from pedogenic features as well as from biota, indicate an overall semi-arid, subtropical climate with distinct seasonality (mean annual precipitation 486 +/- 252 mm, mean annual temperature similar to 15 degrees C). This underlines the late Middle/early Late Miocene dry-spell in Central Europe. From taphonomical point of view, the irregularly distributed but roughly associated larger vertebrate remains refer to an in situ accumulation of the bone bed. Splintered bones, gnawing marks as well as rhizoconcretions and root corrosion structures record some pre- and post-burial modification of the taphocoenose. However, the findings of pellet remains argue for a very fast burial and thus to a low degree of time-averaging. For this reason, the fossil fauna reflects the original vertebrate community rather well and is a cornerstone for the understanding of late Middle Miocene terrestrial ecosystems in this region. Certainly, Gratkorn will be one of the key faunas for a high-resolution continental biostratigraphy and the comprehension of Europe's faunal interchanges near the Middle/Late Miocene transition.

In this study, we quantified the number and survivorship of seedlings and vegetative ramets monthly in juvenile and mature populations of Carex brevicuspis. During the first growing season after flooding (from October to January), 9 seedlings m(-2) (13% of all established shoots) were found in juvenile populations, while no seedlings were found in mature populations. During the second growing season before flooding (from February to May), no new seedling recruits were found either in juvenile or in mature populations. All shoots of seedlings were withered during the dormant season (January and February), but 62.5% seedlings could produce vegetative ramets in the following growing season. During the dormant season, all the early emerging ramets (sprouted in October) withered, but the later emerging ones (sprouted in November and December) survived in both mature and juvenile populations. These results indicated that seedling recruitment was only apparent in juvenile populations of C. brevicuspis. The genetic diversity in mature C. brevicuspis populations may be established in juvenile populations by seedling recruitment, and sustained in mature populations by vegetative reproduction.

We also evaluated the potential transfer pathways of the allochthonous dissolved organic matter into the pelagic food webs of these deep lakes, including the natural zooplankton delta C-13 in the analysis. The dynamics of the allochthonous indicators were related to the precipitation regime, water level fluctuations, and hydrogeomorphic and catchment features of lakes Moreno East and Moreno West. The water color (absorbance at 440 nm) was extremely low (<0.28 m(-1)) in both lakes regardless of the season. However, precipitation and snowmelt regimes drove the increase and decrease of water color, respectively. A significant positive relationship between the zooplankton bulk delta C-13 with the water color would suggest an input of allochthonous organic carbon into the pelagic consumers. The incorporation of the dissolved allochthonous material into higher trophic levels is likely favored by the bacterivorous behavior of planktonic organisms, mixotrophic flagellates and ciliates, which dominate the pelagic food webs of these Patagonian lakes. Morphometric aspects, mainly the higher water residence time, led to lower values of allochthony in Moreno East compared to Moreno West, probably accentuated by its upper position in the lake chain. Overall, our results suggest that these allochthonous signals can bring insight into the magnitude of the interaction between terrestrial environments and lake ecosystems, even in extremely clear and ultraoligotrophic systems, such as the Andean Patagonian lakes.

Late pleistocene and holocene vegetation history of the bale mountains, Ethiopia	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												A sediment core recovered from Garba Guracha, a glacial lake at 3950 m altitude in the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia, at the boundary of the Ericaceous and Afroalpine vegetation belts, provides a 16,700-year pollen record of vegetation response to climatic change. The earliest vegetation recorded was sparse and composed mainly of grasses, Amaranthaceae-Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia, indicating an arid climate. At 13,400 cal BP, Amaranthaceae-Chenopodiaceae pollen declined sharply and Cyperaceae increased, suggesting a change to moister conditions. The Younger Dryas interval is represented by a small increase in Artemisia and reduced Cyperaceae, indicating aridity. Just after the start of the Holocene (11,200 cal BP), the upper altitudinal limit of the Ericaceous belt rose, and woody Ericaceous vegetation extended across the Sanetti plateau, in response to increased moisture and temperature. The marked change from elastic to organic lake sedimentation at this time reflects the increase in woody vegetation cover in the lake catchment, accompanied by soil stabilisation, and increased leaf litter and soil humus content. From about 6000 cal BP, and especially after 4500 cal BP, mid-altitude dry Afromontane Juniper-Podocarpus forests developed on the northern slopes of the mountains in response to reduced rainfall in a shortened wet season. Erica shrub and forest decreased in area and altitude, and the Afroalpine ecosystem expanded on the plateau. Podocarpus declined from about 2000 cal BP, as Juniperus increased to its present dominance at 2500-3300 m attitude. Human impact on the high-altitude Afroalpine and Ericaceous vegetation has been relatively minor, confirming that the endemic biodiversity of the Ethiopian mountains is a legacy of natural Holocene vegetation change, following repeated expansion and contraction of the upland ecosystems during the Quaternary.

J	Li, KX; Yang, QC; Li, X				Li, Kexin; Yang, Qichun; Li, Xia			An Analysis of the Spatiotemporal Variability of Key Water Quality Parameters in China	HYDROLOGY												Intensifying anthropogenic disturbances have caused water pollution in China in recent decades. China has a vast territory with diverse climate conditions, land use types, and human activities, leading to significant water quality variability. However, few studies have investigated nationwide spatiotemporal patterns of key water quality parameters. In this study, we analyze monthly water quality observations from 3647 gauge stations to understand how water quality changes over time and space in China. We group the stations by water resource regions and adopt Python and SPSS to analyze the spatiotemporal variability and intercorrelations of eight water quality parameters. Results indicate that the concentrations of biochemical oxygen demand of 5 days (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), dissolved oxygen (DO), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) show similar spatial patterns, with higher concentrations in the northern parts than the southern regions of China. The concentrations of COD and TP are higher in the rainy season than in the dry season, while DO, NH3-N, and TN show the opposite seasonal patterns. Strong positive correlations were found between BOD and COD, NH3-N and TP. The annual cumulative distribution figures demonstrate that all parameters showed slightly lower concentrations in 2022 and 2023 than in 2021, except for DO and TN. The TN/TP ratios across different water resource regions in China are significantly higher than 16, indicating that phosphorus is the limiting factor of eutrophication. This investigation provides a comprehensive understanding of the spatiotemporal variability of water quality parameters across China. The results of this study are highly valuable for investigating mechanisms regulating water quality across large spatial scales, thus providing valuable implications for improving water quality and mitigating water pollution.					李, 可欣/IAP-2948-2023															2306-5338				SEP	2024	11	9							135	10.3390/hydrology11090135	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/hydrology11090135													WOS:001323089000001

Studies into this matter are of great significance for optimizing the management of campus living environments. Low-cost online sensors to monitor PM2.5 and CO2 levels were used in typical functional areas of a university campus in Beijing, China, including offices, dormitories, leisure spaces, canteens, and laboratories. By comparing the findings with data from nearby national monitoring stations, the seasonal and spatial variations in PM2.5 and CO2 concentrations were analyzed. Findings indicate PM2.5 levels within the campus were notably lower compared to the surrounding urban environment. There was variation in PM2.5 and CO2 concentrations across different functional areas. Typically, indoor PM2.5 levels were lower than outdoor ones, while CO2 concentrations in enclosed indoor spaces with human activities progressively escalated. The main internal emission sources affecting the PM2.5 level on campus included traffic emissions, dust generated by human activities, and emissions from catering. In contrast, in areas with better green coverage or where a lake system participates in the atmospheric circulation, the PM2.5 level and CO2/PM2.5 were lower. This indicates that the cleansing impact of plants and aquatic systems is instrumental in lowering PM2.5 concentrations, offering healthier leisure spaces. Seasonal variations also impact PM2.5 levels. During the non-heating period, less pollution source emissions led to decreased outdoor PM2.5 concentrations. The campus monitoring sites experienced an approximate 5 mu g/m(3) and 29 mu g/m(3) reduction in the average PM2.5 levels as compared to the PM2.5 of the surrounding urban environment, respectively, during the non-heating and heating period. During indoor activities or sleep, CO2 levels can build up to as high as 2303 ppm due to breathing. It is advisable to stay indoors on days when pollution levels are high, whereas on days with clean air, it is healthier to be outdoors or to air out indoor areas by opening windows. Our research provides clearer scientific evidence for incorporating behavioral strategies for improving air quality into both daily work and life. Moreover, the findings are quite meaningful for the widespread adoption of low-cost sensor monitoring in various environments, with applications beyond just the campus settings.					wang, qingqing/Y-3082-2018; Li, Jialin/IYJ-1259-2023; Wei, Lianfang/N-8550-2015; Wang, Zifa/B-5799-2011	Wei, Lianfang/0000-0002-2293-458X														2073-4433				SEP	2024	15	9							1044	10.3390/atmos15091044	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos15091044													WOS:001326186400001

We studied the combined effects of shelter structures, periodical water flow and water level changes on pre- and post-release performance of critically endangered landlocked Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar m. sebago). Relative to standard (plain) rearing tanks, provision of enrichment improved fish condition factor and survival during the first year of rearing when most mortality was attributable to parasitic and bacterial infections. The consequent higher density in enriched tanks probably induced greater growth variation and more dorsal fin damages than found in fish of standard tanks. Possibly this was partly due to the applied changes in water level. Experimentally determined smolt migration tendency at age 3 did not differ, on average, between the rearing groups, but enriched-reared fish showed clearly less variation in total movement activity than standard-reared fish. Experimental angling in earthen ponds did not suggest divergent vulnerability between the differentially reared fish at age 3, but decreased condition during the preceding growth season increased vulnerability to fishing. Based on long-term post-stocking tag returns in large-lake fisheries, fish length at release but not rearing method affected the capture rates of fish released at age 2. When released at age 3 the fish grown in enriched environment had a higher risk to be captured with stationary gears and earlier by hook and line gears compared to standard-reared conspecifics. Earlier time of maximal smolt migration activity was associated with an increased risk of being captured. We suggest that environmental enrichment may modulate growth- and behavior-related qualities that indirectly increased the vulnerability to fishing in natural conditions but not in experimental setting. The favorable effects of enrichment on early survival encourages adopting enriched rearing practices in supportive breeding of landlocked salmon.

In this paper, the variation of vertical distribution of ammonia nitrogen in a source water reservoir was studied, on the base of field monitoring data. The dominant factor of the variation in ammonia nitrogen is the anaerobic environment caused by the seasonal thermal stratification, which leads to the degradation of nitrogen-containing organic compounds in the sediments. To determine the rates of ammonia accumulation, an in situ experimental chamber was used. The results showed that, before the formation of thermal stratification in the reservoir, sediments in the bottom of the water have a high tendency to release ammonia; the rates of ammonia accumulation in the overlying water are 40.31-111.41 mg.m(-2).d(-1). However, thermal stratification causes changes in the physical and chemical properties of the sediment and reduction in the degradability of the nitrogen-containing compound in the sediment. The rates of ammonia accumulation (39.44-44.65 mg.m(-2).d(-1)) after thermal stratification are lower than before. Considering the water pollution hazards caused by seasonal thermal stratification, it is necessary to take corresponding emergency response measures to cope with the possibility of water pollution risk.

Taking the lakeside river network in Wuxi as an example, through numerical simulation, polynomial fitting, correlation analysis, and principal component analysis, the hydrodynamic responses of urban lake-connected river networks to water diversion and hydrodynamic grouping were researched. Based on numerical model and influence weight analysis, we explored the improvement of hydrodynamic conditions of plain river network with strong human intervention and high algal water diversion. The results showed that: (1) The relationship between water diversion impact on river network flow velocity and water diversion flux was not as simple a linear relationship. It could be reflected by polynomial. The water transfer interval in dry season with high hydrodynamic efficiency (HE) was lower than 10 m(3)/s and higher than 30 m(3)/s, and the HE increased significantly when the water transfer flow was higher than 20 m(3)/s in the wet season. (2) According to the main hydrodynamic driving factors, the channels in the river network could be divided into three types: water conservancy projects, river and lake water level difference, and river channel characteristic. The correlations of rivers' flow velocity in each group were very high. (3) The influence weights of water conservancy projects, river and lake water level difference, and river channel characteristic on the whole river network dynamics were 65, 21, and 12.4%, respectively, and the other factors contributed 1.6% of the weight.

They play an important role in the study of terrestrial carbon cycles. This study aimed to explore the sensitivity of soil LOC fractions to environmental changes and analyze their main influencing factors during three seasonal water level periods for scientific management of Dongting Lake wetlands. Soil under three typical wetland types (Carextristachya wetland (CTW), Phragmites australis wetland (PAW) and Salix babylonica (SBW)) in East Dongting Lake in China were collected during the normal season (May), rainy season (August) and dry season (December). Seasonal dynamics of soil LOC fractions (i.e., dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and easily oxidized carbon (EOC)) within these wetlands and their relationship to soil nutrients and carbon-cycle enzyme activity were analyzed. The results showed that the soil DOC contents of the three wetlands first increased and then decreased, with the exception of CTW from the normal season to the dry season, while the seasonal changes of soil MBC and EOC for all wetlands followed an opposite pattern. CTW had the largest DOC concentration (228.29 mg center dot kg(-1)) during dry season, while the highest contents of soil DOC, MBC and EOC were found in PAW during the three observed seasons, which ranged from 82.05 to 203.60 mg center dot kg(-1), 262.54 to 325.74 mg center dot kg(-1) and 3.30 to 4.61 g center dot kg(-1), respectively. However, the contents of soil DOC and their proportions to soil organic carbon (SOC) of all wetlands during the normal season were 56.58~82.05 mg center dot kg(-1) and 0.41~0.47%, respectively, which were the lowest among the three seasons. Nevertheless, the contents of both MBC and EOC as well as their ratios to SOC in these wetlands showed similar seasonal dynamics, with the lowest values recorded in the rainy season. From the normal season to the dry season, invertase activity in all wetlands increased, while cellulase activity decreased by 12.5-31.3%. The seasonal variation of catalase activity for all wetlands was less distinctive, and the highest enzyme activity was during the rainy season. Correlation analysis revealed that soil LOC fractions for all wetlands were closely related to SOC, TN, TP and invertase for the three seasons, especially during the rainy season, but were negatively correlated with TK, cellulase and catalase activity. Generally, soil LOC fractions of the three wetlands were affected by the seasonal fluctuations of water levels and presented different distribution characteristics.																				2071-1050				DEC	2021	13	24							13836	10.3390/su132413836	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su132413836													WOS:000737429100001

Thermokarst processes, increasing temperature, and changes in drainage can cause degradation of polygonal tundra landscape features resulting in elevated, well-drained, unvegetated soil surfaces that exhibit large nitrous oxide emissions. Here, we outline the magnitude and some of the dominant factors controlling variability in emissions for these thermokarst landscape features in the North Slope of Alaska. We measured strong nitrous oxide emissions during the growing season from unvegetated high centered polygons (median (mean) = 104.7 (187.7) mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1)), substantially higher than mean rates associated with Arctic tundra wetlands and of similar magnitude to unvegetated hotspots in peat plateaus and palsa mires. In the absence of vegetation, isotopic enrichment of N-15 in these thermokarst features indicates a greater influence of microbial processes, (denitrification and nitrification) from barren soil. Findings reveal that the thermokarst features discussed here (similar to 1.5% of the study area) are likely a notable source of nitrous oxide emissions, as inferred from chamber-based estimates. Growing season emissions, estimated at 16 (28) mg N2O-N ha(-1) h(-1), may be large enough to affect landscape-level greenhouse gas budgets.					; Oechel, Walter/M-1347-2019; Davidson, Scott/X-7650-2019; Arndt, Kyle/ABC-2565-2021; Zona, Donatella/G-4039-2010	Hashemi, Josh/0000-0002-8660-7406; Davidson, Scott J./0000-0001-8327-2121; Kalhori, Aram/0000-0002-0652-8987; Arndt, Kyle/0000-0003-4158-2054; Zona, Donatella/0000-0002-0003-4839														2662-4435				AUG 30	2024	5	1							473	10.1038/s43247-024-01583-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s43247-024-01583-5								39220210					WOS:001303600700001

The objective of this study was to evaluate the occurrence and distribution of 25 antibiotics in environmental and biological samples from Poyang Lake Basin in China. SPE-HPLC-MS/MS was used to quantify the concentrations in different matrices. The total concentrations ranged from 144 to 933 ng/L in the water and 346 to 1154 ng/g in the sediment. In the spatial distribution analysis of this basin, the concentrations in the Ganjiang River were generally higher than those in Poyang Lake. The seasonal distribution in the wet and dry seasons showed comparatively higher concentrations during the dry season than the wet season. Additionally, antibiotics were found in various hydrophytes and animals, and the bioconcentration factor values followed the order: emergent plants > floating plants > submerged plants and benthic organisms > ducks > fish. Moreover, correlations among different matrices showed that antibiotics in viviparid snails were significantly positively correlated with those in ducks, and negatively correlated with those in carps, indicating the transmission relationship through the food chain. The results showed the trophic transfer of antibiotics in the food web and their potential environmental impacts on Poyang Lake Basin need constant attention.

We quantified the lateral flux of detrital C in the Yangtze estuary where invasive Spartina alterniflora has substantially and extensively altered the ecosystem structure and functions. Our overall objective was to close the C budget of estuarine wetlands through field sampling, tower-based measurements, and modeling. Methods A lateral detrital C exchange evaluation platform was established in a case study of the Yangtze River Estuary to investigate the effect of ecosystem structural changes on lateral detrital C transfer processes. This study estimated the lateral detrital C exchange based on the gross primary production (GPP) by performing coupled modeling and field sampling. Tower-based measurements and MODIS time series and CH4 outgassing and biomass simultaneously measured the lateral detrital C flux to characterize the relative contributions of lateral (i.e., detritus) C fluxes to the annual marsh C budget. Results The C pools in the plants and soil of Spartina marshes were significantly higher than those of the native community dominated by Phragmites australis. The GPP based on MODIS (GPP(MODIS)) was 472.6 g C m(-2) year(-1) and accounted for 73.0% of the GPP estimated from eddy covariance towers (GPP(EC)) (646.9 +/- 70.7 g C m(-2) year(-1)). We also detected a higher GPP(MODIS) during the pre-growing season, which exhibited a similar lateral detrital C flux magnitude. On average, 25.8% of the net primary production (NPP), which ranged from 0.21 to 0.30 kg C m(-2) year(-1), was exported during lateral exchange. The annual C loss as CH4 was estimated to be 17.9 +/- 3.7 g C m(-2) year(-1), accounting for 2.8% of the GPP(EC). The net positive detrital C flux (i.e., more detritus leaving the wetlands), which could exceed 0.16 kg C m(-2) day(-1), was related to daily tides. However, the observed lateral detrital C flux based on monthly sampling was 73.5% higher than that based on daily sampling (i.e., the sum of daily sampling), particularly in March and October. In addition, spatiotemporal granularities were responsible for most of the uncertainty in the lateral detrital C exchange. Conclusion This research demonstrated that an integrated framework incorporating modeling and field sampling can quantitatively assess lateral detrital C transport processes across the terrestrial-aquatic interface in estuarine wetlands. However, we note some limitations in the application of the light-use efficiency model to tidal wetlands. Spartina invasion can turn the lateral C balance from a C source (209.0 g C m(-2) year(-1)) of Phragmites-dominated marshes into a small C sink (-31.0 g C m(-2) year(-1)). Sampling over a more extended period and continuous measurements are essential for determining the contribution of different lateral detrital C flux processes to closing the ecosystem C budgets. The sampling spatiotemporal granularities can be key to assessing lateral detrital C transfer.

J	Bento, B; Hintelmann, H				Bento, Beatriz; Hintelmann, Holger			Assessment of mercury methylation and methylmercury demethylation potentials in water and sediments along the Wabigoon River system	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Monomethylmercury (MMHg) plays a crucial role in the accumulation of mercury (Hg) within aquatic food chains. Since ambient levels of methylmercury are governed by the balance of simultaneous methylation and demethylation processes, determining in situ methylation and demethylation rates is critically important to understand the dynamics of methylmercury in the environment. This is especially important in the Wabigoon River system in Ontario, Canada, which is severely contaminated with Hg by a chlor-alkali facility operating in the 1960s, and still exhibits some of the highest recorded fish mercury concentrations in Canada. This work used a simultaneous addition of isotope enriched Hg and MMHg tracers to ascertain Hg methylation and MMHg demethylation potentials. At the locations investigated for this study, the most favourable conditions for Hg methylation were found at the Hydroelectric dam, being able to transform 4.2 % and 4.4 % of added Hg in water and sediments per day, respectively, to MMHg. This could correspond to 1.9 ng/L and 29 ng/g of new MMHg being produced from current ambient Hg. Clay Lake, which is considered a sink for mercury and exhibiting a seasonal anoxic environment at its bottom waters, also demonstrated significant MMHg generation, being able to produce 2.7 ng/L and 13 ng/g of MMHg per day, respectively. Demethylation rates in sediments of riverbed and wetland locations showed an average half-life for methylmercury of 2.1 days, indicating a rapid turnover of MMHg in the Wabigoon River. However, significantly lower demethylation rates were also measured near the inflow of Clay Lake, where it took up to 144 days for MMHg to decrease by 50 %. Generally, most of the investigated locations downstream of the pollution source displayed the potential to generate methylmercury, which could be distributed throughout the Wabigoon River system and therefore require attention with respect to future remediation activities.					; Hintelmann, Holger/AEV-0466-2022	Bento, Beatriz/0000-0002-7383-5207; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				NOV 15	2024	951								175658	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.175658	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.175658		AUG 2024						39168343					WOS:001302195900001

It is postulated that the above functions were largely dependent on trophic state. To test this hypothesis, composition, abundance, and size-spectrum of phytoplankton were studied in a Chinese shallow lake (Lake Donghu), together with concentrations and sorption behaviors of phosphorus in water column and sediment. Relationships among these variables were also examined by structural equation model. In the basins with the lowest phosphorus concentration, sediment was a phosphorus source as judged by equilibrium phosphorus concentration, directly affecting the abundance of phytoplankton with smaller size. Contrastingly, in the basins with the highest phosphorus concentration, sediment tended to uptake phosphorus, companied by the lowest ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus, diversity, and evenness of phytoplankton with the smaller size one dominating. Oscillatoria sp. was directly affected by ammonia and phosphorus. Moreover, with a balanced exchange of phosphorus between sediment and water column, phytoplankton increased markedly with the highest diversity and evenness in the basins having intermediate phosphorus concentration. Overall, trophic state modulated sediment functions to supply nutrient and was in turn greatly affected by the sediment in shallow lakes.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				AUG	2016	776	1					19	33		10.1007/s10750-016-2811-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-016-2811-x													WOS:000378225900002

AN ABANDONED-CHANNEL FILL WITH EXQUISITELY PRESERVED PLANTS IN REDBEDS OF THE CLEAR FORK FORMATION, TEXAS, USA: AN EARLY PERMIAN WATER-DEPENDENT HABITAT ON THE ARID PLAINS OF PANGEA	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												A well preserved plant assemblage at the Colwell Creek Pond locality of Leonardian (Kungurian) age provides an opportunity to evaluate taphonomic conditions in a dryland alluvial setting. A narrow channel body incised to 5 m depth through red paleo-Vertisols contains 2 m of varicolored laminated mudstone with graded layers and plant material. X-ray diffraction analysis of individual laminae indicates the presence of chlorite, illite, kaolinite, and mixed-layer clay, with hematite in red and gray layers and goethite in yellow-brown laminae. No carbonate was identified, and the total organic carbon content is minimal. The fine sediment accumulated in a shallow abandoned channel from suspension and gentle underflows, probably linked to seasonal inflow, and analysis of lamina thickness suggests that standing water may have persisted for up to a few millennia. The preservation of lamination is attributed to a lack of bioturbation, possibly linked to a paucity of subsurface oxygen, low productivity, elevated salinity, rapid deposition, or a combination of these factors; minimal bioturbation may also reflect the limited use of freshwater ecospace during the Early Permian. Clay-rich paleo-Vertisols complete the fill, with drab root traces that indicate growth of vegetation in a strongly seasonal setting. Abundant plant material in the laminated beds includes branches of walchian conifers, the possible cycadophyte Taeniopteris spp., and the comioid, possible peltasperm, Auritifolia waggoneri. They were derived from an adjacent riparian zone and preserved as 3D goethite petrifactions. Much of the foliage shows evidence of arthropod herbivory. Although a humid climatic episode cannot be ruled out, the exceptional abundance and preservation of the plants probably reflects the persistence of an oxbow lake on a relatively arid alluvial plain, where riparian plants experienced periodic moisture stress but had access to groundwater nearly year round. Rapid burial in standing water, the lack of bioturbation in the laminated sediments, and early biomineralization probably explain the exceptional preservation of the plant remains.

We used the 'static opaque chamber-gas chromatography method' to determine in situ emissions of greenhouse gases in the 3-month growing season (CO2, CH4, and N2O) from bream culturing ponds. We detected emissions of all three gases from the ponds, with CO2 emission far exceeding the other gases in the 3-month growing season (CO2 = 278.54 +/- 36.41 g/m(2), CH4 = 23.73 +/- 5.27 g/m(2), and N2O = 1.69 +/- 0.32 g/m(2)).

We present an analysis of the lake outburst events between 1950 and 2005, as well as results of detailed field investigations related to the lake drainage in 2004 and 2005. The latter include measurements of lake geometry, water pressure in nearby boreholes and glacier surface motion. A distributed temperature-index melt model coupled to a linear-reservoir runoff model is used to calculate hourly discharge from the catchment of Gornergletscher in order to distinguish between the melt/precipitation component and the outburst component of the discharge hydrograph. In this way, drainage volume and timing are determined. From 1950 there is a clear trend for the outburst flood to occur earlier in the melt season, but there is no trend in lake discharge volumes. Peak discharges from the lake lie significantly below the values obtained using the empirical relation proposed by Clague and Mathews (1973). The shapes of the 2004 and 2005 lake outflow hydrographs differ substantially, suggesting different drainage mechanisms. From water balance considerations we infer a leakage of the glacier-dammed lake in 2005, starting 1 week prior to the lake outburst. During the drainage events, up to half of the lake water is temporarily stored in the glacial system, causing substantial uplift of the glacier surface.

During dry seasons, concentrations of 16 USEPA priority PAHs, OH-PAHs, and NPAHs were extremely high, with average values of 1220 +/- 288, 317 +/- 641, 2.54 +/- 3.98, and 12.2 +/- 22.1 ng/g (dry weight, dw). The dry period level was confirmed to be 4 times greater than the wet period concentration. Modeling with positive matrix factorization (PMF) and estimation of diagnostic isomeric ratios were applied for identifying sources, according to the positive matrix factorization model: vehicle emissions (38.1%), biomass burning (25%), petroleum source (23.4%), and diesel engines source (13.5%) in wet season as well as wood combustion (44.1%), vehicle source (40.2%), coke oven (10.8%), and biomass burning (4.9%) in the dry season. The greatest seasonal variability was attributed to high molecular weight compounds (HMW PAHs). BaP was confirmed to be 81% carcinogenic in this study, which offers convincing proof of the escalating health issues.

In the present study, we explored seasonal and vertical variations in BCC in Lake Bosten, a unique oligosaline lake (1.2 parts per thousand salinity) in arid, northwestern China, using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We obtained 544 clones and 98 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from six clone libraries. The top 10 OTUs represented 59.4% of the entire bacterial community. Betaproteobacteria (22.1%), Gammaproteobacteria (19.9%), Bacteroidetes (18.8%), and Firmicutes (11.4%) dominated in Lake Bosten. Although seasonal variations were recorded in BCC, the vertical changes observed were not significant. Water temperature and salinity were the most important factors shaping the dynamics of BCC. A low degree of overlap was observed in BCC between Lake Bosten and freshwater ecosystems, especially for Betaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. An RDP seqmatch analysis showed that 169 sequences (31%) were novel bacterial sequences (<97% similarity to the closest sequences in GenBank), which suggested that specific indigenous bacteria inhabit this oligosaline environment. Our results support bacterial endemicity being more common than previously considered, particularly in oligosaline lakes. An analysis of these communities may reveal how bacteria respond to increases in salinity and nutrients in the early stage of salinization and eutrophication.

John; Flower, Roger J.; Rippey, Brian			Diatom taphonomy and silica cycling in two freshwater lakes and their implications for inferring past lake productivity	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Diatom preservation can be a major taphonomic issue in many lakes but is often unrecognised and its impacts on qualitative and quantitative inferences (such as productivity and biodiversity estimates) from sedimentary archives are seldom explored. Here two palaeolimnological case studies of 20th-century anthropogenic eutrophication of freshwater lakes in Northern Ireland (Lough Neagh and Lough Augher) are re-visited and new data presented on diatom preservation. Assessing problems of taphonomy challenges previous interpretations of silica dynamics and diatom productivity at these sites. Diatom preservation was assessed in both sediment trap material and sediment cores from Lough Neagh, and in sediment cores from Lough Augher. Preservation data, combined with geochemical analysis (Si, Fe), provide an insight into silica cycling and diatom accumulation over a range of temporal scales from these lakes. Diatom preservation was generally good for the Lough Neagh material, although differential (better) preservation of the smaller Aulacoseira subarctica compared to the larger Stephanodiscus neoastraea sensu lato valves was clear, especially in sediments. Porewater silica showed a complex seasonal pattern in the upper sediment, against expectations of steady-state. The Lough Augher material was generally poorly preserved, although preservation (dissolution) was significantly (and positively) correlated to bulk sedimentation rate, and was found to be a major control on (net) diatom accumulation rate across the basin. Past seasonal and severe anoxia at Lough Augher did not improve diatom preservation, contrary to some previous studies, which may be due to extreme changes in sedimentary redox conditions. Finally, using published experimental relationships between dissolution and diatom valve loss, correction factors were applied to previously published profiles of diatom accumulation over the last similar to 150 years (biovolume from Lough Neagh and frustule accumulation rate from Lough Augher), which suggest that diatom productivity estimates from sedimentary records are underestimated by a factor of 2-4 due to dissolution effects alone. The results clearly have implications for the reliability and accuracy of diatom-based inferences made from sediment records, both qualitative and quantitative, especially for those that employ diatoms as direct measures of productivity or biodiversity.

Within-lake distribution patterns of fish assemblages: the relative roles of spatial, temporal and random environmental factors in assessing fish assemblages using gillnets in a large and shallow temperate lake	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												In this study, the relative role of spatio-temporal factors and associated environmental variables (water transparency and temperature) were quantified in relation to gillnet samples of fishes in a large and shallow lake (Lake Balaton, Hungary). Most of the variance (56 center dot 1%) in the relative abundance data (%) was related to the vertical segregation of fishes. This gradient substantially affected the catch per unit effort (CPUE) by number of the dominant species, the surface-oriented bleak Alburnus alburnus and the benthic common bream Abramis brama. It also influenced total CPUE, mean fish mass and species richness and diversity. At the lake level, horizontal habitat heterogeneity (i.e. littoral v. offshore) accounted for only 8 center dot 3% of the total variance in relative abundance data, but was important in structuring the CPUE of the ruffe Gymnocephalus cernua and the pikeperch Sander lucioperca. The longitudinal environmental gradient (i.e. lake basin), year and season of sampling, water transparency and temperature had significant effects on relative abundance only at the habitat level, but were also important components of variability of CPUE in some species at the lake level. As sampling schemes need to consider the main gradients in fish assemblage distributions, the use of surface and pelagic gillnets should be more intensively incorporated in the study and monitoring of fish assemblages in shallow lakes and lake habitats.

Typhoons initiate predictable change in aquatic bacterial communities	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We explored patterns of change in bacterioplankton and phytoplankton community composition in response to typhoons in a subtropical, subalpine freshwater humic lake in Taiwan. Thermal profiles with depth, near-surface dissolved oxygen, and meteorological conditions were measured at high temporal resolution using an instrumented buoy. We collected samples across a time series spanning two typhoon seasons and assessed bacterial community composition at each time point using a fingerprinting technique targeting the internal transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal RNA operon. Wind and rain associated with the typhoons mixed the otherwise stably stratified water column. After each of six typhoon-induced mixing events, the bacterial community composition was reset to similar conditions, revealing a surprisingly deterministic pattern of recovery that was reminiscent of secondary succession following large infrequent disturbances in terrestrial ecosystems. Distinct bacterial assemblages were associated with epilimnion and hypolimnion samples collected more than 80 d after a mixing event. These assemblages were also distinct from the communities observed in the generally unstratified water column within 7 d after a typhoon. Our results were surprising since bacterial communities are not expected to respond in such predictable ways because of their immense complexity and diversity. In contrast, phytoplankton communities did not recover in a predictable way after typhoons.

The three largest and most concerning plateau lakes (Dianchi, Erhai, and Fuxian lakes) in south-western China were selected as case studies to demonstrate their different hydrological responses attributing to the local climatic and watershed characteristics. We processed 27 climate change scenarios according to the local climate characteristics and simulated the daily runoff of each lake basin under the historical and the 27 climate change scenarios. Then we analyzed the change of mean annual and seasonal runoff, and hydrological extremes of each lake basin. The results indicate a great risk of socio-economic and ecological for these plateau lakes as climate change will significantly alter the horological regimes of each lake basin. The mean annual runoff of the three lake basins will change from-65.24 to 54.17 %, when the air temperature increases by 1-2 degrees C and pre-cipitation changes from -20 to + 20 %. Climatic and topographic heterogeneities caused each lake basin responded differently to climate change. Among them, the LFB was more sensitive to climate change than the LDB and LEB. Changes in the annual and seasonal runoff for the LFB were approximately 1.5-fold higher than that of the LDB and LEB. The hydrological extremes in the LFB also had the most significant changes. To cope with future climate change, each lake requires reasonable and effective mitigation measures.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				MAR	2023	147								110015	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110015		FEB 2023											WOS:000946515300001

Hydraulic flushing as a Prymnesium parvum bloom-terminating mechanism in a subtropical lake	HARMFUL ALGAE												Prymnesium parvum blooms have increased in frequency and magnitude in the south-central USA in recent years, resulting in large fish kills and economic losses. Here, we document seasonal and system-wide plankton dynamics of Lake Granbury, TX, over a period spanning the formation and termination of a large, highly toxic, P. parvum bloom that occurred from January through March 2007. High-resolution spatial mapping showed that this bloom was system-wide and patchy during its peak densities. Consistent with laboratory studies, the highest in-lake toxicity to fish occurred during peak bloom density and under the most stressful in-lake conditions (based on salinity, temperature, light and inorganic nutrients). As with other P. parvum blooms, this bloom at its peak density was near monospecific, with P. parvum accounting for similar to 92% of the phytoplankton biomass, and diatoms, cyanobacteria and green algae comprising most of the remaining biomass. A large inflow event in April obliterated this bloom, dramatically reducing population densities by 89% and completely removing toxicity to fish. Interestingly, the bloom had already started to decline somewhat before this hydraulic flushing event affected the lake. During this decline, in-lake conditions were not likely stressful to P. parvum, and predation did not appear to be a factor. The role of pathogens of P. parvum was not assessed during this study, however. Our findings show a strong link between hydrology and bloom termination, which raises concerns given that in-stream flows are predicted to decline as human population increases in this region. In addition, flow reduction may be exacerbated by climate change. Increased understanding of factors that influence P. parvum blooms is paramount given the possible need to offset the effect of diminished hydraulic flushing. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Hence, data on seasonal and spatial variations of phytoplankton primary production (PP) is needed to estimate their ecological state. However, considerable difficulties arise when investigating the spatial and temporal variations of productivity in inland waters. Traditional in situ sampling approaches cannot provide the necessary data over large lakes or for lakes over large geographic regions. A solution can be to combine modelling with satellite data, by using different satellite products as inputs for a primary production model. The objective of this study is to evaluate and validate a lake primary production model based on satellite products. For that purpose we compared PP(sat) with PP(in situ) in two large, shallow, well mixed, and eutrophic Estonian lakes. A semi-empirical phytoplankton primary production model, derived by us earlier, was used. It allows estimating the values of phytoplankton primary production for lakes over large geographic areas. The primary production model operated well using MERIS products as input data. Our results show that spatial variability in primary production cannot be neglected in large lakes. Combining satellite data with model calculations allows monitoring of the state of lakes in space and time, providing a new perspective for lake primary production studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, correlations between cyanobacterial blooms and hydro-meteorological factors, including water quality, temperature and precipitation were investigated. Results demonstrated that South Taihu Lake was heavily affected by cyanobacteria and the proliferation of cyanobacteria due to variations in hydro-meteorological factors and water quality conditions. Water quality parameters, including COD, NH3-N, TN and TP improved significantly since 2008 even at an elevated cyanobacterial bloom situation. Correlation analyses have shown that the development of cyanobacterial density and chlorophyll a concentration was sensitive to a wider temperature variation. The optimum temperature for cyanobacteria was 20 degrees C, while extremely low and high temperatures were found to suppress their growth. Moreover, unusual rainfall patterns were measured during the study period (2003-2009), which showed an adverse impact on cyanobacterial development. Findings from this study suggested that seasonal lake's water quality monitoring; suitable treatment of cyanobacterial blooms and strict policy implementation can solve the water quality issues in highly eutrophic lakes like Taihu.					; Xu, Xinhua/ABG-6289-2021; Qasim, Muhammad/AGP-8795-2022; Lu-Tervola, Xiaoshu/G-5183-2016	Baig, Shams Ali/0000-0001-7419-909X; xu, xinhua/0000-0001-7139-1246; Qasim, Muhammad/0000-0002-1472-7150; 													0275-7540	1029-0370				JAN	2017	33	1					76	87		10.1080/02757540.2016.1261122	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02757540.2016.1261122													WOS:000392971400006

Due to the small sizes and rapid water dynamics, monitoring the extent of small lakes fluctuating between 2.5 and 30 km(2) require observations with both high spatial and temporal resolutions. The paper applied an improved surface reflectance (SR) downscaling method (i.e., IMAR (Improved Modified Adaptive Regression model)) to downscale the daily SR acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra platform to a consistent 250-m resolution, and derived monthly water extent of four small lakes in the Tibetan Plateau (Longre Co, Ayonggongma Co, Ayonggama Co, and Ayongwama Co)) from 2000 to 2014. Using Landsat ETM+ acquired on the same date, the downscaled MODIS SR and identified water extent were compared to the original MODIS, observations downscaled using an early SR downscaling method (MAR (Modified Adaptive Regression model)) and Wavelet fusion. The results showed IMAR achieved the highest correlation coefficients (R-2) (0.89-0.957 for SR and 0.79-0.933 for water extent). The errors in the derived water extents were significantly decreased comparing to the results of MAR and Wavelet fusion, and lakes morphometry of IMAR is more comparable to Landsat results. The detected lake extents dynamic between 2000 and 2014 were analyzed using the trend and season decomposition model (BFAST), indicating an increasing trend after 2005, and it likely had higher correlations with temperature and precipitation variation in the Tibetan region (R-2: 0.598-0.728 and 0.61-0.735, respectively).

Species distribution models, which are based on both environmental and socio-economic variables, facilitate the identification of the most vulnerable areas for the spread of non-native species. We used MaxEnt to predict the potential distribution of 20 non-native aquatic macrophytes in the Iberian Peninsula. Some selected variables, such as the temperature seasonality and the precipitation in the driest quarter, highlight the importance of the climate on their distribution. Notably, the human influence in the territory appears as a key variable in the distribution of studied species. The model discriminated between favorable and unfavorable areas with high accuracy. We used the model to build an invasion risk map of aquatic macrophytes for the Iberian Peninsula that included results from 20 individual models. It showed that the most vulnerable areas are located near to the sea, the major rivers basins, and the high population density areas. These facts suggest the importance of the human impact on the colonization and distribution of non-native aquatic macrophytes in the Iberian Peninsula, and more precisely agricultural development during the Green Revolution at the end of the 70's. Our work also emphasizes the utility of species distribution models for the prevention and management of biological invasions.

The seasonal cycles for ice concentration, thickness, velocity, and other variables are well reproduced in the 2003/04 ice season. Satellite measurements of ice cover were used to validate GLIM with a mean bias deviation (MBD) of 7.4%. The seasonal cycle for lake surface temperature is well reproduced in comparison to the satellite measurements with a MBD of 1.5%. Additional sensitivity experiments further confirm the important impacts of ice cover on lake water temperature and water level variations. Furthermore, a period including an extreme cooling (due to a cold air outbreak) and an extreme warming event in February 2004 was examined to test GLIM's response to rapidly-changing synoptic forcing.

This study focused on producing an initial record of thermo- and physicochemical properties of local forest species. For this purpose, leaf samples of species found in the Penuelas Lake National Reserve, namely Pinus radiata, Eucalyptus globulus, Acacia dealbata, Quillaja saponaria and Cryptocarya alba, were collected and analysed. Higher and lower heating value, flash point, density and moisture content tests were performed for each sample. Overall results showed that lower heating values measured for both native and exotic species could indicate a high energy release source in wildfires. However, differences in the flash point between species indicated that C. alba and E. globulus had a lower ignition resistance than other species tested, possibly due to a lower flash point. In contrast, Q. saponaria and A. dealbata had the highest flash point for native and exotic species respectively. Finally, all presented data and procedures were aimed at establishing a foundation for a national database of critical forest species properties to be used in wildfire simulation tools.

During each season from October 2013 to July 2014, samples of POM from 14 lakes and reservoirs in Northern China were collected. The lakes and reservoirs were meso-eutrophic with considerably high brackish ions (SO42-, 173 mg/L; Cl-, 296 mg/L) in Yangtze River lake, and high total nitrogen: total phosphorus ratio (averaged with 772) or dissolved inorganic nitrogen: soluble reactive phosphorus molar ratios (averaged with 1077) in mountainous reservoirs. The delta C-13(POM), delta N-15(POM), carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratios showed significant seasonal variation, with ranges of - 32.5 to - 17.4 parts per thousand, - 3.6 to 13.5 parts per thousand, and 5.1-13.2, respectively, while they were hard to be distinguished among types of water sources. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that brackish ions, nutrients, and their molar ratios were the main factors influencing variations in delta C-13(POM) and delta N-15(POM). delta C-13(POM) and C/N ratios suggested autochthonous primary production mainly contributed to POM during from April to October, while exogenous organic matter might mainly contribute these carbon pools in January. The low values of delta N-15(POM) (< 0 parts per thousand) and negative correlation between delta N-15(POM) and TN suggested discharge of agricultural waste water (e.g., fertilizers, irrigation tailwater) in Bailanghe, Xinan, and Taihe Reservoir during the fertilization season, while higher values indicated domestic sewage input to waterbodies (e.g., Mishan, Gengjing, Donghai Reservoir). Our results suggested that the aquatic ecosystem in water-receiving area of SNWTP would be potentially affected by the inter-basin water diversion, and thus, ecosystem-based strategies were also presented accordingly.					wang, mingquan/HJA-0140-2022														0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2020	27	3					2805	2818		10.1007/s11356-019-07040-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-07040-7								31832967					WOS:000514849100028

This paper presents an integrated approach to forecast seasonal Chl-a concentration in coastal waters. Before modeling, feature construction procedures, such as simplification, combination, and normalization, are conducted to identify the potentially significant features. The feature extraction method based on Random Forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient BOOSTing (XGBoost) is applied to select relevant variables. Then, we propose a Cluster-stacking-based approach which includes a station-oriented clustering model and a stacking-based regression model. The former model is used to divide the observation stations into several groups, thus partitions the study region into several sub-regions and the study dataset into several subsets according to the corresponding stations. In each subset, single regression models including K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multi-Layer Perceptron regression (MLP) and XGBoost are established in level 0 space and integrated by RF in level 1 space via stacked generalization. We compare the performance of the Cluster-stacking model with that of Cluster-KNN, Cluster-SVR, Cluster-MLP, Cluster-XGBoost and the regression stacking model without cluster. The model evaluation shows that the Cluster-stacking-based approach outperforms others in forecasting Chl-a concentration with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.848 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.665 ug/l.

The precipitation response to the desiccation of Lake Chad	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												Located in the semi-arid African Sahel, Lake Chad has shrunk from a surface area of 25000 km2 in 1960 to about 1350 km2 due to a series of droughts and anthropogenic influences. The disappearance of such a large open-water body can be expected to have a noticeable effect on the meteorology in the surroundings of the lake. The impact could extend even further to the west as westward propagating convective systems pass Lake Chad in the rainfall season. This study examines the sensitivity of the regional hydrology and convective processes to the desiccation of the lake using a regional atmospheric model. Three Lake Chad scenarios are applied reflecting the situation in 1960, the current situation and a potential future scenario in which the lake and the surrounding wetlands have disappeared. The model simulations span the months JulySeptember in 2006, which includes the rainfall season in the Lake Chad area. Total precipitation amounts and the components of the hydrological cycle are found to be hardly affected by the existence of the lake. A filled Lake Chad does, however, increase the precipitation at the east side of the lake. The model results indicate that the boundary layer moisture and temperature are significantly altered downwind of the lake. By investigating a mesoscale convective system (MCS) case, this is found to affect the development and progress of the system. At first, the MCS is intensified by the more unstable boundary layer air but the persistence of the system is altered as the cold pool propagation becomes less effective. The proposed mechanism is able to explain the differences in the rainfall patterns nearby Lake Chad between the scenarios. This highlights the local sensitivity to the desiccation of Lake Chad whereas the large-scale atmospheric processes are not affected.

Massey			Variability in Pesticide Deposition and Source Contributions to Snowpack in Western US National Parks	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Fifty-six seasonal snowpack samples were collected at remote alpine, subarctic, and arctic sites in eight Western U.S. national parks during three consecutive years (2003-2005). Four current-use pesticides (CUPs) (dacthal (DCPA), chlorpyrifos, endosulfans, and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH)) and four historic-use pesticides (HUPs) (dieldrin, alpha-HCH, chlordanes, and hexachlorobenzene (HCB)) were commonly measured at all sites, during all years. The mean coefficient of variation for pesticide concentrations was 15% for site replicate samples, 41% for intrapark replicate samples, and 59% for interannual replicate samples. The relative pesticide concentration profiles were consistent from year to year but unique for individual parks, indicating a regional source effect. HUP concentrations were well-correlated with regional cropland intensity when the effect of temperature on snow-air partitioning was considered. The mass of individual CUPs used in regions located one-day upwind of the parks was calculated using air mass back trajectories, and this was used to explain the distribution of CUPs among the parks. The percent of the snowpack pesticide concentration due to regional transport was high (>75%) for the majority of pesticides in all parks. These results suggest that the majority of pesticide contamination in U.S. national parks is due to regional pesticide use in North America.

Irrigation (470 +/- 33 mm) was measured using V-notches; rainfall did not occur, and the groundwater table was monitored daily using piezometers to estimate recharge from irrigated onion fields using the groundwater table fluctuation method. Recharge was influenced by applied irrigation amount, groundwater table depth, seasonal temperature variations, irrigation application efficiency and crop growth stages. The decreased deep percolation during the hottest periods and peak growth stages negatively influenced the reduction in groundwater decline caused by irrigation. The soil anisotropy also played a major role in the recharge amount: despite clay dominance in the topsoils, rapid groundwater table rises (0.02-0.56 m) were due to the presence of granular and blocky structures. Recharge was also influenced by irrigation efficiency, indicating higher recharge during periods of lower efficiency. The seasonal recharge was 34-46% of applied irrigation and there is much room for improving irrigation efficiency which is only 46 (+/- 12) to 51 (+/- 17)%.

AQUATIC BOTANY												Submerged macrophyte habitats provide significant benefits to estuarine systems. In southeast Louisiana, Myriophyllum spicatunt L (milfoil) and Ruppia maritime L. (widgeongrass) are dominant species existing across fresh to brackish areas. Though frequently co-occurring across the range of salinity and light conditions, their individual responses to changing environmental conditions from restoration, weather and climate may determine overall species distribution, and biomass abundance. We compared milfoil and widgeongrass growth (i.e., biomass increase) across a range of salinity and light, in monoculture (salinity: 0, 5, 10, 15, 20; light: high (similar to) 50% ambient; low (similar to) 20% ambient), and in mixture (salinity: 0, 10, 20; light: high, low). In monoculture, milfoil growth was reduced at high salinity (20) versus low salinity (0), while biomass allocation differed significantly with greater allocation to shoots under high light, compared to low light. Widgeongrass was minimally affected by salinity, with reduced stem densities at high salinity compared to low salinity. In mixture, both species under yielded compared to monoculture with milfoil reduced with high salinity and light, and low salinity and light; widgeongrass under-yielded with low salinity and high light, and mid salinity (10) and low light. These differences in species' responses suggest that salinity and light contribute to the distribution of milfoil and widgeongrass, with higher salinities and light favoring widgeongrass growth, and lower light possibly decreasing both species' growth, and ultimately, distribution. With continued changes occurring and predicted from both coastal restoration and climate change, understanding drivers of habitat forming species remains critical to inform future landscapes.					; LaPeyre, Megan/LJL-1449-2024	La Peyre, Megan/0000-0001-9936-2252; 													0304-3770	1879-1522				APR	2019	155						25	31		10.1016/j.aquabot.2019.02.007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2019.02.007													WOS:000467509400004

Production-level risk factors for syncytial hepatitis in farmed tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L)	JOURNAL OF FISH DISEASES												Syncytial hepatitis (SHT) is an emerging viral disease of tilapia characterized by significant morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to establish the production-level risk factors associated with presence and severity of SHT. Production factors were analysed during multiple outbreaks of SHT that occurred between 2011 and 2013 on a single tilapia farm in Ecuador and compared with the year 2010 before the SHT outbreaks. Relative risks, t tests, modified Poisson and forward stepwise linear regression analyses were performed using EPIINFO. Compared to other strains, Chitralada had an elevated risk of SHT [RR=2.1 (95%CI 1.8-2.4)]. Excessive mortality associated with the presence (and severity) of SHT increased by 611 (365), 6,814 (5,768) and 388 (340) deaths per 100,000 fry when stocking density, dissolved oxygen and pond production cycles were raised by 1 fish/m(2), 1mg/L and 1 cycle, respectively. Excessive mortality associated with the presence (and severity) of SHT decreased by 337 (258) and 1,354 (1,025) deaths per 100,000 when stocking weight and water temperature increased by 1g and 1 degrees C, respectively. Time (season and stocking year) was not significantly associated with SHT. This study shows that some production factors increase the risk incidence and severity of SHTon a farm.																			0140-7775	1365-2761				JAN	2018	41	1					61	66		10.1111/jfd.12672	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfd.12672								28921572					WOS:000418245400007

Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), which consists of complex compounds, was seen as a proxy of water quality. An attempt was made to understand the relationships of CDOM absorption parameters and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) components with PAHs under seasonal variation in the riverine, reservoir, and urban waters of the Yinma River watershed in 2016. These different types of water bodies provided wide CDOM and PAHs concentration ranges with CDOM absorption coefficients at a wavelength of 350 nm (a(CDOM)(350)) of 1.17-20.74 m(-1) and total PAHs of 0-1829 ng/L. CDOM excitation-emission matrix (EEM) presented two fluorescent components, e.g., terrestrial humic-like (C1) and tryptophan-like (C2) were identified using PARAFAC. Tryptophan-like associated protein-like fluorescence often dominates the EEM signatures of sewage samples. Our finding is that seasonal CDOM EEM-PARAFAC and PAHs concentration showed consistent tendency indicated that PAHs were un-ignorable pollutants. However, the disparities in seasonal CDOM-PAH relationships relate to the similar sources of CDOM and PAHs, and the proportion of PAHs in CDOM. Overlooked and poorly appreciated, quantifying the relationship between CDOM and PAHs has important implications, because these results simplify ecological and health-based risk assessment of pollutants compared to the traditional chemical measurements.

Population growth potential of rotifers from a high altitude eutrophic waterbody, Madin reservoir (State of Mexico, Mexico): The importance of seasonal sampling	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												To understand the population growth potential of different species of rotifers in nature, field collections through seasons are essential. We sampled zooplankton (and measured selected physicochemical variables) from the Madin reservoir, a high altitude eutrophic urban waterbody from Mexico, every month for a year. Qualitative analysis of zooplankton revealed 28 rotifer species and four cladoceran crustaceans plus one unidentified copepod. Cephalodella catellina (1400 ind L-1). Horaella thomassoni (550 hid L-1), Conochilus dossuarius (380 ind L-1) and Filinia Iongiseta (25 ind L-1) had higher peak density than other rotifers. Based on the concentrations of nitrates and phosphates, chlorophyll a levels or different diversity indices (e.g., Carlson, Shannon-Wiener. Pantile and Buck, Ejsmont-Karabin's TSI (Rot)). the waterbody is eutrophic to hypertrophic, depending on the season. In this waterbody we observed high densities of Aphanothece sp. which is a toxic picocyanobacterium. During the blooms of Aphanothece. we also recorded higher densities of H. thomassoni and C. catellina. Based on the gut contents we found that both these rotifer species feed on Aphanothece in this waterbody. This study thus suggests the potential growth of Horaella, Cephalodella, Conochilus an d Filima in this eutrophic reservoir containing blooms of Aphanothece.					; Nandini, S./AFN-8031-2022; Sarma, S.S.S./G-3634-2010	Sarma, S.S.S./0000-0003-2820-1579; Moreno Gutierrez, Rosa Martha/0009-0005-0994-7115; Sobrino-Figueroa, Alma/0000-0001-9488-828X													1129-5767	1723-8633					2018	77	3					441	451		10.4081/jlimnol.2018.1823	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2018.1823													WOS:000456092500008

Comparison of WT with local air temperature indicates that the WT variability patterns are likely attributable to both meteorological forcing and internal lake dynamics. We identified seasonal patterns of WT variability and showed that WT variability increases with increasing Schmidt stability, decreasing Lake number and decreasing ice cover duration, and is higher near the shore than in open water. We introduced the slope of WT spectra as an indicator for the degree of lake mixing to help explain the identified temporal and spatial scales of WT variability. The explanatory power of this indicator in other lakes with different mixing regimes remains to be established.

Potentially sensitive receptors to acid deposition in the coastal region of the Gulf of Mexico are lakes, rivers, forests, soils and monuments of cultural heritage. The aim of this study was to evaluate the chemical composition, enrichment factors and trends of wet atmospheric deposition at La Mancha, Veracruz, from 2003 to 2014. The major ions, pH and conductivity were analyzed daily during rainy and dry seasons. The following value ranges of the annual volume weighted mean (VWM) were: pH: 4.78-5.40; SO42-: 16-32 mu eq L-1; NO3-: 4-15 mu eq L-1, among others. The principal findings were found: (1) acid rain has been present for more than a decade along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico; (2) the non-marine ions in decreasing order were: NO3-, NH4+, Ca+ and SO42-; (3) all of the ions were present in major concentrations during the dry season due to minimal precipitation; (4) in several cases, the value of the pH events was low during the rainy season due to the low presence of chemical species that neutralization; (5) the VWM pH in wet deposition was in the range of 4.78 to 5.40 during the study period (2003-2014), and (6) a significant increasing trend for pH was observed during the entire study period, while an increasing trend occurred from 2003 to 2008 for SO42-, NO3-, K+ and Ca2+, which decreased until 2011 and then increased until 2014.					; Echeverría, Rodolfo/ABD-4614-2020	Granados, Elias/0000-0001-6157-898X; Sosa Echeverria, Rodolfo/0000-0003-2536-7266													0187-6236	2395-8812					2018	31	4					317	330		10.20937/ATM.2018.31.04.01	http://dx.doi.org/10.20937/ATM.2018.31.04.01													WOS:000456947300005

The aim was to reconstruct the lake water level and climatic changes during the past 2500 years. The recognized diatom assemblages displayed marked floristic changes along the sediment core samples. The main change in diatom composition consists of a shift from an assemblage dominated by benthic Fragilaria sensu lato species through marked intervals to a planktonic one in distinct zones. A high proportion of benthic to plankton taxa has been reported as indicative for a lowering of the lake level with long ice cover in a cold dry climate and a shift from benthic to planktonic diatom taxa reflects arising water level with longest growing season and reduced ice cover on the lake during a wann wet climate. Multivariate statistical analysis included hierarchical ascending clustering distinguished four diatom ecological groups. The analyzed core section was divided into 11 diatom zones according to a distribution of ecological groups and variation in abundance of dominant species supported by C-14 data. The results displayed a developmental history of the Mlynek Lake that can be divided into 6 main phases of alternating wann wet and cold dry shifts. A distinct dominance of planktonic eutrophic indicator diatoms accompanied by a low abundance of chrysophyte cysts indicates increased lake trophicity and a general trend for the increasing anthropogenic impact.

Pollution-, temperature- and predator-induced responses in phenotypically plastic gastropod shell traits	MOLLUSCAN RESEARCH												Phenotypically plastic traits adopt different appearances in different environments. Researchers routinely investigate environmental variables such as humidity and temperature as influential factors, but predation also can influence phenotype. Gastropods include well-known examples where predation, even if only perceived, can produce shell morphology changes. We conducted a quantitative descriptive study to investigate how apple snail (Pomacea bridgesii) shells changed in response to red-clawed crab (Perisesarma bidens) predator presence when snails were forced to cope with increased pollution levels in water from an industrialised bay in Lake Ontario (Hamilton Harbour, Ontario, Canada). Compared to snails in unpolluted predator-free water, snails in unpolluted predator-containing water grew large thick shells with small apertures; shape differences were produced with relatively tightly coiled, elongated shell apertures. Snails in highly polluted predator-containing water produced thick shells that, contrastingly, changed from relatively short and wide to relatively long and narrow during growth. Antipredator responses that are evoked by waterborne chemical signals thus can be altered by environmental pollutants.																			1323-5818	1448-6067					2018	38	1					34	40		10.1080/13235818.2017.1358587	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13235818.2017.1358587													WOS:000425178000006

While dry-flux studies have shown that desiccating waterbodies emit carbon dioxide (CO2) 2 ) and methane (CH4) 4 ) from exposed sediments, these studies are often seasonal and for freshwater systems, limiting their application to chronically desiccating saline lakes. We measured CO2 2 and CH4 4 emissions (April to November, 2020) from the exposed sediments of Great Salt Lake (Utah, United States), and compared them with aquatic emissions estimates to determine the anthropogenic emissions associated with desiccation. In 2020, the lake bed emitted 4.1 million tons of CO 2eq to the atmosphere, primarily (94%) as CO2 , 2 , constituting a' ' 7% increase to Utah's anthropogenic GHG emissions. As climate change exacerbates drought in arid regions, anthropogenic desiccation and associated climate feedbacks should be considered in assessments of global GHG trajectories as well as local GHG emissions reduction efforts.

Numerous reviews highlight multifaceted controversies, and scholars from diverse fields have attempted reconciliation, yet pessimism prevails. The authors perform a detailed exploration of the current controversies and debates surrounding eutrophication strategies. After leveraging a combination of historical data review, theoretical insights, and advanced modeling, we identify common roots of these controversies, primarily improper problem framing or boundary setting caused by conceptual weaknesses, methodological omissions and residual variability when dealing with complex nexuses, which can lead to multifinality, equifinality, or insoluble problems in subsequent research, fostering redundant and intense debates. Therefore, more efficient techniques during problem framing or conceptual model construction, fully should be emphasized, balancing realism and practicability. Instead of seeking a panacea for eutrophication restoration, we propose an Improved Analytic Hierarchy Process (IAHP) method and an Iteratively Evolutionary Modeling Cycle Method, based on newly proposed sets of criteria. The IAHP method combines traditional Analytic Hierarchy Process with multivariate statistics, breaking down complex problems into a hierarchical structure and determining factor weights through pairwise comparisons or multivariable statistics. The Iteratively Evolutionary Modeling Cycle Method tackles complex modeling by segregating processes into six iterative steps, ensuring expertise-specific problem-solving while fostering communication and collaboration across steps. Both approaches emphasize segmented, iterative optimization, avoiding equifinality and multifinality problems, reconciling conflicts among diverse dimensions and aligning with the principles of Occam's Razor. These methods offer valuable approaches to addressing conflicts arising from multifactorial issues.

Phytoplankton as a monitoring tool in a tropical urban shallow reservoir (Garcas Pond): the assemblage index application	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This study aimed at evaluating phytoplankton as a monitoring tool for water quality assessment in an urban shallow eutrophic reservoir considering temporal and vertical scales. Garcas Reservoir is located in the Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga Biological Reserve (23 degrees 38 ' 08 '' S and 23 degrees 40 ' 18 '' S; 46 degrees 36 ' 48 '' W and 46 degrees 38 ' 00 '' W) that lies in the southeastern part of the Municipality of Sao Paulo, southeast Brazil. Samplings were carried out monthly during 8 consecutive years (1997-2004) following the water column vertical profile (5 depths: subsurface, 1, 2, 3 m and similar to 20 cm from the bottom). Abiotic variables analyzed were: water temperature, electric conductivity, DO, pH, total alkalinity, free CO2, dissolved inorganic carbon, N series, P series and SiO4H4. Biological variables studied were: total density, total biomass and chlorophyll a, which were integrated arithmetically. At the beginning of the 8 year series, Garcas Reservoir was an eutrophic ecosystem with 20% of its surface covered by Eichhornia crassipes (phase I: January 1997-March 1998). Water hyacinth reached 70% of pond surface coverage (phase II: April 1998-August 1999), and then it was mechanically removed (phase III: September 1999-December 2004). After this intervention, drastic alteration in the limnological features was detected, leading to the conclusion that removal of the aquatic macrophyte modified nutrient dynamics drastically reduced water transparency and led to photosynthetic productivity and phytoplankton biomass increase, the latter becoming a physical barrier to light penetration. Twenty one functional groups 'sensu' Reynolds were identified. Cyanobacteria contribution played the main role during the drastic alterations that occurred after water hyacinth removal. Results of ecological status of reservoir using Q index showed statistical difference among the 3 limnological phases (one way ANOVA; F = 119.4; P = 0.000). Regarding Q index classification, Garcas Reservoir limnological phases were characterized as follows: (1) phase I: 0 >= Q <= 2.9, medium to bad; (2) phase II: 1.4 >= Q <= 3, tolerable to medium; and (3) phase III: 0 >= Q <= 1.5, bad to tolerable ecological states.

Factors influencing return-to-creel of hatchery catchable-sized Rainbow Trout stocked in Idaho lentic waters	FISHERIES RESEARCH												In recent years, increases in hatchery rearing and transport costs coupled with stagnate or declining funding has often resulted in reduced numbers of hatchery fish stocked in public waters. This has intensified the need to better understand how to maximize return-to-creel rates of hatchery trout by identifying factors contributing to better post-stocking performance. From 2011 through 2014, we tagged 50,745 catchable-sized hatchery Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and stocked them into 54 different lentic waters in Idaho (mostly impoundments) across 226 individual stocking events. Angler tag returns (n = 5092) were used to generate water-specific estimates of angler return rates (i.e., the proportion of stocked fish caught by anglers) and average daysat-large of captured fish. We then modeled water-specific angler return rates and days-at-large against a suite of water- and stocking-specific characteristics to determine what factors most influenced both angler returns and fishery longevity. First-year angler return rates across all four study years averaged 23% and ranged from 0% to 76% for individual stocking events; the variation in angler returns was best explained by mean fish length at stocking, water size, rearing hatchery, and water elevation. Average days-at-large for angled fish in individual waters varied from a low of 10 d to a high of 297 d, and this variation was best explained by water size, stocking season, and the rearing hatchery. We found the highest angler returns for larger trout stocked into smaller waters at lower elevations. However, these smaller waters also had shorter fisheries, requiring more frequent stocking to prolong the fisheries through the entire angling season. When considering these findings, managers must also consider the balance between angler catch, effort, and satisfaction as they work towards maximizing the benefit to anglers from put-and-take fisheries.																			0165-7836	1872-6763				AUG	2018	204						316	323		10.1016/j.fishres.2018.03.005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2018.03.005													WOS:000432768000034

The objective of this study was to investigate the presence and concentrations of Campylobacter, and determine the influence of agricultural activities and precipitation on their presence, at lake beaches used for water recreation in southern Quebec, Canada. A total of 413 water samples were collected from June to August, from 22 beaches, between 2011 and 2013. The overall proportion of positive water samples was estimated to be 33.9% (95% Cl:27.7, 40.1) for C. jejuni and 49.7% (95% Cl:41. 8,57.6) for Campylobacter spp. The concentrations of both thermotolerant Campylobacter spp. and C. jejuni ranged from 20 to 900 bacteria/L of water. Logistic regressions showed that the presence of C. jejuni and Campylobacter spp. was significantly associated with the year and season. Other significant predictors of C. jejuni, but not Campylobacter spp., included the presence of precipitation the day before sampling and the presence of ruminant farms within a 5 km radius of the beach. The present study provides insights into the risk of Campylobacter presence in recreational lake water for better understanding public health risks.					; Guy, Rebecca/A-8864-2008; Kotchi, Serge/R-2237-2019; Arsenault, Julie/D-5077-2015	Kotchi, Serge Olivier/0000-0002-4931-1489; Arsenault, Julie/0000-0001-8382-7326; Guy, Rebecca A./0000-0002-9833-4994; 													1477-8920					AUG	2018	16	4					516	529		10.2166/wh.2018.222	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wh.2018.222								30067235					WOS:000440471200004

Taxonomical Resolution and Distribution of Bacterioplankton Along the Vertical Gradient Reveals Pronounced Spatiotemporal Patterns in Contrasted Temperate Freshwater Lakes	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												We examined the relationship between viruses and co-occurring bacterial communities across spatiotemporal scale in two contrasting freshwater lakes, namely meromictic Lake Pavin and dimictic Lake Aydat (Central France). Next-generation sequencing of 16S rRNA genes suggested distinct patterns in bacterioplankton community composition (BCC) between the lakes over depths and seasons. BCC were generally dominated by members of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes covering about 95% of all sequences. Oxygen depletion at the bottom waters in Aydat and existence of permanent anoxia in the monimolimnion of Pavin resulted in the occurrence and dominance of lesser known members of lake communities such as Methylotenera, Methylobacter, Gallionella, Sulfurimonas, and Syntrophus in Pavin and Methylotenera and Sulfuritalea in Aydat. Differences in BCC appeared strongly related to dissolved oxygen concentration, temperature, viral infection, and virus-to-bacteria ratio. UniFrac analysis indicated a clear distinction in BCC when the percentage of viral infected bacterial cells and virus-to-bacteria ratio exceeded a threshold level of 10% and 5, respectively, suggesting a link between viruses and their potential bacterial host communities. Our study revealed that in both the lakes, the prevailing environmental factors across time and space structured and influenced the adaptation of bacterial communities to specific ecological niches.					; Keshri, Jitendra/K-5529-2012; Sime-Ngando, Télesphore/M-4134-2019	NANA, Paul Alain/0000-0002-0121-652X; Sime-Ngando, Telesphore/0000-0002-7240-5803; 													0095-3628	1432-184X				AUG	2018	76	2					372	386		10.1007/s00248-018-1143-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-018-1143-y								29340714					WOS:000439727300008

However, there are virtually no longitudinal studies that have assessed long-term effects of forest harvesting on boreal birds. The Calling Lake Fragmentation Study is a long-term experiment in northern Alberta's boreal forest, established in 1993. We have 24 years of avian point count data (1993-2016) from this study site, giving us the opportunity to study how the boreal songbird community has responded over 23 years to forest regeneration after harvesting. We ran multi-season occupancy models of 51 species surveyed at 72 stations (8 stations per 40-ha sampling area) within 3 unharvested forest sites, 3 harvest units that were cut in 1984 and treated to enhance conifer survival, and 3 harvest units that were cut in 1994 and left untreated to regenerate naturally. Eight of 21 species associated with older boreal forests (60-80 years old) used harvest units 23-33 years post-harvest. Eleven of 16 species associated with shrublands or younger forests used harvest units, before declining as harvest units regenerated, while four of 16 such species increased their probability of occupying harvest units over the monitoring period. Increased occupancy by 5 Neotropical migrants and 2 short-distance migrants was associated with increased El Nino weather events preceding a given breeding season. We also found evidence that increased occupancy of 3 species within harvest units was preceded by and correlated with increased occupancy by those species in unharvested forests, while occupancy of 4 species in unharvested forests was preceded by and con-elated with increased occupancy within harvest units. Our results indicate the importance of unharvested forests for some boreal songbird species, the utility of longitudinal studies with controls for assessing changes in occupancy due to forest regeneration in harvest units versus factors operating at larger spatial scales, and the potential of harvest units to serve as habitat for boreal birds up to 33 years post-harvest.					; Bayne, Erin/IUP-1777-2023	Bayne, Erin/0000-0002-0679-4521; 													0378-1127	1872-7042				AUG 1	2018	421				SI		40	53		10.1016/j.foreco.2018.02.029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2018.02.029													WOS:000432758000005

However, it is a challenging task due to the mixture of trend, seasonal and residual components in time series and the nonlinear relationships between Chla and the hydro-environmental factors. Here we developed a hybrid approach for long-term trend forecast of Chla in lakes, taking the Lake Taihu as an instantiation case, by the integration of Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL), wavelet coherence, and Convolutional Neural Network with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-BiLSTM). The results showed that long-term trends of Chla and the hydro-environmental factors could be effectively separated from the seasonal and residual terms by STL method, thereby enhancing the characterization of long-term variation. The resonance pattern and time lag between Chla and the hydro-environmental factors in the time-frequency domain were accurately identified by wavelet coherence. Chla responded quickly to variations in TP, but showed a time lag response to variations in WT in Lake Taihu. The forecasting method using multivariate and CNN-BiLSTM largely outperformed the other methods for Lake Taihu with regards to R2, RMSE, IOA and peak capture capability, owning to the combination of CNN for extracting local features and the integration of bidirectional propagation mechanism for the acquisition of higher-level features. The proposed hybrid deep learning approach offers an effective solution for the long-term trend forecast of algal blooms in eutrophic lakes and is capable of addressing the complex attributes of hydro-environmental data.					mingtao, hu/LMP-3085-2024														0048-9697	1879-1026				NOV 15	2024	951								175451	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.175451	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.175451		AUG 2024						39134277					WOS:001296849200001
J	Partanen, SB; McNeill, K				Partanen, Sarah B.; McNeill, Kristopher			Global Corrections to Reference Irradiance Spectra for Non-Clear-Sky Conditions	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Photochemical reactions in surface waters play important roles in element cycling and in the removal of organic contaminants, among other processes. A central environmental variable affecting photochemical processes in surface waters is the incoming solar irradiance, as this initiates these processes. However, clear-sky incident irradiance spectra are often used when evaluating the fate of aquatic contaminants, leading to an overestimation of contaminant decay rates due to photochemical transformation. In this work, incident irradiance satellite data were used to develop global-scale non-clear-sky correction factors for commonly used reference irradiance spectra. Non-clear-sky conditions can decrease incident irradiance by over 90% depending on the geographic location and time of the year, with latitudes above 40 degrees N being most heavily affected by seasons. The impact of non-clear-sky conditions on contaminant half-lives was illustrated in a case study of triclosan in lake Greifensee, which showed a 39% increase in the triclosan half-life over the course of a year under non-clear-sky conditions. A global annual average correction factor of 0.76 was determined as an approximate way to account for non-clear-sky conditions. The correction factors are developed at monthly and seasonal resolutions for every location on the globe between 70 degrees N and 60 degrees S at a 4 km spatial resolution and can be used by researchers, practitioners, and regulators who need improved estimates of incident irradiance.					; McNeill, Kristopher/A-9834-2009	Partanen, Sarah/0000-0002-5719-8367; McNeill, Kristopher/0000-0002-2981-2227													0013-936X	1520-5851				FEB 14	2023	57	6					2682	2690		10.1021/acs.est.2c07359	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.2c07359		FEB 2023						36735549					WOS:000931255700001

Indonesian Throughflow and monsoon activity records in the Timor Sea since the last glacial maximum	MARINE MICROPALEONTOLOGY												Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) is known to play an important role in the heat exchange between the Pacific and the Indian Oceans. However, our understanding of the long-term evolution of the ITF and, in particular, the mechanism of heat transport is limited. Here, we present a high-resolution foraminifera-based multi-proxy study in the main ITF outflow area of the Timor Sea, to reconstruct the ITF variability and to understand the relationship between the ITF changes and monsoon activity from the last glacial maximum (LGM) to the Holocene. Our results show that when the strong surface water ITF occurs, high productivity is related to the mixing of the upper water column owing to the wind-driven upwelling rather than the shoaling of the depth of thermocline (DOT). By contrast, the DOT is affected more strongly by the ITF than by the monsoonal wind-driven upwelling in the Indonesian Seas. During the LGM (23-19 ka) and middle Holocene (8-6 ka), warm surface water ITF was dominated owing to the lowered sea level and (or) the higher steric height difference between the western Pacific and eastern Indian Oceans as a result of the strong southeast monsoon. During the early Holocene (11-8 ka) and late Holocene (last similar to 6 ka), because of the postglacial high sea level, the strong northwest monsoon and heavy rains, large amounts of freshwater flowed into the Java Sea from the South China Sea (SCS). The freshwater plug at the southern tip of the Makassar Strait blocked the warm surface flow, thus initiating the enhanced thermocline ITF. In the Timor Sea, the changes in the vertical profile of the ITF were influenced by the glacio-eustatic sea-level changes that have modified the geometry of the pathways within the Indonesian Seas, as well as by the monsoon activity which was modulated by the changes in the insolation with a precessional cyclicity.

The present research investigates a hydrologically important area of Greece, where four natural lakes are concentrated. It aims to quantify any potential long-term trends in lake water area, precipitation, and temperature timeseries. Water area timeseries spanning four decades are estimated by the mNDWI from Landsat satellite imagery and used as an index of each lake's water storage. Precipitation and temperature measurements are obtained from the open access datasets Hydroscope and ERA5-Land, respectively. All of the timeseries were tested seasonally and annually with the Pettitt and Mann-Kendal tests for statistically significant breakpoints and trends detection. No timeseries analysis resulted in a statistically significant (at 0.05 or 0.1 levels) annual or seasonal trend. The hydroclimatic regime over the past forty years in western Greece is found to have been relatively stable. Land use was also assessed to have been relatively unchanging, converging to the overall stability of the local water regime. However, the findings of this research should not be interpreted as a reassurance against climate change, but as a call to further research for the detailed regional and local assessment of climate change and hydroclimatic variability with acknowledged statistical approaches.					; Gourgouletis, Nikolaos/GPX-6733-2022	Gourgouletis, Nikolaos/0000-0003-0674-824X; 														1424-8220				FEB	2023	23	4							2056	10.3390/s23042056	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s23042056								36850653					WOS:000941794000001

Temperature, precipitation, and streamflow would all be affected by climate change in the Ribb watershed. As a result of the disruption of regular hydrological processes, these climate changes have an impact on water resources. The goal of this study was to look into the effects of climate change on the Ribb watershed's hydro-climatic characteristics. The forecasted climatic data for rainfall and temperature (minimum and maximum) came from the CORDEX (Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiments) Africa database. Climate change consequences were investigated using RCP 4.5 emission scenarios for the 2021-2060 time range, compared to the 1985-2005 baselines. The observed precipitation and temperature data were used to adjust for bias. The simulation of stream flow was carried out using the semi-distributed and physically based soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). From 1997 to 2003, the model was calibrated, and from 2004 to 2007, it was validated. To determine the trend of the climate variables, trend test analyses were performed on the various time series data. In all of the experiments conducted, the trend test revealed that historical and forecast precipitation recording stations showed statistically negligible trends for all critical values. At a level of 0.05, the historical and prospective maximum and minimum temperature data revealed increasing patterns. In general, the results demonstrated that meteorological conditions cause the flow to decrease over the season. As a result, climate change will have an impact on the Ribb watersheds water resources.

Although remarkable research achievements have been made concerning CH4 ebullition from inland waters, such as rivers, lakes, and ponds, few have been devoted to CH4 ebullition from plateau reservoirs. The present study focused on CH4 ebullition from the Dahejia Reservoir located in the upper reaches of the Yellow River. We analyzed the spatial and temporal characteristics of CH4 ebullition flux across the water-atmosphere interface between July and August 2021. We also evaluated the influence of microbes on CH4 ebullition flux. The results showed that (1) CH4 ebullition was the dominant mode of CH4 emissions in the study site, which contributed to 78.85 +/- 20% of total CH4 flux. (2) The mean CH4 ebullition flux in the nighttime (0.34 +/- 0.21 mg m(-2) h(-1)) was significantly higher than that in the daytime (0.19 +/- 0.21 mg m(-2) h(-1)). The mean CH4 ebullition flux first decreased and then increased from the upstream (0.52 +/- 0.57 mg m(-2) h(-1)) to the downstream (0.43 +/- 0.3 mg m(-2) h(-1)) of the Yellow River. (3) Sediment microbes affected the CH4 ebullition flux primarily by changing the microbial community abundance. The regression analysis showed that CH4 ebullition flux had a significantly linear negative correlation with microbial abundance in sediments. The redundancy analysis further showed CH4 ebullition flux was significantly positively correlated with the abundances of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, and negatively with that of Proteobacteria and Chloroflexi. Among abiotic variables, CH4 ebullition flux was closely related to total phosphorus, total organic carbon, pH and nitrate nitrogen.					; Xiao, Feng/IUP-0388-2023	Wu, Yi/0000-0002-3481-0015; 														1424-2818				FEB	2023	15	2							154	10.3390/d15020154	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d15020154													WOS:000938691300001

Stable isotopes show resource partitioning among the early Late Miocene herbivore community at Rudabanya II: Paleoenvironmental implications for the hominoid, Rudapithecus hungaricus	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Examining how species use and partition resources within an environment can lead to a better understanding of community assembly and diversity. The rich early Late Miocene (early Vallesian) deposits at Rudabanya II (R. II) in northern central Hungary preserve an abundance of forest dwelling taxa, including the hominoid Rudapithecus hungaricus. Here we use the carbon and oxygen stable isotope compositions of tooth enamel carbonate from 10 genera of medium to large-bodied mammals to evaluate resource use and partitioning among the herbivore community, and to reconstruct the paleoenvironment of Rudapithecus. The range of stable carbon and oxygen isotope values (delta C-13(E) and delta O-18(E)) displayed by the R. II fauna indicates a variable forest environment, which included both open and closed canopy habitats. The relatively low delta C-13(E) and delta O-18(E) values found in all sampled taxa are consistent with high levels of precipitation and humidity. Significant differences in stable isotope values were observed among the sampled fauna, supporting the interpretation of resource specialization and partitioning. Higher delta C-13(E) values found in Aceratherium incisivum (Rhinocerotidae), Lucentia aff. pierensis (Cervidae), Hippotherium intrans (Equidae), Tetralophodon longirostris (Gomphotheriidae), Propotamochoerus palaeochoerus and Parachleuastochoerus kretzoii (Suidae) suggest foraging in more open canopy habitats, while lower delta C-13(E) values found in Miotragocerus sp. (Bovidae), Dorcatherium naui (Tragulidae), and Micromeryx flourensianus (Moschidae) imply a preference for more densely canopied habitats. Several of the sampled taxa yielded relatively higher delta O-18(E) and delta C-13(E) values indicative of fruit consumption, including the small ruminants, cervid, and bovid. The analyzed isotope values reflect a moderate degree of dietary niche overlap between taxa. An abundance of plant resources likely allowed for the coexistence of this diverse community of predominantly browsing herbivores. Within the gradient of more open to closed canopy forest, it is likely that Rudapithecus occupied dense closed canopy habitats where access to fruit was relatively continuous. The progressive fragmentation and replacement of humid forests by more open and seasonal woodlands during the late Vallesian would have had a significant influence on the extinction of this fossil ape.

Mobile pastoralists perceive liver parasites as a significant problem and think that proximity to Lake Chad can lead to infection. This study aimed to assess the importance of liver fluke infections in mobile pastoralists' livestock in the south-eastern Lake Chad region. In 2011, all animals presented at three slaughter slabs near Gredaya in the south-eastern Lake Chad area were examined for infection with Fasciola spp. during routine meat inspections. Results: This study included 616 goats, 132 sheep and 130 cattle. The prevalence of adult Fasciola gigantica was 68% (CI 60-76%) in cattle, 12% (CI 10-16%) in goats and 23% (CI 16-30%) in sheep. From all infected animals (n =200), 53% (n =106) were classified as lightly infected with 1-10 parasites, 18% (n =36) as moderately infected with 11-100 parasites and 29% (n =58) as heavily infected with more than 100 parasites per animal. Animals grazing close to the shores of Lake Chad had a much higher risk of infection (prevalence =38%; n =329) than animals not feeding at the lake (n =353), with only one goat being positive (prevalence =0.28%). The ethnic group of the owner was a strong determinant for the risk of infection. Ethnic group likely served as a proxy for husbandry practices. Geospatial distribution showed that animals originating from areas close to the lake were more likely to be infected with F. gigantica than those from more distant areas. Conclusions: Livestock belonging to ethnic groups which traditionally stay near surface water, and which were reported to feed near Lake Chad, have a high risk of infection with F. gigantica.

J	Mountney, NP				Mountney, Nigel P.			Periodic accumulation and destruction of aeolian erg sequences in the Permian Cedar Mesa Sandstone, White Canyon, southern Utah, USA	SEDIMENTOLOGY												The Permian Cedar Mesa Sandstone represents the product of at least 12 separate aeolian erg sequences, each bounded by regionally extensive deflationary supersurfaces. Facies analysis of strata in the White Canyon area of southern Utah indicates that the preserved sequences represent erg-centre accumulations of mostly dry, though occasionally water table-influenced aeolian systems. Each sequence records a systematic sedimentary evolution, enabling phases of aeolian sand sea construction, accumulation, deflation and destruction to be discerned and related to a series of underlying controls. Sand sea construction is signalled by a transition from damp sandsheet, ephemeral lake and palaeosol deposition, through a phase of dry sandsheet deposition, to the development of thin, chaotically arranged aeolian dune sets. The onset of the main phase of sand sea accumulation is reflected by an upward transition to larger-scale, ordered sets which represent the preserved product of climbing trains of sinuous-crested transverse dunes with original downwind wavelengths of 300-400 m. Regularly spaced reactivation surfaces indicate periodic shifts in wind direction, which probably occurred seasonally. Compound co-sets of cross strata record the oblique migration of superimposed slipfaced dunes over larger, slipfaceless draa. Each aeolian sequence is capped by a regionally extensive supersurface characterized by abundant calcified rhizoliths and bioturbation and which represents the end product of a widespread deflation episode whereby the accumulation surface was lowered close to the level of the water table as the sand sea was progressively cannibalized by winds that were undersaturated with respect to their potential carrying capacity. Aeolian sequence generation is considered to be directly attributable to cyclical changes in climate and related changes in sea level of probable glacio-eustatic origin that characterize many Permo-Carboniferous age successions. Sand sea construction and accumulation occurred during phases of increased aridity and lowered sea level, the main sand supply being former shallow marine shelf sediments that lay to the north-west. Sand sea deflation and destruction would have commenced at, or shortly after, the time of maximum aridity as the available sand supply became exhausted. Restricted episodes of non-aeolian accumulation would have occurred during humid (interglacial) phases, accumulation and preservation being enabled by slow rises in the relative water table. Subsidence analysis within the Paradox Basin, together with comparisons to other similar age successions suggests that the climatic cycles responsible for generating the Cedar Mesa erg sequences could be the product of 413 000 years so-called long eccentricity cycles. By contrast, annual advance cycles within the aeolian dune sets indicate that the sequences themselves could have accumulated in just a few hundred years and therefore imply that the vast majority of time represented by the Cedar Mesa succession was reserved for supersurface development.

J	Gladstone, W; Courtenay, G				Gladstone, William; Courtenay, Glenn			Impacts of docks on seagrass and effects of management practices to ameliorate these impacts	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Seagrasses have high conservation and human-use values, but around the world they are being damaged by human activities. Compared to the larger spatial scale at which some human activities affect estuaries and their seagrasses (e.g. catchment disturbance, dredging, pollution, trawling), recreational boating and infrastructure of moorings and docks act at smaller scales. However, the cumulative effects contribute to stresses acting on seagrass beds. This study assessed the effects of docks on the native seagrass Zostera muelleri subsp. capricorni in an estuary in south-east Australia and of current management practices designed to reduce dock impacts on this seagrass. A field survey found that seagrass biomass was significantly reduced below docks, and the effects were not influenced by dock orientation. Management practices requiring the use of a mesh decking to provide greater light penetration reduced, but did not eliminate, the reduction in seagrass biomass caused by docks. A modified beyond BACI experiment provided evidence for a causal link between the installation of wooden or mesh docks and reductions in biomass of seagrass. The reduction in biomass was apparent 6 mo after dock installation, and by 26 mo seagrass biomass had declined by at least 90%. Faced with increasing coastal populations, increases in recreational use, and continued pressures from other human activities, alternative management practices that further minimize the effects of docks are needed.

Biomass and productivity responses of zooplankton communities to experimental thermocline deepening	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Lake thermocline depth is likely to be altered with climate change. We assessed the response of crustacean zooplankton biomass and productivity to an experimental whole-lake manipulation of thermocline depth. Weekly sampling occurred in Experimental and Reference years and responses were assessed with a before-after-control-impact design. While one of three lake basins remained un-manipulated (control), two others experienced thermocline deepening via: active mixing simulating increased wind-stress ('mixing with thermocline deepening'); and increased overall heat content, simulating greater water clarity ('thermocline deepening'). Thus, we simultaneously identified seasonal responses to three treatments: mixing with thermocline deepening, thermocline deepening alone, and an isolated mixing effect. Total crustacean zooplankton biomass was enhanced by all treatment effects, owing to positive responses to thermocline deepening in Bosmina and Daphnia and a positive cyclopoid copepod response to mixing. Enhancement of biomass production rates (BP) occurred only with thermocline deepening, with no effect of mixing alone. The lack of BP response to active mixing was likely due to compositional shifts from fast growing Daphnia to slower growing cylopoids. BP variation was explained by positive and negative relationships with mean water-column temperature and hypolimnetic temperature, respectively. Hypolimnetic warming, occurring naturally with the seasonal thermocline descent was more dramatic for the active mixing manipulation. This loss of hypolimnetic refuge for Daphnia appears to have had a negative effect on the community daily production to biomass ratio (P : B-daily). Our study indicates a greater likelihood for reduced food-web transfer efficiency under scenarios when mixing and hypolimnetic warming accompany thermocline deepening.					; Beisner, Beatrix/ABG-7855-2020; Sastri, Akash/D-7798-2013; Gauthier, Joanna/JAC-9405-2023	Beisner, Beatrix/0000-0001-6972-6887; Juneau, Philippe/0000-0002-7259-9636; Sastri, Akash/0000-0001-8075-0917; Gauthier, Joanna/0000-0003-2844-2532													0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2014	59	1					1	16		10.4319/lo.2014.59.1.0001	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2014.59.1.0001													WOS:000339901800001
J	Kucukosmanoglu, AG; Filazi, A				Kucukosmanoglu, Asli Gul; Filazi, Ayhan			Investigation of the Metal Pollution Sources in Lake Mogan, Ankara, Turkey *	BIOLOGICAL TRACE ELEMENT RESEARCH												It is important to investigate the monthly level of trace metals in freshwater systems to assess environmental health. This information can be used to support effective management and control of natural areas in regard to the introduction and bioavailability of chemicals in the aquatic environment. We aimed to determine monthly changes in the levels of aluminum (Al), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), zinc (Zn), nickel (Ni), and selenium (Se) in water, sediment, and fish samples from Lake Mogan. Five different stations were established in Lake Mogan. Water and sediment samples as well as muscle, liver, kidney, gill, and brain tissues from fish were obtained from these stations every month for 1 year. All analyses were conducted with ICP-OES. In descending order of intensity, the metals identified in the water samples were Fe, Cu, Cr, Zn, Pb, Ni, As, Se, and Hg; those identified in the sediment samples were Fe, Zn, Cu, Ni, Se, Pb, Cr, As, Al, Cd, and Hg; and those identified in fish tissues were Se, Fe, Zn, Cr, Al, Pb, Cu, Ni, As, Hg, and Cd. The most polluted station was located where waste from restaurants and tea gardens were dumped. The level of waste, and thus the level of pollution, was especially high in August. It is concluded that the metals that accumulate in water, sediment, and fish in Lake Mogan originate from anthropogenic activities.					; KÜÇÜKOSMANOĞLU, Aslı/AAE-1994-2021; Filazi, Ayhan/AAA-7163-2019	KUCUKOSMANOGLU, ASLI GUL/0000-0002-0571-7620; Filazi, Ayhan/0000-0002-2800-6215; 													0163-4984	1559-0720				NOV	2020	198	1					269	282		10.1007/s12011-020-02031-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-020-02031-z								31925744					WOS:000574250000030

There is, however, a notable lack of systematic exploration into how various factors drive spatiotemporal variability in groundwater level (GWL). Using local indicators of spatial association (LISA), spatial non-stationarity models, and multi-source data, our analysis explores the spatial distribution of GWL and quantifies the influence of driving factors on its spatiotemporal non-stationarity at annual and monthly scales. We also compare driving factor contributions in hilly, plain, and local areas within the Poyang Lake basin. Our findings reveal significant local clustering of GWL, indicating substantial spatial autocorrelation and geographic heterogeneity in GWL. Influencing factors exhibit non-stationary effects on GWL at spatial and temporal scales, with precipitation (P), ground surface elevation (GSE), and soil moisture (SM) being primary contributors, generally exerting positive effects. SM contributes most during dry years and normal periods. P and the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) have greater impacts in hilly areas, while GSE shows the opposite trend. Rainfall is a source of groundwater recharge, with a lagged response observed in GWL to rainfall in this basin. The lag time is about 1-2 months. Evapotranspiration is not the dominant discharge pathway. The decrease in GWL during the of dry season is mainly due to reduced precipitation recharge and increased lateral groundwater discharge from areas of high hydraulic head to areas of low hydraulic head.

The samplings and physicochemical parameters of the river were carried out during the dry and wet seasons, and stations were visited on monthly basis. The downstream stations had significant (p < 0.05) higher values than the control station. Seasonal variation revealed that, in water, the pesticide level was higher in the dry season than in wet season, and there was no significant difference between the seasons (p > 0.05). The reverse was the case for sediments and fish. The physicochemical parameters of the river's water were within the recommended limits accepted by Federal Environmental Protection Agency, Nigeria. The observed Paraquat dichloride concentrations were above ecological bench, an observation that calls for regular monitoring and strict law enforcement to develop a strategy to manage environmental hazards and to improve environmental protection of this area.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2015	22	11					8517	8525		10.1007/s11356-014-3993-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-3993-2								25548014					WOS:000354960300050

However, their use for establishing time series of past floods is limited by lack in understanding processes of detrital layer formation. Therefore, we monitored hydro-sedimentary dynamics in Lake Mondsee (Upper Austria) and its main tributary, Griesler Ache, over a 3-year period from January 2011 to December 2013. Precipitation, discharge and turbidity were recorded continuously at the river outlet to the lake and compared to sediment fluxes trapped with 3 to 12 days resolution at two locations in the lake basin, in a distance of 0.9 (proximal) and 2.8 km (distal) to the Griesler Ache inflow. Within the 3-year observation period, 26 river floods of different magnitude (10 to 110 m(3) s(-1)) have been recorded resulting in variable sediment fluxes to the lake (4 to 760 g m(-2) d(-1)) including the 'century-scale' flood event in June 2013. The comparison of hydrological and sedimentological data revealed (i) a rapid sedimentation within 3 days after the peak runoff in the proximal and within 6 to 10 days in the distal lake basin; (ii) empirical flood thresholds for triggering sediment flux at the lake floor increasing from the proximal (20 m(3) s(-1)) to the distal lake basin (30 m(3) s(-1)) and (iii) various factors that control the detrital sediment transport in the lake. The amount of sediment transported to the lake is controlled by runoff and catchment sediment availability. The distribution of detrital sediment within the lake basin is mainly driven by mesopycnal inter-flows and closely linked to flood duration and the season in which a flood occurred. The combined hydro-sedimentary monitoring revealed detailed insights into processes of flood layer formation in a meso-scale peri-Alpine lake and, thereby, improves the interpretation of the depositional record of flood layers.

Impacts of large-scale teleconnections on freshwater-ice break/freeze-up dates over Canada	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Freshwater ice affects several physical, chemical, and biological processes in cold regions. Its duration and break-up also has numerous economic implications ranging from transportation, to the occurrence and severity of ice-jam flooding. Recent evidence indicates a shortening of the freshwater-ice season over much of Canada with the reduction being mainly attributable to earlier break-ups. These trends match those in surface air temperature during the last 50 years. Several studies have shown significant relationships between Canadian temperature and large-scale atmospheric and oceanic oscillations (i.e. teleconnections) particularly, during the cold season. However, no investigations have analyzed relationships between several teleconnection indices and historical freshwater-ice durations over Canada. This paper examines the impacts of Et Niho/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), the Pacific North American (PNA) pattern, the North Pacific (NP) index, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and the Arctic Oscillation (AO) on Canadian freshwater-ice break/freeze-up dates from 1950-1999. Composite and correlation analyses reveal strongest links between the Pacific-related PDO, PNA, NP, and ENSO indices and ice dates over western Canada. Lakes have stronger and more spatially coherent results than rivers, while break-up dates have higher correlations as compared to freeze-up. The NAO/AO results are less coherent with no discernible impacts over any region of the country. Results from this analysis improve the understanding of relationships between large-scale atmospheric and oceanic oscillations and past freshwater-ice durations over Canada. They also provide insight into future regional changes to take and river ice given projected changes to teleconnection patterns. Crown Copyright (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Low- and high-frequency climate variability in eastern Beringia during the past 25 000 years	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												We present new temperature and precipitation reconstructions for the past 25 000 cal. years BP from across eastern Beringia based on a network of pollen diagrams, an updated modern pollen calibration database, and an improved methodology using the modern analogue technique (MAT). Time series show July temperatures were around 4 degrees C lower during full glacial and January temperatures were about 2 degrees C lower than present. Annual temperatures rose beginning around 16000 cal. years BP, reaching a maximum around 12000 cal. year BP. The warming was more rapid in southern Beringia. Annual precipitation varied by 250 mm during the past 25000 cal. years BP. Maps of reconstructed precipitation patterns show increasingly drier conditions since 12000 cal. years BP. that vary regionally, suggesting Holocene atmospheric circulation changes at multiple time and space scales. Orbitally forced seasonality changes during the late glacial and early Holocene resulted in reversed seasonal temperature reconstructions due to methodological constraints using the MAT and (or) non-analogue conditions. The magnitude of millennial-scale climate variability in this region was greater during the last glacial and late glacial periods than during the past 8000 years.

To answer this question, two groups of spatially isolated islands in Hongfeng Lake, Guizhou Province, China that have experienced periods of human development, a mix of development and protection (interim period) and strict protection were chosen and monitored from 1988 to 2019. We applied multisource remote sensing to obtain NDVI data in the growth season and atmospheric data. We used an attribution analysis method to identify vegetation growth, climate factors, including temperature and precipitation in the region, and land use and land cover change on the islands over the 32-year study period. In the human development period, population size was the main influencing factor, with a weight exceeding 0.3. In the interim period, precipitation was the key factor that influenced vegetation growth and recovery (average weight of 0.27). In the protected period, human influences from the population size and the area of cultivated land were the most prominent factors (average weight of 0.26). Although there was considerable human activity across the islands, the vegetation has continued to recover over the past 20 years. We identified a recovery phase that occurred approximately 10 years after protected areas were created, which indicates that human development can coexist with protected areas. Moreover, variations in temperature and precipitation did not prevent vegetation recovery or growth.

Primary Production and Carbon Dioxide Metabolic Balance of a Lake-Rich Arctic River Floodplain: Partitioning of Phytoplankton, Epipelon, Macrophyte, and Epiphyton Production Among Lakes on the Mackenzie Delta	ECOSYSTEMS												The Mackenzie River Delta, a floodplain system in the western Canadian Arctic contains approximately 45,000 lakes used by resident and migratory fish, aquatic birds, and mammal populations, which are critical resources for aboriginal peoples. Our results show the Mackenzie Delta is a remarkably productive aquatic ecosystem, not out of place relative to other large river floodplains and unusually productive for its Arctic latitude. Along with other such deltas of north flowing rivers to the Arctic Ocean, it represents a critical habitat of high productivity to support dependent consumers. Our results also showed a consistent under-saturation of CO2 in lake waters of the delta, co-occurring even with high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, and indicating P:R greater than 1 during the open water period. In less turbid lakes, abundant macrophytes provide a considerable surface area for supporting production of epiphyton, but epiphyton production is constrained strongly by macrophyte shading, when macrophyte biomass is high. Despite this, epiphyton represented a greater supply of non-macrophyte algal carbon than phytoplankton, and thus explains why benthic algae may be a more important food source for primary consumers than phytoplankton, except in the most turbid systems. Most importantly, the high autotrophic production in the Delta lakes relative to nearby lakes on the arctic tundra suggests the extended ice-free season of the floodplain lakes and their landscape setting on, and replenishment by, nutrient-rich river sediments, is the strongest influence on aquatic production levels.					; Higgins, Scott/F-5700-2016	Higgins, Scott/0000-0001-9427-7024; 													1432-9840	1435-0629				AUG	2009	12	5					853	872		10.1007/s10021-009-9263-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-009-9263-3													WOS:000268492000012

A semi-structured questionnaire was used to interview 360 households in the four AEZs: I, the Great Lake Floodplain; II, the Mekong Floodplain; III, the Coastal and IV, the Plateau/Mountainous. In addition, samples of common nutritional resources used for cattle feed were collected for nutrient composition analysis, plus cattle were scored for body condition. Rice farming and cattle production were the most common sources of income in all AEZs. The average cattle herd size was 3.7 (SD = 2.4), but the majority of households raised 1-3 animals. The most common cattle management system was grazing with supplementation, mainly with rice straw and 'cut-and-carry' natural grasses fed during the wet season in all AEZs. The body condition score of all cattle types was 3.2 (SD = 0.8), except for cows in lactation that were 1.8. Major constraints to cattle production in AEZs I, II and III were lack of quality feed resources, capital for cattle production and concerns on breed quality, whereas in AEZ IV, diseases were identified as the main constraint. This survey confirms the importance of cattle to smallholders in the four AEZs. Interventions including farmer education to improve husbandry skills, increase the utilisation of forages and crop residues and address disease issues are necessary to enhance cattle production and rural livelihoods in Cambodia.

Use of WorldView-2 time series to establish a wetland monitoring program for potential offsite impacts of mine site rehabilitation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												The Ramsar-listed wetlands of the Magela Creek floodplain, situated in the World Heritage Kakadu National Park, in northern Australia are recognised for their biodiversity and cultural values. The floodplain is also a downstream receiving environment for Ranger uranium mine, which is entering closure and rehabilitation phases. Vegetation on the floodplain is spatially and temporally variable which is related to the hydrology of the region, primarily the extent and level of inundation and available soil moisture. Time-series mapping of the floodplain vegetation will provide a contemporary baseline of annual vegetation dynamics to assist with determining whether change is natural or a result of the potential impacts of mine closure activities such as increased suspended sediment moving downstream. The research described here used geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) to classify the upper Magela Creek floodplain vegetation from WorldView-2 imagery captured over four years (2010-2013) and ancillary data including a canopy height model. A step-wise rule set was used to implement a decision tree classification. The resulting maps showed the 12 major vegetation communities that exist on the Magela Creek floodplain and their distribution for May 2010, May 2011, June 2012 and June 2013 with overall accuracies of over 80% for each map. Most of the error appears to be associated with confusion between vegetation classes that are spectrally similar such as the classes dominated by grasses. Object-based change detection was then applied to the maps to analyse change between dates. Results indicate that change between dates was detected for large areas of the floodplain. Most of the change is associated with the amount of surface water present, indicating that although imagery was captured at the same time of year, the imagery represents different stages of the seasonal cycle of the floodplain.

J	Wu, GP; Liu, YB				Wu, Guiping; Liu, Yuanbo			Combining Multispectral Imagery with in situ Topographic Data Reveals Complex Water Level Variation in China's Largest Freshwater Lake	REMOTE SENSING												Lake level variation is an important hydrological indicator of water balance, biodiversity and climate change in drainage basins. This paper illustrates the use of moderate-resolution imaging spectroadiometer (MODIS) data to characterize complex water level variation in Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China. MODIS data were used in conjunction with in situ topographic data, otherwise known as the land-water contact method, to investigate the potential of this hybrid water level spatiotemporal variability measurement technique. An error analysis was conducted to assess the derived water level relative to gauge data. Validation results demonstrated that the land-water contact method can satisfactorily capture spatial patterns and seasonal variations in water level fluctuations. The correlation coefficient ranged from 0.684 to 0.835, the root-mean-square-error from 0.79 m-1.09 m, and the mean absolute bias error from 0.65 m to 0.86 m for five main gauge stations surrounding the lake. Additionally, seasonal and interannual variations in the lake's water level were revealed in the MODIS-based results. These results indicate that the land-water contact method has the potential to be applied in mapping water level changes in Poyang Lake. This study not only provides a foundation for basic hydrological and ecological studies, but is also valuable for the conservation and management of water resources over gauge-sparse regions in Poyang Lake.

The aim of this study is to explore the potential connection between streamflow, rainfall, and water quality and propose an optimised ensemble model for the prediction of a water quality index (WQI). This study modelled the changes in five water quality parameters such as ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), phosphate (PO43-), pH, turbidity, total dissolved solids (TDS), and their associated WQI caused by rainfall and streamflow. The analysis was conducted across three temporal scales, weekly, monthly, and seasonal, using a generalised additive model (GAM) in Toowoomba, Australia. TDS, turbidity, and WQI exhibited a significant nonlinear variation with the changes in streamflow in the weekly and monthly scales. Additionally, pH demonstrated a significant linear to weakly linear correlation with discharge across the three temporal scales. For the accurate prediction of WQI, this study proposed an ensemble model integrating an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and Bayesian optimisation (BO) algorithm, using streamflow as an input across the same temporal scales. The results for the three temporal scales provided the best accuracy of monthly data, based on the accuracy metrics R2 (0.91), MAE (0.20), and RMSE (0.42). The comparison between the test and predicted data indicated that the prediction model overestimated the WQI at some points. This study highlights the efficiency of integrating rainfall, streamflow, and water quality correlations for WQI prediction, which can provide valuable insights for guiding future water management strategies in similar catchment areas, especially amidst changing climatic conditions.

However, the energy transfer mechanism from the surface to the sediment of thermokarst lakes remains largely unexplored, thereby limiting our understanding of the magnitude and duration of biogeochemical processes and hydrological cycles. Therefore, herein, a typical thermokarst lake situated in the center of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) was selected for observation and energy budget modeling. Our results showed that the net radiation of the thermokarst lake surface was 95.1, 156.9, and 32.3 W m-2 for the annual, ice-free, and ice-covered periods, respectively, and was approximately 76% of the net radiation consumed by latent heat flux. Alternations in heat storage in the thermokarst lake initially increased from January to April, then decreased from April to December, with a maximum change of 48.1 W m2 in April. The annual average heat fluxes from lake water to sediments were 1.4 W m2; higher heat fluxes occurred during the ice-free season at a range of 4.9-12.0 W m2. The imbalance between heat absorption and release in the millennium scale caused the underlying permafrost of the thermokarst lake to completely thaw. At present, the ground temperature beneath the lake bottom at a depth of 15 m has reached 2.0 degrees C. The temperatures and vapor-pressure conditions of air and lake surfaces control the energy budget of the thermokarst lake. Our findings indicate that changes in the hydrologic regime shifts and biogeochemical processes are more frequent under climate warming and permafrost degradation.																			1674-9278					AUG	2024	15	4					636	646		10.1016/j.accre.2024.06.009	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.accre.2024.06.009													WOS:001310003700001

The study of natural vegetation ecological water requirement (EWR) is the basis for the promotion of regional ecological conservation and sustainable development of ecosystems when extreme environmental events occur frequently, which is of great significance for the formulation of scientific and rational ecological conservation strategies. In the study, we improved the vegetation EWR calculation method by introducing a dynamic soil moisture limitation coefficient (KS) and a dynamic vegetation coefficient (KC) that is coupled with a resistance correction factor (Fr) based on the Penman-Monteith method and analyzed its spatio-temporal variation characteristics. Additionally, this study utilized the latitude of ecosystem resilience (LER) to clarify the thresholds for vegetation EWR throughout the growing season in the study area and to analyze the water surplus and deficit (WSD) at different threshold levels. The results of the study show that: (1) Over the past 21 years, the EWR for vegetation has shown a downward trend, with the change in EWR for arbor-shrub forests being more significant than that for grasslands. The average EWR for arbor-shrub forests and grasslands is 36.76 x 108 m3 and 459.59 x 108 m3, respectively. (2) The minimum ecological water requirement (EWRmin) and optimal ecological water requirement (EWRopt) for natural vegetation were 360.45 x 108 m3 and 550.10 x 108 m3, respectively. (3) In EWRmin conditions, the alpine plateau area as a whole showed a water surplus, and the plains area as a whole was in a state of water scarcity, but the precipitation in the study area as a whole could meet the basic survival needs of the vegetation. (4) In EWRopt conditions, the plains and local alpine plateau areas are in a state of water scarcity, the area of water scarcity is gradually increasing, and the regional precipitation is unable to fully realize the objectives of ecological conservation and vegetation restoration.					; Zhao, Shikang/ABA-5154-2021	Huang, Mianting/0009-0004-5940-2458; Yang, Rongqin/0009-0002-2296-4698														2071-1050				AUG	2024	16	16							7034	10.3390/su16167034	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su16167034													WOS:001307579000001

Currently, almost a quarter of the freshwater flowing from Greenland is derived from catchments that are disconnected from the Greenland Ice Sheet. Despite their importance to the total freshwater flux and influence on fjord geochemistry, there is relatively little monitoring data available for those catchments and therefore the drivers of regional differences in export are largely unknown. We present a dataset of 12 years of discharge of four catchments less than 15 km apart, that are different in size (between 7 and 32 km(2)), local glacier coverage (4%-11%) and lake cover (0%-5%). They all drain into Kobbefjord, a well-studied fjord in West Greenland, near Greenland's capital Nuuk. Between catchments, the magnitude of discharge varies at annual, seasonal and sub-daily timescales, due to differences in physical catchment properties as well as local climate variability. We find that annual specific discharges vary greatly (between 1.2 and 1.9 m/year on a 12-year average) due to a longitudinal precipitation gradient from West to East caused by different amount of orographic precipitation shading. The seasonal cycle of discharge (amplitude, timing and minimum flow) differs among the sites mainly due to different exposure to solar radiation as a driver for major snowmelt; the small ice coverage in the catchments plays only a minor role in discharge variability. Dry years generally increase the relative differences in annual specific discharge and no significant temporal trends have been found in the studied catchments. On a sub-daily timescale, the difference in timing of maximum discharge during fair-weather days (>80% maximum solar radiation and no precipitation) ranged between 7 and 12 h, which is attributed to differences between the presence and elevation of lakes among the catchments. The response of discharge to major precipitation events is discussed, where a delay of between 5 and 7 h is found for the catchments that do not contain lakes near the gauge.																			0885-6087	1099-1085				NOV	2021	35	11							e14413	10.1002/hyp.14413	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14413													WOS:000723020900027

BIOMASS & BIOENERGY												In arid regions, reductions in the amount of available agricultural water are fueling interest in alternative, low water-use crops. Perennial grasses have potential as low wateruse biofuel crops. However, little is known about which perennial grasses can produce high quantity, high quality yields with low irrigation on formerly high-input agricultural fields in arid regions. We monitored biomass production, weed resistance, rooting depth, and root architecture of nine perennial grasses under multiple irrigation treatments in western Nevada. Under a low irrigation treatment (71 +/- 9 cm irrigation water annually), cool-season grasses produced more biomass and were more weed-resistant than warmseason grasses. With additional irrigation (120 +/- 12 cm water annually), warm- and coolseason grasses had similar biomass production, but cool-season species remained more weed-resistant. Among species within each grass type, we observed high variability in performance. Two cool-season species (Elytrigia elongata and Leymus cinereus) and one warm-season species (Bothriochloa ischaemum) performed better than the other tested species. Root depth was not correlated with biomass production, but species with deeper roots had fewer weeds. Abundance of fine roots (but not large roots) was correlated with increased biomass and fewer weeds. Both L. cinereus and E. elongata had deep root systems dominated by fine roots, while B. ischaemum had many fine roots in shallow soil but few roots in deeper soil. Cool-season grasses (particularly E. elongata, L. cinereus, and other species with abundant fine roots) may be worthy of further attention as potential biofuel crops for cold desert agriculture.

J	HOOGHIEMSTRA, H; RAN, ETH				HOOGHIEMSTRA, H; RAN, ETH			LATE AND MIDDLE PLEISTOCENE CLIMATIC-CHANGE AND FOREST DEVELOPMENT IN COLOMBIA - POLLEN RECORD FUNZA-II (2-158M CORE INTERVAL)	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY					8th International Palynological Conference	SEP 06-12, 1992	AIX EN PROVENCE, FRANCE					A 586 m long core, Funza II, was recovered from the lake sediments of the high plain of BogotA (Eastern Cordillera, Colombia, 2550 m alt.), which represent the bottom of a drained lake. Results of the palynological analysis of the interval 2-158 m with sample distances of 1 m are presented. Time control of the Funza II core is based on zircon fission-track datings of intercalated volcanic ash horizons. In addition, pollen record Funza II could be correlated in detail with pollen record Funza 1, located at 1 km distance. The Funza I pollen record has been graphically correlated with the oxygen isotope record of ODP Site 677 (East Pacific). Oxygen isotope stages 19.1 to 3.0 have been tentatively recognized in the pollen record, indicating that the interval 158-2 m represents approximately the period of 735-28 ka. The average calculated time resolution is 4550 yr with considerable fluctuations depending changes in accumulation rate. The interval 158-131 m core depth (estimated age 735-569 ka) shows warm climatic conditions most of the time and is tentatively correlated with the oxygen isotope stages 19.1 to 15.1. The pollen spectra have no direct modern analogues because of the absence of Quercus and related conditions. The upper forest line oscillated mainly from 2100 to 2700 m during most of the interval. The corresponding average annual temperature on the high plain is 6.5-11-degrees-C. The high plain was situated in the Andean forest belt most of the time. The upper limit of the subandean forest belt (Acalypha, Alchornea) was situated some hundreds of meters below the modern elevation. Podocarpus was most important in the lower part of the Andean forest belt. Weinmannia forest, the precursor of the modern Weinmannietum, included a substantial contribution of Hedyosmum as well as lower frequencies of Myrsine (= Rapanea) and Eugenia. A type of Vallea-Miconia forest, including low frequencies of Ilex and Myrsine (= Rapanea), could have occurred on the drier parts of the high plain. The lake was shallow most of the time, with local marsh vegetation of cyperaceous reed swamp and Hydrocotyle. Myrica thickets (M. parvifolia) and Alnus carr (swamp forest) covered the wet flats around the lake. Myrica (M. pubescens) and Alnus possibly contributed also with low frequency to the zonal Andean forest belt. Dwarf forest of Polylepis, Myrica and Compositae scrub occurred at the upper forest line. The interval 131-100 m core depth (estimated age 569-350 ka) shows cold climatic conditions most of the time and is tentatively correlated with oxygen isotope stages 14.4 to 11.1. The upper forest line oscillated mainly from 1800 to 2500 m. The corresponding average temperature on the high plain is ca. 5-9.5-degrees-C. The high plain was situated in the grassparamo belt most of the time. Apart from Gramineae (e.g. Calamagrostis, Chusquea) and woody stem rosettes of Espeletia (Compositae) a variety of paramo herbs (Valeriana, Caryophyllaceae, Geranium, Aragoa, Lycopodium) were present with substantial frequencies, and abundant cushion bogs of Plantago were present. The water level in the lake was high and marsh vegetation limited. Polylepis dwarf forest occurred in the subparamo belt, along with shrub of Compositae, Hypericum and Ericaceae. In the Andean forest belt Vallea-Miconia forest and Weinmannia-Hedyosmum forest were most important. The interval 100-57 m core depth (estimated age 350-186 ka) shows warm climatic conditions most of the time and is tentatively correlated with the oxygen isotope stages 10.2 to 7.1. The upper forest line oscillated from 2000 to 2600 m in the first part and from 2600 to 2900 m in the last part of this interval. The corresponding average annual temperature is 6-10-degrees and 10-12-degrees-C, respectively. The high plain was in the first part of this interval most of the time situated in the paramo and in the last part of this interval in the Andean forest belt. During this interval Quercus migrated into the area of the high plain. Quercus forests occurred in a wide altitudinal range (1000-2800 m) and constituted at first local patches of forest, but at the end of this interval zonal Quercus forests were a major part of the Andean forest belt. Acalypha and Alchornea reached higher elevations in the Quercus forests, and the upper limit of subandean forest rose to modem elevations. Weinmannia dominated in the Weinmannia-Hedyosmum forest type. At the end of this interval the contribution of Vallea-Miconia forest increased markedly and replaced Weinmannia forest. Podocarpus-rich forest occurred in the lower part of the Andean forest belt. Alnus carr and Myrica thickets were abundant around the lake, which was of a shallow type. Algae (Botryococcus) became very abundant from the beginning of this interval to the top of the record. The interval 57-2 m core depth (estimated age 186-24 ka) shows for the first time in the record abundant presence of zonal Quercus forests. The composition of the Andean forest belt had changed dramatically. Based on arboreal percentages, climatic conditions seem warm most of the time, but the high frequency of Quercus, a wind-pollinated tree that produces large amounts of pollen, exaggerates real conditions. This interval is tentatively correlated with the oxygen isotope stages 6 to 3.0. The upper forest line oscillated from 2000 to 3000 m most of the time. The corresponding average annual temperature is 6-12.5-degrees-C. Quercus forests, resembling the modern Saurauia-Quercus humboldtii forest, and Weinmannia-Hedyosmum forest, resembling the modem Weinmannietum, dominated in the Andean forest belt. Vallea-Miconia forest probably resembled the modern Xylosma-Duranta-Vallea forest, but the latter is palynologically difficult to recognize. Eugenia, Ilex and Myrsine (= Rapanea) contributed substantially to this rather dry forest type of low stature. Polylepis dwarf forest was frequent at the forest line and possibly also in the paramo belt up to 4000 m. Alnus carr dominated completely the flat parts of the high plain. Myrica thickets and marsh vegetation diminished in the last part of this period. Sediment accumulation was very rapid (up to 60 cm per 1000 yr). Supposedly, erosion of the Tequendama Falls in the Bogota River, the only outlet of the high plain, led to the final draining of the lake between ca. 28 and 22 ka. The Andean biozones VI and VII are represented in this part of the record. Biozone VI (158-94 m core interval; estimated age 735-350 ka) is characterized by the presence of Alnus and absence of Quercus. Biozone VII (94-0 m core interval; estimated age 350-0 ka) is characterized by the presence of Alnus and Quercus, both from northern hemisphere origin.																			0031-0182					JUN	1994	109	2-4					211	246		10.1016/0031-0182(94)90177-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(94)90177-5													WOS:A1994NZ35500007

Oligopeptide chemotypes of the toxic freshwater cyanobacterium Planktothrix can form subpopulations with dissimilar ecological traits	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Nonribosomal oligopeptides were used as qualitative and quantitative markers to test whether populations of the toxic freshwater cyanobacterium Planktothrix comprise subpopulations with dissimilar ecological traits. A field program was conducted in Lake Steinsfjorden (Norway), where Planktothrix has dominated the phytoplankton community for decades, allowing the present study to disregard other potential producers of nonribosomal oligopeptides. Four chemotypes with distinct cellular oligopeptide patterns were found in the lake. The chemotypes occurred largely unaltered throughout a period of up to 33 yr and differed with respect to seasonal dynamics, depth distribution, and participation in loss processes. Changes in the relative abundance of chemotypes occurred almost constantly and could not be explained with fluctuations in light, temperature, or concentration of macronutrients but might have been due to differences among chemotypes in depth regulation or interaction with grazers or pathogens. Chemotypes correlated weakly with taxonomic groups and genotypes defined on the basis of phycocyanin operon deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences. Our findings suggest that first, oligopeptide chemotypes can have dissimilar ecological traits and therefore interact differently with their environment; second, populations of toxic freshwater cyanobacteria can comprise multiple ecologically distinct subpopulations; and, third, the relative abundance of these may vary, causing a high variability in whole-population properties. The latter was demonstrated for the microcystin-related toxicity of Planktothrix. The consequences of the present findings for the taxonomy of Planktothrix are discussed.					; Ptacnik, Robert/B-1347-2012	Edvardsen, Bente/0000-0002-6806-4807; Ptacnik, Robert/0000-0001-7176-7653													0024-3590					JUL	2008	53	4					1279	1293		10.4319/lo.2008.53.4.1279	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2008.53.4.1279													WOS:000257773700008

However, lack of data on CH4 emissions in different geographical regions and high spatial-temporal variability in the emission rates of reservoirs has led to uncertainties regarding regional emission estimates of CH4. In the subtropical plateau climate region, we used the Ertan hydroelectric reservoir as a study area. The CH4 flux at the air-water interface was assessed by floating chambers and factors influencing emissions, including the distance from the dam, water depth, seasonal variation in wet and dry season, air-water temperature gradient and wind speed, and was also studied through a year-long systematic sampling and monitoring experiment. The results showed that the surface of the reservoir was a source of CH4 during the sampling period and the annual average CH4 flux was 2.80 +/- 1.52 mg m(-2) d(-1). CH4 flux (and its variation) was higher in the shallow water areas than in the deep-water areas. CH4 flux near the dam was significantly higher than that of other locations farther from the dam in the dry season. The seasonal variations of CH4 emission in wet and dry seasons were minor and significant diurnal variations were observed in wet and dry seasons. Exponential relationships between the CH4 flux and air-water temperature gradient were found. Air-water temperature gradient was an important factor influencing diurnal variations of CH4 flux in the Ertan hydroelectric reservoir. These results indicate that systematic sampling is needed to better estimate CH4 flux through coverage of the spatial variation of different water depths, measuring-point distance from the dam, seasonal variation in wet and dry seasons and changes in climate factors (such as air-water temperature gradient). Our results also provide a fundamental parameter for CH4 emission estimation of global reservoirs. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Freshwater macrophyte roots are a main site of Hg methylation in different Brazilian environments. Paspalum repens periphyton was sampled in four floodplain lakes during the dry, rainy and wet seasons for measurement of total Hg (THg), MeHg, Hg methylation potentials, %C, %N, delta C-13, delta N-15 and bacterial heterotrophic production as H-3-leucine incorporation rate. THg concentration varied from 67 to 198 ng/g and the potential of (MeHg)-Hg-203 formation was expressive (1-23%) showing that periphyton is an important matrix both in the accumulation of Hg and in MeHg production. The concentration of MeHg varied from 1 to 6 ng/g DW and was positively correlated with (MeHg)-Hg-203 formation. Though methylmercury formation is mainly a bacterial process, no significant correlation was observed between the methylation potentials and bacterial production. The multiple regressions analyses suggested a negative correlation between THg and %C and %N and between methylation potential and delta C-13. The discriminant analysis showed a significant difference in periphyton delta N-15, delta C-13 and THg between seasons, where the rainy season presented higher delta N-15 and the wet period lighter delta C-13, lower THg values and higher (MeHg)-Hg-203 formation. This exploratory study indicates that the flooding cycle could influence the periphyton composition, mercury accumulation and methylmercury production.

J	Madsen, JD; Sartain, B; Turnage, G; Marko, M				Madsen, John D.; Sartain, Bradley; Turnage, Gray; Marko, Michelle			Management of flowering rush in the Detroit Lakes, Minnesota	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												Flowering rush (Butomus umbellatus) is an invasive aquatic plant introduced to North America from Eurasia in 1897. Flowering rush can grow either submersed or emergent from wet soil habitats to waters that are up to 5 m deep. Flowering rush was first observed in the Detroit Lake system in the 1960s, causing significant impact to shoreline and recreational use. Flowering rush is currently found in five basins of the Detroit Lake system: Big Detroit, Little Detroit, Curfman, Sallie, and Melissa Lakes. Submersed treatments with diquat were used during 2012 on an operational scale to control the nuisance impacts of flowering rush in waters from 0 to 1.3 m deep. We evaluated the response of native plant communities with the use of a point intercept method on 30 or more predetermined points in each of nine treatment plots, with four untreated reference plots. Treatment plots were sampled before treatment (June), and 4 wk after each of the two treatments. We also sampled 20 biomass cores (0.018 m(-2)) in each of four treatment and four untreated reference plots. Although some species declined after treatment, most native species did not change significantly after treatments compared to untreated reference plots. Treatments with diquat not only significantly reduce flowering rush distribution (60%) and aboveground biomass (99%), but also significantly reduced belowground biomass (82%) and rhizome bud density (83%). As flowering rush is an herbaceous perennial that propagates predominantly by rhizome buds, reductions in rhizome bud density indicate that this approach can be used for long-term reduction in flowering rush populations.

This study analyses the impact of evaporation (by the Penman method) on water availability for four scenarios based on two regional climatic models (Eta-CanESM2 and Eta-MIROC5) using the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. We compared the water availability in the period of 2071-2100 with that of the historical period (1961-2005). The scenarios derived from the Eta-CanESM2 model indicate an increase in the dry-season evaporative rate (2 % and 6 %, respectively) by the end of the century. Unlike the above scenarios, the ones derived from the Eta-MIROC5 model both show a change in the dry-season evaporative rate of -2 %. Consequently, for a 90 % reliability level, the expected reservoir capacity to supply water with high reliability is reduced by 80 %. It is reasonable to state that both patterns of future evaporation in the reservoirs may prove to be plausible. Because model-based projections of climate impact on water resources can be quite divergent, it is necessary to develop adaptations that do not need quantitative projections of changes in hydrological variables but rather ranges of projected values. Our analysis shows how open-water reservoirs might be impacted by climate change in dry regions. These findings complement a body of knowledge on the estimation of water availability in a changing climate and provide new data on and insights into water management in reservoir-dependent drylands.					de Araújo, José/J-9629-2012; Rodrigues, Gláuber/AAL-3581-2021; Rodrigues, Italo/AFW-4563-2022; Mamede, George/AIB-6695-2022; de Araujo, Jose Carlos/J-9629-2012; Brosinsky, Arlena/K-3984-2019	Pontes Rodrigues, Glauber/0000-0001-7427-6104; de Araujo, Jose Carlos/0000-0002-2649-151X; Rodrigues, Italo/0000-0001-8583-3084; 													1027-5606	1607-7938				JUL 25	2024	28	14					3243	3260		10.5194/hess-28-3243-2024	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-3243-2024													WOS:001275492000001

However, application of particularly HTS in tropical lakes is still uncommon. We analyzed the community composition of cyanobacterial and eukaryotic phytoplankton in relation to trophic status and other environ-mental factors in 15 tropical crater lakes in western Uganda, using both high-performance liquid chromatog-raphy (HPLC) of photosynthetic marker pigments and HTS of 16 S and 18 S small subunit rRNA genes. We then compared the results with phytoplankton composition data based on microscopic identification and cell counting to evaluate whether the two former methods can be alternative or complementary approaches to analyze these lakes' phytoplankton communities. HTS recorded 105 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of cyanobacteria, and 197 OTUs of autotrophic eukaryotes mainly from dinoflagellates, cryptophytes and green algae. Ochrophyta (chrysophytes and diatoms) were present in low abundances only, and the few remaining sequences belonged to Streptophyta and Haptophyta. Marker pigment distribution among samples reflected the widespread and often dominant presence of cyanobacteria (primarily zeaxanthin, myxoxanthophyll and echinenone), followed by green algae (chlorophyll b, lutein, antheraxanthin, neoxanthin) and diatoms (fucoxanthin, diato-diadinoxanthin), and with cryptophyta (alloxanthin) important in some of the lakes. Direct and indirect ordi-nations of the OTUs and marker pigments revealed that, similar to patterns observed in cell counts, phyto-plankton community composition differed between deep oligotrophic lakes and shallower more productive lakes, even though the distribution of cyanobacterial OTUs was more related to lake water conductivity and season than to trophic status. Procrustes analyses of the composition of green algae and Ochrophyta, the two dominant eukaryotic groups, based on HTS data showed patterns significantly similar to composition data based on cell counts, but no significant correlations were found between the complete eukaryotic or cyanobacterial HTS data and cell count data. While the latter discrepancies can be attributed to method-related biases in both HTS and microscopy, in contrast to the microscopic approach HTS failed to identify trophic indicator species and did not assign all lakes to the correct trophic category. Composition data based on marker pigments clustered the 15 lakes according to their trophic level only when pigment abundances were expressed as absolute concentrations, not when expressed as fractional abundances. We attribute this lower discriminating power partly to the wide distribution of cyanobacteria in these tropical crater lakes, besides the pigments' low taxonomic resolution. Nevertheless, as the compositional patterns in relation to environmental variation observed in marker pigments and OTUs of the dominant eukaryotic phytoplankton groups are similar to those in cell count data, both methods hold potential for ecosystem-level monitoring of tropical crater lakes. However, the high-resolution HTS approach is handicapped by non-uniform amplification of gene sequences, while the low-resolution marker -pigment approach is handicapped by the widespread dominance of cyanobacteria in these systems irrespective of their trophic status.

J	Anyah, RO; Semazzi, FHM				Anyah, Richard O.; Semazzi, Fredrick H. M.			Variability of East African rainfall based on multiyear RegCM3 simulations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												The International Center for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) regional climate model version 3 (ICTP-RegCM3) multiyear simulations of East Africa rainfall during the October-December, short rains season are evaluated. Two parallel runs; based on NCEP reanalysis and NASA FvGCM lateral boundary conditions are performed. The simulated monthly and seasonal rainfall climatology as well as the interannual variability are found to be fairly consistent with the observations. The model climatology over specific homogeneous climate subregions, except central Kenya (CKE) highlands, also reasonably agrees with the observed. The latitude-time evolution (intraseasonal variability) of the simulated seasonal rainfall exhibits two distinct modes of behavior. The first is a quasistationary mode associated with high rainfall throughout the season within the equatorial belt between 1 degrees S and 2 degrees N. The second mode is associated with the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ)-driven southward migration of regions of rainfall maxima as the season progresses, which is also consistent with the observed. Furthermore, observed rainfall variability over distinct homogeneous climate subregions is also fairly reproduced by the model, except over central Kenya highlands and northeastern parts of Kenya. The spatial correlation between the simulated seasonal rainfall and some of the global teleconnections (DMI and Nino3.4 indices) shows that the regional model conserves some of the observed regional 'hot spots' where rainfall-ENSO/DMI associations are strong. At the same time, unlike observations, the model reveals that along the East Africa Rift Valley and over western parts of the Lake Victoria Basin, the association is weak, perhaps an indication that nonlinear interactions between local forcing (captured by the model) and large-scale systems either suppress or obscur the dominant influence of the teleconnections on rainfall over certain parts.

Soils were sampled along a toposequence and analyzed by XRD, TEM-EDS, and ICP-MS. The studied micas, mainly concentrated in a green horizon, are dioctahedral, strongly associated with Fe3+ and Al, and interstratified with smectite layers. Classification of individual crystals shows that glauconite and Fe-illite are the dominant micas, but one crystal of illite was recognized. Si-rich amorphous materials are associated with small crystallites in the mica-enriched horizon. A recent study shows that water samples from the studied lake and the surrounding water table have high pH, negative Eh, temperatures up to 40 C. high concentration of K. and low concentration of Si(OH)(4). Experimental studies of micas synthesis reported in the literature show that similar water conditions allow for dioctahedral mica crystallization from initial precipitation of amorphous hydroxides. Therefore, water characteristics combined with presence of Si-rich amorphous materials in the mica-enriched horizon suggest that the micas of the study area are neoformed. The alternated origin of illite, glauconite, and Fe-illite mixed-layer minerals probably occurs due to seasonal variations of pH. temperature, and chemical composition of waters in microenvironments, since the changes at this scale are possibly faster and more extreme.

The potential influence of climate on this "Neolithic Revolution" has long been debated. Here we present a speleothem record from the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, covering from Early Neolithic to Early Chalcolithic periods (similar to 11 to 7.3 ka, 9000-5300 BCE). The record reveals the influence of the Siberian High on regional precipitation, and shows large hydroclimatic variability at the multicentennial scale. In particular, it highlights wetter conditions between 9.7 and 9.0 ka, followed by an abrupt reduction of precipitation between 9.0 and 8.5 ka, and a wetter interval between 8.5 and 8.0 ka. A comparison with regional and local archaeological data demonstrates an influence of recorded hydroclimatic changes on settlement patterns (size, distribution, permanent vs. seasonal occupation) and on the exploitation of water resources by Neolithic to Chalcolithic populations. Our record does not show prominent hydroclimatic changes at 9.3 and 8.2 ka, thus not supporting direct influence of such rapid and widespread events on the process of Neolithization and its cultural dispersal.

Systematic isolation and characterization of freshwater cyanophages might provide a biological solution to control the awful blooms. However, genomic sequences and related investigations on the freshwater cyanophages remain very limited to date.Results Following our recently reported five cyanophages Pam1 similar to Pam5 from Lake Chaohu in China, here we isolated another five cyanophages, termed Pan1 similar to Pan5, which infect the cyanobacterium Pseudanabaena sp. Chao 1811. Whole-genome sequencing showed that they all contain a double-stranded DNA genome of 37.2 to 72.0 kb in length, with less than half of the putative open reading frames annotated with known functions. Remarkably, the siphophage Pan1 encodes an auxiliary metabolic gene phoH and constitutes, together with the host, a complete queuosine modification pathway. Proteomic analyses revealed that although Pan1 similar to Pan5 are distinct from each other in evolution, Pan1 and Pan3 are somewhat similar to our previously identified cyanophages Pam3 and Pam1 at the genomic level, respectively. Moreover, phylogenetic analyses suggested that Pan1 resembles the alpha-proteobacterial phage vB_DshS-R5C, revealing direct evidence for phage-mediated horizontal gene transfer between cyanobacteria and alpha-proteobacteria.Conclusion In addition to the previous reports of Pam1 similar to Pam5, the present findings on Pan1 similar to Pan5 largely enrich the library of reference freshwater cyanophages. The abundant genomic information provides a pool to identify novel genes and proteins of unknown function. Moreover, we found for the first time the evolutionary traces in the cyanophage that horizontal gene transfer might occur at the level of not only inter-species, but even inter-phylum. It indicates that the bacteriophage or cyanophage could be developed as a powerful tool for gene manipulation among various species or phyla.

The present paper aimed to investigate the temporal change of yields of the most dominant fish species and to evaluate the spatio-temporal changes in the fish community and the indicator species of assemblages. Fish catch data were collected from thirtythree fishing lots around the lake during the open season from October to May each year between 1994 and 2000. The fish yields were dominated by few commercial fishes: Channa micropeltes, Pangasianodon hypophthalmus, Channa striata, Cyclocheilichthys enoplos, Henicorhynchus spp., Barbonymus gonionotus, Micronema spp. and Trichopodus microlepis. The standard linear regression coefficients of the fish yields versus year were negative for all these commercial species except T. microlepis. Moreover, the total fish yields of the lake were temporally declined (standard coefficient = -2.410, adjusted r(2) = 0.272). Nonmetric multidimensional scaling of the fish assemblage data showed a clear opposition between northern assemblage and southern assemblage along the first axis, and the temporal pattern of the samples from 1994 to 1999 was explained by the second axis. The fish species assemblage from earlier years (1994 and 1995) was characterised by the abundance of all functional groups of black-white-grey fish species, but more recent years (1996-1999) were linked to white and grey functional groups, which was explained by a decrease in many black fishes.

Development and testing of a biotic index to assess the ecological quality of lakes in Bangladesh	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lakes in Bangladesh face many threats including habitat loss, over-exploitation of resources, pollution (e.g. sewage, waste dumping), climate change and the introduction of non-native species. To support effective lake management, we developed and tested the first Bangladesh Lake Biotic Index (BLBI), an index based on macroinvertebrates with the potential to assess and monitor the ecological status of lakes. Twenty sites in each of fourteen representative lakes were surveyed during the wet and dry seasons in 2009 and 2010 (total N = 560) to investigate the variation in macroinvertebrate assemblages, and their response to several physical and chemical parameters. The BLBI of a particular lake was calculated according to taxa tolerance scores, allowing categorization of the studied lakes according to their ecological status: least polluted, moderately polluted and highly polluted. BLBI was positively related to traditional structural metrics including species diversity and richness, evenness, and presence of taxa sensitive to pollution such as Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera. Outcomes from this study provide basic information on the ecological status of lakes in Bangladesh, and encourage the use and development of biomonitoring methods for the assessment and conservation of lakes in developing Asian countries.

In this study, we examined the major ion composition of the inflows to, and the water in, the Caohai Wetland. The main sources of major ions in the wetland water were the groundwater and river water inflows, the chemical compositions of which were controlled by the local geology, aquifer water-rock interactions, and human activities. The inflowing waters were the Ca-HCO3 type. The wetland water was classified as the Mg-HCO3, Mg-SO4, Ca-HCO3, and Ca-SO4 types during the high-flow season, and as the Ca-HCO3 type in the low-flow season. The physical and chemical properties of the wetland water varied widely from west to east. Concentrations of K+, Ca+, Mg2+, Cl-, and HCO3 (-) in the wetland water were higher in the low-flow season than in the high-flow season; K+, Na+, Cl-, and Mg2+ concentrations were higher in the wetland than in the inflowing waters in both seasons, and HCO3 (-) concentrations were lower in the wetland than in the inflowing waters. The chemical composition of the wetland water was mainly controlled by biogeochemical processes and evaporation in the high-flow season, and by evaporation in the low-flow season.

RDW discharge is assumed to be an important source of ammonium in surface water; however, the effect of long-term RDW discharge on nitrogen pollution in sediments remains unknown. Batch incubations were conducted to investigate the characteristics of internal ammonium loading from long-term polluted sediments by RDW discharge. Four sediments were demonstrated to be heavily polluted by long-term RDW discharge, with total nitrogen (TN) values of 5350, 8080, 2730, and 2000 mg center dot kg(-1), respectively. The internal ammonium release from sediment was a slow and long process, and the risk of ammonium release from sediment during the dry season was significantly greater than that during the wet season. Though all selected sediments were heavily polluted by long-term RDW discharge, the relative contribution of internal ammonium loading from sediments was generally lower than that of external pollution. Hence, dredging is not suggested for RDW-polluted sediments except in response to an emergency. The excessive ammonium in the selected catchment was mainly from untreated and centralized black water in RDW. Centralized black waters in rural communities are highlighted to be separately treated or reused to maintain ammonium content at a safe level.					; Shen, Yi/HOA-8628-2023; Li, Qingqing/AAM-4971-2021	Shen, Yi/0000-0001-8977-7569; yungui, li/0000-0001-7813-279X; Li, Qingqing/0000-0002-9015-7815														1660-4601				DEC	2019	16	23							4657	10.3390/ijerph16234657	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16234657								31766710					WOS:000507275700047

Once a year, the fish take part in reproductive migration to the fresh waters flowing into the lake. The fish migrate from an extreme environment with high salinity (2.2%) and high pH (9.8). These fish are unable to reproduce in this alkaline environment and must migrate to fresh water during their breeding season. The aim of the present study is to report the presence of the myxosporean parasites on the gills and the pathological changes. Changes in gill histopathology, mucocytes, mitochondria-rich cells, expression of Heat Shock Protein 70 (Hsp70), and ATPase (NKA) were observed in the gill tissue. As a result of the histopathological changes in gills, infected fish had abundant plasmodia with different sizes. Plasmodia were found on gill filaments inside white ovoid-shaped structures. It was observed that plasmodia were contained on the primary filament which changed the histological structure of the gill tissue to a large extent. It was determined that the density and size of mucocytes in the infected areas of the gill tissue increased, whereas the number of mitochondria-rich cells decreased. Hsp70, an indicator of stress, was not different between normal and infected fish.					; oguz, ahmet/G-3672-2013	KAVAL OGUZ, Elif/0000-0003-0196-2693; oguz, ahmet regaib/0000-0001-6431-0508													0147-8885	2046-0236				APR 2	2020	43	2					76	82		10.1080/01478885.2019.1686848	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01478885.2019.1686848		DEC 2019						31783723					WOS:000499488100001

Seasonal variation effect on water quality and sediments criteria and its influence on soil pollution: Fayoum Governorate, Egypt	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE												BackgroundIrrigation with low-quality water without considering the acceptable levels negatively impacts not only humans, but also extends to the whole surrounding ecosystem. The current research is a comprehensive-integrated appraisal of the irrigation water quality gathered from El-Batts drain in Fayoum Governorate, from September 2021 to June 2022, together with the drain sediments and the soils adjacent to it. The characteristics (physical, chemical and biological), and the risk fate of some heavy metals (As, B, Cr, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, Ni, Fe and Mn) were measured. Moreover, the risks of the studied pollutants were assessed using many indices: irrigation water quality index (IWQI), contamination factor (Cf), degree of contamination (Cd), Salinity indices and Zn equivalent (ZE). Additionally, kinetic studies of the inorganic pollutants were evaluated to determine their availability and impact on the surrounding environment.ResultsData from IQWI showed that water in all five sites was assumed to be very bad and unsuitable for usage with a general average (14.62 and 25.35) in all four seasons. ZE exceeds the critical level of 250, which means there is a risk of soil contamination.ConclusionsThe elevated levels of heavy metals, microbial enzymes, pathogenic fecal coliform and Salmonella reflect bad and direct risk of dealing with such water in irrigation and its effect on the soil ecosystem and the growing crops. Most of the tested parameters exceeded the acceptable levels of the Egyptian Governmental Law Guidelines, WHO and FAO, which may threaten aquatic life.

Microcystis species produce microcystins (MCs) as a cyanotoxin. Certain bacteria that harbor the mlr gene cluster, especially mlrA, are capable of degrading MCs. However, MC-degrading bacteria may possess or lack mlr genes (mlr(+) and mlr(-) genotypes, respectively). In this study, we investigated the genotype that predominantly contributes to biodegradation and cyanobacterial predator community structure with change in total MC concentration in an aquatic environment. The 2 genotypes coexisted but mlr(+) predominated, as indicated by the negative correlation between mlrA gene copy abundance and total MC concentration. At the highest MC concentrations, predation pressure by Phyllopoda, Copepoda, and Monogononta (rotifers) was reduced; thus, MCs may be toxic to cyanobacterial predators. The results suggest that cooperation between MC-degrading bacteria and predators may reduce Microcystis abundance and MC concentration.					utsumi, motoo/AAB-5780-2020; Lei, Zhongfang/B-3611-2014; Amano, Chie/AFS-1822-2022; Shimizu, Kazuya/V-3417-2019	Shimizu, Kazuya/0000-0002-8274-0410; Amano, Chie/0000-0003-2537-9902; Li, Qintong/0000-0003-0675-5968													0916-8451	1347-6947				JAN	2022	86	1					78	91		10.1093/bbb/zbab179	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bbb/zbab179		OCT 2021						34661632					WOS:000734808900009

Evaluating consumptive and nonconsumptive predator effects on prey density using field time-series data	ECOLOGY												Determining the degree to which predation affects prey abundance in natural communities constitutes a key goal of ecological research. Predators can affect prey through both consumptive effects (CEs) and nonconsumptive effects (NCEs), although the contributions of each mechanism to the density of prey populations remain largely hypothetical in most systems. Common statistical methods applied to time-series data cannot elucidate the mechanisms responsible for hypothesized predator effects on prey density (e.g., differentiate CEs from NCEs), nor can they provide parameters for predictive models. State-space models (SSMs) applied to time-series data offer a way to meet these goals. Here, we employ SSMs to assess effects of an invasive predatory zooplankter, Bythotrephes longimanus, on an important prey species, Daphnia mendotae, in Lake Michigan. We fit mechanistic models in an SSM framework to seasonal time series (1994-2012) using a recently developed, maximum-likelihood-based optimization method, iterated filtering, which can overcome challenges in ecological data (e.g., nonlinearities, measurement error, and irregular sampling intervals). Our results indicate that B. longimanus strongly influences D. mendotae dynamics, with mean annual peak densities of B. longimanus observed in Lake Michigan estimated to cause a 61% reduction in D. mendotae population growth rate and a 59% reduction in peak biomass density. Further, the observed B. longimanus effect is most consistent with an NCE via reduced birth rates. The SSM approach also provided estimates for key biological parameters (e.g., demographic rates) and the contribution of dynamic stochasticity and measurement error. Our study therefore provides evidence derived directly from survey data that the invasive zooplankter B. longimanus is affecting zooplankton demographics and offer parameter estimates needed to inform predictive models that explore the effect of B. longimanus under different scenarios, such as climate change.					; Bence, James/E-5057-2017	Elgin, Ashley/0000-0001-5728-9843; Pothoven, Steven/0000-0002-7992-5422; 													0012-9658	1939-9170				MAR	2019	100	3							e02583	10.1002/ecy.2583	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.2583								30565223					WOS:000460163500017

The present study aims to quantify and qualify changes in the transfer of terrestrial organic matter (TOM) to aquatic environments following deforestation. Lignin biomarkers have been analyzed from sediment cores collected in three floodplain lakes and in suspended particulate matter sampled during both wet and dry seasons. These analyses are interpreted with regard to lignin biomarker signatures of surface and deeper horizons of common soils, and of dominant plant species from forested and deforested environments. Dating the sediment cores with Pb-210 allows reconstructing the successive deforestation cycles since the onset of European colonization two centuries ago. Further, satellite images coupled to a GIS approach is used to correlate the evolution of sedimentary TOM and anthropogenic land-use from 1986 to 2009. Over this period, sedimentation rates have sharply increased, and the nature of the sedimentary TOM has been shifted from being linked to primeval forest soils to degraded soils following deforestation for subsistence cropping and/or pasture lands. The intensity of changes in the nature of sedimentary TOM appears inversely related to the connectivity of flood lakes to the river. In the least connected flood lake, weathering of pasture soils in the watershed dominates TOM inputs particularly during the dry season. Massive deforestation in the Amazon thus triggers major changes in the nature of TOM transferred and sedimented in aquatic systems.

Geochemistry of the Lake Chad Tributaries Under Strongly Varying Hydro-climatic Conditions	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The Lake Chad Basin (LCB) is one of the main endorheic basins in the world and has undergone large-level and surface variations during the last decades, particularly during the Sahelian dry period in the 1970s and the 1980s. The Chari-Logone River system covers 25% of the LCB but accounts for up to 82% of the Lake Chad water supply. The aim of this study is to investigate the dissolved phase transported by the Chari-Logone system, in order (1) to elucidate the origin and the behavior of major elements and the weathering processes in the watershed; (2) to estimate the total dissolved flux, its variability over the last decades and the driving factors. To do so, samples were collected monthly between January 2013 and November 2016 at three representative sites of the basin: in the Chari River in "Chagoua," in the Logone River in "Ngueli" just before the confluence of both rivers, and at a downstream site in "Douguia," 30 km after the confluence. Concentrations in major elements displayed significant seasonal variations in the Chari and Logone waters. At the seasonal time scale, the comparison between the concentrations of chemical elements and the flow rates showed a hysteresis loop. This hysteresis behavior corresponds to a variable contribution over time of two water bodies, fast surface water, and slow groundwater, the latter carrying higher concentrations and Ca/Na ratio, which may result from the contribution of pedogenic carbonate weathering to the dominant signature of silicate weathering. At the annual time scale, similar average concentrations are observed in the Chari and Logone Rivers, despite contrasted annual runoff. In addition, an interannual stability of ionic concentrations was observed in the Chari-Logone River during the flood regime, both during the years covered by our monitoring (2013-2016) and during the pre-drought period (1969, 1972 and 1973). This situation corresponds to a chemostatic behavior, where the annual river discharge is the main factor controlling the interannual variation of chemical fluxes.					; Bouchez, Camille/AAC-3015-2021; NOUR, Abdallah/AAR-4464-2021; Deschamps, Pierre/M-9632-2013	Vallet-Coulomb, Christine/0000-0001-5898-1516; Mahamat Nour, Abdallah/0000-0001-5364-2750; Bouchez, Camille/0000-0002-3094-6070; Deschamps, Pierre/0000-0003-1687-3765													1380-6165	1573-1421				MAR	2020	26	1					3	29		10.1007/s10498-019-09363-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10498-019-09363-w		NOV 2019											WOS:000499413200001

Correlations between fatty acid composition of seston and zooplankton and effects of environmental parameters in a eutrophic Siberian reservoir	LIMNOLOGICA												During two sampling seasons we analyzed on weekly basis fatty acid (FA) composition of seston fraction < 130 pm and zooplankton fraction > 130 mu m, and compared them using a multivariate canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Besides, we evaluated a possible impact of water temperature and inorganic nutrients on FA composition of the seston and the zooplankton. In spite of significant differences in percentages of several individual FAs, we found very strong canonical correlation (cross-correlation, 1-week lag) between FA composition of the seston and the zooplankton. The most important factor, providing the overall canonical cross-correlation between FA profiles of the seston and the zooplankton fractions was eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5 omega 3, EPA). FA composition of the zooplankton fraction had comparatively poor correlations with taxonomic composition of the zooplankton. Thus, seasonal variations of FA composition of the zooplankton were determined primarily by seasonal changes in FA composition of the seston, rather than by taxonomic differences of FA profiles between rotifers, cyclopoids and cladocerans. FA composition of the seston was strongly affected by its taxonomic composition, namely by that of phytoplankton. According to CCA, the highest factor loadings pertained to diatoms interacting with their marker acids, including EPA, and cyanobacteria and greens, interacting with their marker acids. Ciliates and small rotifers composed considerable and sometimes major part of the seston biomass, but according to CCA their contributions to seasonal variations of the total FA profile of the seston were insignificant. This finding indirectly support the conclusion of the other authors, that the main source of FAs presented in ciliates and rotifers must be sought in algae and that they do not modify FA composition of food consumed, apart from repackaging it. Water temperature was the principal environmental parameter which drove the overall variations of FA composition. Factor loadings for the inorganic nutrients were comparatively negligible. The main contribution in the seasonal variation of FA composition of the seston was given by negative interaction between water temperature and percentage of EPA in the seston.

Temporal variation of the small eukaryotic community in two freshwater lakes: emphasis on zoosporic fungi	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Applications of molecular approaches to the study of microbial eukaryotic communities in freshwater lakes are transforming our understanding of these ecosystems. One of the most unexpected discoveries is that zoosporic fungi significantly dominate the planktonic fungal diversity. Although zoosporic fungi are now recognized as an important component of aquatic microbial food webs, our knowledge of their community structure and temporal variability remains poor. The objectives of our study were (1) to compare and describe the contribution of zoosporic fungi to the eukaryotic diversity in 2 lakes differing in their trophic status during the mixing and the stratified seasons and (2) to phylogenetically identify the recovered zoosporic fungal sequences. The small eukaryotes (0.6 to 8 mu m) of the euphotic zone of the oligotrophic Lake Tuscaloosa and meso-eutrophic Lake Lurleen (Alabama, USA) were collected over 1 yr. Analyses of the 28S rDNA clone libraries showed that zoosporic fungi dominated the small planktonic fungal community and were more diverse in the meso-eutrophic lake and during the thermal stratification. Although the overall structure of the eukaryotic community was similar between the 2 lakes, at lower taxonomic levels, community composition differed. Analyses of the retrieved fungal sequences revealed that zoosporic fungi mostly affiliated with Rhizophydiales and Chytridiales or formed environmental clades. Although the phytoplanktonic community was also monitored, zoosporic fungal parasites were rarely observed on algae. These results provide new insights into the diversity and seasonality of the zoosporic fungal community in lake ecosystems.																			0948-3055	1616-1564					2012	67	2					91	105		10.3354/ame01592	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame01592													WOS:000310006400001

Use of flow-normalization to evaluate nutrient concentration and flux changes in Lake Champlain tributaries, 1990-2009	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The U.S. Geological Survey evaluated 20 years of total phosphorus (P) and total nitrogen (N) concentration data for 18 Lake Champlain tributaries using a new statistical method based on weighted regressions to estimate daily concentration and flux histories based on discharge, season, and trend as explanatory variables. The use of all the streamflow discharge values for a given date in the record, in a process called "flow-normalization", removed the year-to-year variation due to streamflow and generated a smooth time series from which trends were calculated. This approach to data analysis can be of great value to evaluations of the success of restoration efforts because it filters out the large random fluctuations in the flux that are due to the temporal variability in streamflow. Results for the full 20 years of record showed a mixture of upward and downward trends for concentrations and yields of P and N. When the record was broken into two 10-year periods, for many tributaries, the more recent period showed a reversal in N from upward to downward trends and a similar reversal or reduction in magnitude of upward trends for P. Some measures of P and N concentrations and yields appear to be related to intensity of agricultural activities, point-source loads of P, or population density. Total flow-normalized P flux aggregated from the monitored tributaries showed a decrease of 30 metric tons per year from 1991 to 2009, which is about 15% of the targeted reduction established by the operational management plan for the Lake Champlain Basin.

J	Wang, YP; Wang, X; Ding, P				Wang, Yanping; Wang, Xi; Ding, Ping			Nestedness of snake assemblages on islands of an inundated lake	CURRENT ZOOLOGY												Nestedness is a pattern frequently reported for faunal assemblages in fragmented systems. Although nestedness has been documented for a wide range of taxa, it is rarely tested in snake assemblages. To arrive at robust generalizations about processes and mechanisms structuring island biotas, it is important to examine under-represented taxa such as snakes for the insights they may offer. We tested for the existence of nestedness and underlying causal mechanisms using snake data collected on islands in the Thousand Island Lake, China. We used the line-transect method to survey snake occupancy and abundance on 20 islands during two breeding seasons in 2009 and 2010. We used the recently developed metric WNODF to estimate nestedness. We used Spearman rank correlations to examine the associations of nestedness and habitat variables (area, isolation, and habitat diversity) as well as life-history traits (body size, clutch size, geographical range size and area requirement) related to species extinction and immigration tendencies. Snake assemblages were significantly nested and were shaped by extinction processes mediated through area effects and habitat nestedness. The nestedness of snake assemblages was not due to passive sampling or selective colonization. From a conservation viewpoint, our results indicate that we should protect both the largest island with the most species-rich community and habitat-rich islands to maximize the number of species preserved [Current Zoology 58 (6): 828-836, 2012].

Using high-resolution in situ radon measurements to determine groundwater discharge at a remote location: Tonle Sap Lake, Cambodia	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY												Tonle Sap Lake (Cambodia) is the largest freshwater lake in SE Asia, and is reported to have one of the highest freshwater fish productions anywhere. During the dry season (November-April) the lake drains through a tributary to the Mekong River. The flow in the connecting tributary completely reverses during the wet monsoon (May-October), adding huge volumes of water back to the lake, increasing its area about fourfold. We hypothesize that nutrients are at least partially delivered via groundwater discharge, especially during the draining portion of the annual flood cycle. We surveyed over 200 km in the northern section of the lake using a customized system that measures natural Rn-222 (radon), temperature, conductivity, GPS coordinates and water depth while underway. Results showed that there were portions of the lake with significant enrichments in radon, indicating likely groundwater inputs. These same areas were generally characterized by lower electrical conductivities. Samples collected from nearby wells also showed a general inverse relationship between radon and conductivity. Our data suggest that groundwater pathways are important, accounting for roughly 10-20 % of the freshwater flow of the Tonle Sap tributary (connection to the Mekong River), the largest single source of fresh water to the lake. Nutrient inputs from these inputs, because of higher concentrations in groundwater, will be correspondingly higher.

This study focused on the saline, turbid and arid Ebinur Lake, located in China's northwestern region. The Random Forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model algorithms were compared to select the one with the highest accuracy. It combined Sentinel-2 remote sensing data and in situ measurement data for the quantitative inversion of CDOM. Monthly CDOM distribution maps were generated with a 10 m resolution for the non-frozen months of May to October from 2018 to 2022, followed by a comprehensive analysis of temporal trends. The primary conclusions are: (1) The XGBoost model yielded highly accurate CDOM estimates, with a training set coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.94, a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.06 mg/L, Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 6.05 %, Relative Percent Difference (RPD) of 4.07; the test set demonstrated an R2 of 0.41 with an RMSE of 0.22 mg/L, MAPE of 22.74 %, RPD of 1.35; (2) Throughout the study period, the main lake portion displayed variable CDOM spatial patterns and trends. The inversion indicated higher CDOM concentrations in the central part than nearshore areas and decreasing CDOM in tandem with seasonable water-surface shrinkage. The findings offer hints for an accurate evaluation of water color parameters of Ebinur Lake and practical references for monitoring arid-region lake water quality via remote sensing.

The Influence of Fetch on the Holocene Thermal Structure of Hidden Lake, Glacier National Park	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												We use three-dimensional modeling of the basin of Hidden Lake, Montana, to assess the influence of effective fetch on diatom-inferred changes in mixing depths throughout the Holocene. The basin of Hidden Lake is characterized by a complex morphometry; for example, three-dimensional modeling of the lake basin indicates that a decrease in lake level of 2 m would result in complete isolation of the deepest part of the lake basin from the rest of the lake. Our model suggests that small changes in the lake surface elevation at Hidden Lake would produce threshold-like responses in effective fetch, which in turn would have a profound influence on average lake mixing depth. The present-day planktic diatom community of Hidden Lake is comprised of three species. Neo-ecological experiments revealed the effect of mixing depth and nutrient levels on growth rates of these species. A sediment core collected from the deepest part of the lake basin and spanning the last 8,640 years was analyzed for diatoms. Here we show how changes in fetch through the Holocene explain changes in the dominant planktic diatom species by modification of the thermal structure of Hidden Lake. Additionally, the timing of diatom-inferred changes in effective moisture and thermal structure from Hidden Lake were compared to late Holocene patterns reconstructed from other regional lake records. Between 8.64 - 7.61 ka the diatom record from Hidden Lake suggests that the lake was deep and fresh, although somewhat lower than the modern lake. After 7.61 ka, water levels rose, expanding the available benthic diatom habitat. Between 6.18 and 4.13 ka, lake level declined and seasonal stratification was enhanced. After 1.4 ka, the lake became deeper and less stratified in response to the effects of enhanced fetch. We argue that changes in effective fetch may play an important, and underexplored, role in planktic diatom community structure over longer time scales and should be more broadly considered in paleolimnological studies.					; Spanbauer, Trisha/P-6916-2019	Stone, Jeffery/0000-0002-1313-0643; Spanbauer, Trisha/0000-0002-4014-4995; 														2296-6463				FEB 22	2019	7								28	10.3389/feart.2019.00028	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2019.00028													WOS:000467225300001

Challenges in applying water budget framework for estimating groundwater storage changes from GRACE observations	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The application of a water budget framework to isolate Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) groundwater storage anomalies (GRACE-GWA) from GRACE terrestrial water storage anomalies (GRACE-TWSA) is hindered by the lack of direct observations of water budget components. In GRACE groundwater studies, water budget components are frequently applied to isolate changes in a storage component from various auxiliary methods (e.g., land surface or hydrology models, reanalysis, or remote sensing) and are used as a supplement to, or a substitute for, in-situ measurements when direct observations are sparse or unavailable. The contribution of select auxiliary datasets to isolate GRACE-GWA from GRACE-TWSA is an enduring quandary, attributed to the various assumptions applied to resemble hydrologic processes in model formulations. This study systematically allocates water budget components from assorted auxiliary sources to demonstrate bias and distortion of GRACEGWA resulting simply from water storage component data selection. Whereas previous GRACE-GWA studies used combinations of water budget component datasets with uncertainty derived from the variance of the combined water budget components, this study applies single estimates for each component to measure bias and variability. An initial comparative analysis focused on three basins with suitable in-situ groundwater observations and complex hydrology stores (e.g., large lakes and seasonal snow cover), with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.32 to 0.89. Our systematic analysis was extended to 12 additional basins that capture a range of hydrologic characteristics to highlight the inconsistency in GRACE-GWA estimates. The variability evident in GRACE-GWA estimates highlights that the selection of water budget components carries the risk of misleading outcomes when disaggregating GRACE-TWSA into GRACE-GWA.

Tolypella mongolica (Charophyceae, Characeae): A new dioecious charophyte species from the center of Eurasia and implications for charophyte taxonomy, including the validation of T. porteri and the new combination for T. jwalae	PHYTOTAXA												A new dioecious species of Tolypella, T. mongolica sp. nov. from the section Tolypella, was described using an integrative taxonomy. It was found in three distant localities - shallows of a brackish small lake and a channel in the midland steppe in Mongolia and the Altai Mountains, and a small brackish water body in the dry steppe in Southeast Europe. It differs from other species in rbcL and ITS sequences and in distinct complex ornamentation of the oospore surface, varying from sparsely coarsely tuberculate to having the appearance of an aerial view of mountain landscape with acute to mostly sharp edges of elements at probably the ripest stage. Wide intrapopulation variability of expression of this trait, only partly explainable by oospore ripening stage, was found and illustrated for two populations, indicating previous underestimation of this phenomenon in taxonomic research. T. mongolica is richly fertile and appears to be ephemeral as most species of this genus. Only female plants were found in all localities. The absence of male plants could be referred to either their earlier development during the growing season or, less likely, parthenogenesis in this species. The description of the new species suggests taxonomic changes for two dioecious species of charophytes. Tolypella porteri stat. et comb. nov. was validated here. T. jwalae was recognized as a species of Nitella, N. jwalae comb. nov.					; Romanov, Roman/A-3686-2013; Efremov, Andrey/AAO-3904-2020; Gontcharov, Andrey/GLR-4125-2022; Nikulin, Vyacheslav/AAO-3365-2020; Vishnyakov, Vasily/Q-6184-2016	Efremov, Andrey/0000-0001-8983-392X; Romanov, Roman/0000-0002-6137-3586; Vishnyakov, Vasily/0000-0003-3807-2221; Gontcharov, Andrey/0000-0003-2918-730X; Nikulin, Vyacheslav/0000-0002-6643-4325; 													1179-3155	1179-3163				JUL 9	2024	659	1					24	40		10.11646/phytotaxa.659.1.2	http://dx.doi.org/10.11646/phytotaxa.659.1.2													WOS:001275548100001

This study aimed to explore the response of the diversity and composition of denitrifying bacteria to the environmental factors in wetland, so as to obtain more information about the community structure of denitrifying bacteria driven by environmental factors. Using the genes encoding nitrite reductase (nirS and nirK) as molecular markers, we analysed the seasonal changes in the diversity of denitrifying bacteria in halophyte soils by high-throughput sequencing technology. The results showed that the diversity of denitrifying bacteria was higher in July and lower in April, showing seasonal changes. The diversity index of denitrifying bacteria in rhizosphere soil was higher than that in non-rhizosphere soil. The diversity of denitrifying bacteria in the Phragmites australis rhizosphere soil was the highest. The diversity of nirK denitrifying bacteria was higher than that of nirS denitrifying bacteria, but the relative abundance was lower than that of nirS denitrifying bacteria. Three-way ANOVA showed that soil types, vegetation types and season had significant effects on the diversity of denitrifying bacteria. Furthermore, redundancy analysis indicated that nitrate was the environmental factor that significantly affected the community structure of nirS denitrifying bacteria in wetland, and electric conductivity, total nitrogen, ammonium and nitrate were the environmental factors that significantly affected the community structure of nirK denitrifying bacteria. These results provide data basis and theoretical support for the dynamic change of diversity of denitrifying bacteria in wetland.

Douglas			Variations in U concentrations and isotope signatures in two Canadian lakes impacted by U mining: A combination of anthropogenic and biogeochemical processes	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Temporal and vertical variations in uranium (U) concentrations and U isotope (delta U-238, parts per thousand) signatures were examined in sediment cores collected seven times over a one year period, from two lakes in Ontario, Canada, which are contaminated with U by historical mining activities. Bow Lake is holomictic, experiencing seasonal anoxia, while the sediments of meromictic Bentley Lake are permanently anoxic. Average annual peak concentrations of U in Bow Lake subsurface sediments were approximately 300 mu g L-1 and 600 mu g g(-1) in porewater and bulk sediments, respectively. Similar ranges of concentrations (900 mu g L-1 and 600 mu g g(-1), respectively) were observed in Bentley Lake sediments. The exceedingly high levels of U observed in the porewaters of both lakes, as well as the seasonal variability in U levels, challenge the traditional paradigm regarding U chemistry, i.e., that reduced U(IV) should be insoluble under anoxic conditions. The average annual delta U-238 parts per thousand values at the sediment-water interface of both lakes were similar (i.e., 0.47 +/- 0.09 parts per thousand and 0.50 +/- 0.16 parts per thousand, relative to IRMM-184). The deep sediments in both Bentley Lake and Bow Lake record U isotope composition with a typical fractionation of 0.6 parts per thousand relative to the surface water, confirming authigenic U accumulation, i.e., negligible contribution of particulate material from the tailings. Also, the delta U-238 values in porewater have an average offset of ca. -0.1 parts per thousand relative to bulk sediments in anoxic zones and are reversed in the oxic sediment layer.

This is particularly true in arid and semiarid regions like the Sahel where permanent surface waters are rare and hydrological solutions (e.g., accessing deep aquifers) are often not feasible. This work is devoted to the determination of the spatial and temporal variations of surface water extent at 250m over 9years (2003-2011) for the Soudan-Sahel region using visible and infrared imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from both Terra and Aqua platforms. The methodology is automatic and could be applied to other regions and sensors. We utilized a combination of two MODIS spectral indices: the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index. Accuracy assessments carried out on 743 lakes across 37 Landsat images selected in Sahelian Africa on the basis of a stratified sampling show that the new product is (i) reliably able to detect surface water bodies of approximately 50ha and larger, (ii) improves on existing surface water body products, and (iii) can be used to monitor the seasonal distribution of surface water in semiarid regions.

Species portfolio effects dominate seasonal zooplankton stabilization within a large temperate lake	ECOLOGY												Portfolio effects (PEs) in ecology refer to the suite of phenomenon where the temporal variation of aggregate ecosystem properties (i.e., abundance) is lower than that of their ecosystem components. An example of this is where differential responses of species to environmental variation generate stability at higher levels of ecological organization (e.g., local community, metapopulation, metacommunity). Most of the research examining such PEs has focused on spatial or interannual variation of ecosystems; however, as global change continues to alter seasonality and ecosystem functioning, understanding the underlying food web structures that help maintain stability at multiple spatial and temporal scales is critical to managing ecological systems. Recent advances investigating diversity-stability relationships has led to the development of frameworks that incorporate a metacommunity perspective which allows for the partitioning of PEs across organizational scales (i.e., local community, metapopulation, cross-community, metacommunity) from local population dynamics (total). This partitioning yields insights into the mechanisms that generate observed PEs in nature. Here, we employed one of these recently developed frameworks on a temporally (1986-1999, 2008-2019) and spatially (five sampling stations, local communities) extensive data set of zooplankton abundance (e.g., density) within a large temperate lake to investigate how temporal (seasonal) and spatial (among site) PEs influence stability within the zooplankton metacommunity. We found that seasonal asynchrony of different zooplankton species within local communities and across communities generated the vast majority of stabilization, while spatial (i.e., metapopulation) dynamics were more synchronous and contributed little to overall system stability. Furthermore, significantly positive diversity-asynchrony relationships at the total, local- and cross-community scales were found as asynchrony was positively correlated with local Shannon diversity. Last, a comparison of PEs over the time periods, during which significant local and global changes (i.e., climate warming, invasive species) have occurred suggests that PEs may be eroding, as increasingly synchronous dynamics and declining diversity in recent years have led to a rise in metacommunity variability. We end by arguing for the critical importance of understanding seasonally driven stabilizing mechanisms as local and global changes threaten to fundamentally alter seasonal signals with potentially strong implications for the structures that lend stability to ecosystems.

The accumulation of agricultural runoff through the Main Nara Valley Drain (MNVD) has changed its fate of salty water. The super flood event of 2010 in the Indus River and the receiving MNVD passed through Manchar Lake, affecting the lake water and sediments. The study, covering the period earlier than the monsoon season (April-June) of 2012, includes the physicochemical characteristics of water quality and sediments. Two bodies, the water and sediments, were monitored for more than 30 parameters: TDS, EC, DO, COD, BOD, chloride, hardness, alkalinity, nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, sulfate, orthophosphate, total phosphate, Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Cd, Pb, Cr, Ni, Co, Cu, Mn, and Zn. The total extractable salts in sediments were determined by EDTA or mixed acid. The trend of EDTA-extractable metals was in a decreasing order Ca>Mg>Na>K>Fe>Mn>Pb>Ni>Zn>Cu>Cr>Cd. Most of the acid-extractable metals indicated similar pattern but the values were lower than EDTA. The water and sediments of the lake indicated less contamination compared to that reported before the Indus river super flood 2010, despite causing many causalities and economic loss. The study explained factor analysis (FA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), Pearson correlation coefficient, and geo contamination index for the quality parameters of the water and sediments.

While the influence of biological factors, such as food availability and composition, has been recognized in theory and studies in some temperate lakes, how food availability and composition affect the seasonal succession of zooplankton communities, especially in tropical/subtropical lakes, is still unclear and under debate. In this study, we applied multivariate analyses to a 3-year time series of physicochemical factors, various food sources (primary and bacterial production), and phytoplankton and zooplankton species composition in a subtropical reservoir in Taiwan. Our results demonstrated that (i) in addition to physical factors, seasonal variation of food availability partly explains zooplankton seasonal succession. In particular, inter-annual variation of food availability proved more important than physical factors in determining the inter-annual variation in zooplankton populations. Specifically, limited food supply amplifies the amplitude of seasonal variation of zooplankton community biomass and composition; (ii) the association between zooplankton and phytoplankton was stronger when regarding their species composition than when regarding their biomass, implying a strong interaction between zooplankton and phytoplankton at the community level.

The rotifer community and its functional role in lakes of a neotropical floodplain	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												Aquatic communities vary depending on local factors, such as environmental conditions and biological interactions and regional factors, such as the hydrological regime in floodplains. This study analyzed the community structure of rotifers and their secondary production in two lakes of an Upper Parana River floodplain (Brazil) differing in their hydrology: one connected to the river and the other isolated. Integrated samples of the water column were collected daily during 15 days in the low and high water periods. Three statistical methods, ANOVA, MRT, and IndVal were applied to distinguish the structure, biomass, and secondary production of their rotifer communities. The rotifer fauna was rich (91 species). Temperature, an indicator of seasonal change, and hydrological connection to river were major factors structuring rotifer communities. The community presented differences between periods in the isolated lake, but had a higher stability in the connected lake. We identified 34 indicator species of the groups formed by the MRT analysis. Production was low and consistent in the connected lake (similar to 1.5 mu g DW m(-3) day(-1)), being higher and more variable in the isolated lake (peaking at ca. 60-90 mu g DW m(-3) day(-1)). Results also showed that changing environmental conditions verified in the low water period and in the isolated lake were determinant for both the community structure and the secondary production of rotifers. We demonstrate that not only flooding but also the levels of isolation from the river during low water period are the driving forces for the structure and dynamics of organisms in floodplains. Thus, the isolated lakes represent important areas for rotifer biodiversity.					; Dias, Juliana/B-3184-2013; Bonecker, Claudia/D-5946-2013; Miracle, Maria/G-3482-2016	Bonecker, Claudia/0000-0003-4338-9012; Dias, Juliana/0000-0003-2881-3751													1434-2944	1522-2632				MAR	2014	99	1-2			SI		72	83		10.1002/iroh.201301706	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.201301706													WOS:000333163800008

Here we report quantitative estimates for the contribution of littoral versus pelagic sources in supporting the three most important planktivorous fish of a deep, large, subalpine lake in Italy. Contributions of pelagic (p) and littoral (q) signatures of delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotopes were detected in fish muscular tissue by applying a dynamic baseline mixing model. This model integrates tissue-specific metabolic turnover (m) and fish growth (k) rates over baselines delta C-13 seasonality. Annual fluctuations for both pelagic and littoral baselines were not negligible (Delta C = 10% and 8%, respectively). We calculated that they could not be ignored, since contributions of pelagic and littoral signatures would be largely underestimated (up to 30% p and 13% q for whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) and roach (Rutilus rutilus), respectively). When fish relied upon pelagic consumers, stepwise N-15-enrichment (E) of pelagic preys linearly decreased with prey-size-specific predation pressure. Therefore, longer food webs would be proportionally less stepwise N-15-enriched than shorter ones.					; Di Guardo, Antonio/E-3905-2010	VOLTA, Pietro/0000-0003-3177-0473; Di Guardo, Antonio/0000-0001-9284-2763													0706-652X	1205-7533				MAR	2014	71	3					436	446		10.1139/cjfas-2013-0178	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2013-0178													WOS:000332461000011

Identifying Cisco Refuge Lakes in Minnesota under Future Climate Scenarios	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The cisco Coregonus artedi is the most common coldwater stenothermal fish in Minnesota lakes. To project its chances of survival under future warmer climate conditions, an oxythermal habitat variable, i.e., the water temperature at 3 mg/L of dissolved oxygen in stratified lakes (TDO3) was calculated from simulated daily temperature and DO profiles in 30 lake types under past (1962-2008) climate conditions and two future climate scenarios. The mean daily TDO3 values over a 31-d fixed benchmark period were calculated for each of the simulated years and then averaged over the simulation period for each lake type. The multiyear average TDO3 was used to identify cisco refuge lakes in Minnesota. Six hundred twenty known cisco lakes in Minnesota were divided into three groups, tier 1 refuge lakes having the most suitable habitat for ciscoes, tier 2 refuge lakes having suitable habitat for ciscoes, and tier 3 or nonrefuge lakes supporting ciscoes only at a reduced probability of occurrence. The multiyear average TDO3s for tier 1, 2, and 3 lakes were <= 11 degrees C, 11-17 degrees C, and >17 degrees C, respectively. Projected increases in the multiyear average TDO3 under the two future climate scenarios averaged 2.6 degrees C to 2.9 degrees C. About one-third of the 620 lakes that are known to have cisco populations were projected to maintain viable cisco habitat under the two future climate scenarios. These lakes have a Secchi depth greater than 2.3 m (mesotrophic and oligotrophic lakes) and are seasonally stratified.					liu, jingjing/K-1183-2016; Fang, Xing/AAC-4760-2021														0002-8487	1548-8659				NOV 1	2012	141	6					1608	1621		10.1080/00028487.2012.713888	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2012.713888													WOS:000315216000017

Atmospheric Transport of Anthropogenic Impurities to the Russian Arctic (1986-2010)	ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS												The 25-year series of data on air-mass transport to three sites in the Russian Arctic has been extended till 2010 and analyzed. Spatial, seasonal, and long-term features of the atmospheric transport of anthropogenic aerosol impurities are studied. Changes in atmospheric circulation over 25 years (1986-2010) have led to an increase in the proportion of marine air masses above northern islands of Eurasia. This can affect the composition of soils, river and lake waters, and living conditions of the Arctic flora and fauna. For the last decade (2001-2010), the average anthropogenic air concentrations of heavy metals (Pb, Cd, As, Zn, Ni, Cr, and Cu) and black carbon, as well as their average fluxes onto the surface were estimated in the regions of Franz Josef Land and Severnaya Zemlya archipelagos.

However, there are few studies on the accumulation and loss of P from surface soil to deep soil profiles driven by shallow groundwater table (SGT) fluctuations. This study used the intensive cropland around 7 plateau lakes in Yunnan Province as an example and conducted in situ monitoring of P storage in the soil profile and SGT during the rainy season (RS) and dry season (DS) as well as simulation experiments on soil P loss. The aim was to study the spatiotemporal variation in P accumulation in the soil profile of cropland driven by SGT fluctuations in the RS and DS and estimate the P loss in the soil profile driven by SGT fluctuations. The results showed that fluctuations in the SGT promoted P accumulation from the surface soil to deeper soil. The proportions of P stored in various forms in the 30 -60 cm and 60 -100 cm soil layers in the RS were greater than those in the DS, while the average proportion in the 0 -30 cm soil layer in the DS was as high as 48%. Compared with those in the DS, the maximum decreases in the proportion of P stored as TP and Olsen-P in the 0 -100 cm soil layer in the RS were 16% and 58%, respectively, due to the rise in the SGT (SGT <30 cm), while the soil TP storage decreased by only 1% when the SGT was maintained at 60 -100 cm. The critical thresholds for soil Olsen-P and TP gradually decreased with increasing soil depth, and the risk of P loss in deeper soil increased. The loss of soil P was increased by fluctuations in the SGT. Based on the cropland area around the 7 plateau lakes, P storage, and SGT fluctuations, the average loss intensity and loss amount of TP in the 0 -100 cm soil layer around the 7 plateau lakes were estimated to be 25 kg/ha and 56 t, respectively. Therefore, reducing exogenous P inputs, improving soil endogenous P utilization efficiency and maintaining deep soil P retention are the basic strategies for preventing and controlling P accumulation and loss in deep soil caused by SGT fluctuations.

In this study, a three-dimensional manganese cycle model was developed and coupled with a hydrodynamic model, for the simulation of the distribution of manganese in a monomictic water reservoir. The model was successfully validated and used to model and predict the spatial-temporal manganese variation in the reservoir. Results showed that the variations of the thermal structure of the reservoir affect the seasonal change of manganese levels and in turn the peak concentrations of manganese in the epilimnion. It was also evident that the high level of dissolved oxygen in the epilimnion promotes the oxidation of soluble manganese, and the oxidised particulate Mn settles rapidly. The advection processes mainly caused by wind-driven currents play a vital role in rising or decreasing the level of soluble manganese near the dam wall. The developed numerical tool allows the user to gain a better understanding of spatial manganese distribution in different locations and depths of the reservoir under different wind/rain conditions, among others; such knowledge empowers the local water utility and enables more targeted, optimized water treatment strategies.

Mean flux rates of N2O were 0.054 +/- 0.094 mg N2O m(-2) h(-1) and 0.009 +/- 0.072 mg N2O m(-2) h(-1) from infralittoral zone and pelagic zone respectively. Submerged plant biomass index (SPBI) (R = 0.43, P < 0.01, n = 16), nitrate content in surface sediment (R = 0.22, P < 0.05, n = 16) and surface sediment temperature (R = 0.79, P = 0.000, n = 16) were found to significantly correlated to the spatial pattern of N2O flux. Nitrates loading gradient across (sub) zones along with the enhancing effect of plant on nitrate removal were thought to be responsible for this spatial pattern of N2O flux, while temperature act as a regulator on denitrification. Infralittoral zone had the greatest relative contribution (62.2%) of N2O emission to the whole lake budget among various (sub) zones, indicating infralittoral zone a vital component of N2O emission from shallow lakes. As the consequence of the lake restoration project, the response of N2O flux to the raised water depth might vary from different (sub) zones, therefore further study should be conducted so as to have a better understanding on the effect of restoration project on the overall N2O flux from the lake.

Feeding ecology of the freshwater crab Trichodactylus borellianus (Decapoda: Trichodactylidae) in the floodplain of the Parana River, southern South America	LATIN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC RESEARCH												Freshwater crabs are not commonly considered to be an important group in trophic webs, and this might be due to a lack of knowledge about their trophic roles in aquatic ecosystems. Trichodactylus borellianus is one of the most common and widely distributed freshwater crabs in the floodplains of the southern South American rivers. The main objective of the present study was to examine the trophic role of T. borellianus, in the floodplain of the Parana River, and its relationships with the freshwater littoral community. The trophic spectrum of this species was characterized for both sexes and individuals of different sizes (adults and juveniles), throughout daily and seasonal cycles. Samples were collected from the aquatic vegetation of three shallow lakes. The diet composition and the feeding activity of T. borellianus were evaluated through the examination of the stomach contents and their degree of emptiness. This crab species consumed several plant and animal items, including amoebas, rotifers, oligochaetes, copepods, cladocerans, and insect larvae. Moreover, this species consumes filamentous and unicellular algae, diatoms, fungi, and macrophytic remains. The predatory habits varied with the season and time of day, and variations in the feeding activity of the juveniles and adults were detected and documented. The diversity of food items eaten by this crab suggests that its trophic role in the community as an omnivore and opportunistic predator provides a connection among several trophic levels from both aquatic and terrestrial communities.					; Collins, Pablo/Q-7376-2017; Williner, Verónica/AAL-5868-2020	Collins, Pablo/0000-0001-9611-9089; 													0718-560X	0717-7178				SEP	2013	41	4			SI		781	792		10.3856/vol41-issue4-fulltext-15	http://dx.doi.org/10.3856/vol41-issue4-fulltext-15													WOS:000328337700015

The Middle and Later Stone Age in the Iringa Region of southern Tanzania	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					Meeting of the PanAfrican-Archaeological-Association for Prehistory and Related Studies (PAA)/Meeting of the Society-of-Africanist-Archaeologists (SAfA)	NOV, 2010	Univ Cheikh Anta Diop, Dakar, SENEGAL	Soc Africanist Archaeol, PanAfrican Archaeolog Assoc	Univ Cheikh Anta Diop			Fossil, genetic and archaeological data all confirm an African origin for our own species, Homo sapiens, during the Middle Stone Age (MSA) around 200,000 years ago. Somewhere around 40,000 to 50,000 years ago, descendants of these first modern people dispersed out of Africa and ultimately colonized the entire world. This parallels the beginning of the Later Stone Age (LSA) where microlithic stone tool assemblages replace the flake tools and points of the MSA. New research in the Iringa Region in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania may offer a way to study the MSA and how it changed to the LSA. Three seasons of survey and excavation (in 2006, 2008 and 2010) have demonstrated that Iringa might contain a more or less continuous archaeological record from the late Acheulean around 500,000 years ago to the present It thus offers a new opportunity to trace the evolution of the technology and behaviour of modern humans both prior to, and after, the Out of Africa 2 dispersal. Excavations have uncovered MSA occupation layers in three areas at one rockshelter, Magubike. LSA occupations are stratified above them in two of these areas. At a second rockshelter, Mlambalasi, there is a modern human skeleton, in a Pleistocene LSA context This paper reviews this new evidence and what it might state about questions of modern human origins and dispersals.

The response of the ambient bacterial community to decomposing jellyfish biomass was evaluated in two marine ecosystems, the Gulf of Trieste (northern Adriatic Sea) and Big Lake (Mljet Island, southern Adriatic Sea). The major difference between these two ecosystems is that Aurelia sp. medusae occur throughout the year in the oligotrophic Big Lake, whereas in the mesotrophic Gulf of Trieste, they occur only seasonally and often as blooms. Addition of homogenized jellyfish to enclosed bottles containing ambient water from each of these systems triggered considerable changes in the bacterial community dynamics and in the nutrient regime. The high concentrations of protein, dissolved organic phosphorous (DOP), and PO4 (3-) immediately after homogenate addition stimulated increase in bacterial abundance and production rate, coupled with NH4 (+) accumulation in both ecosystems. Our preliminary results of the bacterial community structure, as determined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, indicated differences in the bacterial community response between the two ecosystems. Despite divergence in the bacterial community responses to jellyfish homogenate, increased bacterial biomass and growth rates in both distinctive marine systems indicate potentially significant effects of decaying jellyfish blooms on microbial plankton.

Effects of turbidity and prey density on the foraging success of age 0 year yellow perch Perca flavescens	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine how larval and juvenile yellow perch Perca flavescens respond to changes in prey density when exposed to different levels and types of turbidity (phytoplanktonic or sedimentary). Across prey densities, consumption by P. flavescens tended to be less in phytoplanktonic turbidity compared with sedimentary turbidity. For larvae, this effect was dependent on turbidity level (consumption differed between turbidity types only at high turbidity), while for juveniles the difference with turbidity type was equal across turbidity levels. These results suggest that phytoplankton blooms are detrimental to the ability of late season age 0 year P. flavescens to forage and support the need to control factors leading to excessive phytoplankton growth in lakes.

The ice cover duration on the rivers (17 rivers) in the Baltic countries and Belarus has decreased during the recent decades. In addition to this, long term observational records of ice break on the rivers of the studied region exhibit a pattern of periodic changes in the intensity of ice regime. Both the ice regime and the seasonal river discharge are shown to be strongly influenced by large-scale atmospheric circulation processes over North Atlantic that manifests through close correlation with North Atlantic Oscillation index.																			0165-0009	1573-1480				AUG	2009	95	3-4					485	498		10.1007/s10584-009-9567-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-009-9567-5													WOS:000268255300014

Landscape Distribution of Microbial Activity in the McMurdo Dry Valleys: Linked Biotic Processes, Hydrology, and Geochemistry in a Cold Desert Ecosystem	ECOSYSTEMS												In desert ecosystems, microbial activity and associated nutrient cycles are driven primarily by water availability and secondarily by nutrient availability. This is especially apparent in the extremely low productivity cold deserts of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. In this region, sediments near streams and lakes provide the seasonally wet conditions necessary for microbial activity and nutrient cycling and thus transfer energy to higher organisms. However, aside from a few studies of soil respiration, rates of microbial activity throughout the region remain unexplored. We measured extracellular enzyme activity potentials (alkaline phosphatase, leucine-aminopeptidase, beta-glucosidase, phenol oxidase, and peroxidase) in soils adjacent to lakes and streams, expecting activity to be primarily related to soil water content, as well as time of season and organic matter supply. Phosphatase and beta-glucosidase activities were higher in shoreline than upland soils; however, potential rates were not correlated with soil water content. Instead, soil organic matter, salinity, and pH were the best predictors of microbial activity. Microbial nutrient limitation metrics estimated from extracellular enzyme activity were correlated with pH and salinity and exhibited similar patterns to previously published trends in soil P and N content. Compared to other terrestrial ecosystems, organic matter specific rates for leucine-aminopeptidase and oxidative enzyme activities were high, typical of alkaline desert soils. Phosphatase activity was close to the global mean whereas beta-glucosidase activity was extremely low, which may reflect the lack of vascular plant derived organic matter in the Dry Valleys. In this cold desert ecosystem, water availability promotes microbial activity, and microbial nutrient cycling potentials are related to soil geochemistry.

(Mel)			Treatment of odor by a seashell biofilter at a wastewater treatment plant	JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION												Biofilters are becoming an increasingly popular treatment device for odors and other volatiles found at wastewater treatment plants. A seashell media based biofilter was installed in April 2011 at Lake Wildwood Wastewater Treatment Plant located in Penn Valley, California. It was sampled seasonally to examine its ability to treat odorous compounds found in the air above the anaerobic equalization basin at the front end of the plant and to examine the properties of the biofilter and its recirculating water system. The odor profile method sensory panels found mainly sulfide odors (rotten eggs and rotten vegetable) and some fecal odors. This proved to be a useful guidance tool for selecting the required types of chemical sampling. The predominant odorous compounds found were hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan and dimethyl sulfide. These compounds were effectively removed by the biofilter at greater than 99% removal efficiency therein reducing the chemical concentrations to below their odor thresholds. Aldehydes found in the biofilter were below odor thresholds but served as indicators of biological activity. Gas chromatography with mass spectrometry and gas chromatography with sensory detection showed the presence of dimethyl disulfide and dimethyl trisulfide as well, but barely above their respective odor thresholds. The neutrality of the pH of the recirculating water was variable depending on conditions in the biofilter, but a local neutral pH was found in the shells themselves. Other measurements of the recirculating water indicated that the majority of the bio-activity takes place in the first stage of the biofilter. All measurements performed suggest that this seashell biofilter is successful at removing odors found at Lake Wildwood. This study is an initial examination into the mechanism of the removal of odorous compounds in a seashell biofilter.Implications:This paper presents a thorough examination of a seashell media biofilter, a sustainable treatment technology used to remove reduced sulfide compounds. The durable performance of the seashell biofilter ensures that odors will be adequately controlled, preventing odor nuisance to surrounding residences, which is an emerging problem faced by waste management facilities. The odor profile method technique used in this study can be applied in many situations by waste management facilities and regulatory air management organizations for source tracking in relation to prevention and management of odor complaints, respectively.																			1096-2247	2162-2906					2015	65	10					1217	1228		10.1080/10962247.2015.1075918	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10962247.2015.1075918								26223488					WOS:000362721600006

The Development of a Customization Framework for the WRF Model over the Lake Victoria Basin, Eastern Africa on Seasonal Timescales	ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY												Lake Victoria, Africa, supports millions of people. To produce reliable climate projections, it is desirable to successfully model the rainfall over the lake accurately. An initial step is taken here with customization of the Weather, Research, and Forecast (WRF) model. Of particular interest is an asymmetrical rainfall pattern across the lake basin, due to a diurnal land-lake breeze. The main aim is to present a customization framework for use over the lake. This framework is developed by conducting several series of model runs to investigate aspects of the customization. The runs are analyzed using Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission rainfall data and Climatic Research Unit temperature data. The study shows that the choice of parameters and lake surface temperature initialization can significantly alter the results. Also, the optimal physics combinations for the climatology may not necessarily be suitable for all circumstances, such as extreme years. The study concludes that WRF is unable to reproduce the pattern across the lake. The temperature of the lake is too cold and this prevents the diurnal land-lake breeze reversal. Overall, this study highlights the importance of customizing a model to the region of research and presents a framework through which this may be achieved.

Surveys were conducted during 2000-2009 at 150 unique streams and lakes within the San Gabriel, San Bernardino, San Jacinto, and Palomar mountains of southern California. Only nine small, geographically isolated populations were detected across the four mountain ranges, and all tested positive for the amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Our data show that when R. muscosa is known to be present it is easily detectable (89%) in a single visit during the frog's active season. We estimate that only 166 adult frogs remained in the wild in 2009. Our research indicates that R. muscosa populations in southern California are threatened by natural and stochastic events and may become extirpated in the near future unless there is some intervention to save them.

Chaotic dynamics of a glaciohydraulic model	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												A model subglacial drainage system, coupled to an ice-dammed reservoir that receives a time-varying meltwater input, is described and analysed. In numerical experiments an ice-marginal lake drains through a subglacial channel, producing periodic floods, and fills with meltwater at a rate dependent on air temperature, which varies seasonally with a peak value of T-m. The analysis reveals regions of Tm parameter space corresponding to 'mode locking', where flood repeat time is independent of T-m; resonance, where decreasing T-m counter-intuitively increases flood size; and chaotic dynamics, where flood cycles are sensitive to initial conditions, never repeat and exhibit phase-space mixing. Bifurcations associated with abrupt changes in flood size and timing within the year separate these regions. This is the first time these complex dynamics have been displayed by a glaciohydraulic model and these findings have implications for our understanding of ice-marginal lakes, moulins and subglacial lakes.																			0022-1430	1727-5652					2015	61	227					493	502		10.3189/2015JoG14J208	http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/2015JoG14J208													WOS:000358977400007

For this purpose, cyanobacterial abundance, microcystin (MC) production, and environmental parameters were monitored monthly from September 2011 to August 2012 in one drinking water source of Lake Chaohu. The cyanobacterial density ranged from 1400 to 220 000 cells per mL with the succession of two dominant species Microcystis and Dolichospermum, which was determined by water temperature and nutrient loading. The MC concentrations were correlated significantly with the cyanobacterial density and they varied between 0.28 and 8.86 mu g L-1. Therefore, the characteristics of MC cell quotas were classified according to four stages of the development of cyanobacteria, namely: recruitment, multiplication, decline and dormancy. The ST for cyanobacteria was established for different periods based on the MC cell quota and its guideline wherein three commonly monitored MC congeners (MC-LR, -RR and -YR) were considered in the present study. Its reliability was verified in the water source using the data collected between June 2013 and May 2014. The results highlighted the necessity to classify the ST-values in different periods referring to the main MC congeners rather than MC-LR, which will facilitate the management and control of toxic cyanobacterial proliferation in drinking water sources.

Twenty-nine and thirty adults individuals were collected respectively on February (rainy season) and August (dry season) 2007. The specimens were sacrificed by spinal section before sex identification, body weight and total length determination. For total mercury, DDT and DDE quantifications and cholinesterase activity samples of the axial muscle were frozen at -20 degrees C, and for histopathological studies gill and liver were fixed in ALFAC solution for 16 h. A value of 48.2% and 33% of the individuals, respectively from rainy and dry seasons, presented mercury concentrations higher than the maximum established for safe human consumption (0.5 mu g g(-1)) by World Health Organization. A positive correlation between body weight and Hg concentration was observed only in individuals from the rainy season, but no correlation was observed to DDT and DDE from both seasons. Differently from that observed to mercury, DDT levels presented a significant difference between both studied seasons, but no correlation was observed for both mercury and DDTs and sex. The levels of DDTs in muscle of C. monoculus are under the maximum established by FAO-Alimentarius CODEX and Swedish Food Regulation for human consumption. The histopathological and neurotoxic findings showed that the wild population of fish is affected by chronic exposure to mercury, meaning risk also to fish-eating populations. Finally, the results showed that C. monoculus is an important vehicle for human exposure to mercury and DDTs in Samuel Reservoir and that it is necessary a continuous biomonitoring of the levels of both pollutants in order to manage the risk of exposure to human populations.

Hidden diversity among aquatic heterotrophic flagellates: ecological potentials of zoosporic fungi	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Since the emergence of the 'microbial loop' concept, heterotrophic flagellates have received particular attention as grazers in aquatic ecosystems. These microbes have historically been regarded incorrectly as a homogeneous group of bacterivorous protists in aquatic systems. More recently, environmental rDNA surveys of small heterotrophic flagellates in the pelagic zone of freshwater ecosystems have provided new insights. (i) The dominant phyla found by molecular studies differed significantly from those known from morphological studies with the light microscope, (ii) the retrieved phylotypes generally belong to well-established eukaryotic clades, but there is a very large diversity within these clades and (iii) a substantial part of the retrieved sequences cannot be assigned to bacterivorous but can be assigned instead to parasitic and saprophytic organisms, such as zoosporic true fungi (chytrids), fungus-like organisms (stramenopiles), or virulent alveolate parasites (Perkinsozoa and Amoebophrya sp.). All these microorganisms are able to produce small zoospores to assure dispersal in water during their life-cycles. Based on the existing literature on true fungi and fungus-like organisms, and on the more recently published eukaryotic rDNA environmental studies and morphological observations, we conclude that previously overlooked microbial diversity and related ecological potentials require intensive investigation (i) for an improved understanding of the roles of heterotrophic flagellates in pelagic ecosystems and (ii) to properly integrate the concept of 'the microbial loop' into modern pelagic microbial ecology.

The characterization and role of aeolian deposition on water quality, McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica	AEOLIAN RESEARCH												The connection of ecosystems by wind-driven transport of material has become a topic of increasing interest and importance. Less than 1% of dust transported worldwide is exported to the Southern Ocean and Antarctic cryosphere; however, aeolian transport on the Antarctic continent is predominantly locally derived from the abrasion of bedrock. The deposition of the aeolian material is integral to nutrient and solute dispersal in the Antarctic ecosystem. This is particularly true in the ice-free areas of Antarctica, such as the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV), where aeolian material deposited in the aquatic system is solubilized during the melt season. The material is predominantly locally-derived from the abrasion of bedrock. In this study, a two-step leaching experiment simulates the melt season and we quantify the flux of solutes and nutrients to the aquatic ecosystem. Soluble salts were removed from the aeolian material first during cold water leaching followed by an increase in carbonate and silicate dissolution during freezethaw. Major ion fluxes on glaciers and lakes are at least two orders of magnitude greater than nutrient fluxes. However, the fluxes derived from these experiments are less than the estimated flux from streams to lakes and probably represent minima. Aeolian redistribution of local soils is important because they are the only source of new solutes and nutrients to the aquatic ecosystem of the MDV. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The current study attempts to examine the impact of human activities on spatio-temporal variation in the water quality of the study area. The study integrates extensive field surveys, sample processing, and statistical analysis to assess the recent status of wetland health. Latin Square Matrix (LSM) was employed to select the sampling sites while the Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) interpolation technique was used for spatial variation mapping. Modified Weighted Arithmetic Water Quality Index (MWAWQI) and Comprehensive Pollution Index (CPI) were utilized for assessing seasonal variation water quality and pollution loads, respectively. The results showed that dissolved oxygen (DO) was strongly influenced by the tributaries, and recreational activities have substantially influenced the highest concentrations of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and total suspended solids (TSS). The central portion of the lake is particularly susceptible to pollution from extensive fishing and recreational activities while peripheral sites are strongly influenced by agricultural run-offs, seepages from brick industries, and municipal wastes characterized by high concentrations of pH, total hardness (TH), oxidation-reduction potential (ORP). The findings reveal remarkable spatio-temporal fluctuations and highlight the areas within the lake susceptible to anthropogenic activities. The study proposed a sustainable management model to ameliorate anthropogenic threats. Moreover, the study contributes to the scientific understanding of the challenges and ensures the long-term viability of wetland health as a vital ecological and socio-economic resource.

However, in recent decades, human activities have led to various alterations in aquatic environments, resulting in environmental degradation through pollution. The safety of utilizing surface water sources for drinking and other purposes has come under intense scrutiny due to rapid population growth and industrial expansion. Surface water pollution due to micro-plastics (MPs) (plastics < 5 mm in size) is one of the emerging pollutants in metropolitan cities of developing countries because of its utmost resilience and synthetic nature. Recent studies on the surface water bodies (river, pond, Lake etc.) portrait the correlation between the MPs level with different parameters of pollution such as specific conductivity, total phosphate, and biological oxygen demand. Fibers represent the predominant form of MPs discovered in surface water bodies, exhibiting fluctuations across seasons. Consequently, present study prioritizes understanding the adaptation, prevalence, attributes, fluctuations, and spatial dispersion of MPs in both sediment and surface water environments. Furthermore, the study aims to identify existing gaps in the current understanding and underscore opportunities for future investigation. From the present study, it has been reported that, the concentration of MPs in the range of 0.2-45.2 items/L at the Xisha Islands in the south China sea, whereas in India it was found in the range of 96 items/L in water samples and 259 items/kg in sediment samples. This would certainly assist the urban planners in achieving sustainable development goals to mitigate the increasing amount of emergent pollutant load.

In this study, remote sensing datasets from Landsat images (Landsat 5, 7, 8 and 9) and three Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and Gravity Follow-on (GRACE-FO) mascon solutions were jointly used to evaluate the water area and storage changes in response to global and regional climate changes. The results showed that seasonal characteristics existed in the terrestrial water storage (TWS) and water area changes of Poyang Lake, with nearly no significant long-term trend, for the period from April 2002 to December 2022. Poyang Lake exhibited the largest water area in June and July every year and then demonstrated a downward trend, with relatively smaller water areas in January and November, confirmed by the estimated TWS changes. For the flood (August 2010) and drought (September 2022) events, the water area changes are 3032 km2 and 813.18 km2, with those estimated TWS changes 17.37 cm and -17.46 cm, respectively. The maximum and minimum Poyang Lake area differences exceeded 2700 km2. The estimated terrestrial water storage changes in Poyang Lake derived from the three GRACE/GRACE-FO mascon solutions agreed well, with all correlation coefficients higher than 0.92. There was a significant positive correlation higher than 0.75 between the area and TWS changes derived from the two independent monitoring techniques. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that combined remote sensing with satellite gravimetric techniques can better interpret the response of Poyang Lake to climate change from the aspects of water area and TWS changes more efficiently.

Due to the diverse physical and chemical properties of antibiotics, their spatial and temporal distribution in the environment varies. Moreover, antibiotics can stimulate the emergence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), which complicates the monitoring and regulation of antibiotics and poses a significant threat to both aquatic and terrestrial environments. This study investigated the distribution of 15 antibiotics and 11 typical ARGs across four categories at 19 sites of drinking water sources in Wuhan, China. The findings revealed that the concentration of antibiotics during the dry season (nd similar to 61,883 ng/L) was significantly higher compared to both the normal water season (nd similar to 49,883 ng/L) and the wet season (nd similar to 28,686 ng/L). Sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfamethoxazole (SMD), sulfadiazine (SD), and roxithromycin (RTM) were the predominant antibiotics in the target water environments. The study indicated that most of the antibiotics analyzed posed little to no risk to aquatic organisms. The primary ARGs detected in the surface water of the study area were sul1, qnrD, and tetO. Furthermore, some ARGs showed a negative correlation with their respective antibiotics. Additional research is necessary to evaluate the impact of these emerging pollutants (antibiotics and ARGs) on the safety of high-quality drinking water for residents in Wuhan City.					yu, ying/J-6700-2012; Liu, ziyi/HHM-8313-2022; JIANG, Jiayi/GRF-4032-2022															2305-6304				JUL	2024	12	7							507	10.3390/toxics12070507	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/toxics12070507								39058158					WOS:001278642900001

Sessile rotifers (Rotifera) exhibit strong seasonality in a shallow, eutrophic Ramsar site in Mexico	INVERTEBRATE BIOLOGY												To better understand the sessile rotifer community of a shallow, eutrophic lake, we monitored over a 1-year period the monthly changes in the density and diversity of rotifers on the roots of the common water hyacinth, Eichhornia crassipes, which served as a representative hydrophyte. Selected physical and chemical parameters of the water were also determined. Mean annual density of all sessile species was 630 individuals per ml. Species of Collothecacea (n = 7) were most abundant. Of the 12 species of Flosculariaceae (Flosculariidae), Sinantherina socialis occurred seasonally, while Ptygura beauchampi was most common across all seasons. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index was highest (H ' = 2.8) in April, but decreased in January (H ' = 1.3). Applying the concept of the guild ratio (functional-based analysis) we found that raptorial species (Collothecacea) were dominant over most of the year (June-February), while microphagous Flosculariidae were dominant during the warm, drier season (March-May). BEST (optimal matching of biota to environment, including stepwise search) analysis and canonical correspondence revealed that temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity, and transparency strongly influenced sessile rotifer dynamics. We also found significant correlations between the density of some species and physicochemical variables. These species included Collotheca ambigua, C. coronetta, C. ornata, C. campanulata, C. tenuilobata, and Stephanoceros millsii in the Collothecacea; and Beauchampia crucigere, Limnias melicerta, L. ceratophylli, Ptygura crystallina, P. melicerta, and Sinantherina ariprepes in the Flosculariidae. Our study shows that the communities of sessile rotifers were structured by abiotic factors and that the guild ratio is useful for understanding the relationship between sessile rotifers and their substrata.					; Sarma, S.S.S./G-3634-2010; Nandini, S./AFN-8031-2022; Jiménez Santos, Marco Antonio/JAC-7471-2023	Sarma, S.S.S./0000-0003-2820-1579; Jimenez-Santos, Marco Antonio/0000-0002-1486-9351; 													1077-8306	1744-7410				DEC	2019	138	4							e12270	10.1111/ivb.12270	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ivb.12270		NOV 2019											WOS:000495903500001

A study on the accumulation of nine heavy metals in some important fish species from a natural reservoir in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia	TOXICOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY												Concentrations of nine heavy metals (Cr, Cd, Pb, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mn, As, and Fe) in the muscles of four fish species (O. niloticus, C. gariepinus, P. latipinna, and A. d. dispar) collected from the Riyadh River were detected using atomic absorption spectrophotometry in two different seasons in 2012. The concentrations of the studied heavy metals except Cd, Pb, Ni, and Cu in Aphanius d. dispar and Poecilia latipinna were found to be below the safe limits suggested by various authorities. This study also showed that Zn was predominant, while Cr was least accumulated metal in the studied fish muscles. Data demonstrated that there was a significant variation in the heavy-metal concentrations in different fish species in the Riyadh River. Significant positive correlations between heavy-metal concentrations in fish muscles were also found both in pre- and post-monsoon seasons. Metal pollution index was calculated to distinguish polluted from unpolluted ecosystems based upon current knowledge of metal bioavailability, bioconcentration, and bioaccumulation patterns. From the human health point of view, this study showed that there was a possible health risk to consumers due to the intake of Aphanius d. dispar and Poecilia latipinna under the current consumption rate in the country.

In the present study, we analyzed contrasting-season changes in the phytoplankton communities of five subtropical shallow lakes, covering a nutrient gradient from oligo-mesotrophy to hypereutrophy, using a morphologically based functional approach to cluster the species. Six environmental variables accounted for 46% of the total phytoplankton morphological groups variance, i.e., turbidity (Secchi disk), conductivity, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, total zooplankton abundance, and herbivorous meso:microzooplankton density ratio. The differences in resource availability and zooplankton abundance among the systems were related with important changes in phytoplankton composition and structure. Within phytoplankton assemblages, adaptations to improve both light and phosphorus/nitrogen uptake were important in nutrient-poor systems; while grazing-avoidance mechanisms, such as colonial forms or bigger individuals, seemed relatively important only in eutrophic Lake Blanca, where light was not a limiting factor. However, this was not observed in the nutrient-rich Lake Cisne, where low light availability (due to clay resuspension and dark water color) was identified as the main structuring factor. Our results suggest that the composition of phytoplankton morphologically based functional groups appear to reliably describe the trophic sate of the lakes. However, other factors, such as nonbiological turbid condition, or zooplankton composition, may interact rendering interpretations difficult, and therefore, deserve further studies and evaluation.

J	Tirok, K; Gaedke, U				Tirok, Katrin; Gaedke, Ursula			Internally driven alternation of functional traits in a multispecies predator-prey system	ECOLOGY												The individual functional traits of different species play a key role for ecosystem function in aquatic and terrestrial systems. We modeled a multispecies predator-prey system with functionally different predator and prey species based on observations of the community dynamics of ciliates and their algal prey in Lake Constance. The model accounted for differences in predator feeding preferences and prey susceptibility to predation, and for the respective trade-offs. A low food demand of the predator was connected to a high food selectivity, and a high growth rate of the prey was connected to a high vulnerability to grazing. The data and the model did not show standard uniform predator-prey cycles, but revealed both complex dynamics and a coexistence of predator and prey at high biomass levels. These dynamics resulted from internally driven alternations in species densities and involved compensatory dynamics between functionally different species. Functional diversity allowed for ongoing adaptation of the predator and prey communities to changing environmental conditions such as food composition and grazing pressure. The trade-offs determined whether compensatory or synchronous dynamics occurred which influence the variability at the community level. Compensatory dynamics were promoted by a joint carrying capacity linking the different prey species which is particularly relevant at high prey biomasses, i.e., when grazers are less efficient. In contrast, synchronization was enhanced by the coupling of the different predator and prey species via common feeding links, e.g., by a high grazing pressure of a nonselective predator. The communities had to be functionally diverse in terms of their trade-offs and their traits to yield compensatory dynamics. Rather similar predator species tended to cycle synchronously, whereas profoundly different species did not coexist. Compensatory dynamics at the community level thus required intermediately strong tradeoffs for functional traits in both predators and their prey.																			0012-9658	1939-9170				JUN	2010	91	6					1748	1762		10.1890/09-1052.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/09-1052.1								20583716					WOS:000278859700020

Moreover, the drainage events during the rice growing season deliver sufficient organic and inorganic nutrients to rivers, which makes there an increasing concerned source of atmospheric CH4. Here, we compared CH4 emissions from rice paddies and the associated rivers draining agricultural watersheds by a parallel field experiment in southeast China. Over the whole rice-growing season (June-November), CH4 fluxes from drainage rivers averaged 25 mg m-2 h-1, which were 82 % higher than those from rice paddies (13.7 mg m-2 h-1). Besides the dependence of riverine CH4 fluxes on water dissolved oxygen (DO), both ecosystem CH4 fluxes were significantly correlated with water/soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), oxidation-reduction potential (Eh) and the microbial functional genes that drive CH4 production or uptake [methanogens (mcrA and methanogenic archaeal 16S rRNA) and methanotrophs (pmoA)]. Our results highlighted that the CH4 mitigation potential benefited from the drainage practice in rice paddies might have been totally offset by its induced increases in CH4 emissions from rivers draining agricultural watersheds at the regional scale.					; ZOU, JIANWEN/B-3059-2012; 方, 贤滔/HJB-3291-2022	Yu, Kai/0000-0002-6902-9202; ZOU, JIANWEN/0000-0003-4689-9237; 													0167-8809	1873-2305				APR 1	2023	345								108321	10.1016/j.agee.2022.108321	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2022.108321		DEC 2022											WOS:000993061100001

Fragment dispersal and plant-induced dieback explain irregular ring-shaped pattern formation in a clonal submerged macrophyte	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Submerged macrophytes can colonize shallow lakes via several reproductive mechanisms, and can in turn substantially alter these environments by modifying the thermal structure and dissolved oxygen levels within these lakes. Although multiple mechanisms of submerged macrophyte expansion have been described, the relative contribution of each of these in shallow lake environments has been largely overlooked. In this study we analyzed the spatial spread and patterning during seasonal growth of a globally invasive submerged macrophyte, Potamogeton crispus, in a shallow urban lake (Lake Monger, Western Australia). We used underwater and aerial imagery to estimate the spatial pattern of the P. crispus bed. By comparing the spatial extent of the bed at different times during the growing season, we found linear expansion rates two orders of magnitude higher than those previously estimated through rhizome elongation. We formulated a deterministic mathematical model that accounted for the ability of P. crispus to spread through rhizomes and fragments broken off by the feeding activities of aquatic birds, to assess the contribution of fragment dispersal to the emergent patterns of the submerged macrophyte bed. In addition to accounting for dispersal from fragments, the model also accounted for a hypothesized feedback between macrophyte-induced thermal stratification and central dieback. Comparison of our model results against field data indicated that the model accurately represented the spatial spread of the macrophyte bed when fragment dispersal was included. When fragment dispersal was not included in the model, the spatial spread of the bed was largely underestimated, suggesting that fragment dispersal may well account for the fast seasonal spread of this species. The model also captured the formation of a ring-shaped pattern in spatial macrophyte distribution suggesting that both fragment dispersal and the feedback between stratification and dieback are necessary to reproduce the spatial structure of the macrophyte bed. Our results highlight the potential important role of fragment dispersal in facilitating colonization and submerged macrophyte invasion in shallow lakes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Response of littoral macrophytes to water level fluctuations in a storage reservoir	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												Lakes and reservoirs that are used for water supply and/or flow regulations have usually poorly developed littoral macrophyte communities, which impairs ecological potential in terms of the EU Water Framework Directive. The aim of our study was to reveal controlling factors for the growth of littoral macrophytes in a storage reservoir with fluctuating water level (Lipno Reservoir, Czech Republic). Macrophytes occurred in this reservoir only in the eulittoral zone i.e., the shoreline region between the highest and the lowest seasonal water levels. Three eulittoral sub-zones could be distinguished: the upper eulittoral with a stable community of perennial species with high cover, the middle eulittoral with relatively high richness of emergent and amphibious species present at low cover values, and the lower eulittoral devoid of permanent vegetation. Cover and species composition in particular sub-zones were primarily influenced by the duration and timing of flooding, followed by nutrient limitation and strongly reducing conditions in the flooded organic sediment. Our results stress the ecological importance of eulittoral zone in reservoirs with fluctuating water levels where macrophyte growth can be supported by targeted management of water level, thus helping reservoir managers in improving the ecological potential of this type of water bodies.

Ephemeral lakes lie above the water table and locally contain saline water (total dissolved solids, TDS, contents up to 119,000 mg/L). Saline lakes that lack halite crusts and which have Cl/Br ratios similar to local surface water and groundwater are throughflow lakes with high relative rates of groundwater outflows. Permanent hypersaline lakes contain brines with TDS contents of up to 280,000 mg/L and low Cl/Br ratios due to the formation of halite in evaporite crusts. These lakes are throughflow lakes with relatively low throughflow rates relative to evaporation or terminal discharge lakes. Variations in stable isotope and major ion geochemistry show that the hypersaline lakes undergo seasonal cycles of mineral dissolution and precipitation driven by the influx of surface water and evaporation. Despite the generation of highly saline brines in these lakes, leakage from the adjacent ephemeral lakes or saline throughflow lakes that lack evaporite crusts is mainly responsible for the high salinity of shallow groundwater in this region.

We calculated the expected annual exuviae production of nine planktonic taxa in the water column using contemporary zooplankton records, and compared the value to the observed net accumulation of their remains in deep sediment for 7 years. Although all of the species studied occur commonly in the lake pelagic zone, deposition of remains differed significantly among taxa. The observed accumulation of three Bosmina species and Chydorus sphaericus was similar to or exceeded expected values, suggesting good preservation of their remains as well as focusing of sediment into the deepest part of the lake. The accumulation of Limnosida and Leptodora remains exceeded expected values several fold, suggesting under-representation of these species in pelagic plankton samples, as well as efficient transportation and spatial averaging of their remains in the sediment. Daphnia, Diaphanosoma, and Ceriodaphnia were clearly under-represented in the sediment due to poor preservation of their remains and use of a 50-mu m sieve in sediment processing. Thus, sieving should be taken into account as a possible source of bias. Correlation between relative abundances of all species in the sediment and in the plankton was weak (r (s) = 0.54, P < 0.001), but for well-preserved species, the correlation was strong (r (s) = 0.91, P < 0.001). Inter-annual variation in the deposition of remains suggested that resuspension and sediment focusing may vary between years, thus making it difficult to interpret absolute abundances, even though the deepest part of the basin shows clear varve formation and seasonality is well recorded. Detailed study of the uppermost lamination showed the seasonal succession of a cladoceran community within an annual varve as well as differences in the seasonality and intensity of ephippia production among the species. We recommend that results of cladoceran analyses be expressed in several ways (relative abundances, per unit dry weight, per unit organic matter, and as net accumulation values) before drawing final conclusions, as each approach may reveal a different aspect of the deposition process. In addition, sedimentation differences between epilimnetic and hypolimnetic species should be considered in stratified lakes.

J	Kurylyk, BL; Hayashi, M				Kurylyk, Barret L.; Hayashi, Masaki			Inferring hydraulic properties of alpine aquifers from the propagation of diurnal snowmelt signals	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Alpine watersheds source major rivers throughout the world and supply essential water for irrigation, human consumption, and hydroelectricity. Coarse depositional units in alpine watersheds can store and transmit significant volumes of groundwater and thus augment stream discharge during the dry season. These environments are typically data scarce, which has limited the application of physically based models to investigate hydrologic sensitivity to environmental change. This study focuses on a coarse alpine talus unit within the Lake O'Hara watershed in the Canadian Rockies. We investigate processes controlling the hydrologic functioning of the talus unit using field observations and a numerical groundwater flow model driven with a distributed snowmelt model. The model hydraulic parameters are adjusted to investigate how these properties influence the propagation of snowmelt-induced diurnal signals. The model results expectedly demonstrate that diurnal signals at the talus outlet are progressively damped and lagged with lower hydraulic conductivity and higher specific yield. The simulations further indicate that the lag can be primarily controlled by a higher hydraulic conductivity upper layer, whereas the damping can be strongly influenced by a lower hydraulic conductivity layer along the base of the talus. The simulations specifically suggest that the talus slope can be represented as a two layer system with a high conductivity zone (0.02 m s(-1)) overlying a 10 cm thick lower conductivity zone (0.002 m s(-1)). This study demonstrates that diurnal signals can be used to elucidate the hydrologic functioning and hydraulic properties of shallow aquifers and thus aid in the parameterization of hydrological models.

ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												While phosphorus (P) is a vital element in freshwater systems, excessive P loads will induce eutrophication. Large inputs of various pollutants, including P, to rivers in semi-arid regions result in complex environmental problems. In this study, we investigate dissolved oxygen (DO), ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3), chemical oxygen demand (CODcr), soluble reactive P (SRP) in surface water and pore water, and sediment P in the Niuwei River, within the Hai River Basin. From our results we developed and tested a theory for P release in semi-arid regions driven by DO. The results show that NH3 and CODcr can cause variations in DO in surface water. The presence of pollutants at high concentrations caused seasonal hypoxia. Hypoxic river water induced adsorption and hydrolysis of NaOH-Pi and labile organic P (L-Po), which then resulted in increased SRP concentrations in pore water and surface water. Overall, our results illustrate that NH3 and CODcr may be important for P adsorption and desorption and for management of water quality problems in rivers in semi-arid regions.

Modelling level change in lakes using neuro-fuzzy and artificial neural networks	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Accurate estimation of level change in lakes and reservoirs in response to climatic variations is an important step for the development of sustainable water usage policies, particularly for complex hydrological systems such as Lake Beysehir, Turkey. In this study, level changes of Lake Beysehir were estimated using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), artificial neural networks (ANN) and a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA). The ANN and ANFIS models were first trained based on observed data between 1966 and 1984, and then used to predict water level changes over the test period extending from 1985 to 1990. The performances of the different models were evaluated by comparing the corresponding values of mean squared errors (MSE) and decisive coefficients (R-2). While all models produced acceptable results, the minimum MSE value (0.0057) and the maximum R-2 value (0.7930) were obtained with ANFIS model, followed by the three-layered artificial neural network model (ANN1). The lowest performance was observed with the SARIMA model. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Multi-scale environmental factors explain fish losses and refuge quality in drying waterholes of Cooper Creek, an Australian arid-zone river	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Many rivers experience intermittent flows naturally or as a consequence of water abstraction. Climate change is likely to exacerbate flow variability such that dry spells may become more common. It is important to understand the ecological consequences of flow intermittency and habitat fragmentation in rivers, and to identify and protect habitat patches that provide refugia for aquatic biota. This paper explores environmental factors influencing dry season fish losses from isolated waterbodies in Cooper Creek, an unregulated arid-zone river in the Lake Eyre Basin, Australia. Multivariate ordination techniques and classification and regression trees (CART) were used to decompose species-environment relationships into a hierarchically structured data set, and to determine factors explaining changes in fish assemblage structure and species losses over a single dry season. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) explained 74% of fish assemblage change in terms of waterhole morphology (wetted perimeter, depth), habitat structure (bench development, off-take channels), waterhole quality (eroded banks, gross primary production), the size of surrounding floodplains and the relative isolation of waterholes. Classification trees for endemic and restricted species reaffirmed the importance of these waterhole and floodplain variables as drivers of fish losses. The CCA and CART models offer valuable tools for identification of refugia in Cooper Creek and, possibly, other dryland rivers.

Allelopathic effects of microcystin-LR on the germination, growth and metabolism of five charophyte species and a submerged angiosperm	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												Microcystins (MCs) are produced by cyanobacteria in aquatic environments and adversely affect macrophytes at very high concentrations. However, the effects of MC on macrophytes at concentrations of environmental relevance are largely unknown. The main objective of this study was to analyze the allelopathic effects of MC-LR at natural concentrations (1, 8 and 16 mu gMC-LR/L) on five charophyte species (Chara aspera, C. baltica, C. hispida, C. vulgaris and Nitella hyalina) and the angiosperm Myriophyllum spicatum. Macrophyte specimens were obtained from a restored area located in Albufera de Valencia Natural Park, a protected coastal Mediterranean wetland. Two different experiments were conducted involving (i) the addition of MC-LR to natural sediment to evaluate its effects on seed germination and (ii) the addition of MC-LR to water cultures of macrophytes to evaluate its effects on growth and metabolic functions. In water, the MC-LR concentration decreased by 84% in two weeks; the loss was not significant in sediment. The first seedlings (all C hispida) emerged from the wetland sediment following a delay of a few days in the presence of MC-LR. The germination rates in 8 and 16 mu gMC-LR/L treatments were 44% and 11% of that occurring in the absence of MC, but these differences disappeared over time. The final density was 6-7 germlings/dm(3). Final germling length was unaffected by MC-LR. Rotifers (Lecane spp.) emerging from the natural sediment during the experiment were favored by MC-LR; the opposite pattern was observed in the cladoceran Daphnia magna. The growth rates of C vulgaris, C. baltica and N. hyalina were unaffected by MC exposure, whereas those of C hispida and C aspera were reduced in the MC treatments relative to the control treatment. The concentration of chlorophyll-a and the in vivo net photosynthetic rate were lower in the presence of MC-LR, even at the lowest concentration, for all of the characeans tested. M. spicatum was sensitive to the presence of MC-LR in the culture medium; the growth and chlorophyll-a concentrations were reduced. Therefore, environmentally relevant concentrations of MC might induce important changes in macrophyte meadows and the structure of the associated plankton community. Synchrony or delay in the processes evaluated here in response to environmentally relevant concentrations of cyanobacteria MC exudates can enhance understanding of the turning point to alternative states and the point of no return in eutrophicated shallow lakes.

Environmental change and seasonal behavior of mastodons in the Great Lakes region inferred from stable isotope analysis	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												We investigate seasonal variations in the diet and drinking water of four Great Lakes mastodon (Mammut americanum) specimens using stable isotope analysis of serially sampled inner-enamel bioapatite structural carbonate (delta C-13(sc), delta O-18(sc)), and previously published bulk analyses. Isotopic analyses and thin section measurements showed that mastodon tooth enamel extension rates (similar to 12-4 mm/yr, decreasing toward the cervix) were lower than those of mammoths or modem elephants. Mastodons had distinct and highly regular seasonal variations in delta C-13(sc) and delta O-18(sc), which we interpret in the context of local glacial history and vegetation changes. Seasonal variations in delta O-18 were large but variations in delta C-13 were small, and may have been obscured if coarser sampling methods than our inner-enamel sampling approach were used. Thus, our approach may be particularly useful for understanding relatively small seasonal changes in delta C-13 within C-3 environments. The seasonal patterns, though not entirely conclusive, suggest that the Ontario mastodons did not migrate over very long distances. Rather, the climate and seasonal dietary patterns of mastodons within the region changed over time, from similar to 12,400 to 10,400 C-14 yr BP (similar to 15,000- 12,000 cal yr BP). Insights gained using these methods can contribute to a better understanding of megafaunal extinctions and Paleoamerican lifeways. (C) 2014 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Synergistic effects of mining and urban effluents on the level and distribution of methylmercury in a shallow aquatic ecosystem of the Bolivian Altiplano	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												Lake Uru Uru (3686 m a.s.l.) located in the Bolivian Altiplano region receives both mining effluents and urban wastewater discharges originating from the surrounding local cities which are under rapid development. We followed the spatiotemporal distribution of different mercury (Hg) compounds and other metal(oid) s (e.g., Fe, Mn, Sb, Ti and W) in both water and sediments during the wet and dry seasons along a north-south transect of this shallow lake system. Along the transect, the highest Hg and metal(oid) concentrations in both water and sediments were found downstream of the confluences with mining effluents. Although a dilution effect was found for major elements during the wet season, mean Hg and metal(oid) concentrations did not significantly differ from the dry season due to the increase in acid mine drainage (AMD) inputs into the lake from upstream mining areas. In particular, high filtered (<0.45 mu m) monomethylmercury (MMHg) concentrations (0.69 +/- 0.47 ng L-1) were measured in surface water representing 49 +/- 11% of the total filtered Hg concentrations (THgF) for both seasons. Enhanced MMHg lability in relation with the water alkalinity, coupled with abundant organic ligands and colloids (especially for downstream mining effluents), are likely factors favoring Hg methylation and MMHg preservation while inhibiting MMHg photodegradation. Lake sediments were identified as the major source of MMHg for the shallow water column. During the dry season, diffusive fluxes were estimated to be 227 ng m(-2) d(-1) for MMHg. This contribution was found to be negligible during the wet season due to a probable shift of the redox front downwards in the sediments. During the wet season, the results obtained suggest that various sources such as mining effluents and benthic or macrophytic biofilms significantly contribute to MMHg inputs in the water column. This work demonstrates the seasonally dependent synergistic effect of AMD and urban effluents on the shallow, productive and evaporative high altitude lake ecosystems which promotes the formation of natural organometallic toxins such as MMHg in the water column.

A Spatially Explicit Assessment of Changes in Chinook Salmon Fisheries in Lakes Michigan and Huron from 1986 to 2011	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We produced a spatially explicit assessment of the changes in stocking, catch, fishing effort, and catch per effort (CPE) for Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha in Lakes Michigan and Huron from 1986 to 2011. We focused on describing spatial differences in the changes that occurred during three well-known episodes of rapid change: (1) a decline in abundance during 1986-1994 in Lake Michigan, (2) a recovery in abundance during 1994-2006 in Lake Michigan, and (3) a decline in abundance during 2002-2010 in Lake Huron. We used a spatial grid system to describe and contrast trends in fishing effort and CPE among the main lake basins (Michigan, Huron, and Georgian) and subregions within those basins. We applied linear regressions, ANCOVAs, and Tukey's tests to assess differences. We found that trends differed among and within basins during all three episodes, which resulted in changes in the distribution of fishing effort and CPE. Fishing effort generally decreased in all basins and subregions over the entire 25 years, but it decreased less in areas where CPE had increased. The timing of the recovery episode and second mortality episode overlapped, so CPE simultaneously increased from 79 to 139 fish/1,000 h of fishing in the Michigan basin and decreased from 65 to 35 fish/1,000 h of fishing in the Huron basin. Movement of fishing effort and Chinook Salmon from the Huron basin to the Michigan basin probably occurred during this time. The CPE did not change significantly in the Georgian basin. Within basins, CPE exhibited sharp declines of more than 80% in some subregions during both mortality episodes but declined much less or not at all in others. After the recovery episode, areas of highest CPE in the Michigan basin had shifted from eastern subregions to western subregions.

J	Han, HJ; Allan, JD				Han, Haejin; Allan, J. David			Estimation of nitrogen inputs to catchments: comparison of methods and consequences for riverine export prediction	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Catchment nitrogen (N) budgets are a valuable tool to assess relative magnitude of N inputs and predict losses via riverine export. However, a range of computational approaches may be chosen, potentially affecting the modeled relationship between inputs and exports. To determine the influence of various assumptions and computational details on the effectiveness of N input estimates in predicting riverine N export, we compared eight separate net anthropogenic N input budgets and one soils compartment budget for each of 18 Lake Michigan catchments. N input estimation methods that took into account seasonal fluctuations in livestock numbers and estimated crop N-fixation by legume yield rather than area harvested best predicted river N export. The average annual river export of N from the 18 catchments ranged from less than 300 kg N km(-2) year(-1) in forested areas to more than 800 kg-N km(-2) year(-1) in agricultural catchments and 1,580 kg-N km(-2) year(-1) in small urban catchments. Using the most effective model (R (2) = 0.95, median prediction error = 1.8%) riverine N exports were found to account for 21% of N inputs. Other methods predicted riverine N exports less well (R (2) = 0.61-0.73), bias was greater, and the fractional export of N inputs by rivers decreased to similar to 13%. The soil N budget also was a less effective predictor of river export. This comparison demonstrates that N budgeting that incorporates more detailed description of agricultural N sources can substantially improve prediction of riverine N exports from catchments with a wide range of landscape characteristics.																			0168-2563					DEC	2008	91	2-3					177	199		10.1007/s10533-008-9279-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-008-9279-3													WOS:000262503700006

Despite the unprecedented expansion of pen culture areas in Chinese lakes due to the increasing demands on fishery products, little is known about the potential impacts of pen culture on fish communities. Here, we addressed this issue by quantifying changes in alpha and beta diversity with its turnover and nestedness-resultant components between pen culture areas (PA) and non-pen culture areas (NPA) in a large floodplain lake lying on the northern shore of the Yangtze River. Fish communities were sampled seasonally from January 2016 to December 2016 in 16 representative sites (PA, 8; NPA, 8) of Lake Huayanghe using fyke nets. In comparing with fish communities in NPA, we demonstrated an overall loss of fish species and a significant reduction in alpha diversity (richness) in PA, which were probably due to habitat alteration and fragmentation triggered by pen culture. We reported a significantly lower overall beta diversity with its turnover component and a significantly higher nestedness-resultant component in PA. The homogenized and nested trend for fish communities in PA was triggered by the synthesized effects of abiotic and biotic factors. Net pens caused habitat fragmentation and blocked the offset effects by supplementary fish species in nearby habitats, thus resulting in a significantly lower turnover and higher nestedness-resultant component in PA. The introduction of the same cultured fish species and the decrease of the wild native fish species made the fish communities in PA become more homogenized and nested. Pen culture had resulted in a significant decline in alpha diversity and a designed homogenization for fish communities in the lake. Our study highlighted the urgent need for systematic assessment of cultured fish and effective control of pen culture areas to avoid the future fish homogenization and species loss in Chinese lakes.					; Liu, Chunlong/AAB-6989-2020; Zhou, Lizhi/AAF-4535-2021; Xiong, Wen/T-8186-2019	Jiang, Zhongguan/0000-0002-5949-6106; 													0165-7836	1872-6763				FEB	2019	210						41	49		10.1016/j.fishres.2018.10.007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2018.10.007													WOS:000451934800005

The habitats share the absence of light but differ in other features, such as pore size of the habitat, available food, and degree of seasonality. Measurements of body size, antennal size, and antennal segment number of type specimens were compared for 56 species occurring in the eastern United States. Except for differences in body size, differences among species in the four different habitats were not significant. Body size was related to relative pore size of the habitat, e.g., epikarst, with the smallest spaces, had the smallest species. However, in all habitats, there was one very large species (> 15mm); these enigmatic species apparently occupy a distinct ecological niche, perhaps being more predatory. Differences in relative antennal size showed no significant differences among habitats, and differences in number of antennal segments were marginally significant (P = 0.06) among habitat types and not in the predicted pattern. Differences among habitats in seasonality and available food seemed to be a minor part of the selective environment; absence of light seemed to be a major part of the selective environment.

However, little is known about its importance in small tropical lakes and reservoirs. We hypothesized that (a) DON is higher in these systems than dissolved inorganic N (DIN), and that (b) relative contributions of DON and DIN to the total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) pool decrease and increase, respectively, with trophic status. To test these hypotheses, we measured DON and DIN in six lakes and two reservoirs at the Atlantic forest-Cerrado savanna transition in Southeast Brazil, in the rainy and the dry season. With one exception in each season, all oligo- and mesotrophic systems had DON:DIN ratios >1. DON:DIN ratios were negatively correlated with total phosphorus (TP). This pattern was due to high DIN, mainly ammonium, in eutrophic and hypertrophic systems. DON:DIN ratios <1 occurred at TP higher than 103 and 104 mu g L-1 in the rainy and dry season, respectively. We found a general dominance of DON in near-natural lentic systems at the Atlantic forest-Cerrado savanna transition, which was more pronounced than that reported for other regions. Human alterations to the TDN pool may affect biological communities and ecosystem functioning of these systems.

Information on their distribution, behaviour, habitat use, and estimated population density play an important role in the identification of critical areas and regulating human activities within. Here we examine the seasonal variations, group size, and distribution of Guiana dolphin in the southern Gulf of Venezuela, to identify their critical habitats and thus aid mitigation planning. We used boat-based surveys with a follow-group protocol where observers monitor groups of animals for 30 min, from a distance of 20 to 30 m, gathering the following data: date, time observed, GPS position, estimated number of individuals, presence of calves, behavioural observations (when possible); and environmental parameters (sea-surface temperature, water transparency, salinity, sea state [Beaufort], and cloud cover). We found that Guiana dolphins did not use the studied area (6.33 km(2)) homogeneously but rather aggregated in north of Zapara Island's retaining wall. The highest density of dolphins was between 301 and 573 individuals within 4.22 km(2) approximately off north of Zapara Island, and the lowest (1 - 150 individuals) at the entrance of the main navigation channel. The group size was considerably larger in the wet season (mean +/- SD = 6.4 +/- 1.9 individuals, range = 1 to 80) than the dry season (2.2 +/- 2.7 individuals, range = 1 to 27). The number of sightings differed among seasons (dry/wet), there were more sightings in the wet season (1.3414 +/- 0.4389 groups, range = 1 to 5) than dry season (1.1233 +/- 0.7418 groups, range = 1 to 5). Our data suggest this population might be highly adapted to local conditions and prey movements, and use the areas intensely year around, particularly during the wet season. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This is especially true for the Amazon region that experiences increasing threats to its ecosystems, which already show clear signs of loss of structure and functions. Aquatic ecosystems are particularly threatened by large-scale power generation, mining and agriculture ventures. Our objectives were to assess the recovery of a floodplain lake from the impact of bauxite tailings and the flood pulse effect on it. We used several indices of diversity as a tool to understand the recovering process in the zooplankton community of an Amazonian floodplain lake (Batata Lake) impacted by bauxite tailings during the 1980s. Zooplankton was sampled 4 times per year in two sampling stages: during seven years in the 1990s and for one year in 2012-13. In the second sampling stage, environmental variables were also measured and related to biotic indices. Zooplankton community was characterized in terms of total densities, functional groups, richness, and the functional indices of richness, evenness and dispersion. Impacted and non-impacted areas of the lake displayed similar seasonal and long-term patterns. Seasonally-associated flood pulses tended to increase densities in periods of high water and increase species richness and functional richness in periods of low water. However, in years of extreme drought, there was a loss of functionality manifested as a reduced functional dispersion index and functional group composition. Seasonal water level variations are the major biodiversity driver in these systems, and its effects become stronger in years of extreme droughts. The combined use of taxonomic and functional measures helped explain different aspects of biodiversity.					; de Oliveira Sodré, Elder/J-5439-2019; Bozelli, Reinaldo/S-6414-2019; Roland, Fabio/C-7918-2013	Sodre, Elder/0000-0001-6741-7191; 													1863-9135					NOV	2017	190	4					279	298		10.1127/fal/2017/1064	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/fal/2017/1064													WOS:000423785200002

However, the effects of DSi on phytoplankton growth and community structure have yet to be fully determined in tropical lakes, particularly in relation to N and P. Therefore, this study in-vestigated the role of DSi in Tonle Sap Lake, Cambodia, a tropical floodplain system well known for its flood-pulse characteristics and high productivity. To that end, seasonal water sampling and in situ water quality measurements were performed around the floating villages of Chhnok Tru region. The concentration of DSi was significantly higher in the dry season than in the wet season at 16.3-22.1 versus 7.2-14.0 mg/L, respectively; however, both sets of mea-surements were comparable with lakes in other parts of the world. Meanwhile, the average molar ratio of TN:TP:DSi was 69:1:33 in the dry season and 39:1:24 in the wet season, which compared with the Redfield ratio of 16:1:16, sug-gested limitation of TP and DSi in both seasons. In addition, phytoplankton biomass in terms of chlorophyll -a was found to be a collective function of DSi, TN:TP, dissolved oxygen, and water temperature in both seasons. Taken to-gether, these results suggest that DSi is affected by the annual hydrological cycle in the Tonle Sap Lake flood-pulse eco-system, serving as a secondary limiting nutrient of primary production during both the dry and wet seasons.

COVID-19 reduced recreational fishing effort during the black bass spawning season, resulting in increases in black bass reproductive success and annual recruitment	FISHERIES RESEARCH												In Opinicon Lake, Ontario during two non-pandemic years (2019 and 2022) the hook-wounding rates from recreational angling observed among nesting male largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides (LMB), and nesting male smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu (SMB), were quite high, but typical of those observed in the lake over the last 20 years of monitoring. That level of illegal, preseason angling resulted in very low percentages of both LMB and SMB nesting males being successful at raising their broods to independence, rates comparable to those observed for this lake in previous years. In 2020 and 2021, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, however, access to fishing in Ontario was severely limited during the bass spawning season, which serendipitously provided a natural "whole-lake bass spawning sanctuary" to study. Not surprisingly, the hook-wounding rates for nesting male LMB and SMB in Opinicon Lake were the lowest rates ever observed over the last 30 + years. Concomi-tantly, the percentage of nesting male LMB and SMB that were successful at raising their broods to independence was approximately 3-4 times greater than that in the non-COVID years. Not unexpectedly, those increases in nesting success translated to similar increases in LMB and SMB reproductive success (production of post parental care, independent fry). More importantly, those increases further resulted in large increases in the annual recruitment of both LMB and SMB. This unanticipated COVID-driven experiment revealed that using bass spawning sanctuaries would be more efficient than closed seasons as a management strategy to conserve levels of black bass annual recruitment.

Headwater stream sediments, especially fine sediments, are essential ecosystem components and dominant reservoirs for heavy metals, with these reservoirs significantly affecting their cycling in streams. However, the dynamics of heavy metals in headwater stream sediments are not well assessed in the literature. Here, we assessed the temporal and spatial storage dynamics of several common heavy metals (i.e., Mn, Zn, Cu, Cr, Cd, and Pb) in the fine sediments from a typical subtropical forest headwater stream during the rainy season of 2021 (Mar-Aug). We found that (1) the mean storage of fine sediment of heavy metals was ordered Mn (21.57 g m(-2)) > Pb (2.53 g m(-2)) > Zn (2.27 g m(-2)) > Cr (0.66 g m(-2)) > Cu (0.12 g m(-2)) > Cd (0.006 g m(-2)); (2) their storage had a transient increase during the rainy season, followed by a decrease, but storage of both Zn and Cr was unevenly distributed from stream source to mouth; and (3) the key factors controlling heavy metal storage were water alkalinity, temperature, and pH, as well as monthly precipitation. These findings suggest that forest headwater streams can store heavy metals, but the amounts vary across temporal and spatial scales. Our results help us better understand the role of headwater streams in storing and transferring materials in forest ecosystems.

However, fish kill in recent years and anthropogenic impacts from human-related activities in its catchment area have resulted in deterioration of its surface water quality. This study aims to characterize spatial and temporal variations in surface water quality, identify contaminant sources, and compare their levels with quality guidelines. Surface water samples were collected from 10 sites and analyzed for 27 physicochemical parameters for a period of 2 years on a seasonal basis. Concentration of metals in surface water in pre-monsoon were in the order: Fe > Mg > Ca > Mn > Zn > Ni > Cr > Cu > Co > Pb, whereas in post-monsoon, the order of elemental concentrations was: Ca > Mg > Na > Fe > K > Zn > Cr > Li > Pb > Co > Ni > Cu > Mn > Cd. Metals (Ni, Fe, Zn, and Ca), pH, electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and nutrients (PO (4) (3-) , NO3-N, and SO (4) (2-) ) were measured higher in pre-monsoon, whereas concentration of Cu, Mn, Cr, Co, Pb, Cd, K, Na, Mg, Li, Cl-, and NH4-N were recorded higher in post-monsoon. Results highlighted serious metal pollution of surface water. Mean concentration of Zn, Cd, Ni, Cu, Fe, Cr, and Pb in both seasons and Mn in post-monsoon were well above the permissible level of surface water quality criteria. Results stress the dire need to reduce heavy-metal input into the lake basin and suggest that heavy-metal contamination should be considered as an integral part of future planning and management strategies for restoration of water quality of the lake reservoir.

Exploring the relationships between climate change, vegetation dynamics, and hydrologic factors would contribute to the sustainable management of ecosystems. Here, we investigated the response of vegetation dynamics to climate change and its impact on hydrologic factors in a traditional agricultural basin with limited water resources in China, Nansi Lake Basin (NLB). To this end, CASA (Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach) model and the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model were applied to simulate the net primary productivity (NPP), evapotranspiration (ET), and soil water in the growing season (April-October) from 2000 to 2016. Results showed that the mean growing-season NPP (NPPGS) exhibited an ascending trend at a rate of 2.93 g C/m(2)/year during the 17-year period. The intra-annual variation of NPPGS displayed two peaks in May and July, respectively. The first peak in May was accompanied by relative deficits in soil water, which might inhibit vegetation productivity. Precipitation was the principal climatic factor controlling NPPGS dynamics in the water-limited NLB. The positive influence of temperature on NPPGS was relatively weak, and even future warming could negatively affect ecosystem productivity in the south-central regions of the NLB. Furthermore, a strongly positive relationship between NPPGS and ET was detected, suggesting that increasing NPP in the future might stimulate the rise in ET and then exacerbate drought at the watershed scale. This study provides an integrated model for a comprehensive understanding of the interaction between vegetation, climate, and hydrological cycle, and highlights the importance of water-saving agriculture for future food security.

Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses were applied on bulk organic matter and the green alga Botryococcus from a sediment core from Lake Pupuke (Auckland, North Island, New Zealand) spanning the period since 7,165 cal. year BP. The origin of organic matter was established using total-organic-carbon-to-nitrogen ratios (TOC/TN) as well as organic carbon (delta C-13(OM)) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope composition of potential modern sources. This approach demonstrated that the contribution of allochthonous organic matter to the lake sediment was negligible for most of the record. The sedimentary TOC/TN ratios that are higher than Redfield ratio (i.e. > 7) are attributed to N-limiting conditions throughout the record. Variations of nitrogen and carbon isotopes during the last 7,165 years are interpreted as changes in the dominant processes in the lake. While epilimnetic primary productivity controlled isotope composition before 6,600 cal. year BP, microbial processes, especially denitrification and methane oxidation, caused overall shifts of the delta N-15 and delta C-13 values since the Mid-Holocene. Comparisons with climate reconstructions from the Northern Island suggest that changes in the wind-induced lake overturn and a shift to more pronounced seasonality were the most likely causes for lake-internal changes since 6,600 cal. year BP.					; Wastegard, Stefan/G-5720-2012	Mayr, Christoph/0000-0001-9002-9963; Lucke, Andreas/0000-0003-4199-0808; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				AUG	2012	48	2					351	366		10.1007/s10933-012-9606-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-012-9606-5													WOS:000305959000006

ESTIMATING PRODUCTIVITY OF TRADITIONAL IROQUOIAN CROPPING SYSTEMS FROM FIELD EXPERIMENTS AND HISTORICAL LITERATURE	JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY												Results from field experiments in New York establish realistic yield levels for the Three Sisters, a polycultural cropping system of inter-planted corn, bean, and squash which was used by Iroquoian farmers in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. A traditional open-pollinated white flour corn yielded from 22 to 76 bu/acre (1155 to 4127 kg/ha); the higher yields were obtained in New York's Lake Plain region with its fertile soils and long growing season. Corn grain yields were also higher at increased plant densities and closer spacing. We argue that these grain yields, which are significantly higher than other scholars have reported, are an accurate reflection of the yield potential of the productive soils of this region. Other researchers have failed to account for the complex and critical ways that soil organic matter and agronomic practices determine corn yields. Our yield estimates are further supported by eyewitness accounts that describe a highly productive agriculture practiced by Iroquoian farmers in the 16th through 18th centuries. Using Land Equivalency Ratios, we also demonstrate that the three crops grown as a polyculture were more productive than monocultures of individual crops. Corn grain yields were little affected by competition from bean and squash, but these two crops yielded much less in the polyculture compared to monocultures. We suggest that the Three Sisters, while widespread, was not universal across Iroquoia.																			0278-0771	2162-4496				SPR-SUM	2010	30	1					52	79		10.2993/0278-0771-30.1.52	http://dx.doi.org/10.2993/0278-0771-30.1.52													WOS:000208406000004

Diet assemblages of each species varied between northern and southern Green Bay, but walleye diets were more temporally variable (among months within zones and between years) than diets of lake whitefish or yellow perch. Lake whitefish represented a seasonally important prey item for walleye in southern Green Bay, composing 10 % and 41 % of walleye diets by weight in May and June, respectively. Yellow perch generally composed <15 % of walleye diets by weight but were consumed at a broader spatiotemporal scale than lake whitefish. Diet overlap between walleye and both lake whitefish and yellow perch was generally weak or moderate, whereas diet overlap between whitefish and perch was generally strong. Our assessment of adult trophic interactions suggests that changes in the population status of one species could influence fisheries for all three, and we identify additional research questions to address potential population-level effects of these trophic interactions.

This study assessed the hydrodynamic processes of a multiple-use reservoir located in the Brazilian semiarid region. The aim was to apply the CE-QUAL-W2 model to understand the lake's thermal structure and its variabilities in time and space by using the Richardson's number (Ri) as a reference. Meteorological patterns were also investigated. Results show that: (1) no significant changes were found by analysing the spatial variabilities of stratification; (2) seasonal changes were relevant as more robust stratification stability was observed in the wet period when water availability may be impacted by poor water quality; (3) from meteorological evaluations, rainfall showed a strong coefficient of determination with Ri (r(2) of 0.77); and (4) a threshold value of 60 mm in monthly precipitation was found as an indication of a stable stratification in the water column. Wind speed and water level partly influenced Ri's variabilities, while low impact was noted for air temperature and inflow. These results can promote an improvement in water-resources management by linking rainfall regime and reservoir hydrodynamics.					; Lima Neto, Iran/B-2980-2012; Lima Neto, Iran Eduardo/B-2980-2012; de Assis Souza Filho, Francisco/AAV-8783-2020	Gondim Rocha, Sofia Midauar/0000-0001-5296-5355; Souza Filho, Francisco de Assis/0000-0001-5989-1731; Lima Neto, Iran Eduardo/0000-0001-8612-5848; 														2071-1050				DEC	2022	14	23							16051	10.3390/su142316051	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su142316051													WOS:000897294500001

We analysed monthly data from a 2-year sampling period at two depths corresponding to the epi- and hypolimnetic layers. The archaeal communities seemed to be mainly composed of ammonia-oxidizing archaea belonging to the thaumarchaeotal phylum. The spatio-temporal dynamics of these communities were very similar in the two lakes and were characterized by (1) disparities in archaeal community structure in both time and space and (2) no seasonal reproducibility between years. The archaeal communities were regulated by a complex combination of abiotic factors, including temperature, nutrients, chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen, and biotic factors such as heterotrophic nanoflagellates and ciliates. However, in most cases, these factors explained <52% of the variance in archaeal community structure, while we showed in a previous study that these factors explained 70-90% of the temporal variance for bacteria. This suggests that Bacteria and Archaea may be influenced by different factors and could occupy different ecological niches despite similar spatio-temporal dynamics.					; Pollet, Thomas/AAZ-2141-2021; Jacquet, Stéphan/AAJ-7846-2021	Pollet, Thomas/0000-0002-3427-7695; JACQUET, Stephan/0000-0001-6017-3892													0168-6496	1574-6941				NOV	2013	86	2					215	230		10.1111/1574-6941.12154	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1574-6941.12154								23730709					WOS:000325986500005

Water samples were collected from depths of 0.5-1.0 m with the aid of the global positioning system (CPS). The seasonal variations in the concentrations of different N components in the rivers were measured. Using tension-free monolith lysimeters and N-15-labeled fertilizer, field experiments were carried out in this region to determine variations of N-15 abundance of NO3- in the leachate during the rice and wheat growing seasons, respectively. Results showed that the main source of N pollution of surface waters in the Taihu Lake region was not the N fertilizer applied in the farmland but the urban domestic sewage and rural human and animal excreta directly discharged into the water bodies without treatment. Atmospheric dry and wet N deposition was another evident source of N pollutant of the surface waters. In conclusion, it would not be correct to attribute the N applied to farmlands as the source of N pollution of the surface waters in this region.					xiong, zhengqin/B-2808-2010; Zhu, ZhaoLiang/MGU-1717-2025														1002-0160	2210-5107				APR	2007	17	2					200	208		10.1016/S1002-0160(07)60026-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1002-0160(07)60026-5													WOS:000245447300008

Borner) and emergent (Phragmites australis (Cay.) Trin. ex Steud.) rooted macrophytes in three water bodies was studied as dependent on water salinity (specific conductivity) and main environmental factors (temperature, pH of water, growing period, element contents in water and sediments). Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP - OES) was used for the element detection in the plants, sediments, and water. Multivariate statistics redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that investigated factors together explained 37.8 44.7% and 29.9 - 42.6% of the essential/beneficial and non-essential elements variability, respectively, whereas salinity was one of the main factors determining the accumulation of a number of elements (Mg, S, Na, Li, Sr, Sb) by the macrophytes. A decrease in the essential element contents (K, P, N, Cu, Zn) was observed in both species of the macrophytes during the growing season. Environmental factors (salinity, growing period, and pH) were more significant than the element contents in water and the sediments for the essential/beneficial element accumulation by two species of the macrophytes. The element contents in the sediments to a greater extent determined non-essential element accumulation by P. australis than by S. pectinata. The study showed that the efficiency of using P. australis and S. pectinata for remediation of aquatic ecosystems contaminated by heavy metals should not decrease with a salinity increase.					; Drobotov, Anton/I-8428-2018; Kolmakova, Anzhelika/ABL-9266-2022; Tolomeev, Aleksandr/I-9601-2018; Anishchenko, Olesya/KPB-3909-2024; Zuev, Ivan/AAH-5256-2019	Ivanova, Elena/0000-0002-3220-103X; Zuev, Ivan/0000-0002-0695-8936; Tolomeev, Aleksandr/0000-0002-9124-4566; Anishchenko, Olesya/0000-0002-1976-599X; Drobotov, Anton/0009-0007-1722-4958													0981-9428					SEP	2020	154						328	340		10.1016/j.plaphy.2020.05.019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2020.05.019								32593089					WOS:000566818900032
J	Murniati, E; Geissler, S; Lorke, A				Murniati, Erni; Geissler, Sebastian; Lorke, Andreas			Short-term and seasonal variability of oxygen fluxes at the sediment-water interface in a riverine lake	AQUATIC SCIENCES												In situ measurements of sediment-water oxygen fluxes conducted in a riverine lake during different seasons were analyzed with the aim of quantifying the combined effects of hydrodynamic forcing and seasonal changes in temperature on sediment oxygen uptake rate. Oxygen fluxes measured using the eddy correlation (EC) technique varied widely between -6.4 and -84 mmol m(-2) day(-1), while variations observed on hourly time scales were of comparable magnitude to seasonal variations. Oxygen fluxes were most strongly correlated to current speed in the benthic boundary layer and water depth, which both co-varied with discharge, temperature, and oxygen concentration. A direct correlation of measured fluxes with temperature and corresponding seasonal flux variations could not be observed. To explore the potential effect of temperature on oxygen fluxes, we applied a simplified analytical model, which couples the effect of hydrodynamic forcing with a temperature-dependent oxygen consumption rate within the sediment. The results suggest that the flux is a non-linear function of both variables and both can have comparable effects on the magnitude of the oxygen fluxes. The model confirms our observation that short-term variations of oxygen fluxes in response to hydrodynamic forcing can mask longer-term seasonal variations driven by temperature. The model further indicates that the magnitude and form of the temperature dependence of oxygen uptake and mineralization rates in freshwater sediments obtained from laboratory incubations can be strongly affected by flow conditions during incubations. We conclude that predictions of oxygen uptake and mineralization rates under changing climatic conditions should also take potential changes of flow conditions into account.

Research on the long-term spatiotemporal variations in plankton and their correlations with environmental variables after submerged macrophyte restoration is limited. Plankton in the West Lake, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China, was monitored on a monthly basis, and the main factors and relative contributions of environmental variables to phytoplankton were determined using quantitative analyses after lake geo-engineering. Dominant phytoplankton phyla exhibited a gradual decline along with submerged macrophyte restoration, and the composition changed to a more evenly distributed status on a long-term scale. Zooplankton populations sustainably increased during the initial period of submerged macrophyte restoration, and then gradually decreased until the composition sustained a stable status. Owing to lake geo-engineering, significant spatiotemporal variations in phytoplankton were attributed to the large submerged macrophyte distribution, water diversion project, and seasonal change. Spearman correlation analysis results illustrated that submerged macrophyte characteristics, especially Vallisneria natans, which was the species with the highest distribution in the West Lake, strongly affected the dominant phytoplankton. Comparison of ecological indices including abiotic and biotic factors in the monitoring survey revealed that submerged macrophytes were responsible for re-establishing a preferable aquatic system. The core effect of submerged macrophytes in the aquatic system could be explained by the interactions between environmental variables, whereby submerged macrophytes affected phytoplankton growth by releasing allelochemicals and altering water nutrient levels, sediment, and zooplankton communities. Therefore, our findings offer new evidence on the vital ecological functions of submerged macrophytes in a typical subtropical shallow urban lake under increasing anthropogenic pressure.					; Chen, Hongxiang/KTI-5497-2024; He, Feng/HHS-6457-2022; kong, lingwei/AAD-9667-2019; Zhang, Yi/AGH-9267-2022; TANG, Yadong/I-1291-2016	Kong, Lingwei/0000-0001-6759-6580; Tang, Yadong/0000-0002-1561-1467; Zhang, Yi/0000-0003-4441-3504; Liu, Zisen/0000-0002-2021-0617														2690-0645				NOV 28	2022	3	1					105	120		10.1021/acsestengg.2c00255	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsestengg.2c00255		NOV 2022											WOS:000891772300001

Here a novel method called Brillouin thermometry is applied to halite-bearing dry intervals of the late Pleistocene/Holocene (45-0 ka) core record of Searles Lake, California. Temperatures during muddy wetter intervals are available from branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs). Halite from the sediment-water interface records lake bottom temperatures during dry, high salinity periods. Analysis of modern saline lakes of various chemistries, depths, climate zones, and mixing regimes shows that: 1) average bottom water temperature is approximately equal to mean annual air temperature, and 2) annual range of bottom water temperature is inversely proportional to lake depth. Brillouin temperatures for eight halite intervals 30.6 ka to 8.5 ka range from 11.8 +/- 3.6 to 22.4 +/- 3.2 C-?. Bottom water temperature variability indicates paleolake depths of similar to 10 m during halite precipitation. Temperatures from brGDGTs for mud intervals 44.7 ka to 3.6 ka range from 13.4 +/- 2.8 to 23.9 +/- 3.0 C-?. Comparisons of Brillouin temperatures with predicted equilibrium temperatures of salt crystallization shed light on seasonal processes of evaporite deposition and diagenesis. The multiproxy temperature record of Searles Lake agrees with other regional records at glacial/interglacial timescales but displays a wider degree of millennial-scale variability, with temperatures during the last glacial ranging from 8.3 ?C below modern mean annual temperatures to 3.8 ?C above.

Some walleye anglers have reported reductions in the quality of walleye fisheries since the introduction of smallmouth bass and attribute this to the consumption of young walleyes by smallmouth bass and competition for shared prey resources. We quantified the diets of walleyes and smallmouth bass in the lower reaches of Lake Sharpe (a Missouri River reservoir), calculated the diet overlap between the two predators, and determined whether they partitioned shared prey based on size. We also quantified walleye diets in the upper reach of the reservoir, which has a different prey base and allowed us to compare the growth rates of walleyes within Lake Sharpe. Age-0 gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum composed a substantial proportion of the diets of both predators, regardless of location, for most of the growing season; the patterns in shad vulnerability appeared to drive the observed patterns in diet overlap. Smallmouth bass appeared to consume a smaller size range of gizzard shad than did walleyes, which consumed a wide range. Smallmouth bass consumed Sander spp. in some months, but in very low quantities. Given that global climate change is expected to alter the population and community dynamics in Great Plains reservoirs, we also used a bioenergetics approach to predict the potential effects of limiting prey availability (specifically, the absence of gizzard shad and rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax) and increased water temperatures (as projected from global climate change models) on walleye and smallmouth bass growth. The models indicated that the absence of rainbow smelt from the diets of walleyes in upper Lake Sharpe would reduce growth but that the absence of gizzard shad would have a more marked negative effect on both predators at both locations. The models also indicated that higher water temperatures would have an even greater negative influence on walleye growth; however, smallmouth bass growth was predicted to increase with higher temperatures. Fisheries managers should consider strategies to enhance the prey base or mitigate the effects of increased water temperatures that may occur in the future as a result of global climate change. Such proactive actions may alleviate potential future competition between walleyes and smallmouth bass resulting from changes in the fish community.

J	Shen, ZL; Liu, Q				Shen, Zhi-Liang; Liu, Qun			Nutrients in the Changjiang River	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												N, P and SiO(3)-Si in the Changjiang mainstream and its major tributaries and lakes were investigated in the dry season from November to December, 1997, and in the flood season in August and October, 1998. An even distribution of SiO(3)-Si was found along the Changjiang River. However, the concentrations of total nitrogen, total dissolved nitrogen, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, nitrate and total phosphorus, total particulate phosphorus increased notably in the upper reaches, which reflected an increasing impact from human activities. Those concentrations in the middle and lower reaches of the Changjiang River were relatively constant. Dissolved N was the major form of N and the particulate P was the major form of P in the Changjiang River. The molar ratio of dissolved N to dissolved P was extremely high (192.5-317.5), while that of the particulate form was low (5.6-37.7). High N/P ratio reflected a significant input of anthropogenic N such as N from precipitation and N lost from water and soil etc. Dissolved N and P was in a quasi-equilibrium state in the process from precipitate to the river. In the turbid river water, light limitation, rather than P limitation, seemed more likely to be a controlling factor for the growth of phytoplankton. A positive linear correlationship between the concentration of dissolved N and the river's runoff was found, mainly in the upper reaches, which was related to the non-point sources of N. Over the past decades, N concentration has greatly increased, but the change of P concentration was not as significant as N. The nutrient fluxes of the Changjiang mainstream and tributaries were estimated, and the result showed that the nutrient fluxes were mainly controlled by the runoff, of which more than a half came from the tributaries. These investigations carried out before water storage of the Three Gorges Dam will supply a scientific base for studying the influences of the Three Gorges Dam on the ecology and environment of the Changjiang River and its estuary.																			0167-6369					JUN	2009	153	1-4					27	44		10.1007/s10661-008-0334-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-008-0334-2								18484183					WOS:000265917200003

Decadal warming has intensified Microcystis-dominated cyanobacterial blooms in Lake Erie	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS												Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CHABs) are increasingly common in freshwater ecosystems and are often associated with climate change. Here, we used two independent high-resolution surface temperature records (1995-2022) and temperature-dependent growth rates of Microcystis to evaluate changes in these CHABs in Lake Erie. The potential mean seasonal growth rate of Microcystis and the duration of the Microcystis bloom season have both significantly increased within the western basin of Lake Erie since 1995. Trends were strongest in the far western region of Lake Erie including Maumee Bay which receives the largest point source of nutrients in the Lake and where the Microcystis bloom season has expanded by up to 1 month. In contrast, warming trends in bloom-free portions of central and eastern Lake Erie have been more muted. We conclude that increasing water temperature is an important factor facilitating the intensification of these, and likely other, CHABs, and is thus promoting an expanding public health threat.

J	Lü, JL; Wang, SQ; Liu, BB; Song, XF				Lu, Jiali; Wang, Shiqin; Liu, Binbin; Song, Xianfang			Spatiotemporal heterogeneity of nitrogen transformation potentials in a freshwater estuarine system	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Under the influence of water diversion, the microbial community composition of estuarine waters and sediments might have complex spatiotemporal variations. Microbial interactions with N are significant for lake water quality. Therefore, the largest lake receiving seasonal water diversion in the North China Plain was selected as the study area. Based on 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing and metagenomic sequencing techniques, this study analysed temporal (June-December) and spatial (estuary-pelagic zone) changes in the microbial community and functional gene composition of water and sediment. The results showed that the water microbial community composition had temporality, while sediment microbes had spatiality. The main causes of temporality in the aquatic microbial community were temperature and nitrate-N concentration, while those of sediment were flow velocity and N content. Additionally, there were complex interactions between microbial communities and N. In water, temporal variation in the relative abundance of N-related functional genes might have indirectly contributed to inorganic N composition in June (nitrite-N> ammonia-N> nitrate-N) and August (nitrite-N> nitrate-N> ammonia-N). High nitrate-N concentrations in December influenced the microbial community composition. In sediment, the estuary had higher N functional genes than the pelagic estuary, creating a relatively active N cycle and reducing total N levels in the estuary. This study revealed a potentially overlooked N sink and a flow velocity threshold that has great impacts on microbial community composition. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the estuarine N cycle under the influence of water diversions, with implications for the calculation of global N balances and the management of lake water environments.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				FEB 10	2023	859		2						160335	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160335	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160335		NOV 2022						36414069					WOS:000898822600011

Cold Tolerance of the Eastern Subterranean Termite, Reticulitermes flavipes (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae), in Ontario	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												We characterized the cold tolerance of natural populations of the Eastern subterranean termite (Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar) [Isoptera, Rhinotermitidae]) in southwestern Ontario, Canada. We measured cold tolerance in workers from six colonies of termites established from Pelee Island in Lake Erie, and Point Pelee National Park. The mean critical thermal minimum, at which termites entered chill coma, ranged from 8.1 to 5.7 degrees C. Mean super cooling points (SCP, the temperature at which individuals freeze) ranged from -4 to -4.6 degrees C, and did not differ significantly between colonies, nor was SCP dependent on body size. Individuals survived brief exposure to low temperatures, as long as they did not freeze, but internal ice formation was always lethal, suggesting a freeze avoiding strategy. The LT50 (temperature at which 50% of individuals were killed by a 1 h exposure) was -5.1 degrees C, but all individuals could survive -2 degrees C for at least 72 h. Low temperature acclimation (12 degrees C, 7 d) or hardening (4 degrees C, 2 h) had no impact on the SCP, but acclimation did slightly increase the critical thermal minimum, making the termites less cold tolerant. We conclude that R. flavipes is not particularly cold tolerant, and likely relies on burrowing deep into the soil to avoid exposure to temperature to extremes.

Using an improved bubble trap device, in situ collection of N-2 bubbles was achieved by avoiding the contamination of N-2 in the air. Measurements using the device indicated very high ebullition rates (36.3-366.7 ml m(-2) h(-1)) and N-2 ebullition flux (0.025-0.297 g m(-2) h(-1)) at warmer months of September and October. The ebullition rates and N-2 ebullition fluxes dropped sharply in colder months of December and January, ranged 2.5-15.9 ml m(-2) h(-1) and 0.002-0.016 g m(-2) h(-1), respectively. Distinct spatial variation of ebullition rates, and N-2 and N2O ebullition fluxes were observed, with the highest rate at the heavy sediment location. Ebullition of N2O was a very minor fraction of total gaseous nitrogen released to air. The data demonstrated that ebullition could contribute greatly to biogenic N-2 fluxes in eutrophic waters with significant bubble emission. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B. V.

J	Mahesh, BS; Warrier, AK; Mohan, R; Tiwari, M				Mahesh, Badanal Siddaiah; Warrier, Anish Kumar; Mohan, Rahul; Tiwari, Manish			Impact of Antarctic climate during the Late Quaternary: Records from Zub Lake sedimentary archives from Schirmacher Hills, East Antarctica	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The Antarctic continental margin is marked with ice-free areas which are host to numerous freshwater lakes. These lacustrine systems are rich in sedimentary deposits which archive in them the regional and general climatic variations. These lakes respond to the seasonal variations in climate over glacial-interglacial timescales and can be inferred from the sedimentary proxies. In this study, a 79-cm-long radiocarbon dated sediment core retrieved from a peri-glacial lake is analysed for elementary (C-org%, N-org%), isotopic (delta C-13(OM), delta N-15(OM)) and particle size (sand, silt, clay). The radiocarbon dated sections (0-65 cm) extends up to 43 kyr BP. The time-series of sedimentary organic matter (OM) proxies (C-org similar to 3.5 +/- 3%, C/N-atomic (ratio) similar to 11 +/- 3 and delta C-13(OM) similar to-14 +/- 4 parts per thousand) indicate that the OM in this lake sedimentary record is an admixture of terrestrial and lacustrine biomass. Distinctly higher (lower) values during the Holocene (LGM) suggests presence of terrestrial and aquatic (aquatic) biomass indicating ice-free (ice-cover) and warm (cold) Holocene (glacial) conditions which would result in an increased (decreased) lake-productivity and fluvial (wind) input of sand and clay (silt). Higher sand content (similar to 30, similar to 24 and similar to 15 kyr BP), silt content (similar to 24 kyr BP), C-org and N-org (similar to 24 kyr BP) within the Last Glacial Stage (LGS) indicates intermittent warming period in coherence with the Antarctic Isotope Maximum (AIM). The transition in values (C-org N-org, C/N ratio, delta C-13(OM), sand content) starting at 16.6 kyr BP closely following Antarctic deglaciation to reach Holocene optimum values at 11.3 kyr BP documents the influence of Antarctic climate on regional areas.

Eutrophication potential of lakes: an integrated analysis of trophic state, morphometry, land occupation, and land use	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												Despite being inside a protected area, Lake Sumidouro has been impacted by the anthropogenic occupation of the surrounding area since the 1970's, compromising the ecological integrity of the lake and the sustainable use of natural resources. This study examined the current trophic classification of the lake and developed methods for improving it through an integrated analysis of morphometric and limnological parameters, land use and land occupation in the watershed, and eutrophication potential. Data for the limnological parameters, land use and land occupation, and morphometric characteristics of Lake Sumidouro were collected in the rainy and dry seasons of 2009 and 2010. Depending on the trophic classification system used, Lake Sumidouro is classified as oligotrophic to hypereutrophic. In our study, the highest concentration of nutrients occurred in the rainy season, indicating that high nutrient inputs played an important role during this period. Areas of anthropogenic occupation comprised approximately 62.9% of the total area of the watershed, with pasture and urban settlement as the main types of land use. The influent total phosphorus load was estimated to be 15,824.3 kg/year. To maintain mesotrophic conditions, this load must be reduced by 29.4%. By comparing the isolated use of trophic state indices, this study demonstrated that comparing the trophic state classification with morphometric analyses, land use and land occupation types in the watershed, and potential phosphorus load provided better information to guide management actions for restoration and conservation. Furthermore, this approach also allowed for evaluating the vulnerability of the environment to the eutrophication process.					; Barbosa, Francisco/M-6225-2019	Barbosa, Francisco Antonio/0000-0002-2026-6936; 													1519-6984	1678-4375				AUG	2015	75	3					607	615		10.1590/1519-6984.18913	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1519-6984.18913								26292101					WOS:000362733300013

Several methods, including the comet assay to determine breaks in DNA and quantification of antioxidant enzymes were applied to characterize genotoxic effects of organic extracts of water from Taihu Lake on the flagellated, microalga Euglena gracilis. Contents of photosynthetic pigments, including Chl a, Chl b and carotenoid pigments were inversely proportion to concentrations of organic extracts to which E. gracilis was exposed. Organic extracts of Taihu Lake water also affected activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) of E. gracilis. There were no statistically significant differences in SOD activities among seasons except in June but significant differences in POD activities were observed among all seasons. The metrics of DNA fragmentation in the alkaline unwinding assay (Comet assay), olive tail moment (OTM) and tail moment (TM), used as measurement endpoints during the genotoxicity assay were both greater when E. gracilis was exposed to organic of water collected from Taihu Lake among four seasons. It is indicated that the comet assay was useful for determining effects of constituents of organic extracts of water on E. gracilis and this assay was effective as an early warning to organic pollutants.					高, 翔宇/IQV-9328-2023; Giesy, John/MXJ-7032-2025; Wu, Bing/H-8245-2014	Giesy, John/0000-0003-1931-9962; Wu, Bing/0000-0001-7117-580X													0963-9292	1573-3017				MAY	2014	23	4			SI		633	640		10.1007/s10646-014-1214-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-014-1214-x								24570293					WOS:000335773400018
J	Zhang, LL; Liu, JL				Zhang, Lulu; Liu, Jingling			Relationships between ecological risk indices for metals and benthic communities metrics in a macrophyte-dominated lake	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												With the aim of evaluating and comparing the correlation relationship between metal pollution and benthic structural and functional metrics, we carried out samplings of three anthropogenic disturbance levels at eight sites located in the Lake Baiyangdian that are strongly influenced by wastewater discharge (Sites 1 and 2), aquaculture and densely populated villages (Sites 3, 6, and 8), and the least human disturbances (Sites 4, 5, and 7). Benthic communities were studied in eight sample sites, and Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, Hg, Cd, and Cr were simultaneously determined. The potential ecological risk index (RI) was calculated by Hakanson's methodology. The results showed that the RI for all three habitats was lower than 94, and they are in decreasing order: Habitat 1, Habitat 2, and Habitat 3. When the three sampling seasons were compared, August appeared to show the highest risk, followed by April and November. For the periphyton metrics, the best correlation was detected between chlorophyll c/chlorophyll a (Chl c/a) ratio and Eri Hg (r = -0.851, p<0.01); for the benthic macroinvertebrate metrics, the best correlation was established between Ed Hg and community similarity index (CSI) (r = -0.983,p<0.01). When periphyton and benthic macroinvertebrate metrics were compared, benthic macroinvertebrate metrics appeared to be more sensitive, especially the metrics of number of diptera taxa (NOT), community loss index (CLI), and CSI. Our results suggest that the benthic community would be used in biomonitoring for heavy metal pollution in the Lake Baiyangdian, China. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Hamzehpour, N; Mahdavinia, GR; Rahmati, M				Hamzehpour, Nikou; Mahdavinia, Gholam Reza; Rahmati, Mehdi			Sand sheets-the major dust source in the western Lake Urmia playa-A comprehensive study of the soil-dust properties and stabilization	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH												Climate change accelerated by anthropogenic activities has led to the shrinkage and eventually disappearance of salt lakes all over the world. Gradual desiccation of Lake Urmia (LU) in northwestern Iran, as one example of desiccating lakes, has led to the exposure of the lakebed sediment with enormous dust emission potential in some parts. Sand sheets of western LU are identified as one of the major contributors to aerosols in this region. Yet, dust blown from this area is not well characterized. The aims of the current study were, therefore, to comprehensively investigate the origin of dust from sand sheets; the characteristics of dust and temporal variability of the aerosol and to test the effectiveness of the application of sodium alginate (SA) on soil crusting and stabilization. Soil samples were collected from the two prevailing soil types from sand sheets in August 2020. Dust samples were also collected during four time periods: July and August (the beginning of the dry season); October and November (the beginning of the wet season). Using SA with varying concentrations and different methods of application, the effectiveness of the induced crusts was investigated. Authigenic aragonite minerals with elongated needle shapes were found to be the major constituent of the soil and dust samples. Temporal variability of the dust characteristics and their elemental correlation to dust sources revealed that while dust source 1 (DS1) with higher clay, salt, and silt contents contribute more to the dust composition from July to August (R-2 > 0.75 for DS1 versus R-2 > 0.58 for DS2), dust source 2 (DS2) with less salinity and higher sand content becomes the major contributor to dust composition from October to November (R-2 > 0.91 for DS2 versus R-2 > 0.75 for DS1). Results of stabilizing both DS1 and DS2 showed that SA-induced crusts on DS1 are more stable than DS2 due to the presence of higher clay, silt, salt, organic matter, and lower aragonite minerals. SA-induced crusts by a compaction method significantly performed better than a spray of SA on either dry (DSp) or soil at its optimum water content (WSp) at all concentrations. Nevertheless, spray methods are more feasible at the field scale and in both DSp and WSp methods, SA(0.5) improved the crust thickness. Scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) along with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) confirmed the remaining SA on the soil surface three months after its application indicating the effective performance of the SA solution in sand sheets stabilization. Hence, its application at the field scale could possibly reduce aerosol release and transport to surrounding areas.

The upstream connection with rivers and downstream access to the Yangtze River create seasonal hydrological regimes, resulting in over 100 seasonal lakes within the floodplain. These lakes provide important habitats for migratory birds to forage and nest during dry seasons, and contribute to floodwater regulation during wet seasons, maintaining lake ecosystem. Study focus: This study has combined laboratory experiments and numerical simulations to mechanically analyze the effect of the depth, width, slope of seasonal lakes, water level amplitude and dry season periods on water recharge patterns, exchange fluxes and solute transport characteristics at the sediment-water interface. New hydrological insights for the region: Reducing the lake area by 33 % through adjustments in depth or slope significantly reduces solute transport range (12.81 % and 6.5 % within 120 min) and high velocity area. The sensitivity of the solute amount in the lakebed to depth is the highest, followed by slope and width. Decreasing water level amplitude during dry seasons increases the flow velocity within the beach, facilitating short-term solute transport towards the lakebed. Extending the duration of dry periods increases cumulative flux of solutes entering the lakebed. These findings contribute to the ecological restoration efforts in floodplains and water pollution control measures.

Study focus: The construction of water transfer projects provides feasible measures for lake space and ecology restoration, with a critical issue in this practice being how to efficiently utilize multiple sources of water replenishments to improve the water quality of the water-receiving lakes. This study developed a hydrodynamic and water quality model for the Baiyangdian Lake, which receives water from upstream reservoirs within its basin and from two water transfer projects in other basins. Simulation scenarios with varied proportions of this lake receiving water from these sources were set up in the model, and the optimal water replenishment scheme for the best improvement in water quality was determined. New hydrological insights for the region: The multi-source water replenishment can effectively enhance the environment of the water-receiving lakes, and water transported from other basins has a more positive effect than that released from the local basin; additionally, water quality was found to be more improved during non-flood seasons compared to flood seasons. Under the preferred water replenishment scheme, the average concentrations of ammonia, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus in the core areas all decreased by more than 10%. However, the water replenishment may induce divergence in water quality indicators and aquatic system evolutions in the water-receiving lakes, making the lake environment fragmented. This study proposes to further exploit the water quality improvement benefits of multi-source water replenishments while mitigating its potential risks by enhancing hydrological connectivity in the water-receiving areas and integrating water quality monitoring and mathematical modeling.

Metagenomic Assessment of Prokaryotic Diversity within Hypersaline Tuz Lake, Turkey	MICROBIOLOGY												Tuz Lake is the second biggest lake with an extreme hypersaline environment (over 32% (w/v) salt) in Turkey. It is reported that the lake was of marine origin, and its formation began with tensional movements during the Late Cretaceous and the Late Eocene. We conducted this research to determine the prokaryotic diversity of Tuz Lake by metagenomics approach, which is 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of microbial communities in their natural environments. Hence, next-generation sequencing and then bioinformatic analysis was used to investigate the microbial structure of halophilic Bacteria and Archaea in Tuz Lake. Metagenomic analysis of reads revealed that all the archaeal populations in Tuz Lake belonged to the Euryarchaeota and Nanoarchaeaeota phyla. Haloquadratum (34%), Haloparvum (31%), Halonotius (7%), Halorubrum (3%), Halapricum (2%), Halobellus (3%), Natronomonas (1%), Halococcus (1%), and Halobacterium (1%) were found as the dominant archaeal genera. The most abundant and diverse bacterial phyla were Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. The remaining bacterial taxa were assigned to Acetothermia, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, and Halanaerobiaeota. Salinibacter (3%), uncultured microorganisms (1%), Pseudomonas (<1%), Arhodomonas (<1%), Halorhodospira (<1%), Chromobacterium (<1%) were the most common genera in bacterial diversity. Monthly and seasonal potential interactions among environmental factors and taxa were investigated. It was detected that several environmental factors such as temperature, salinity, and drought might have significant effects on microbial richness.

Sequential extraction of the surficial sediments using chelating agents was taken as a tool for this. Phosphate in the water column showed seasonal variations, with high values during the monsoon months, suggesting external runoff. Sediment texture was found to be the main factor influencing the spatial distribution of the geochemical parameters in the study region. Similarly, total phosphorus also showed granulometric dependence and it ranged between 319.54 and 2,938.83 mu g/g. Calcium-bound fraction was the main phosphorus pool in the estuary. Significant spatial variations were observed for all bioavailable fractions; iron-bound inorganic phosphorus (5.04-474.24 mu g/g), calcium-bound inorganic phosphorus (11.16-826.09 mu g/g), and acid-soluble organic phosphorus (22.22-365.86 mu g/g). Among the non-bioavailable phosphorus, alkali-soluble organic fraction was the major one (51.92-1,002.45 mu g/g). Residual organic phosphorus was comparatively smaller fraction (3.25-14.64% of total). The sandy and muddy stations showed distinct fractional composition and the speciation study could endorse the overall geochemical character. There could be buffering of phosphorus, suggested by the increase in the percentage of bioavailable fractions during the lean pre-monsoon period, counteracting the decreases in the external loads. Principal component analysis was employed to find the possible processes influencing the speciation of phosphorus in the study region.					; K.R., Renjith/AAF-5824-2020	K R, Renjith/0000-0002-1626-4479; 													0167-6369					MAR	2011	174	1-4					299	312		10.1007/s10661-010-1458-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-010-1458-8								20449651					WOS:000286830200022

However, few studies describe the regional characteristics of the wind regime over the Brazilian Southeast (SEB), the most developed and populated part of the country. The objectives of the current work were (a) to assess the spatial patterns of the wind regime using cluster analysis (CA) and (b) to apply principal components analysis (PCA) to investigate which meteorological systems influence the spatial and temporal patterns of the wind regime. The dataset consisted of wind speed and direction from 70 automatic weather stations with records from 2008 to 2019. According to the CA method, four groups of homogeneous wind speed (G1-G4) were identified; G4 presented the highest magnitudes of wind speed (wind speed >5 m center dot s(-1), with maxima of 7.2 m center dot s(-1)). Seasonal well-defined minima (March-June) and maxima (July-October) were observed only for G2 and G3. The systems South Atlantic Subtropical Anticyclone (SASA), Frontal Systems (FS), and the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) influenced these groups. In addition, the mesoscale meteorological systems likely influence other groups such as breezes from land/sea (G1, G3, and G4), lakes (G2 and G3), and valley/mountain (G2 and G3). The topography had a strong influence on G3, mainly due to the mountain ranges of Mantiqueira and Serra do Mar and Paraiba River valley. Dominant wind directions were E, N/NE, and NW, associated with SASA, in addition to S and SE/SW, influenced by FS and SACZ. The wind speed range of 1.4-3.9 m center dot s(-1) was dominant in all groups, except for G4 (range of 2.4-5.5 m center dot s(-1)). According to PCA analysis, two PCs are enough to explain the wind pattern in the SEB with 69.9% of the total variance explained. The surface roughness accounted for 29% of the total variance explained in PC1. The latitude (37.6%) and distance to the coast (30.8%) are the most important variables for PC2. Region's physiography and meteorological systems strongly influenced the wind regime over the Brazilian Southeast. The assessment of wind regime variability presented in this work is expected to support public policies on renewable energy applications, air pollution, and climate change mitigation.					; Santiago, Dimas/HQZ-9639-2023; Cunha-Zeri, Gisleine/V-3303-2017; Zeri, Marcelo/B-7701-2008; Souza, Pedro/GZH-1275-2022; Correia Filho, Washington/AAS-4735-2020; Júnior, José/IQS-5202-2023; Lyra, Gustavo/L-3986-2019; Lyra, Gustavo/I-3123-2012	Santiago, Dimas/0000-0001-7118-8467; Oliveira-Junior, Jose Francisco/0000-0002-6131-7605; Cunha-Zeri, Gisleine/0000-0001-9842-6891; Correia Filho, Washington/0000-0002-4029-4491; Lyra, Gustavo/0000-0002-9882-7000													0899-8418	1097-0088				MAR 15	2022	42	3					1767	1788		10.1002/joc.7334	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.7334		AUG 2021											WOS:000691422000001
J	McCann, MJ				McCann, Michael J.			Evidence of alternative states in freshwater lakes: A spatially-explicit model of submerged and floating plants	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Freshwater systems provide iconic examples of ecological tipping points. In some lakes and ponds, changes to nutrient levels can drive sudden shifts between primary producer communities dominated by either submerged or floating plants. Several models, ranging in complexity, have been developed to understand the interaction between these primary producer groups. Previous field studies suggest that spatial (e.g., water body size) and temporal (e.g., seasonality) processes are important for the dynamics of this system in nature, but these processes cannot be included in most models without a significant increase in model complexity. Therefore, I developed a spatially- and temporally-explicit model of this system with moderate model complexity that extends a previous model, in which alternative states are known to occur. I found that under low (approximately <= 2 mg total nitrogen L-1) or high (approximately >= 6 mg total nitrogen L-1) nutrient levels, either submerged or floating plants dominated, respectively. At intermediate nutrient levels, simulations resulted in different final plant states, depending on the initial cover of floating and submerged plants, providing evidence for alternative states. Under most conditions, stable intermediate states were uncommon. Water body size had a large effect on the dynamics of the system, as observed in the field, but only if wind strengths increased with water body size and there was a prevailing wind direction. Surprisingly, species composition and trait diversity did not appear to have major effects on the final plant states. This model allows the integration of processes on multiple scales of biological organization, from species traits and composition, to climate and seasonality or ecosystem level properties, and it complements the growing realization that spatial context has significant impacts on the dynamics of alternative states in nature.

The Garden was designed and built in accordance with contemporary European standards for the design of botanical gardens. From its foundation until today, the Garden has retained its multiple purposes. As an integral part of the Faculty of Science of the University of Zagreb for more than a century, the Garden has played an extremely important role in university teaching and scientific research in the field of botany, as well as education of the general public. The Garden also has cultural, historical and touristic value for the city of Zagreb and the Republic of Croatia. Since it was founded, it has remained open to the public free of charge, providing visitors with numerous educational and popular activities. It is part of the Green Horseshoe in Donji grad, a cultural good inscribed in the Register of Cultural Goods of the Republic of Croatia as an original architectural achievement, and as a completed, urbanistic, architectural space in the form of a park in the centre of Zagreb, and also as a horticultural monument in the botanical- garden category. In the first decades after its foundation, a series of functional buildings and structures of park architecture, such as a gazebo, a lookout and small bridges on the lake, shelters and similar elements in various historic styles, were built in the Botanical Garden. As a permanent residence for gardeners, a garden house was built in 1890 in the west part of the Garden, in the direction of Savskacesta. Later, greenhouses were erected and the pavilion was transported from the Second Jubilee Exhibition of Economy and Forestry held in Zagreb in 1891. A rare example of a communal building, a public toilet for parks, based on the 1905 project by Milan Lenuci, has been preserved. The last two buildings were designed by professors from the Faculty of Architecture. In 1933, in the south part of the Garden, Prof. Juraj Denzler built the well of the City Water Supply Network, used by the Garden to this day; and, in 1942, along with the already-built physiological laboratory, Prof. Zvonimir Vrkljan started building the Division of Botany. Buildings, park architecture, parterre and installation network were reconstructed and renovated over the past twenty years in accordance with the defined priorities and conservation guidelines, projects and supervision of the City Institute for the Conservation of Cultural and Natural Heritage. Several selected examples present recent projects and renovations. Industrial development in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and new materials - iron and glass - enabled the construction of large halls illuminated from above. Constructors applied this type of knowledge to build greenhouses, essential for the successful cultivation of tropical, subtropical and Mediterranean plants in botanical gardens. Often, this type of old greenhouse is a valuable example of specific architectural heritage. A unique historical structure of this type is preserved in the Botanical Garden of the Faculty of Science in Croatia. Professor Dr. Antun Heinz took a sabbatical in 1889 and visited European botanical gardens in order to gather experience and the latest ideas he needed for the design and construction of the Botanical Garden of the University of Zagreb. He chose a situational solution, a combination of geometric and landscape style. He decided to design the largest part of the Garden in the landscape - or socalled English - style, with randomly planted groups of trees and shrubs, and curving paths. Only the parterre ( ornamental flower beds), located in the west part of the Garden, was built in the French style, with a strict geometric and symmetrical ground plan. Around the long central axis, a conception typical of Baroque park heritage of the 17th and 18th centuries, he placed the main building of the Garden and the greenhouses with a geometric floral parterre with two symmetrical paths on each side, and most of that open surface is a free composition of the parterre with high and low greenery. The original shape of the exhibition greenhouses built at the end of the 19th century was preserved, but they were in very bad condition. Therefore, renovation was planned and is underway in order to restore the original condition of the complex of exhibition greenhouses. Fence around the Botanical Garden was gradually added as the city in the immediate vicinity of the Garden developed. In 1900, after the construction of the new street (today's Mihanovic Street), the north fence of the Garden was built with the main entrance portal based on a design by the Royal Building Department of the Land Government, and then the east and west fence were built. Since the aesthetically shaped southern fence did not exist, it was designed as a public walkway with a pergola, and the construction began in 2018. The oldest fair building in Croatia was preserved in the Botanical Garden of the Department of Biology, Faculty of Science in Zagreb, and restored in 2007. The wooden pavilion was presented at the international exhibition in Vienna in 1890, and in Zagreb in 1891. In 1892, it was moved to the Garden as a building where plants susceptible to frost were kept during winter. Over time, the domes and facade were removed. However, the roof structure and the volume of the building were preserved, and all characteristic elements of the lining were found before the 2005 reconstruction. Based on sufficient data and archival photographs, it was possible to restore the exhibition pavilion to its original form. Reconstruction and renovation of the Botanical Garden complex and functional historic buildings will continue and contribute to the preservation of the complete historical architectural heritage in the park section of the Green Horseshoe of Zagreb Donji Grad.																			1847-9464	1848-6681					2018		9					93	113		10.17018/portal.2018.7	http://dx.doi.org/10.17018/portal.2018.7													WOS:000468198500007
J	Winder, M				Winder, Monika			Photosynthetic picoplankton dynamics in Lake Tahoe: temporal and spatial niche partitioning among prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Dynamics of prokaryotic and eukaryotic picophytoplankton were investigated over a 2-year time period using flow cytometry and combined with an in situ experiment in Lake Tahoe, USA to better characterize to which extent environmental factors control these communities. Pronounced seasonal patterns and clear temporal and spatial partitioning were observed between picocyanobacteria and picoeukaryotes. Picocyanobacteria dominated in the nutrient deficient upper water column during the stratified season, while picoeukaryotes reached maximum abundance during isothermal conditions and maintained high numbers in deep-water layers during the stratified season. Picocyanobacteria were more sensitive to high solar and UV radiation compared with picoeukaryotes, which were not affected by high solar radiation and nutrient enrichment stimulated their growth. The opposing response of these two populations is consistent with their vertical distribution: picocyanobacteria dominate below the 30% isolume and above the nitrocline depth, whereas picoeukaryotes increase in the vicinity of the nitrocline and thus increased nutrient concentration. This spatial separation of picophytoplankton groups along environmental gradients in Lake Tahoe is consistent with other deep-oligotrophic lakes and the marine environment, suggesting that these marine and freshwater organisms have similar ecophysiological requirements. These results highlight that the smallest photosynthetic communities show taxon-specific responses to mixing and resource availability, which affect the structure and dynamics of picophytoplankton.

We explore whether temporal variations in ice-sheet surface hydrology can be linked to the development of a downstream sediment plume in Kangerlussuaq Fjord by comparing: (1) plume area and suspended sediment concentration from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery and field data; (2) ice-sheet melt extent from Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) passive microwave data; and (3) supraglacial lake drainage events from MODIS. Results confirm that the origin of the sediment plume is meltwater release from the ice sheet. Interannual variations in plume area reflect interannual variations in surface melting. Plumes appear almost immediately with seasonal surface-melt onset, provided the estuary is free of landfast sea ice. A seasonal hysteresis between melt extent and plume area suggests late-season exhaustion in sediment supply. Analysis of plume sensitivity to supraglacial events is less conclusive, with 69% of melt pulses and 38% of lake drainage events triggering an increase in plume area. We conclude that remote sensing of sediment plume behavior offers a novel tool for detecting the presence, timing and interannual variability of meltwater release from the ice sheet.

The dilemma of disappearing diatoms: Incorporating diatom dissolution data into palaeoenvironmental modelling and reconstruction	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Taphonomic issues pose fundamental challenges for Quaternary scientists to recover environmental signals from biological proxies and make accurate inferences of past environments. The problem of microfossil preservation, specifically diatom dissolution, remains an important, but often overlooked, source of error in both qualitative and quantitative reconstructions of key variables from fossil samples, especially those using relative abundance data. A first step to tackling this complex issue is establishing an objective method of assessing preservation (here, diatom dissolution) that can be applied by different analysts and incorporated into routine counting strategies. Here, we establish a methodology for assessment of diatom dissolution under standard light microscopy (LM) illustrated with morphological criteria for a range of major diatom valve shapes. Dissolution data can be applied to numerical models (transfer functions) from contemporary samples, and to fossil material to aid interpretation of stratigraphic profiles and taphonomic pathways of individual taxa. Using a surface sediment diatom-salinity training set from the Northern Great Plains (NGP) as an example, we explore a variety of approaches to include dissolution data in salinity inference models indirectly and directly. Results show that dissolution data can improve models, with apparent dissolution-adjusted error (RMSE) up to 15% lower than their unadjusted counterparts. Internal validation suggests improvements are more modest, with boot-strapped prediction errors (RMSEP) up to 10% lower. When tested on a short core from Devils Lake, North Dakota, which has a historical record of salinity, dissolution-adjusted models infer higher values compared to unadjusted models during peak salinity of the 1930s-1940s Dust Bowl but nonetheless significantly underestimate peak values. Site-specific factors at Devils Lake associated with effects of lake level change on taphonomy (preservation and re-working, implied by dissolution data) may override model improvements incorporating dissolution. Dissolution-adjusted salinity models are also applied to a 150-year sediment record from Spiritwood Lake, North Dakota, which suggests that this lake has a damped and lagged response to major regional climate forcing of salinity during the Dust Bowl. At this site, dissolution data also suggest different taphonomic behaviour of taxa related to their seasonal patterns of growth and sedimentation. Thus, dissolution data can improve models, and aid interpretation of sedimentary profiles as records of limnological, ecological and environmental change, filtered by taphonomy.

Leading events span 90 mm at Cape Dyer, along the southeast coast of Baffin Island, to 26 mm at Sachs Harbour, on the southwest coast of Banks Island. The 95th percentiles range from 20 to 30% of leading event sizes. Extreme events are most common on or near the month of climatological peak precipitation. Contrasting with Eurasian continental sites having a July precipitation peak corresponding to the seasonal peak in precipitable water, seasonal cycles in precipitation and the frequency of extremes over Arctic Canada are more varied, reflecting marine influences. At Cape Dyer and Clyde River, mean precipitation and the frequency of extremes peak in October when the atmosphere is quickly cooling, promoting strong evaporation from Baffin Bay. At all stations, leading events involved snowfall and strong winds and were associated with cyclone passages (mostly of relatively strong storms). They also involved strong vapour fluxes, sometimes associated with atmospheric rivers or their remnants. The most unusual sequence of events identified here occurred at Clyde River, where the three largest recorded precipitation events occurred in April of 1977. Obtaining first-hand accounts of this series of events has proven elusive. Identified links between extreme events and atmospheric rivers demonstrates the need to better understand how the characteristics of such features will change in the future.

The effect of basking disturbances by motorboats on the body temperature and energy budget of the northern map turtle	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												1. Basking is the primary mechanism used by many freshwater turtles to maintain their body temperature (Tb) in a range that maximizes physiological performance. Basking turtles are easily disturbed by motorboats, but the consequences of the increasingly popular use of motorboats on turtles is largely unknown. 2. In this work, predictive models built from field and laboratory data were used to assess the effects of the frequency of basking disturbance by motorboats on Tb and metabolic rate (MR) of female northern map turtles (Graptemys geographica), a species of conservation concern. 3. Simulations revealed that the effects of boat disturbance vary seasonally. In early May, a conservative estimate of the disturbance rate (0.15 per hour) resulted in a 0.34 degrees C decrease in mean daily Tb, which translated to a 7.8% reduction in mean MR. In June, July and August, owing to warmer lake temperatures, the effect of disturbance was less marked and the observed disturbance rates (0.32, 0.96 and 1.23 per hour, respectively) reduced the mean MR of an adult female by 2.1%, 0.5%, and 0.4 %, respectively. 4. Reduction in MR decreases the rate of energy assimilation, which could translate into sublethal effects on turtles, such as reduced growth and reproductive output. 5. Motorboat usage is increasing in many areas and is probably affecting other species of freshwater turtles that use aerial basking. This study offers important insights on the implications of disturbances for species that bask. Copyright # 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

It is focused on assessment of climatic and environmental changes that took place since late Neolithic to Roman times, trying to discriminate natural from anthropogenic signals. Based on an integration of archaeological, geomorphological, stratigraphic, pedological, volcanological and soil charcoal (pedoanthracological) data, the following paleoclimatic/environmental reconstruction is proposed: a warm and humid, seasonally contrasted climate, with an overall geomorphological stability suited for soil development, characterized the late prehistoric environment (Holocene climatic optimum), dominated by a widespread oak forest. The main pedogenetic processes consisted in organic matter accumulation, clay illuviation, phyllosilicate and short-range order mineral neogenesis from weathering of granite and volcanic ash, sourced from late Pleistocene-Holocene eruptions of the Aeolian Islands. One or more mid-Holocene episodes of climate deterioration towards drier conditions (indicated by a decrease of clay translocation processes and possible irreversible dehydration of poorly-crystalline aluminosilicates into phyllosilicate clay minerals) promoted intense land degradation. This was in turn enhanced by increasing human activities for settlement and resource exploitation (among which deforestation and ploughing for agriculture), which led to a shift of the vegetation cover towards a dominant pine forest between 3 ka BP and the Roman epoch. Humid and possibly cooler climatic conditions during the late Holocene are indicated by the decrease of clay illuviation, coupled with short-range order components prevailing over phyllosilicate clays during Roman soil formation.

During the breeding seasons 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 we monitored 251 lakes on the main plateaus of Santa Cruz province, southern Patagonia, Argentina, where the entire population of Hooded Grebes spends the breeding season. During 2009/2010 we monitored 131 lakes and observed 521 Hooded Grebes in 16 lakes, while during 2010/2011 we monitored 186 lakes and observed 535 individuals in 14 lakes. At both breeding seasons five lakes contained near 85% of the population. We only observed 6 breeding colonies, two in 2009/2010 and four in 2010/2011, totalling 242 nesting attempts. Nearly 90% of the nests failed during egg stage, mainly due to strong winds and depredation by American mink Neovison vison. Only 28 nests hatched chicks, but none of the young survived to independence due to low temperatures. We compared the results of our 2010/2011 survey with one conducted during 1984/1985 and detected that the population diminished by approximately 80%. This decline was observed on all but one plateau ("Buenos Aires") where most breeding attempts occurred. Our results show that at present Hooded Grebes are highly dependent on a few suitable lakes where they congregate to breed. We analyse possible causes for the decline of the population and propose conservation actions to protect this species.

However, less attention has been paid to response to flow restoration, especially flow restoration in gradient. Flow regime of rivers may affect river functional indicators and microbial community structure. This study simulated the ecological restoration of the flow-reduced river reach by gradiently controlling the water flow and explores the ecological response of environmental functional indicators and microbial community structure to the water flow. The results showed that gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration rate (ER) and some water quality indices such as chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus (TP), exhibited positive ecological responses to flow restoration in gradient. GPP and ER increased by 600.1% and 500.2%, respectively. The alpha diversity indices of the microbial community increased significantly with a flow gradient restoration. Thereinto, Shannon, Simpson, Chao1, and Ace indices, respectively, increased by 16.4%, 5.6%, 8.6%, and 6.2%. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that water flow, Dissolved oxygen and TP were the main influencing factors for changes in bacterial community structure. Microbial community structure and composition present a positive ecological response to flow restoration in gradient. This study reveals that the main variable in the restoration of the flow-reduced river reach is the flow discharge, and it provides a feasible scheme for its ecological restoration.

The coupled modeling system was well calibrated, and simulated values mainly agreed with observed data, demonstrating that the SWAT and CE-QUAL-W2 coupled modeling system can be used to assess hydrodynamic and water quality processes in a complex watershed comprised of an upland watershed and a downstream reservoir. Applying the coupled model, a long time simulation was conducted to analyze the temporal characteristics of nitrogen exported from the watershed and to reveal the effect of nitrogen retention in the reservoir at annual, monthly and daily scales. The results showed that nitrogen export from the watershed is closely associated with precipitation and runoff. The wet season was the critical period of nitrogen loss, whereas the dry season is the critical period for water quality management. The reservoir serves mainly as a nitrogen sink at annual scale due to the effect of nitrogen retention, but within the year, it may act as a sink during the wet season and a source during the dry season, which is significantly influenced by inflow runoff, nitrogen load and reservoir regulation.

Tench spawners caught during the spawning season originated from carp ponds (domestic stock) and a lake (wild stock). Fish were reproduced under controlled conditions after hormonal stimulation with GnRHa-containing pellets combined with metoclopramide (Ovopel) or carp pituitary homogenate (CPH). As a result of hormonal stimulation, eggs were obtained from a larger number of females originating from the lake (71.7%) than those originating from the pond (58.3%), although no other statistical differences were found. A similar relationship was recorded for the spermatozoa motilities (range from 72 to 76%). The obtained results indicate that both investigated reservoirs are suitable for tench broodstock management due to the fact that synchronization of ovulation among different stocks is easy to achieve. For this purpose, among the tested spawning agents, Ovopel could be recommended as being slightly more effective.					; Kucharczyk, D./AFA-8748-2022; Kucharczyk, Dariusz/AFA-8748-2022; Zarski, Daniel/H-9091-2019	ZARSKI, Daniel/0000-0003-3082-9250; Kucharczyk, Dariusz/0000-0002-0889-0656; Mamcarz, Andrzej/0000-0003-1443-2544; Kujawa, Roman/0000-0003-0925-1204; Targonska, Katarzyna/0000-0002-6273-2587													0967-6120	1573-143X				JUN	2011	19	3					513	521		10.1007/s10499-010-9366-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-010-9366-z													WOS:000290318300010

Nutrient and organic matter patterns across the Mackenzie River, estuary and shelf during the seasonal recession of sea-ice	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Suspended material, nutrients and organic matter in Mackenzie River water were tracked along a 300 km transect from Inuvik (Northwest Territories, Canada), across the estuarine salinity gradient in Kugmallit Bay, to offshore marine stations on the adjacent Mackenzie Shelf. All particulates measured (SPM, POC, PN, PP) declined by 87-95% across the salinity gradient and levels were generally below conservative mixing. Organic carbon content of suspended material decreased from 3.1% in the river to 1.7% in shelf surface waters while particulate C:N concurrently decreased from 17.1 to 8.6. Nitrate and silicate concentrations declined by more than 90% across the salinity gradient, with nitrate concentrations often below the conservative mixing line. Phosphate concentrations increased from 0.03 mu mol/L in the river to 0.27 mu mol/L over shelf waters, thereby changing the inorganic nutrient regime downstream from P to N limitation. Dissolved organic carbon decreased conservatively offshore while dissolved organic N and P persisted at high levels in the Mackenzie plume relative to river water, increasing 2.7 and 25.3 times respectively. A deep chlorophyll-a maximum was observed at two offshore stations and showed increases in most nutrients, particulates and organic matter relative to the rest of the water column. During river passage through the Mackenzie estuary, particulate matter, dissolved organic carbon and inorganic nutrients showed sedimentation, dilution and biological uptake patterns common to other arctic and non-arctic estuaries. Alternatively, inorganic content of particles increased offshore and dissolved organic N and P increased substantially over the shelf, reaching concentrations among the highest reported for the Arctic Ocean. These observations are consistent with the presence of a remnant ice-constrained ('stamukhi') lake from the freshet period and a slow flushing river plume constrained by sea-ice in close proximity to shore. Nutrient limitation in surface shelf waters during the ARDEX cruise contributed to the striking deep chlorophyll-a maximum at 21 m where phytoplankton communities congregated at the margin of nutrient-rich deep ocean waters.

Yet most attempts to introduce anadromous salmon failed until the onset of aquaculture by 1980. Escapes of Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (Chinook salmon) from aquaculture after 1990 have apparently produced increasingly important reproductive returns "naturalized", to upper basins in Chile and Argentina south of 390 S. In this paper we show data on the historic and spatial occurrence of chinook salmon in four Pacific basins during the past decade. Our objective is to establish the progress of the settlement forecasting some ecosystem disruptions in order to project and manage potential impacts. In Chile, sampling took place from 1995 to 2005 including rivers Petrohue, Poicas, and Rio Negro-Hornopiren, and Lake Puyehue, in the X Region. In Argentina sampled rivers were Futaleufu, Carrenleufu and Pico. In Chile and Argentina reproductive Chinooks ranged in size between 73 and 130 cm total length, being the smallest sizes those of Lake Puyehue where the population is apparently landlocked. In Rio Petrohue, the size of the runs varied from year to year reaching in the peak season of 1996 and 2004 up to 500 kg of fish along 100 m of riverbank. Temporal distribution of juvenile Chinooks suggested mainly a typical ocean type as they are gone to sea within the first year of age. As seen in Petrohue, reproductive populations could import significant quantities of marine derived nutrients as they do in their original habitats thus disturbing natural cycles and balances. Chinook establishment in these pristine watersheds in southern South America poses new challenges for decision makers and fishermen since they may develop a fishery in the Pacific Ocean with consequences to other fishery resources. Additionally they also become a resource for sport fishing. Therefore there is the need of developing management tools and approaches to control the populations avoiding irreversible ecosystem disruptions and social conflicts.					; Arismendi, Ivan/B-3144-2010	di prinzio, cecilia/0000-0002-3561-4307; Arismendi, Ivan/0000-0002-8774-9350													0716-078X	0717-6317				MAR	2007	80	1					81	98																WOS:000245580300007

We analysed 865 spectra of light absorption by phytoplankton a(ph)(lambda) and non-algal particles a(NAP)(lambda) in different seasons during 35 cruises of r/v Oceania in the southern Baltic from 2006 to 2012. Depending on season and region, we found distinct differences in the absorption properties of particles suspended in the water with respect both to the spectral shapes of the coefficients a(p)(lambda), a(ph)(lambda) and a(NAP)(lambda), and to the values at the characteristic wavelength of 440 nm. The proportions of phytoplankton governing the absorption properties of the suspended matter varied from 50 to 75%, whereby the greatest spread of these proportions was found in open waters. In contrast, the greatest seasonal variability in the overall absorption coefficients ap occurred in coastal waters. The absolute values of coefficients a(ph)(lambda) and a(NAP)(lambda) at wavelength 440 nm in the different types of water and seasons varied respectively over three and four orders of magnitude. In river mouth waters the mean values of a(ph)(440) were nearly twelve times and a(NAP)(440) over twenty times greater than in open sea waters. The absorption properties of non-algal particles exhibited a greater regional than seasonal variability, achieving the lowest values in open and coastal waters (0.006-031 m(-1)), and the highest ones in river mouths (0.199-4.196 m(-1)).

The effects of sediment supply and concentrations on the formation timescale of martian deltas	ICARUS												We used a comprehensive 2-D and 3-D basin-filling morphodynamical model to explore the effects of changing hydrologic and sedimentary conditions on delta formation under martian conditions. Spatial and temporal deposition of sediment into a body of standing water was simulated using event-based time stepping (e.g. seasons). River and sediment discharge were calculated using the Darcy-Weisbach equation for width- and depth-averaged flow velocity and well-known and tested terrestrial sediment transport predictors modified for application to martian flows. A range in sediment grain sizes was determined from both landers and orbiting spacecraft data in order to include grain sizes typical of Mars and yet representative of the martian deltas. Several different scenarios of seasonal river discharge and sediment supply were explored to encompass a range of possible formation conditions. With the ability to track sediment as it is transported throughout the basin, it is apparent that non-negligible amounts of material are moved beyond the delta-forming region. This loss of sediment increased with river discharge, increasing the gap between the calculated and modeled formation time-scales. These results have important implications for the formation timescales of the deltas and the small number of identifiable deltas on Mars today. Formation timescales that consider only the supply of sediment to the system and do not take into account factors affecting deposition and delta formation are underestimates of the actual amount of time needed to form the deposits. The lack of identifiable deltas in many paleolakes is likely a result of significant sediment transport beyond the channel mouth, causing the expected delta deposit to be draped throughout the basin.

Behavioral and environmental influences on fishing rewards and the outcomes of alternative management scenarios for large tropical rivers	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Identifying the factors that influence the amount of fish caught, and thus the fishers' income, is important for proposing or improving management plans. Some of these factors influencing fishing rewards may be related to fishers' behavior, which is driven by economic motivations. Therefore, those management rules that have less of an impact on fishers' income could achieve better acceptance and compliance from fishers. We analyzed the relative influence of environmental and socioeconomic factors on fish catches (biomass) in fishing communities of a large tropical river. We then used the results from this analysis to propose alternative management scenarios in which we predicted potential fishers' compliance (high, moderate and low) based on the extent to which management proposals would affect fish catches and fishers' income. We used a General Linear Model (GLM) to analyze the influence of environmental (fishing community, season and habitat) and socioeconomic factors (number of fishers in the crew, time spent fishing, fishing gear used, type of canoe, distance traveled to fishing grounds) on fish catches (dependent variable) in 572 fishing trips by small-scale fishers in the Lower Tocantins River, Brazilian Amazon. According to the GLM, all factors together accounted for 43% of the variation in the biomass of the fish that were caught. The behaviors of fishers' that are linked to fishing effort, such as time spent fishing (42% of the total explained by GLM), distance traveled to the fishing ground (12%) and number of fishers (10%), were all positively related to the biomass of fish caught and could explain most of the variation on it. The environmental factor of the fishing habitat accounted for 10% of the variation in fish caught. These results, when applied to management scenarios, indicated that some combinations of the management measures, such as selected lakes as no-take areas, restrictions on the use of gillnets (especially during the high-water season) and individual quotas larger than fishers' usual catches, would most likely have less impact on fishers' income. The proposed scenarios help to identify feasible management options, which could promote the conservation of fish, potentially achieving higher fishers' compliance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Southern Patagonia's Perito Moreno Glacier, Lake Argentino, and Santa Cruz River hydrological system: An overview	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												An overview of the hydrological data from Patagonia's Perito Moreno Glacier-Lake Argentino- and Santa Cruz River system reinforces our previous assertion that the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) are teleconnected with the rupture sequence when the glacier's snout harmonically dams (during certain interannual periods) the Rico branch of Lake Argentino. It is clear, however, that the incidence of interannual climatic anomalies is not uniform in time and appears embedded in decadal or quasi bidecadal periods of relative damming inactivity. The use of nonparametric tests shows that there are no significant positive trends in the river's annual discharge with the only exception of the yearly snowmelt/ice melt periods (September-October), when riverine flow appears to increase with statistical significance. The question of the glacier's stability looks like a complex multivariate process, although we do not rule out the occasional role of ENSO/AAO. A longer hydrological data series (i.e., 100 years) would prove useful in casting some light on this intriguing process, surely accounting for the glacier's response time. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

It remains unclear, however, how the ciliate community responds to such changes over the long-term, particularly in subtropical lake and reservoir ecosys-tems. We analysed 9-year planktonic ciliate data series from the surface water of two subtropical reservoirs to elucidate the role of cyanobacterial bloom and environmental variabilities on the ciliate temporal dynamics. We identified five distinct periods of cyanobacterial succession in both reservoirs. Using multiple time-scale analyses, we found that the interannual variability of ciliate communities was more strongly related to cyanobacterial blooms than to other envi-ronmental variables or to seasonality. Moreover, the percentage of species turnover across cyanobacterial bloom and non-bloom periods increased significantly with time over the 9-year period. Phylogenetic analyses further indicated that 84 %-86 % of ciliate community turnover was governed by stochastic dispersal limitation or undominated pro-cesses, suggesting that the ciliate communities in subtropical reservoirs were mainly controlled by neutral processes. However, short-term blooms increased the selection pressure and drove 30 %-53 % of the ciliate community turnover. We found that the ciliate community composition was influenced by environmental conditions with nutrients, cyanobacterial biomass and microzooplankton having direct and/or indirect significant effects on the ciliate taxo-nomic or functional community dynamics. Our results provide new insights into the long-term temporal dynamics of planktonic ciliate communities under cyanobacterial bloom disturbance.

Most evidence for hominin ecosystem reconstructions originates from the Eastern Rift in today's Somali-Masai Endemic Zone. We provide stable carbon (delta C-13) and oxygen (delta O-18) isotope data from 22 bovid, equid, suid, hippopotamid and elephant teeth from the southern part of the East African Rift and supplement these by 8180 values of present-day meteoric water. This region (Karonga Basin, Malawi) hosts remains of Homo rudolfensis and Paranthropus boisei. It is situated between hominin-bearing sites in Eastern and Southern Africa and therefore fills an important geographical gap for hominin evolution. Tooth enamel delta C-18 and 8180 data of 14 large-bodied mammalian herbivore species from Units 2 and 3 (ca. 4.3 to 0.6 Ma) in the Chiwondo Beds provide information about foraging strategies and vegetation patterns. Our stable isotope data reflect C-3-dominated ecosystems that permitted access to open C-4-environments for migratory mammals. Many analyzed taxa show evidence for mixed diets with high abundances of C-3-biomass consumption; only selected bovids were specialized grazers. delta O-18 of present-day meteoric water reflects rainfall amount and seasonality, elevation, and lake evaporation. 6180 values of Karonga Basin herbivore enamel are generally low and cover values similar to present-day drinking water, indicating both, evaporated and freshwater sources. Comparison of delta C-13 values from the Karonga Basin with other Eastern African herbivore communities reveals significant differences in dietary patterns with much more generalized mixed C-3/C-4, and pure C-3 feeding behaviors in the Malawi Rift. Similarly, enamel 6180 values are lower than in most Plio-Pleistocene Eastern African herbivores, suggesting more humid conditions. Collectively, our data support models in which early hominin foraging activity included access to C-3-dominated biomes, complicating traditional interpretations linking early human evolutionary innovations to a shift towards savanna habitats.

The Morphometry of Lake Palmas, a Deep Natural Lake in Brazil	PLOS ONE												Lake Palmas (A = 10.3 km(2)) is located in the Lower Doce River Valley (LDRV), on the southeastern coast of Brazil. The Lake District of the LDRV includes 90 lakes, whose basic geomorphology is associated with the alluvial valleys of the Barreiras Formation (Cenozoic, Neogene) and with the Holocene coastal plain. This study aimed to investigate the relationship of morphometry and thermal pattern of a LDRV deep lake, Lake Palmas. A bathymetric survey carried out in 2011 and the analysis of hydrographic and wind data with a geographic information system allowed the calculation of several metrics of lake morphometry. The vertical profiling of physical and chemical variables in the water column during the wet/warm and dry/mild cold seasons of 2011 to 2013 has furnished a better understanding of the influence of the lake morphometry on its structure and function. The overdeepened basin has a subrectangular elongated shape and is aligned in a NW-SE direction in an alluvial valley with a maximum depth (Z(max)) of 50.7 m, a volume of 2.2 x 10(8) m(3) (0.22 km(3)) and a mean depth (Z(mv)) of 21.4 m. These metrics suggest Lake Palmas as the deepest natural lake in Brazil. Water column profiling has indicated strong physical and chemical stratification during the wet/warm season, with a hypoxic/anoxic layer occupying one- half of the lake volume. The warm monomictic pattern of Lake Palmas, which is in an accordance to deep tropical lakes, is determined by water column mixing during the dry and mild cold season, especially under the influence of a high effective fetch associated with the incidence of cold fronts. Lake Palmas has a very long theoretical retention time, with a mean of 19.4 years. The changes observed in the hydrological flows of the tributary rivers may disturb the ecological resilience of Lake Palmas.

The physical and biological drivers of sediment oxygenation and denitrification were examined in a New Zealand ICOLL using in situ enclosures for one year. Denitrification was seasonally and spatially variable, and higher denitrification rates were driven by organic matter availability, temperature and nitrate flux. The bulldozing invertebrates generally deepened oxygen penetration in 18% of oxygen profiles, consistent with their effect in multiple regressions. Chironomid larvae (Chironomidae) dominated the benthic community, and their tubular burrows modified oxygen penetration into the sediment in 18% of profiles, potentially affecting denitrification in the ICOLL through bioirrigation. Our study shows that macroinvertebrates support increased sediment oxygenation; therefore the use of artificial opening regimes in many ICOLLs may have negative effects on macroinvertebrate community composition and may consequently inhibit denitrification.

Element analyses were performed by ICP-MS. Results showed that the trace and toxic elements (Al, As, Mn, Pb, Fe) concentration in lake water and/or its feeding sources were above the recommended water standards (WHO, EC, EPA, TS-266). It was found that the maximum accumulation of the heavy metals iron, aluminum, manganese, zinc, and barium in the sediment of Yeni double dagger aga Lake. The accumulation order of trace metals were Fe > Al > Mn > Zn > Ba > Ni > Cr > As > Cu > Pb > Co > Mo > Sn > Cd in the lake, creeks sediment, and soil samples. The similar results suggest that the accumulation of heavy metals in the sediment is a natural process. Metals accumulated in the lake are naturally mixed from the soil. However, the presence of heavy metals in the analysis of artesian well water and sewage reveals that the transportation occurs also from the groundwater to the lake. The results obtained in plankton in Yeni double dagger aga Lake showed that aluminum, iron, manganese, zinc, and barium were most accumulated elements in the plankton. The lower averages of lead prevalent in the water and sediment during some months were seen to have a significant mean accumulation in the plankton.					; Atasagun, Sibel/HJI-7514-2023	Atasagun, Sibel/0000-0001-8507-0961; 													0167-6369					MAR	2012	184	3					1379	1389		10.1007/s10661-011-2048-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-011-2048-0								21494824					WOS:000299520200016
J	Timm, H; Möls, T				Timm, Henn; Moels, Tonu			Littoral macroinvertebrates in Estonian lowland lakes: the effects of habitat, season, eutrophication and land use on some metrics of biological quality	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Due to requirements of EU Water Framework Directive, the popularity of littoral macroinvertebrate communities as indicators in quality assessment of lakes has continuously increased. However, it is not always clear what the indices actually reflect. The littoral is an area linking the lake and the adjacent terrestrial environment, and is integrating the influences from both habitats on the aquatic biota. In addition, natural and anthropogenic environmental factors cannot always be disentangled easily. Our study was based on littoral macroinvertebrate data from 296 hand net samples collected from 196 natural Estonian lowland lakes during 2000-2010. The aim was to identify relationships between relevant macroinvertebrate metrics and several natural and anthropogenic factors. Five metrics (total taxon richness, Shannon diversity H', number of EPT taxa, Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT), and Swedish Acidity Index) were used. In addition, a new hydromorphological index, MESH (Macroinvertebrates in Estonia: Score of Hydromorphology) was tested against the environmental factors. First, we analysed the relationships between the metrics and factors according to Estonian lake typology. In order to estimate the effects of factors on biological quality, the effect of the lake type was thereafter eliminated. The highest number of significant relationships was found in relation to natural factors, such as diversity of vegetation types, general relative vegetation coverage, lake area and latitude. In general, the human-related factors had unexpectedly low relationships with most of the metrics. Average Score Per Taxon predictably increased with the percentage of natural land use area in the lake's catchment. However, the lake water concentration of total phosphorus - a typical indicator of eutrophication in freshwaters - did not reveal a significant relationship with any of the tested metrics. We suggest that the expected ecological relationships were obscured by a general low human stress on Estonian lakes, in combination with a high residual natural variability in the littoral.																			1863-9135					MAR	2012	180	2					145	156		10.1127/1863-9135/2012/0203	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1863-9135/2012/0203													WOS:000304255800007

Potamopyrgus antipodarum, a snail indigenous to New Zealand, has recently colonized North America. We documented the distribution and density of P. antipodarum in the major tributaries of the Madison River in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, examined associations between P. antipodaruin and native macroinvertebrates, and experimentally examined how P. antipodarum affected colonization of substrates by other macroinvertebrates. In 1997 and 1998, we sampled benthic macroinvertebrates in the Madison, Firehole, and Gibbon Rivers and Nez Perce Creek in 3 seasons. 111 1999, we examined colonization of P. antipodarum and other macroinvertebrates in a field experiment using slate tiles in the Madison River. In September 1997, we found P. antipodarum at 23 of 32 locations. Where they were present, P. antipodarum densities ranged from 22 to 299,000 ind./m(2). Densities of P. antipodarum declined between September 1997 and March 1998 and increased between March and July 1998. The composition and structure of native macroinvertebrate assemblages covaried with P. antipodarum densities. Whether the differences in macroinvertebrate communities among sites were related to differences in physical characteristics of streams or to interactions with P antipodaruin was unclear. However, in the field experiment, high densities of P. antipodarum were associated with low colonization of other macroinvertebrates; thus, negative interactions between native macroinvertebrates and P. antipodarum may have the potential to influence the large-scale distribution of other macroinvertebrates.

Oceans on Mars: The possibility of a Noachian groundwater-fed ocean in a sub-freezing martian climate	ICARUS												The Noachian climate of Mars is thought by many to have been "warm and wet", characterized by a global mean annual temperature (MAT) > 273 K and abundant rainfall infiltrating into the groundwater system. In this "warm and wet" scenario, when the groundwater system was in contact with the surface in the northern lowlands, a groundwater-fed ocean could form. In contrast, 1-dimensional climate models and 3-dimensional general circulation models (GCMs) are unable to reproduce long-lived, continuous "warm and wet" conditions due to the influence of the faint young Sun when considering a pure CO2-H2O atmosphere; these models instead predict "cold and icy" conditions, characterized by MAT similar to 225 K and water trapped as snow and ice in the southern highlands. Furthermore, a kilometers-thick globally continuous cryosphere is predicted in this "cold and icy" scenario, precluding direct connection of the groundwater system and the surface, and disfavoring a Noachian northern lowlands ocean. However, global MAT values lack information about regional and seasonal temperature variations, which may vary significantly from global MAT. In this work, we explore whether regional or seasonal temperature variations could permit the formation of a Noachian ocean in a climate with global MAT < 273 K. We use a combination of a 3D climate model and a 1D thermal model to determine the climatic conditions in which the required criteria for groundwater release could be met: (1) temperatures above 273 K, required for there to be no cryosphere preventing the groundwater from being released onto the surface, and (2) a sufficiently large groundwater reservoir, required for the groundwater table to intersect the surface. Our results suggest that the formation of a groundwater-fed ocean does not require a continuous and long-lived "warm and wet" climate with global MAT > 273 K. If the long-lived Noachian global MAT was > 255 K (similar to 30 K above the nominal ambient "cold and icy" climate) and the subsurface contained > 63 m global equivalent layer (GEL) of groundwater, then groundwater could be released onto the surface and pond on the floor of the Hellas basin; global MAT > 258 K and a subsurface water inventory of > 170 m GEL are required for release of groundwater into the topographically lowest regions of Utopia Planitia. If a subsurface water reservoir of 770 m GEL existed and local MAT was 273 K at Utopia, groundwater release could occur at Utopia and lead to flooding of the northern lowlands and formation of an ocean up to the level of Contact 1. Further, in a "cold and icy" MAT 225 K climate, short-term punctuated heating that raised global MAT to > 255 K for at least a few thousand years could lead to groundwater release and flooding of the lowest points on Mars. Under the influence of these very cold climates (global MAT similar to 255-260 K), these bodies of water would remain ice-free for a geologically short period of time, possibly only a few hundred days, and would completely freeze and sublime in only a few thousand years.																			0019-1035	1090-2643				OCT	2019	331						209	225		10.1016/j.icarus.2019.04.022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2019.04.022													WOS:000473554600017

Hydrochemistry and hydrodynamics of a Mexican Caribbean Lagoon: Nichupte Lagoon System	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The study results describe the hydrogeochemical and the hydrodynamic characterization, and the evolution compounds in the water in the Nichupte Lagoon System (NIS). This is the most representative lagoon of Quintana Roo State and hosts the Natural Protected Area "Manglares de Nichupte" and borders the Punta Cancun-Punta Nizuc National Park. Sampling was performed during rainy and cold-front seasons to asses the distribution and variability of temperature, pH, dissolved axygen salinity, nutrients and major elements. Significant differences were detected for temperature and salinity but not for dissolved oxygen between the seasons. The dissolved oxygen values have considerably diminished in a decade. NOx and PO4 concentrations were high, and did not show significant differences between seasons. NH4+ concentration was an order of magnitude higher in the rainy season. Two types of water occur in the study area (Cl) and (Cl-SO4-Na-Ca-Mg). A strong predominance of Na-Cl, classifies the lagoon system as a brackish lake. Evaporation was the dominant process and the lagoon behaves like a salty lake, with an evolution in the chemical composition of the water, which became enriched in calcium during the cold-front season, and in sulfates during the rainy season. No precipitation of calcite or gypsum was identified, but this could occur during the cold fronts due to the geo-chemical evolution observed in the Spencer diagram. Nutrient concentrations have increased in ten years, but some are still below Mexican water quality criteria (CE-CCA-001/89). Some sites present high nutrients concentrations like Bojorquez lagoon sites. The results obtained underline: a) high temperature records vis-a-vis of previous studies measurements (historical records), b) decreasing dissolved oxygen concentrations, c) increasing NO3- and PO43- concentrations. These factors combination shows eutrophication signs that should already be taken as an alert. The circulation of the water in the two analyzed periods was qualitatively similar but the magnitudes of the currents were remarkably different between each other. The rainy season (August 2015) showed near-coastal mean currents of magnitude similar to 2-3 cm s(-1), while the cold-front season (March 2016) showed mean currents about twice stronger (similar to 5-6 cm s(-1)). The circulation pattern result in relatively short residence times of the water bodies of the Lagoon System, with values from 3 to 6 weeks in the rainy season; these values can be decreased by 30-50% in the cold-front season.

Dissolved organic matter quality in thermokarst lake water and sediments across a permafrost gradient, Western Siberia	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Thermokarst (thaw) lakes of permafrost peatlands are among the most important sentinels of climate change and sizable contributors of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in high latitudes. These lakes are humic, often acidic and exhibit fast growing/drainage depending on the local environmental and permafrost thaw. In contrast to good knowledge of the thermokarst lake water hydrochemistry and GHG fluxes, the sediments pore waters remain virtually unknown, despite the fact that these are hot spots of biogeochemical processes including GHG generation. Towards better understating of dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality at the lake water - sediment interface and in the sediments pore waters, here we studied concentration and optical (UV, visual) properties of DOM of 11 thermokarst lakes located in four permafrost zones of Western Siberia Lowland. We found systematic evaluation of DOM concentration, SUVA and various optical parameters along the vertical profile of lake sediments. The lake size and hence, the stage of lake development, had generally weak control on DOM quality. The permafrost zone exhibited clear impact on DOM porewater concentration, optical characteristics, aromaticity and weight average molecular weight (WAMW). The lowest quality of DOM, reflected in highest SUVA and WAMW, corresponding to the dominance of terrestrial sources, was observed at the southern boundary of the permafrost, in the sporadic/discontinuous zone. This suggests active mobilization of organic matter leachates from the interstitial peat and soil porewaters to the lake, presumably via subsurface or suprapermafrost influx. Applying a substitute space for time scenario for future evolution of OM characteristics in thermokarst lake sediments of Western Siberia, we foresee a decrease of DOM quality, molecular weight and potential bioavailability in lakes of continuous permafrost zone, and an increase in these parameters in the sporadic/discontinuous permafrost zone.

Comparative analyses of P variations among 13 semi-connected sub-lakes in Wuliangsu Lake in China, a typical MDE lake, considered external flow and macrophyte decomposition as driving forces. Sediment P fractions and water total phosphorus (TP) were analyzed at 35 sampling points across three ice-on season stages, along with macrophyte TP content to assess debris contributions. Our findings reveal that phosphorus accumulation occurs during the ice-on season in the MDE lake, with an average TP content increase of 16 mg/kg. However, we observed a surprisingly small sediment nutrient accumulation ratio (Delta TP/Delta TN=0.006) compared to macrophyte nutrient levels before decomposition. Further analysis of the dominant species, Potamogeton pectinatus, indicates that a significant portion (55%) of macrophyte phosphorus is released before the ice-on season. This highlights the critical importance of timing macrophyte harvesting to precede the phosphorus leaching process, which has implications for lake management and ecosystem restoration efforts. Additionally, our research demonstrates similar transformations among different sediment fractions as previously reported. Macrophyte debris decomposition likely serves as the primary source of Residual P (Res-P) or TP accumulation. In addition, Ca-bound P (Ca-P) generally showed a decrease, which mainly caused by its transformation to Fe/Al-bound P (Fe/Al-P), Exchange-P (Ex-P), and sometimes to Res-P. However, we emphasize the significant impacts of flow dynamics on Ca-P transport and transformations. Its hydrodynamic action increases water dissolved oxygen, which accelerates the transformation of Ca-P to more easily released Fe/Al-P and Ex-P. Furthermore, hydrodynamic transport also leads to upstream Ca-P transport to downstream. This underscores the necessity of considering flow dynamics when estimating phosphorus variations and formulating phosphorus restoration strategies.

R.; Rossetti, Dilce F.; Francisquini, Mariah I.; Bendassolli, Jose A.; Macario, Kita			Late Holocene mangrove dynamics dominated by autogenic processes	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Generally, palaeoenvironmental interpretations consider only allogenic processes, when autogenic factors may have a strong influence on proxies of stratigraphic sequences. For instance, the Holocene history of the vegetation along the southern littoral of the State of Bahia in north-eastern Brazil is characterized by mangrove dynamics controlled by allogenic processes. However, over smaller timescales (similar to 700years), autogenic processes may have controlled vegetation dynamics and hence observed pollen distribution. This work proposes tidal channel dynamics as one of the main cause for changes in pollen assemblage along the studied stratigraphic profiles during the last centuries, based on sedimentology, pollen and elemental analysis (C-13, N-15 and C/N) and radiocarbon dating of sedimentary organic matter from two cores sampled from an abandoned meander and a tidal flat at the mouth of the Jucurucu River. One core was sampled from a mangrove formed during the past similar to 550cal yr bp. Another core recorded sediments in a varzea forest (swamp seasonally and permanently inundated by freshwater) located similar to 2.7km from the current shoreline, which displayed a maximum age of similar to 680cal yr bp. Two facies associations were identified: tidal channel (A) and tidal flat/oxbow lake (B). This work proposes allogenic processes as the main driving forces controlling the wetlands dynamics at the studied site during the Holocene. However, our data also reveal that part of the changes in vegetation over the last similar to 700years reflect tidal channels and tidal flats development, which represent autogenic processes. The change in timescale analysis from the Holocene to recent centuries may have weakened the influence of allogenic factors. However, this needs interpretation with reference to the spatial scale of the depositional environment as the larger the depositional system analyzed, the stronger the influence of autogenic processes on stratigraphic sequences over longer timescales.

Agriculture as a source of phosphorus for eutrophication in southern Europe	SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT												Large areas of the southern European Countries possess a Mediterranean climate, which influences soil properties, land use, fertilizer application practices and pathways of phosphorus (P) loss from agricultural soils. On average, inputs of fertilizer P exceed P exports from the agricultural areas in these countries; however, large differences in P surplus/deficit and soil P test values exist among regions. Losses of P in drainage water are modest except in some irrigated areas and in those regions where intensive animal production is concentrated. Losses of P in runoff water, whether as dissolved reactive or particulate P, can be substantial as a result of the significance of erosive processes under the land uses typical of the Mediterranean region, where extreme rainfall events contribute disproportionately to such losses. Eutrophication due sensu lato to agricultural P sources affects a relatively high proportion of rivers, lakes and reservoirs. The typical Mediterranean climate and patterns of land use result in marked seasonality in the concentration of P in surface waters. Despite the growing number of studies conducted, the contribution of agricultural P to eutrophication in southern European countries remains largely unassessed and thus warrants pertinent research at the soil, field and catchment scales.

Reproduction of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) in the Maumee River, Ohio: Part 1-Spawning area identification using bidirectional drift modeling	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Control of invasive grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) populations in the Western Lake Erie Basin merits adaptive management guided by the best available science. Presently (2024), capture of mature grass carp in rivers during spawning season is most efficient, so knowing when and where grass carp are spawning is essential information for natural resource agencies. Using bidirectional drift modeling and grass carp ichthyoplankton samples captured in the Maumee River during the 2017-2019 spawning seasons, this study identified 12 probable grass carp spawning areas in the lower 96.5-kilometers of the Maumee River. These spawning areas were located both above and below the Grand Rapids/Providence low-head dams. Three areas showed evidence of multiyear use, while nine had multi-event use. Spawning activity had no definitive diel variation and occurred at an average photoperiod of 15.15 h. The maturation metric ADD15, or annual degree days above 15 degrees Celsius, generally exceeded the 655 threshold for spawning; however, some spawning occurred when ADD15 <= 235, indicating spawners likely matured in a warmwater discharge. The probable spawning areas were generally characterized by mean velocities between 0.4 and 2.1 m per second (with locally higher velocities possible), areas of high turbulence produced by dam spillways or bedrock outcroppings, channel constrictions, confluences, islands, and bridges with piers in the water. Spawning suitability indices (SSI), based on velocity, varied considerably between spawning areas and SSI models. These results could be used to inform control efforts and predict potential grass carp spawning locations in other rivers under threat of invasion.

Role of rotifers in microzooplankton community in a large monsoonal estuary (Cochin backwaters) along the west coast of India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The distribution ecology of microzooplankton in the Kochi (Cochin) backwaters has been presented. Emphasis has been given to the micro-rotifers present in the environment, considering they were a hitherto ignored component of the microzooplankton in the past studies. Three seasonal samplings were carried out at six locations along the salinity gradients in the Kochi backwaters during the Pre-Monsoon (March), Southwest Monsoon (August), and Northeast Monsoon (December). A total of 48 species of microzooplankton were recorded, of which 35 were ciliates, 10 were rotifers, and 3 were heterotrophic dinoflagellates. The study also reports the swarm of a microzooplankton species from the Kochi backwaters, which was formed by a tintinnid ciliate, Tintinnopsis uruguayensis, during the Northeast Monsoon. Very high microzooplankton density (11,990 No. L-1), as swarm in the downstream location was associated with the mesohaline condition and high availability of food. Rotifers were the major component of microzooplankton in the limnohaline/oligohaline region, whereas ciliates dominated in the polyhaline/mesohaline region. Hence, in the present study, salinity appeared to be a major factor affecting the composition of the microzooplankton community in the Kochi backwaters. As rotifers have a wide food spectrum, they can feed on almost all components of the microbial food web, including small ciliates. They also share the same food spectrum with larger ciliates and crustacean nauplii. The present study, for the first time, recorded the importance of rotifers in the microzooplankton community in the plankton food web in the Kochi backwaters.

Late Pleistocene mammoth trackway from Fossil Lake, Oregon	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Behavior of Columbian mammoths (Mammuthus columbi) is revealed by a newly discovered trackway at the Pleistocene locality of Fossil Lake, Oregon. Our 8 by 20 m excavation of the mammoth trackway found 117 tracks, including one 20-m-long adult trail, partial trackways of 3 additional adults, a yearling and a baby all heading generally west. The tracks are in the Marble Bluff biotite tuff (43.2 cal ka), which forms a surface horizon to the Pogani silty clay loam paleosol (Natrargid), with a cracked surface and a columnar-structured, subsurface (Bn) horizon, like soils under desert soda pans with alkali shrubland. Directly below is the Yada silty clay paleosol (Xeroll) with crumb textured surface (A) horizon like grassland soils. The Pasiwa loam (Psamment) is a thin brown siltstone, with sparse roots and burrows of lake-margin early successional vegetation. The Pui sandy loam (Aquent) is well-bedded tuff and sand (A) with subhorizontal calcareous rhizomes and adventitious roots, like those of lake-margin tule reeds (Schoenoplectus acutus). Columbian mammoths may have moved like modern elephants with infants in matriarchal groups through landscapes of sagebrush and grassland, and this trackway includes a limping female attended by concerned juveniles. Grassland paleosols common in the Fossil Lake Formation, are now rare in the same region, perhaps related to extinction of proboscidean and equine grazers.					; Broz, Adrian/AAR-3894-2020	Retallack, Gregory/0000-0003-4356-9240; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				MAY 1	2018	496						192	204		10.1016/j.palaeo.2018.01.037	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2018.01.037													WOS:000428973000015

This study investigates the seasonal and inter-annual variability of the 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees surface water extent (SWE) from the Global Inundation Extent from Multi-Satellites (GIEMS-2) extended to a 30-year time series (1992-2020). Comparison with MODIS-derived SWE, CYGNSS-derived SWE and the Global Lakes and Wetlands Database (GLWD) shows consistent spatial patterns globally and over 10 different basins, although there are discrepancies in extent, partly due to different resolutions of the initial satellite observations. Strong cross-correlation ( > 0.8) in seasonal variability is observed when comparing GIEMS-2 with MODIS, CYGNSS and river discharge in most of the basins studied. Encouraging similarities were found in the inter-annual variability in most basins (cross-correlation > 0.6) between GIEMS-2 and MODIS over 20 years, and between GIEMS-2 and river discharge over long time series, including over the Amazon and the Congo basins. These results highlight the reliability of GIEMS-2 in detecting changes in SWE in different environments, especially under dense vegetation, making it a valuable resource for calibrating hydrological models and studying global methane emissions.

By using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data, a machine learning algorithm was previously developed to assess algal biomass within the euphotic depth (Beu). Here, a long-term Beu dataset of Lake Taihu from 2003 to 2020 was generated to examine its spatio-temporal dynamics, sensitivity to environmental factors, and variations in comparison to the surface algal bloom area. During this period, the daily Beu (total Beu within the whole lake) exhibited temporal fluctuations between 40 and 90 t Chla, with an annual average of 63.32 +/- 5.23 t Chla. Notably, it reached its highest levels in 2007 (72.34 t Chla) and 2017 (73.57 t Chla). Moreover, it demonstrated a clear increasing trend of 0.197 t Chla/y from 2003 to 2007, followed by a slight decrease of 0.247 t Chla/y after 2017. Seasonal variation showed a bimodal annual cycle, characterized by a minor peak in March - April and a major peak in July - September. Spatially, the average pixel-based Beu (total Beu of a unit water column) ranged from 21.17 to 49.85 mg Chla, with high values predominantly distributed in the northwest region and low values in the central region. The sensitivity of Beu to environmental factors varies depending on regions and time scales. Temperature has a significant impact on monthly variation (65.73%), while the level of nutrient concentrations influences annual variation (55.06%). Wind speed, temperature, and hydrodynamic conditions collectively influence the spatial distribution of Beu throughout the entire lake. Algal bloom biomass can capture trend changes in two mutant years as well as bimodal phenological changes compared to surface algal bloom area. This study can provide a basis for scientific evaluation of water environment and a reference for monitoring algal biomass in other similar eutrophic lakes.

Hydrologic characterization of 56 geographically isolated wetlands in west-central Florida using a probabilistic method	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Wetlands are important hydrological elements of watersheds that influence water storage, surface water runoff, groundwater recharge/discharge processes, and evapotranspiration. Understanding the cumulative effect wetlands have on a watershed requires a good understanding of representative water-level fluctuations and storage characteristics associated with multiple wetlands across a region. We introduce a probabilistic approach based on frequency analysis of water levels in numerous geographically isolated wetlands across the mantled karst terrain of west-central Florida, in the Tampa Bay region. This approach estimates the probabilities, or percentage of time, that water levels in a wetland or upland groundwater wells are at or below a specific elevation. We applied this hydrologic characterization to 56 wetlands in west-central Florida, and documented that standing water was present in the wetlands 61 % of the time and that these wetlands were groundwater recharge zones at least 50 % of the time over the 7 year study. Additionally, we demonstrated that various wetland types, classified according to vegetation community composition and structure, exhibit similar means, extremes and ranges in water-level behavior. We believe that this is the first paper to robustly quantify inundation frequency and recharge status in seasonally flooded wetlands at a regional scale. The analytical tool introduced in this manuscript could be used to detect, through changes in water-level frequency distribution, wetland hydrological response to different climatological or anthropogenic stressors. This tool is timely as changes in frequency distribution shape may provide early warnings of ecosystem regime change.					; Lewis, David/B-6313-2009	Rains, Mark/0000-0002-8103-475X; Lewis, David/0000-0002-8094-1577													0923-4861	1572-9834				FEB	2013	21	1					1	14		10.1007/s11273-012-9275-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-012-9275-1													WOS:000314691500001

Environmental and maternal effects on embryonic and larval developmental time until dispersal of lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												For migratory fish like lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), the period from egg deposition through embryonic and larval development until dispersal (ELDTUD) contributes substantially to variation in survival at the individual level and to population levels of recruitment. Using genetically determined parentage, we examined the relative importance of environmental variables in a stream environment (e.g., temperature and discharge) and maternal effects (including individual female body size, spawning time, and location) to ELDTUD on an individual basis. Adult lake sturgeon (n = 208) spawning in the Upper Black River (Michigan, USA), and larvae (n = 1444) dispersing downstream were captured during the 2007 spawning season. We used generalized mixed models and multimodel inference based on Kullback-Leibler information-theoretic criteria to demonstrate that environmental variables and the maternal effects of individual female and spawning time were both important predictors of ELDTUD. Decreasing ELDTUD during the season resulted from linearly increasing temperature and nonlinearly decreasing river discharge. Spawning time and individual female explained a large proportion of variation in ELDTUD. The individual-based approach used in this study provided precise estimates of ELDTUD also facilitated the partitioning of variation in ELDTUD of larvae produced by the same female and among females spawning at different times and different environmental conditions.					; Thuy-Yen, Duong/AAC-9071-2019	Crossman, James/0000-0002-7134-982X; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				APR	2011	68	4					643	654		10.1139/F11-008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F11-008													WOS:000291183500006
J	Ravinet, M; Syväranta, J; Jones, RI; Grey, J				Ravinet, Mark; Syvaranta, Jari; Jones, Roger I.; Grey, Jonathan			A trophic pathway from biogenic methane supports fish biomass in a temperate lake ecosystem	OIKOS												Although some primary consumers such as chironomid larvae are known to exploit methane-derived carbon via microbial consortia within aquatic food webs, few studies have traced the onward transfer of such carbon to their predators. The ruffe Gymnocephalus cernuus is a widespread benthivorous fish which feeds predominantly on chironomid larvae and is well adapted for foraging at lower depths than other percids. Therefore, any transfer of methanogenic carbon to higher trophic levels might be particularly evident in ruffe. We sampled ruffe and chironomid larvae from the littoral, sub-littoral and profundal areas of Jyvasjarvi, Finland, a lake which has previously been shown to contain chironomid larvae exhibiting the very low stable carbon isotope ratios indicative of methane exploitation. A combination of Fish gut content examination and stable isotope analysis was used to determine trophic linkages between Fish and their putative prey. Irrespective of the depth from which the ruffe were caught, their diet was dominated by chironomids and pupae although the proportions of taxa changed. Zooplankton made a negligible contribution to ruffe diet. A progressive decrease in delta C-13 and delta N-15 values with increasing water column depth was observed for both chironomid larvae and ruffe, but not for other species of benthivorous fish. Furthermore, ruffe feeding at greater depths were significantly larger than those feeding in the littoral, suggesting an ontogenetic shift in habitat use, rather than diet, as chironomids remained the predominant prey item. The outputs from isotope mixing models suggested that the incorporation of in ethane-derived carbon to larval chironomid biomass through feeding on methanotrophic bacteria increased at greater depth, varying from 0% in the littoral to 28% in the profundal. Using these outputs and the proportions of littoral, sub-littoral or profundal chironomids contributing to ruffe biomass, we estimated that 17% of ruffe biomass in this lake was ultimately derived from chemoauotrophic sources. Methanogenic carbon thus supports considerable production of higher trophic levels in lakes.

The accumulation of the hepatotoxic microcystins (MCs) determined by LC-MS in various organs of silver carp was studied monthly in Lake Taihu dominated by toxic Microcystis aeruginosa. Average recoveries of spiked fish samples were 78% for MC-RR and 81% for MC-LR. The highest content of MCs was found in the intestine (97.48 mu g g(-1) DW), followed by liver (6.84 mu g g(-1) DW), kidney (4.8 8 mu g g(-1) DW) and blood (1.54 mu g g(-1) DW), and the annual mean MC content was in the order of intestine > liver > kidney > blood > muscle > spleen > gallbladder > gill. Silver carp could effectively ingest toxic Microcystis cells (up to 84.4% of total phytoplankton in gut contents), but showed fast growth (from 141 g to 1759 g in I year in mean weight). Silver carp accumulated less microcystins in liver than other animals in the same site or other fish from different water bodies at similar level of toxin ingestion. There was possible inhibition of the transportation of the most toxic MC-LR across the gutwall. Muscle of silver carp in Lake Taihu should not be consumed during period of dense Microcystis blooms while viscera were risky for consumption in more months. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

While the social and environmental impacts of dams are now wellunderstood, there is little knowledge about the effects of dams on groundwater-surface water interactions in a complex lake -river-aquifer system. This study adopts a three-dimensional groundwater numerical model to quantify the potential impacts of dam construction, on regional groundwater flow system, exemplified by the proposed Poyang Lake Hydraulic Dam (PLHD) in China. Once implemented, the PLHD will regulate lake levels, artificially controlling the lake inundation area during the recession season (September-October) and the dry season (November -December). Modeling results indicated that the increase in lake infiltration induced by PLHD regulation would alter the regional water exchange pattern. The PLHD regulation will likely enhance the groundwater storage by 20.44 % in the general dry year (i.e., 2018), alleviating 78.1 % of the groundwater deficit in the extreme dry year (i.e., 2019). Additionally, the response of groundwater dynamics to the PLHD regulation exhibits significant spatial differences between the upstream and downstream areas of the dam, primarily depending on topographical changes. Overall, the PLHD regulation is most likely to impact groundwater levels across an area of approximately 5,700 km 2 , and the associated groundwater storage is anticipated to reach a stable state, under future long -term regulation. Our findings may guide policy -makers wishing to develop more suitable PLHD scheduling plans and floodplain protection strategies by providing reliable information regarding groundwater storage change and ecosystem succession.

J	Ji, FY; Sun, YQ; Yang, Q				Ji, Fengyun; Sun, Yeqing; Yang, Qing			Early warning of red tides using bacterial and eukaryotic communities in nearshore waters	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Anthropogenic discharge activities have increased nutrient pollution in coastal areas, leading to algal blooms and microbial community changes. Particularly, microbial communities could easily be affected with variation in nutrient pollution, and thus offered a promising strategy to predict early red tides warning via microbial community-levels variation and their keystone taxa hysteretic responses to nutrient pollution. Herein high -throughput sequencing technology from 52 samples were used to explore the variation of microbial commu-nities and find the significant tipping points with aggravating nutrient conditions in Xiaoping Island coastal area. Results indicated that bacterial and microeukaryote communities were generally spatial and seasonal hetero-geneity and were influenced by the different nutrient conditions. Procrustes test results showed that the comprehensive index of organics polluting (OPI), total nitrogen (TN), inorganic nitrogen (DIN), and total phosphorus (TP) were significantly correlated with the composition of bacteria and microeukaryotes. A SEGMENTED analysis revealed that the threshold of TN, DIN, and NH4-N for bacterial community were 0.23 +/- 0.091 mg/L, 0.21 +/- 0.084 mg/L, 0.09 +/- 0.057 mg/L, respectively. Tipping points for TN, DIN, and NH4-N agreed with the concentration during Ceratium tripos and Skeletonema costatum blooms. Co-occurrence network results found that Planktomarina, Acinetobacter, and Verrucomicrobiaceae were keystone and OPI-discriminatory taxa. The abundant changes of Planktomarina at station A1 were significantly correlated with the development C. tripos blooms (r = 0.55, p < 0.05), and also significantly correlated with TN, DIN, and NO3-N (r >=|0.55|, p < 0.05). The abundant changes of Acinetobacter and Verrucomicrobiaceae at station C1 were significantly correlated with the development of C. tripos blooms (r >= 0.77, p < 0.05), and also significantly correlated with PO4-P (r >= 0.64, p < 0.05). The dynamic abundance of keystone taxa showed that the trend of rapid changes could be monitored 1.5 months before the occurrence of red tide. Therefore, this study provides an assessment method for early warning of red tide occurrence and factors that trigger red tide.																			0013-9351	1096-0953				JAN 1	2023	216		3						114711	10.1016/j.envres.2022.114711	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.114711		NOV 2022						36334824					WOS:000886067400004

The zooplankton community was monitored for 9 years with monthly samplings. We estimated the inter-annual, inter-seasonal, intra-seasonal, and inter-month beta-diversity with the magnitude of sampling errors, and examined relative contributions of these time scales on changes in the zooplankton community structure. The temporal beta-diversity was high at the inter-seasonal scale than at the intra-seasonal and inter-annual time scales, suggesting that taxonomic turnover in the zooplankton community was regulated by seasonally changing parameters such as water temperature. Indeed, the temporal beta-diversity is related significantly to water temperature, although no significant relationship was detected between the temporal beta-diversity and chlorophyll-aconcentrations. In addition, the large inter-month beta-diversity with significant inter-annual beta-diversity indicated that the phenology of the zooplankton community changed depending on years, especially before and after 2012. These results indicate that temporal beta-diversity is a useful gauge for detecting phenological changes and for quantifying the temporal stability of plankton communities at various time scales.					; Urabe, Jotaro/ACO-1029-2022; Makino, Wataru/GLS-2518-2022	Perera, Ishara/0000-0002-6066-3637; 													1439-8621	1439-863X				JAN	2021	22	1					89	99		10.1007/s10201-020-00637-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-020-00637-9		AUG 2020											WOS:000556663500001

In contrast to the control group, male mice exposed intraperitoneally to 3.33 or 6.67 mu g microcystins/kg body weight for 14 days had decreased mean body weight, and the mean absolute weight of the testes and epididymides was decreased. However, the mean relative weight of the testes increased compared to the controls. In addition, histological examination of microcystin-treated mice indicated that the testes were damaged and the space between the seminiferous tubules was more pronounced compared to control mice. The quality of mature sperm in the seminiferous tubules was also decreased in treated mice compared with the control group. Further studies showed that motility and viability of the sperm from microcystin-treated mice were reduced, but no significant difference was found in the concentration and abnormality of the sperm from treated mice compared to the control. This study indicated that microcystins had numerous toxic effects on the reproductive system of male mice. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Papatheodorou, G; Demopoulou, G; Lambrakis, N				Papatheodorou, G; Demopoulou, G; Lambrakis, N			A long-term study of temporal hydrochemical data in a shallow lake using multivariate statistical techniques	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												The multivariate statistical techniques R- and Q-mode factor analysis and discriminant analysis were applied to a dataset containing physicochemical parameters in lake water samples collected from a shallow (similar to 4 m) lake located in northwest Greece during a 10-years (1981-1991) monitoring program. Multivariate statistical methods were applied to separate datasets of Pamvotis Lake in order to identify the environmental factors associated with the physicochemical temporal variability. R-mode factor analysis was applied on raw and log-transformed datasets and has allowed the identification of a reduced number of factors with a hydrochemical meaning. R-mode factor analysis has shown that the temporal variability in the Lake Pamvotis depends on six main factors associated to evaporoconcentration processes, natural inflows, anthropogenic influences and phytoplaktonic biomass. The sinusoidal shape of the six factors scores plots has shown that the temporal variations caused by natural and human factors are linked to seasonality. Q-mode factor analysis and discriminant analysis were sequentially applied to (i) the log-transformed full data set of Lake Pamvotis and (ii) a subset contains variables (D.O., SAT, NO3-, NO2-, NH4+ and T.P.) which are related to the water quality of lake water samples. In both cases, three clusters of water samples were identified representing (i) a clear seasonal flocculation of the lake waters and (ii) a clustering of the water samples on the basis of water quality showing a seasonal eutrophication of the lake waters. Discriminant analysis showed four parameters (T.P., Na+, Mg2+ and Ca2+) affording more than 86% right assignations in temporal analysis of full dataset and one parameter (NO3-) to afford 96% right assignations of the subset contained water quality parameters. The application of Q-mode analysis and discriminant analysis has achieved a meaningful classification of lake water samples based on seasonal criteria. Overall, the results of this study present effectiveness of multivariate statistical techniques for evaluation of temporal changes in governing hydrochemical processes and water quality of lake waters.

However, little is known about the factors that drive the differentiation of bacterial lifestyles, especially in flooding lake systems. Here we assessed the compositional and functional similarities between the FL and PA bacterial fractions in a typical flooding lake-the Poyang Lake (PYL) of China. The results revealed that PA communities had significantly different compositions and functions from FL communities in every hydrological period, and the diversity of both PA and FL communities was affected mainly by the water regime rather than bacterial lifestyles. PA communities were more diverse and enriched with Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, while FL communities had more Actinobacteria. There was a higher abundance of photosynthetic and nitrogen-cycling bacterial groups in PA communities, but a higher abundance of members involved in hydrocarbon degradation, aromatic hydrocarbon degradation, and methylotrophy in FL communities. Water properties (e.g., temperature, pH, total phosphorus) significantly regulated the lifestyle variations of PA and FL bacteria in PYL. Collectively, our results have demonstrated a clear ecological differentiation of PA and FL bacterial communities in flooding lakes, suggesting that the connectivity between FL and PA bacterial fractions is water property-related rather than water regime-related.

Climatic variability in Mfabeni peatlands (South Africa) since the late Pleistocene	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												It has been postulated that a bipolar seesaw interhemispheric mechanism dominated the relationship between the Northern and Southern hemisphere climates since the late Pleistocene. A key test for this proposition would be to undertake palaeoenvironmental studies on terrestrial archives in climatically sensitive regions. Southern Africa's contemporary C-3 and C-4 terrestrial plant distributions display a definitive geographical pattern dictated by different growing season rainfall and temperature zones; however, the region is generally archive poor due to its overall semi-arid climate and high relief topography. The Mfabeni peatland, with a basal age of c. 47 k yrs calibrated before present (kcal yr BP), is one of the oldest continuous coastal peat deposits in Southern Africa. Molecular leaf wax isotopes (delta C-13(wax)) were generated for a 810 cm long core, and combined with previously published bulk geochemical (delta C-13(bulk), %TOC), palynological, and stratigraphic data, to reconstruct the late Pleistocene and Holocene palaeoenvironments. We interpreted environmental shifts associated with the Heinrich 4, Last Glacial Maximum, deglacial and Holocene periods, which are consistent with adjacent Indian Ocean sea surface temperature records. However, the other shorter climate perturbations during the Heinrich 5, 3, 2, 1, Antarctic cold reversal and Younger Dryas, were muted, most likely due to local hydrological overprinting on the Mfabeni record. A general anti-phase sequence was observed between the Mfabeni record and better established Northern Hemisphere events, underpinning the bipolar seesaw interhemispheric mechanism proposed for global climate forcing since the Late Pleistocene.

Addressing biodiversity issues solely based on morphological characters is further problematic since molecular analyses revealed a huge genetic diversity within morphotypes, even showing polyphyly in some morphological defined species. In order to address the seasonal variations of chrysophytes, 10 samples were collected in 2007 from the oligotrophic lake Fuschlsee (Salzkammergut, Austria). By using Dinobryon as a case study, we compared different gene phylogenies of single cells of the 18S, ITS (including ITS1, 5.8S, partial ITS2) and the mitochondrial marker COI. No clear molecular phylogenetic separation between morphological identified cells of D. divergens and D. bavaricum could be accomplished based on the 18S rDNA sequences. ITS and COI sequence data revealed a higher genetic diversity then the 18S, with several independent lineages consisting of D. divergens cells. We further encountered divergent phylogenies by comparing 18S/ITS sequence data with COI data within D. pediforme, D. sociale and D. bavaricum lineages. By combining the results of the single cell approach with seasonal data based on 454 pyrosequencing, we addressed the question in how far one morphological species may dominate in the water column over the course of a single year. The results of the 454 pyrosequencing revealed that the D. divergens/D. bavaricum lineage shows the highest abundance from all Chrysophyceae/Synurophyceae and strong seasonal variations with peaks in May and October.

Dynamics and limitations of phytoplankton biomass along a gradient in Mwanza Gulf, southern Lake Victoria (Tanzania)	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. We investigated how dynamics in phytoplankton biomass are driven through light and nutrient limitations in the Mwanza Gulf, Lake Victoria (Tanzania). 2. We measured light attenuation, chlorophyll a and water quality parameters along a phytoplankton biomass gradient in the Mwanza Gulf at six sampling stations in three different seasons from August 2009 to March 2011. 3. We found a higher rate of attenuation of photosynthetic available radiation than in other gulfs of Lake Victoria which could only partially be explained by phytoplankton biomass, measured as chlorophyll a. Suspended particulate detritus strongly affected light attenuation, particularly in shallow water. 4. In shallow water in the southern part of the Mwanza Gulf, nutrients were in excess and phytoplankton biomass was limited by light. In deeper water near the entrance of the gulf, light was not limiting when nitrogen probably was, as indicated by the N:P ratio. 5. Low abundance of N-fixing phytoplankton species suggests that N-fixation was low in shallow water. Phytoplankton biomass was lower in Mwanza Gulf than in northern gulfs of Lake Victoria, but might increase in the future as a result of nutrient enrichment caused by an increase in intensive agriculture and rapid growth of the city of Mwanza.

Retinol contents in fresh edible tissues of the Common carp and European catfish were found to be 30.8 +/- 3.4 mu g/100 g wet weight (ww) for the Common carp 30.8 +/- 3.4 mu g/100 g ww and 1.9 +/- 0.1 mu g/100 g ww for the European catfish, cholecalciferol contents 14.8 +/- 1.0 and 3.1 +/- 0.1 mu g/100 g ww, and a-tocopherol contents 2764.5 +/- 44.0 and 2182.5 contents 14.8 +/- 1.0 and 3.1 +/- 0.1 mu g/100 g ww, and a-tocopherol contents 2764.5 +/- 44.0 and 2182.5 31.5 mu g/100 contents 14.8 +/- 1.0 and 3.1 +/- 0.1 mu g/100 g ww, and a-tocopherol contents 2764.5 +/- 44.0 and 2182.5 +/- 31.5 mu g/100 +/- 31.5 mu g/100 g ww, respectively. The sum of monounsaturated FA accounted for 50.02% (catfish) and 23.15% (carp). Polyunsaturated FA (PUPA) showed a higher level in the carp (36.75%) and a lower one in the catfish (21.64%). Both fishes are good sources of cholecalciferol in terms of the recommended daily intake of vitamins established in Bulgaria. Three fat soluble vitamins, n-3 PUFAs content, and IA value were higher in carp.

A land use regression model for predicting ambient concentrations of nitrogen dioxide in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada	JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION												This paper reports on the development of a land use regression (LUR) model for predicting the intraurban variation of traffic-related air pollution in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, an industrial city at the western end of Lake Ontario. Although land use regression has been increasingly used to characterize exposure gradients within cities, research to date has yet to test whether this method can produce reliable estimates in an industrialized location. Ambient concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO,) were measured for a 2-week period in October 2002 at > 100 locations across the city and subsequently at 30 of these locations in May 2004 to assess seasonal effects. Predictor variables were derived for land use types, transportation, demography, and, physical geography using geographic information systems. The LUR model explained 76% of the variation in NO2. Traffic density, proximity to a highway, and industrial land use were all positively correlated with NO, concentrations, whereas open land use and distance from the lake were negatively correlated with NO2. Locations downwind of a major highway resulted in higher NO2 levels. Cross-validation of the results confirmed model stability Over different seasons. Our findings demonstrate that land use regression can effectively predict NO, variation at the intraurban scale in an industrial setting. Models predicting exposure within smaller areas may lead to improved detection of health effects in epidemiologic studies.					; Jerrett, Michael/CAA-2482-2022; Gilbert, Nicolas/A-2253-2009; Arain, M./ABA-9750-2020	Gilbert, Nicolas/0000-0001-6985-8046; Newbold, Bruce/0000-0002-6441-7863; Arain, M.

J	Li, LL; Vrieling, A; Skidmore, A; Wang, TJ				Li, Linlin; Vrieling, Anton; Skidmore, Andrew; Wang, Tiejun			Evaluation of a new 18-year MODIS-derived surface water fraction dataset for constructing Mediterranean wetland open surface water dynamics	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Wetlands are among the most biodiverse ecosystems in the world, due largely to their dynamic hydrology. Frequent observations by satellite sensors such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) allow for monitoring the seasonal, inter-annual and long-term dynamics of surface water extent. However, existing MODIS-based studies have only demonstrated this for large water bodies (> 100 km(2)) despite the ecological importance of smaller-sized wetland systems. In this paper, we assessed if the temporal dynamics of surface water extent can be effectively captured with MODIS for a wide range of water body sizes, specifically 0.01 km(2) and larger. We constructed the temporal dynamics of surface water extent for 340 individual water bodies in the Mediterranean region between 2000 and 2017, using a previously developed 8-day 500 m MODIS surface water fraction (SWF) dataset. We then evaluated how MODIS SWF time series corresponded to water extent derived from a Landsat-based dataset and to satellite-altimetry derived water level data. Results showed that although correlations between MODIS- and Landsat-derived SWF were poor for relative static water bodies (r = 0.17), they increased for more dynamic water bodies (r = 0.81). For dynamic water bodies > 100 km(2), time series of water extent derived from MODIS SWF showed good correlation with both Landsat (r >= 0.76) and water level data (rho >= 0.63). Our MODIS SWF dataset can also effectively monitor the variability of very small water bodies (< 1 km(2)) when comparing with Landsat data as long as the temporal variability in their surface water area was high. We conclude that MODIS SWF is a useful product to help understand hydrological dynamics for both small and larger-sized water bodies, and to monitor their seasonal, intermittent, inter-annual and long-term changes.					; Vrieling, Anton/B-2639-2012; Skidmore, Andrew/C-7441-2011; Wang, Tiejun/A-4671-2010	Wang, Tiejun/0000-0002-1138-8464; Vrieling, Anton/0000-0002-7979-1540; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				AUG	2020	587								124956	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124956	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124956													WOS:000568819100048
J	Zuijdgeest, A; Wehrli, B				Zuijdgeest, Alissa; Wehrli, Bernhard			Carbon and nutrient fluxes from floodplains and reservoirs in the Zambezi basin	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Inland waters are under increasing anthropogenic stresses. In the last century, roughly two thirds of the world's wetland area disappeared, and so many dams have been constructed that currently 50% of river water passes through reservoirs before reaching the ocean. Large river systems in tropical and subtropical areas often develop extensive floodplain areas that will suffer from modifications in the flow regime as another boom in dam construction is under way. In the Zambezi catchment, we developed a comparative analysis of the biogeochemical effects of floodplains (Barotse Plains) and reservoirs (Lake Kariba) on tropical river biogeochemistry, to provide a basis to assess the net effect of eliminating wetland areas and transforming rivers into artificial lakes. To support such analyses, we propose a combination of specific sampling campaigns with sensor deployments to capture the seasonality of fluxes over large regional scales in remote areas. Dams and reservoirs alter the riverine biogeochemistry in distinct, and often different ways. While the Barotse Plains floodplain releases particles during a flood cycle, this suspended material is effectively trapped in Kariba reservoir. Seasonal production of biomass on the floodplain binds nutrients in the form of organic matter that sustains biological productivity in downstream ecosystems. Degradation of the biomass can lead to significant greenhouse gas emissions from the floodplain. The reservoir traps particles and nutrients, but carbon burial (120.10(3) t C per year) is offset by annual emissions of methane to the atmosphere with about 3000.10(3) t C-CO2-equivalents. Therefore, building new dams will add permanent sinks of particles and nutrients to the land-ocean aquatic continuum, while draining riparian wetlands will disrupt their functions as temporal storage systems and source of terrestrial biomass for aquatic food chains.

J	Lapointe, BE; Bedford, BJ				Lapointe, Brian E.; Bedford, Bradley J.			Drift rhodophyte blooms emerge in Lee County, Florida, USA: Evidence of escalating coastal eutrophication	HARMFUL ALGAE												Macroalgal blooms have increased globally in recent decades as a result of increased nutrient enrichment and eutrophication of coastal waters. In Lee County, Florida, this problem reached a critical stage in 2003/2004 when massive rhodophyte blooms washed ashore, making beaches unsuitable for recreation and requiring an expensive removal program. To better understand the ecology of these blooms, water quality and macroalgae sampling was conducted in August 2004, prior to hurricane Charley, and again in late October following several months of large freshwater discharges from the Caloosahatchee River. During both samplings, water and macroalgae were collected along a gradient extending from the Caloosahatchee River to natural and artificial reefs up to 26 km from shore. Dissolved nutrient concentrations were generally high throughout the study area, with significantly higher concentrations in the Caloosahatchee River. Mean dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations in the Caloosahatchee River increased from Ortona Lock (< 18 mu M) to Franklin Lock (23-28 mu M) downstream during both samplings, indicating significant enrichment within the basin. On coastal reefs, mean ammonium concentrations increased six-fold (<= 0.20-1.31 mu M) and soluble reactive phosphorus increased three-fold (0.30-0.92 mu M) from August to October, respectively. Mean reef macroalgae C:N ratios were low and similar in August (13.9) and October (13.5), and C:P and N:P ratios were also low but decreased significantly from August to October (386-242 and 27.4-17.5, respectively). Macroalgal delta N-15 values increased from Ortona Lock (+8 to 9 parts per thousand) to Franklin Lock (+12 to 15 parts per thousand) during both samplings, were within the sewage nitrogen range, and decreased with increasing distance from shore to similar to+3.0 parts per thousand. at the most offshore reef. Macroalgae (Gracilaria, Hypnea, Botryocladia, Eucheuma, Sargassum) collected in July 2004 from Lee County beaches had mean delta N-15 values >+6.0 parts per thousand, similar to values for macroalgae on inshore reefs and within the sewage nitrogen range. However, mean delta N-15 values of reef macroalgae decreased from August (+5.84 parts per thousand) to October (+3.89 parts per thousand) as Caloosahatchee River discharges increased, suggesting relatively larger contributions from nitrogen sources with low delta N-15 values (<+3 parts per thousand), such as rainfall and agricultural fertilizers, in the wet season. Improved management of freshwater releases from Lake Okeechobee, combined with nutrient removal from sewage effluent within the Caloosahatchee River drainage basin, could help mitigate future macroalgal blooms in Lee County's coastal waters.(c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

One of the impacts to the downstream physical environment that has important implications for the aquatic ecosystem is the transformation of the thermal regime from highly variable seasonally to relatively constant year-round. owing to hypolimnetic releases from the upstream reservoir, Lake Powell. Because of the perceived impacts oil the downstream aquatic ecosystem and native fish communities, the Glen C,Canyon Darn Adaptive Management Program hits considered modifications to flow releases and release temperatures designed to increase downstream temperatures. Here. we present I new model of monthly average water temperatures below Glen Canyon Dam designed for first-order, relatively simple evaluation Of various alternative darn operations. The model is based oil a simplified heat-exchange equation, and model parameters are estimated empirically. The model predicts monthly average temperatures at locations up to 421 km downstream from the darn with average absolute errors less than 0.5 degrees C for the dataset considered. The modelling approach used here may also prove useful for other systems, particularly below large dams where release temperatures are substantially Out of equilibrium with meteorological conditions. We also present some examples of how the model call be used to evaluate scenarios for the operation of Glen Canyon Darn. Published in 2008 by John Wiley & Sons.

All profundal charr live in deep water their entire life and have a maximum size of 14 cm, while the littoral charr grow to 40 cm. Some small and young littoral charr move to the profundal zone in an ontogenetic habitat shift in the ice-free season and the rest of the population remains in epilimnic waters. The two morphs had different diet niches in the profundal zone: the profundal charr ate typical soft-bottom prey (chironomid larvae, pea mussels and benthic copepods), while the young littoral chart mainly consumed crustacean zooplankton. In four other lakes without a profundal morph (i.e. monomorphic populations), young charr also performed ontogenetic habitat shifts to the profundal zone and fed on zooplankton. The profundal morph of Fjellfrosvatn therefore utilize a food resource niche that neither the littoral morph nor comparable monomorphic populations exploit. This suggests that intraspecific resource competition has driven incipient ecological speciation of the profundal charr of Fjellfrosvatn. The exploitation of the soft-bottom resources by the profundal chart supports earlier experimental findings that the profundal morph is genetically different in trophic behaviour and morphology. The sympatric ecological divergence within the profundal habitat is possible because unexploited food resources (soft-bottom profundal prey) are available. Apparently, this represents a case of incipient segregation by expansion to new resource types (niche invasion), and not by subdivision of one broad ancestral niche.

Water quality of Flag Boshielo Dam, Olifants River, South Africa: Historical trends and the impact of drought	WATER SA												Increasing demands for water, discharge of effluents, and variable rainfall have a negative impact on water quality in the Olifants River. Crocodile and fish mortalities attributed to pansteatitis, in Loskop Dam and downstream in the Kruger National Park (KNP), have highlighted the serious effects these impacts are having on aquatic ecosystems. Flag Boshielo Dam is a reservoir on the Olifants River, located between Loskop Dam and the KNP. It has the largest crocodile population outside of the KNP, and pansteatitis has not been reported in fish or crocodiles to date. This study evaluated comparative water quality parameters concurrent to a similar study undertaken at Loskop Dam to establish possible environmental drivers of pansteatitis. Long-term monitoring data collected by the Department of Water Affairs were analysed for trends using a Seasonal-Kendall trend test. Short-term monitoring showed that water quality in Flag Boshielo Dam was of a good standard for ecosystem health. Concentrations of dissolved Cu, Se, V and Zn were always below instrument detection limits, and Al, Fe and Mn were mostly within guideline levels for ecosystem health. A severe drought occurred between November 2002 and December 2005. Long-term monitoring showed that water quality during the drought deteriorated, with high levels of dissolved salts, especially K, Na, Cl, F, and total alkalinity. Following the drought, dissolved salt concentrations dropped, and there was a brief flush of inorganic N and P. However, between 1998 and 2011, inorganic N showed a significant decreasing trend into the oligotrophic range, while inorganic P remained in the oligo-to mesotrophic range. The inorganic N to inorganic P ratio of 5.4 after the drought was indicative of N limitation, and the phytoplankton assemblage was dominated by nitrogen-fixing species, especially Cylindrospermopsis sp. In contrast, further upstream, Loskop Dam has undergone increasing eutrophication, has frequent blooms of Microcystis aeruginosa and Ceratium hirundinella, and concentrations of Al, Fe and Mn periodically exceed guideline levels. The difference in trophic state, phytoplankton assemblage and levels of productivity between these two reservoirs may provide insights into the aetiology of pansteatitis, which is frequently associated with dietary causes.

The dynamics of phytoplankton under a cyanobacterial pressure may provide important information about what a competitive advantage of Cyanobacteria have over eukaryotic microalgae. The research, therefore focused on the relationship between cyanobacterial blooms and the accompanying species in hypertrophic shallow lakes where nutrients are in excess. The following hypotheses were selected for testing: i) Cyanobacterial blooms negatively affect the species richness and diversity of phytoplankton assemblages in the studied hypertrophic lakes. ii) Cyanobacterial blooms negatively affect the multi-trait functional diversity of phytoplankton assemblages in the studied hypertrophic lakes. iii) The formation of a cyanobacterial bloom causes a shift in the species and trait composition of phytoplankton assemblages. It was found that the species diversity of non-cyanobacterial assemblages was not affected negatively by increasing density of Cyanobacteria. Cyanobacterial biomass negatively affected the functional richness and functional dispersion of the assemblages, but both relationships were only marginally significant. Some temporal shift was detected in the community weighted mean values of width, colonial ability of accompanying microalgae, and also in flagellatedness and mixotrophic ability. We conclude that Cyanobacterial blooms basically alter dominance relations in the phytoplankton and reduce availability of light in waters. However, it does not necessarily coincide with the elimination of other taxa and reduction their species numbers or diversity. The formerly published data on the decrease in species richness can be likely explained by methodological deficiencies, which are responsible for reduced detectability of species. To better understand the seasonal dynamics and resilience of phytoplankton assemblages in hypertrophic water bodies the development of new methodologies by which diversity and succession of subordinate species can be evaluated is required.

Divergent hydrological responses to 20th century climate change in shallow tundra ponds, western Hudson Bay Lowlands	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The hydrological fate of shallow tundra lakes and ponds under conditions of continued warming remains uncertain, but has important implications for wildlife habitat and biogeochemical cycling. Observations of unprecedented pond desiccation, in particular, signify catastrophic loss of aquatic habitat in some Arctic locations. Shallow tundra ponds are a ubiquitous feature in the western Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL), a region that has undergone intense warming over the past similar to 50 years. But it remains unknown how hydrological processes in these ponds have responded. Here, we use cellulose-inferred pond water oxygen isotope records from sediment cores, informed by monitoring of modern pond water isotope compositions during the 2009 and 2010 ice-free seasons, to reconstruct hydrological conditions of four shallow tundra ponds in the western HBL over the past three centuries. Following an interval of relative hydrological stability during the early part of the records, results reveal widely differing hydrological responses to 20th century climate change among the study sites, which is largely dependent on hydrological connectivity of the basins within their respective surrounding peatlands. These findings suggest the 20th century has been characterized by an increasingly dynamic landscape that has variably influenced surface water balance - a factor that is likely to play a key role in determining the future water balance of ponds in this region.

A 1 Ma sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) record of catchment vegetation changes and the developmental history of tropical Lake Towuti (Sulawesi, Indonesia)	GEOBIOLOGY												Studying past ecosystems from ancient environmental DNA preserved in lake sediments (sedaDNA) is a rapidly expanding field. This research has mainly involved Holocene sediments from lakes in cool climates, with little known about the suitability of sedaDNA to reconstruct substantially older ecosystems in the warm tropics. Here, we report the successful recovery of chloroplast trnL (UAA) sequences (trnL-P6 loop) from the sedimentary record of Lake Towuti (Sulawesi, Indonesia) to elucidate changes in regional tropical vegetation assemblages during the lake's Late Quaternary paleodepositional history. After the stringent removal of contaminants and sequence artifacts, taxonomic assignment of the remaining genuine trnL-P6 reads showed that native nitrogen-fixing legumes, C-3 grasses, and shallow wetland vegetation (Alocasia) were most strongly associated with >1-million-year-old (>1 Ma) peats and silts (114-98.8 m composite depth; mcd), which were deposited in a landscape of active river channels, shallow lakes, and peat-swamps. A statistically significant shift toward partly submerged shoreline vegetation that was likely rooted in anoxic muddy soils (i.e., peatland forest trees and wetland C-3 grasses (Oryzaceae) and nutrient-demanding aquatic herbs (presumably Oenanthe javanica)) occurred at 76 mcd (similar to 0.8 Ma), similar to 0.2 Ma after the transition into a permanent lake. This wetland vegetation was most strongly associated with diatom ooze (46-37 mcd), thought to be deposited during maximum nutrient availability and primary productivity. Herbs (Brassicaceae), trees/shrubs (Fabaceae and Theaceae), and C-3 grasses correlated with inorganic parameters, indicating increased drainage of ultramafic sediments and laterite soils from the lakes' catchment, particularly at times of inferred drying. Downcore variability in trnL-P6 from tropical forest trees (Toona), shady ground cover herbs (Zingiberaceae), and tree orchids (Luisia) most strongly correlated with sediments of a predominantly felsic signature considered to be originating from the catchment of the Loeha River draining into Lake Towuti during wetter climate conditions. However, the co-correlation with dry climate-adapted trees (i.e., Castanopsis or Lithocarpus) plus C-4 grasses suggests that increased precipitation seasonality also contributed to the increased drainage of felsic Loeha River sediments. This multiproxy approach shows that despite elevated in situ temperatures, tropical lake sediments potentially comprise long-term archives of ancient environmental DNA for reconstructing ecosystems, which warrants further exploration.

J	Frau, D; Gutierrez, MF				Frau, Diego; Gutierrez, Maria Florencia			Plankton Response to a Mix of Environmental Stressors	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Water ecosystems face enormous, variable anthropogenic stressors that contribute to water degradation. This study explores the effects of three substances frequently found in high concentrations in natural environments linked to agricultural areas on plankton abundance, composition, and trophic interactions. We conducted a microcosm experiment where we exposed a natural plankton assemblage to excess copper (Cu), atrazine (At), and dissolved organic matter (OM), along with a control group encompassing all possible treatment combinations. Each treatment was replicated three times (n = 24), and the experiment lasted 96 h. At the beginning and end of the experiment, relevant limnological variables, including inorganic dissolved nutrients, were measured. We used one-way ANOVA analyses with total abundances and species richness as response variables for data analysis. Results showed that the response of each plankton group to these substances was unequal, with some benefiting at tested concentrations. For example, Cu was beneficial for Chlorophyceae and Euglenophyceae, while CuOM was beneficial for Cyanobacteria and Cryptophyceae. Regarding zooplankton, Copepoda density was depleted in all treatments where stressors were combined and when exposed to OM compared to the control. When richness was considered, phytoplankton showed depletion in CuOMAt compared to OM and AtCu. No treatments affected zooplankton richness. Zooplankton:phytoplankton ratios showed significant effects for total zooplankton and Copepoda in all treatments compared to the control. These results indicate that the effects of contaminants on natural assemblages strongly depend on the plankton group and the combinations of contaminants, making predictions and extrapolations a challenging task that requires further study.					; Frau, Diego/V-2613-2019; Gutierrez, María Florencia/AFG-1766-2022	Frau, Diego/0000-0002-7000-8863; 													0049-6979	1573-2932				MAY	2024	235	5							316	10.1007/s11270-024-07117-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-024-07117-1													WOS:001216677600002

Predicting and evaluating seasonal water turbidity in Lake Balkhash, Kazakhstan, using remote sensing and GIS	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Lake Balkhash is Asia's third-largest lake and an endorheic basin. The lake and its contributing tributaries provide essential water and ecosystem services to the surrounding population, particularly in the Kazakh region. With approximately 2.5 million people living in the areas such as Almaty oblast, Zhetisu oblast, several districts of Karagandy oblast, and Abay province, monitoring and maintaining the lake's health and water quality is essential for the sustainable management of water resources. The hydrology of Lake Balkhash has been significantly impacted in recent decades by a warming climate, landuse landcover changes, and water-consuming economic activities, the latter of which are driven by population growth and expansion. Turbidity-the measurement of water clarity-serves as a major indicator of water health. Here, we analyze spatial and temporal variability in turbidity across Lake Balkhash by mapping the normalized difference turbidity index (NDTI) based on Landsat data for 1991-2022. We consider major exploratory variables such as precipitation, near-surface temperature, wind speed and direction, water level, and landuse landcover (LULC) within the catchment. We find an overall decrease in turbidity over interannual and seasonal timescales. We observe significant negative correlations between NDTI, near-surface temperature, and water level at both scales but no clear relationship between turbidity and precipitation or wind variables. Among the LULC variables, grassland and bareland near Lake Balkhash showed a positive correlation with NDTI but have spatially decreased over time. Conversely, shrubland and wetland exhibit a negative correlation with NDTI; however, this has spatially increased with time. Our results highlight the significant impact of rising temperatures, anthropogenically influenced water levels, and the LULC variables on turbidity. The turbidity dynamics, in turn, influence the circulation, oxidation, and overall health of Lake Balkhash's water. Therefore, the study emphasizes that the warming climate and alterations in the lake's hydrology have a considerable impact on water quality. This suggests that monitoring water health alone may not suffice to mitigate the impacts of climate change and human activities. However, a more comprehensive approach is needed to sustainably manage and conserve dryland water resources.

This study offers a new perspective on the quantitative assessment of glacier surface velocities and associated lake changes during six surges from 1968 to 2023 by using time-series imagery (Corona, Hexagon, Landsat), SRTM elevation maps, ITS_LIVE, unmanned aerial vehicles, local climate, and glacier surface elevation changes. Six turbulent periods (1968, 1973, 1977, 1989-1990, 2001, and 2011) were investigated, each lasting three years within a 10-11-year cycle. During inactive phases, a reduction in the thickness of the glacier tongue in the ablation zone occurred. During a surge in 2011, the flow accelerated, creating an ice dam and conditions for GLOF. Using these datasets, we reconstructed the process of the Medvezhiy glacier surge with high detail and identified a clear signal of uplift in the surface above the lower glacier tongue as well as a uniform increase in velocities associated with the onset of the surge. The increased activity of the Medvezhiy glacier and seasonal fluctuations in surface runoff are closely linked to climatic factors throughout the surge phase, and recent UAV observations indicate the absence of GLOFs in the glacier's channel. Comprehending the processes of glacier movements and related changes at a regional level is crucial for implementing more proactive measures and identifying appropriate strategies for mitigation.					; Qiu, Yubao/P-8103-2016; Lv, Mingyang/AAZ-7579-2021; Safarov, Mustafo/IUM-9687-2023; Li, Lanhai/AAE-9967-2020	Gulakhmadov, Aminjon/0000-0002-2366-2491; li, lan hai/0000-0003-4573-6284; Safarov, Mustafo/0009-0001-3521-0716; Kabutov, Khusrav/0000-0002-1653-1741; qiu, yu bao/0000-0003-1313-6313; 														2072-4292				MAY	2024	16	10							1730	10.3390/rs16101730	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs16101730													WOS:001233222300001

Distinct Reproductive Strategy of Two Endemic Amazonian Quillworts	DIVERSITY-BASEL												We examined the reproductive strategy of two Amazonian quillworts (Isoetes cangae and Isoetes serracarajensis), endemic and threatened species of canga ecosystems. Sexual propagation was examined by in vitro fertilization assays, while asexual propagation was examined by tiller emission. Isoetes cangae is an outcrossing species that reproduces exclusively by spore germination and is able to propagate by self- and cross-fertilization. Isoetes serracarajensis reproduces asexually by emitting tillers from the plant corm, despite producing male and female sporangia. These distinct reproductive strategies in the different species may be linked to their contrasting habitats. Isoetes cangae inhabit a permanent oligotrophic lake with mild environmental changes, while I. serracarajensis are found in temporary ponds facing severe seasonal drought, where asexual propagation may represent an adaptive advantage to the short growth period during access to water. We also observed different relationships between plant growth and reproductive traits between the species, despite their common production of sporophytes with high survival rates. Together, these results are of paramount importance for establishing conservation plans for both species considering the advantages of sexual propagation to maintain the genetic diversity of I. cangae and the diligent management required to do the same with asexually propagated I. serracarajensis.					; Gastauer, Markus/GMW-6022-2022; Oliveira, Guilherme/E-2624-2014; Frois Caldeira, Cecilio/O-7184-2018; ZANDONADI, DANIEL/AAI-6749-2020; Oliveira, Guilherme/JDC-8172-2023; Pupo Santos, Mirella/HII-3206-2022; Frois, Cecilio/HQZ-9386-2023; Gestinari, Lisia/MXL-7777-2025	Lopes, Arthur/0000-0001-7276-7831; Oliveira, Guilherme/0000-0003-0054-3438; Frois Caldeira, Cecilio/0000-0003-4762-3515; MARINO GOMES DOS SANTOS, FERNANDO/0000-0002-8458-735X; Martins, Rodrigo/0000-0001-8403-3990; Machado Schelk Gomes, Vinnicius/0000-0002-7417-1369; Rabelo, Joao/0000-0001-5923-3253; Pupo Santos, Mirella/0000-0001-9864-3677; Ferreira, Aline/0000-0001-9017-7819; Prado, Luis Alfredo/0000-0002-7368-7996														1424-2818				AUG	2021	13	8							348	10.3390/d13080348	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d13080348													WOS:000688855700001

This study investigated horizontal and vertical variations of electrical conductivity (EC), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) in a shallow polymictic lake. Monitoring of short-term variability of physical and chemical lake water parameters is a critical component in lake management, as it influences aquatic life. Based on the field research, maps of spatial distribution of the parameters were drawn. Using two methods: (1) a classical approach to water column measurements, from the top to the bottom (TB), in which the reference point is always a surface layer (SL), and (2) a newly introduced method of lake water quality monitoring based on a nearest neighbor (NN) approach; a comparison of higher and lower layers of the water column. By subtracting partial maps of spatial variability for different depths, final raster images were obtained. The NN method is rather absent in the limnology literature worldwide. Vertical and horizontal variability of the tested parameters in the polymictic, shallow Lake Bikcze (Poland) was presented in the results. In the presented paper, the commonly used TB method emphasized the role of the surface layer in shaping the variability of physicochemical parameters of lake waters. It shows a general trend of parameters' changes from the top, to the bottom. The newly presented NN method, which has a major advantage in its simplicity and objectivity, emphasized structural differentiation within the range of variability. The nearest neighbor method was more accurate in showing the actual structure of fluctuation of parameters with higher fluctuation in the water column. Its advantage is a detailed recognition of the vertical variability of selected parameters in the water column. The method may be used regardless of the lake depth, its location in climatic zone, and/or region.

J	Shrestha, S; Tachamo-Shah, RD; Doody, T; Cuddy, S; Shah, DN				Shrestha, Sunita; Tachamo-Shah, Ram Devi; Doody, Tanya; Cuddy, Susan; Shah, Deep Narayan			Establishing the relationship between benthic macroinvertebrates and water level fluctuation in subtropical shallow wetlands	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Wetland water level fluctuations often influence benthic macroinvertebrate communities through changes in water quality, substrate, and macrophytes and, hence, affect the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems. However, there is lack of understanding on how water level fluctuations affect the structure and composition of benthic macroinvertebrates in subtropical shallow wetlands in Nepal. Here, we assessed the changes in benthic macroinvertebrate community composition in response to water level fluctuations and identified indicator taxa sensitive to such fluctuations. A study was conducted over 4 seasons covering one annual cycle of water level fluctuation in 4 wetlands of Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve, Nepal. The study revealed that benthic macroinvertebrate composition significantly differed across water levels. Dissimilarities in macroinvertebrate community composition were mainly attributed by families Atyidae, Dytiscidae, Baetidae, Planorbidae, Chironomidae, Bithyniidae, Sphaeriidae, and Thiaridae. Taxon specific richness, densities, and biomass varied across the water levels while no difference was documented for overall family richness, density, and biomass. Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera richness decreased when water levels were low while Coleoptera and Diptera richness increased. Medium water level supported high benthic macroinvertebrate diversity. Indicator taxa analysis identified Coleoptera: Hydrophilidae and Dytiscidae, Hemiptera: Pleidae, Diptera: Muscidae and Mollusca: Sphaeriidae, Viviparidae, and Thiaridae, as indicators of low water level. Similarly, Coleoptera: Scirtidae, Hemiptera: Micronectidae and Oligochaeta: Tubificidae as indicators of medium water level, and Trichoptera: Polycentropodidae and Ephemeroptera: Caenidae as indicators of high water level. Redundancy analysis identified water level as one of the most influencing factors in benthic macroinvertebrate community variation. Considering the significant response of benthic macroinvertebrates to water level fluctuations, they are important as ecological indicators in research aimed at developing environmental flow frameworks. Indicator species are likely to be a vital tool in environmental impact assessment and monitoring in relation to hydrological development. The outcomes of this research have important implications to conservation and management of wetlands to preserve the valuable ecosystem functions provided by wetlands.					; doody, tanya/C-6890-2011; Cuddy, Susan/B-5788-2011; Doody, Tanya M/C-6890-2011; Shrestha, Sunita/MIN-1905-2025	Tachamo Shah, Ram Devi/0000-0002-1061-2903; Shah, Deep Narayan/0000-0001-8436-7560; Shrestha, Sunita/0000-0002-4510-8627; Doody, Tanya M/0000-0001-6359-5329; Cuddy, Susan/0000-0003-3905-9491													0167-6369	1573-2959				AUG	2021	193	8							534	10.1007/s10661-021-09225-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-09225-5								34327569					WOS:000691492000002

This study focused on hydraulic change show that drove the migration of P in an agricultural groundwater system, Jianghan Plain, Central China. Based on four rounds of field investigation over different seasons and across two consecutive years. Seasonable water table fluctuations (WLFs) reached 1.6 m and 3.8 m in GW and surface water (SW), respectively. Moreover, the concentrations of P in GW were obviously higher than those in SW where 54.1% of all GW samples presented higher content of P than the World Health Organization (WHO) limit of 0.4 mg/L with the highest one arriving to 1.97 mg/L. Although the trends and amplitudes varied at different points and depths, the spatial and temporal distribution of P corresponded with the local WLFs that were responsible for the enrichment of GW P. On the one hand, WLFs changed hydraulic conditions to enhance the migration of soluble P in the unsaturated zone into the aquifer. On the other hand, WLFs resulted in changes to the redox conditions or to the GW hydrochemical compositions, which promoted the dissolution of Fe or Mn containing P. These caused the release and enrichment of P in GW. Therefore, this study helps understand the geochemical cycling of P and improves GW management in the local GW system, Jianghan Plain.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				FEB	2023	30	8					21213	21224		10.1007/s11356-022-23618-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-23618-0		OCT 2022						36269473					WOS:000870948100007

Historical fire regimes of North American hemiboreal peatlands	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Peatlands contain one-third to one-half of global soil carbon, and disturbances, specifically fire, directly influence these carbon stocks. Despite this, historical variability of peatland fire regimes is largely unknown. This gap in knowledge partly stems from reconstructions of peatland fire regimes with methods limited to evaluating infrequent, severe fire events and not capturing frequent, low-severity events. Furthermore, variability in fire regimes is likely higher in heterogenous landscapes like the hemiboreal subzone, the transition between boreal and temperate biomes, where peatlands are embedded in landscapes including forests with high proportions of fire-dependent species, such as red pine (Pinus resinosa), that are well adapted to frequent low-severity fires. Here, we sought to evaluate the role of low- and moderate-severity fires within hemiboreal peatlands in central North America to better understand historical variability in fire regimes. We reconstructed historical fire regimes using fine-scale (temporal and spatial) dendrochronology methods to estimate frequency of low- and moderateseverity fires, identify synchronous fire events among forested uplands within and surrounding individual peatlands as well as among sites, and assess fire-climate relationships. We collected 220 cross-sections or partialtree sections within three poor fen peatlands across the Great Lakes Region. Using standard dendrochronological techniques, we crossdated 129 samples, assigning dates to 414 fire scars (128 unique fire years) comprising a 500-year tree-ring record (1520-2019). Prior to the mid-1900s, fire events were frequent and widespread within peatlands we evaluated, with mean fire return intervals (MFRI) ranging from 7 to 31 years. Fire events were also synchronous among forested uplands within and surrounding peatlands. Fires predominantly occurred in the dormant and latewood (growing season) positions and during regionally dry conditions corresponding to mild and moderate drought (Palmer Drought Severity Index >= -2.99) but interestingly not during regionally severe drought (Palmer Drought Severity Index <= -3.00). While large-scale, high-severity fires are important to the ecology of peatlands and to changing climate-fire interactions, our results suggest that widespread low- to moderate-severity fires were historically frequent in hemiboreal peatlands and likely central to their development and maintenance. Evaluating whether peatlands will continue to be carbon sinks or become carbon sources due to climate change requires an understanding of the inherent variability in fire regimes, especially in hemiboreal systems.					; Radeloff, Volker/B-6124-2016	Sutheimer, Colleen M./0000-0003-3211-3491; Radeloff, Volker/0000-0001-9004-221X													0378-1127	1872-7042				OCT 15	2021	498								119561	10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119561	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119561		JUL 2021											WOS:000686595900003
J	Wu, JF; Yao, HX				Wu, Jiefeng; Yao, Huaxia			Simulating dissolved organic carbon during dryness/wetness periods based on hydrological characteristics under multiple timescales	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Understanding and simulating dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations is a challenge with important implications for water quality projections and carbon balance estimates, particularly at the event-scale. Hy-drological dryness/wetness represents water shortage/surplus in surface water. Previous studies have analyzed the dynamic patterns of DOC concentrations during either dryness or wetness (or rewetting) periods. However, the dynamic patterns of DOC concentrations and corresponding simulations during both dryness and wetness events, based on their characteristics (i.e., duration and severity), remain to be fully understood, particularly under multiple timescales. This study proposed a framework to help overcome this limitation. The standardized streamflow index (SSI) combined with run theory was used to describe the dryness/wetness characteristics at the monthly, seasonal, and annual scales. Simulation models were constructed and validated based on the multi -variable linear regression model and cross-validation method. Three evaluation indicators, namely, the coeffi-cient of determination (R-2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE, %), were employed to determine the optimal model. This model was then applied to additional basins based on the correction coefficient method. Three nearby basins (HP3a, HP4, and HP6), with different catchment areas (9.28 to 122.80 ha) and long-term (41 years) daily streamflow and weekly (or biweekly) DOC measurements in the Harp Lake catchment, south-central Ontario, Canada, were used to demonstrate the usefulness of the framework. Data from HP3a was used to construct and validate the simulation model, and the model was applied to the HP4 and HP6 basins. Results show that the average DOC concentration during the dryness events is lower than that in the wetness events at the monthly, seasonal, and annual scales. The average, maximum, and minimum DOC concentrations during the dryness events increased with the dryness/wetness index timescales, but decreased during the wetness events. The optimal model was able to accurately simulate the DOC concentrations (R-2 >= 0.90, NSE >= 0.90, and MAPE <= 10 %) at the monthly, seasonal, and annual scales based on the hydrological characteristics during the dryness and wetness periods, respectively, and the application results exhibit a good performance. The proposed framework can help improve the forecasting of DOC concentrations and the corre-sponding ecological coping strategies at the event-scale under changing environments.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				NOV	2022	614		A						128534	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.128534	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.128534		OCT 2022											WOS:000916980800004

Lake temperature and external forcing were measured during contrasting hydrological periods modulated by severe cold (2011-2012) and warm (2015-2016) phases of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a major driver of Andes hydrology. The seasonal heat budget of the reservoir was driven by the competing rates of cooling by the inflow and heating through the surface. As the atmospheric heating rate remained roughly constant, the seasonality of the river inflow heat flux drove the seasonal reservoir temperature. The inflow also intervened on the heat transport within the reservoir and, during dry periods, mixed heat downward from the surface layer and introduced heat at intermediate depths such that a thick metalimnion formed that brought the V2H1 mode into resonance with the diurnal wind forcing. During wet periods, the inflow compressed and cooled the metalimnion, tuning the V1H1 mode to resonate with the diurnal wind. It was also observed that large inflows destroyed temporarily coherent basin-scale internal wave motions. Because of the dominant role of the inflow on the seasonal reservoir temperature, changes within the reservoir will be more strongly related to changing temperature and volume of the incoming water than atmospheric forcing as in many large natural lakes.

J	Smith, A; Smokorowski, K; Marty, J; Power, M				Smith, Adrienne; Smokorowski, Karen; Marty, Jerome; Power, Michael			Stable isotope characterization of Rainy River, Ontario, lake sturgeon diet and trophic position	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) are considered threatened and many populations have declined since the early 1890s. Limited food web studies have been conducted with lacustrine lake sturgeon populations while similar studies do not exist for riverine populations. We use stable isotope analysis to study the diet composition of lake sturgeon captured in the Rainy River, Ontario. Historical reports of lake sturgeon consumption of fish and fish eggs exist, but both prey have largely been considered as a minor contribution to the overall diet of lake sturgeon. More recent dietary studies have focused on juvenile sturgeon and report low or no incidence of fish or fish eggs in lake sturgeon diets. The results of the stable isotope studies of Rainy River lake sturgeon suggest they obtain a large portion of their energy from organic material derived directly or indirectly from fish. Results parallel those recently reported for adult sturgeon in Lake Winnebago, Wisconsin, and are important in the context of contributing modem technical verification to earlier historical reports of fish and fish eggs in lake sturgeon diets. The results of this study provide evidence of potential seasonal or temporal shifts in lake sturgeon diet and further evidence to the potential shift in resource use based on life stage. Estimates of isotopic niches for the Rainy River sturgeon establish an important baseline for future changes in food web structure that might accompany the introduction of invasive species or the addition of anthropogenic stressors that could have implications for lake sturgeon conservation.

J	Chen, ZY; Li, JF; Shen, HT; Wang, ZH				Chen, ZY; Li, JF; Shen, HT; Wang, ZH			Yangtze River of China: historical analysis of discharge variability and sediment flux	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Hydrological records (covering a 100-year period) from the upper, middle and lower Yangtze River were collected to examine the temporal and spatial distribution of discharge and sediment load in the drainage basin. The Yangtze discharge, as expected, increases from the upper drainage basin downstream. Only an estimated 50% of the discharge is derived from the upper Yangtze, with the rest being derived from the numerous tributaries of the middle and lower course. However, the distribution of sediment load along the Yangtze is the reverse of that observed for discharge, with most of the sediment being derived from the upper basin. A dramatic reduction in sediment load (by similar to 0.8 X 10(8) tons/year) occurs in the middle Yangtze because of a marked decrease in slope and the change to a meandering pattern from the upper Yangtze rock sections. Considerable siltation also occurs in the middle Yangtze drainage basin as the river cuts through a large interior Dongting Lake system. Sediment load in the lower Yangtze, while significantly less than that of the upper river, is somewhat higher than the middle Yangtze because of additional load contributed by adjacent tributaries. A strong correlation exists between the discharge and sediment load along the Yangtze drainage basin during the dry season as lower flows carry lower sediment concentration. During the wet season, a strong correlation is also present in the upper Yangtze owing to the high flow velocity that suspends sand on the bed. However, a negative to poor correlation occurs in the middle and lower Yangtze because the flow velocity in these reaches is unable to keep sand in suspension, transporting only fine-grained particles downstream. Hydrological data are treated for 30 years (1950-1980), when numerous dams were constructed in the upper Yangtze drainage basin. At Yichang and Hankou hydrological stations, records revealed a decreasing trend in annual sediment load, along with slightly reduced annual discharge at the same stations. This can be interpreted as the result of water diversion primarily for agriculture. Sediment load at Datong further downstream is quite stable, and not influenced by slightly reduced discharge. Furthermore, sediment concentration at the three hydrological stations increased, which can be attributed to sediment loss in association with intensifying human activity, especially in the upper drainage basin, such as deforestation and construction of numerous dams. Mean monthly sediment load of these 30 years pulses about 2 months behind discharge, implying dam-released sediment transport along the entire river basin during the high water stage.

Comparing with those in the reference sites, local habitat variables were significantly altered by low-head dams in the treatment sites, involving wider channel (only in the impoundment area), deeper water and slower flow. Fish species richness varied significantly across seasons, not across site categories, suggesting that these low-head dams did not alter species richness. However, significant decreases in fish abundance and density were observed in the impoundment areas immediately upstream of dams, but not in the plunge areas downstream. Fish assemblage structures kept relative stability across seasons, and their significant difference between-site was only observed between the impoundment areas and the sites far from dams upstream. This variation in assemblage structures was due to the differing relative abundance of some co-occurring species; more lentic but less lotic fish was observed in the impoundment areas. The spatial and temporal patterns of fish assemblages were correlated with local habitat in this study area. Wetted width had negative correlation with fish species richness, abundance and density, respectively. Water temperature also positively affected species richness. In addition, wetted width, water depth, current velocity and substrate were the important habitat variables influencing assemblage structures. Our results suggested that, by modifying local habitat characteristics, low-head dams altered fish abundance and density in the impoundment areas immediately upstream of dam, not in the plunge areas immediately downstream, and thereby influenced fish assemblage structures in these stream segments.

J	Lin, ZY; Lim, JY; Oh, JM				Lin, ZiYu; Lim, Juin Yau; Oh, Jong-Min			Innovative interpretable AI-guided water quality evaluation with risk adversarial analysis in river streams considering spatial-temporal effects	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Water security remains a critical issue given the looming threats of industrial pollution, necessitating comprehensive assessments of water quality to address seasonal fluctuations and influential factors while formulating effective strategies for decision makers. This study introduces a novel approach for evaluating water quality within a complex riverine zone in South Korea: Han River that encompasses five river streams situated at each junction of North and South streams (including Gyeongan Stream) that ultimately leading towards Paldang Lake. By utilizing the monthly water characteristic data from the year 2013-2022 across 14 different locations, the significant seasonal trends and potential influences on water quality are identified. The water quality here is calculated with the proposed method of sub-index water quality index (s-WQI). A combinatorial prediction approach of s-WQI for each location is conducted through a collective of data preprocessing approaches including Hampel filtering and feature selection in prior to the machine learning predictions. In return, light gradient boosting (LGB) is the most accurate predictor by outperforming other prediction algorithms, especially through LGB-Pearson and LGB-Spearman combinations for North and South stream intersections, and LGBPearson for Paldang Lake. To further evaluate the robustness of this evaluation and extending the results to a foreseeable scenario, a seasonal based Monte-Carlo Simulation with 10,000 attempts targeting the water characteristic distributions obtained from each location considered are carried out to identify the risk bounds within. The results are further interpreted with SHAP analysis on identifying the contributions of each water characteristics towards the water quality through local and global spectrum. This research yields practical implications, offering tailored strategies for water quality enhancement and early warning systems. The integration of AI-based prediction and feature selection underscores the transformative potential of computational techniques in advancing data-driven water quality assessments, shaping the future of environmental science research.

Disrupted seasonal clockwork in the population dynamics of a freshwater copepod by climate warming	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Life history responses are expected to accompany climate warming, yet little is known how long-term effects of climate and environmental change affect the seasonal dynamics of planktonic organisms. We used an historical data set from Lake Washington (U.S.A.) to quantify population responses of a calanoid copepod (Leptodiaptomus ashlandi) to long-term changes in temperature and resource availability and explore potential mechanisms for the responses. Increasing water temperatures (annual mean increase of 1.5 degrees C in the upper 10-m water volume) and longer stratification periods (about 4 weeks) were observed between 1962 and 2005, coincident with a pronounced decline in Leptodiaptomus densities. However, production was maintained because of an increase in the production to biomass ratio and a life cycle shift in Leptodiaptomus from an annual to a 6-month cycle. Cross-wavelet analyses demonstrated that the annual thermal forcing of copepod recruitment observed during the first two decades of the study weakened substantially, leading to more stochastic population dynamics during the past two decades. This shift from one to two generations per year was most likely produced by a longer and warmer growing period combined with changing fluctuations in resource (phytoplankton) availability. Climate change can lead to higher-frequency voltinism in ectothermic organisms and to temporal reorganization of their population dynamics.

In the Amazon basin, several piranha species (Serrasalmidae) co-occur in floodplain lakes, providing a model to understand how similar species manage coexisting. We employed a combination of classic and molecular stomach contents analysis, and stable isotope analysis to evaluate the use of resources and isotopic niche breadth among three co-occurring piranha species (Serrasalmus altispinis, S. maculatus, and Pygocentrus nattereri), and the influence of the hydrological cycle (low vs. high water) in resources partitioning. A higher diversity of prey and lower isotopic niches was found during low water, likely due to prey concentration. Cannibalism occurred in all three species, and although piscivores, these species feed on different trophic levels, with P. nattereri consuming omnivores, S. maculatus detritivores, and S. altispinis herbivores. Coexistence was mediated by changes in resource availability associated with the hydrologic cycle. Trophic niche overlap was higher during the high water compared to low waters due to high prey availability when lakes connect to river channels and floodplain forests. Here, we identified strategies used by piranhas to avoid competition under different environmental conditions. Understanding species interactions is fundamental to managing biodiversity conservation in a changing world.					; Possamai, Bianca/AAD-1075-2022; Freitas, Carlos/I-5386-2012; Possamai, Bianca/D-2344-2019; Siqueira-Souza, Flavia/LZH-0578-2025; da Silva Batista, Jacqueline/AAD-4349-2020; Freitas, Carlos/F-1752-2014; Hoeinghaus, David/A-3190-2008	Souza, Flavia/0000-0002-8723-8956; Possamai, Bianca/0000-0003-0596-3597; Hoeinghaus, David/0000-0003-0363-8723; Freitas, Carlos/0000-0001-5406-0998; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				OCT	2024	851	18					4325	4340		10.1007/s10750-024-05536-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-024-05536-z		APR 2024											WOS:001207044600002

Affected mainly by the various anthropogenic activities in this region, its population decreased dramatically in the past two decades. To protect this animal from extinction, captive breeding program is an important way to provide basic knowledge for wild population conservation. Non-invasive fecal steroid radioimmunoassay technique was validated in three captive Yangtze finless porpoises for the first time in this study. The seasonality of one captive male and the reproductive status of two females were investigated by longitudinal monitoring their fecal reproductive steroid hormone metabolites. Pregnancy could be diagnosed by an abrupt increase in fecal progesterone metabolites. In late pregnancy (4 months before birth), a significant decrease of fecal progesterone metabolites was observed, which might be referenced for the expectation of parturition date. Seven estrous cycles were recognized in one breeding season of a non-pregnant female judged by the variation of fecal progesterone metabolite levels. The fecal progesterone metabolite level was proved a reliable and precise indicator for estrus and pregnancy diagnosis.					; Nabi, Ghulam/AGQ-2183-2022	Nabi, Ghulam/0000-0001-5256-0083; 													1664-2392					SEP 4	2019	10								606	10.3389/fendo.2019.00606	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2019.00606								31551933					WOS:000483738400001

Cryosphere: ice on Niwot Ridge and in the Green Lakes Valley, Colorado Front Range	PLANT ECOLOGY & DIVERSITY												Background: Subsurface ice preserved as ice lenses and within rock glaciers as well as glacial and lake ice provides sensitive indicators of climate change and serve as a late-season source of meltwater. Aims: We synthesise the results of geomorphological, geophysical and geochemical studies during the period of 1995-2014, building on a long history of earlier work focused on ice and permafrost studies on Niwot Ridge and the adjacent Green Lakes Valley (GLV), which is part of the Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research Site. Methods: These studies are discussed in the context of how bodies of ice and rock glaciers reflect changing local climate. We review recent results from geophysical investigations (resistivity, seismic refraction and ground-penetrating radar) of the shallow subsurface, ongoing monitoring of the Arikaree Glacier, three rock glaciers and lake ice in the GLV, and interpretations of how subsurface ice melt regulates the flow and chemistry of alpine surface water after seasonal snowfields melt. Results and conclusions: Permafrost conditions reported from Niwot Ridge in the 1970s are generally absent today, but ice lenses form and melt seasonally. Ice is present permanently within the Green Lakes 5 rock glacier and at nearby favourable sites. The Arikaree Glacier has shown a marked decline in cumulative mass balance during the past 12years after a 30-year period when net mass balance was ca. 0. Duration of seasonal lake ice increases with elevation in GLV, but duration has decreased at all seven lakes that have been monitored during the last three decades. This decrease has been most marked at the lowest elevation where it amounted to a reduction of about 1dyear(-1) and least at Green Lake 5 where the loss has been at a rate of 0.5dyear(-1). Surface temperature measurements from rock glaciers have not shown strong trends during the past 15years. It has been suggested that almost all of the 2.5-mmyear(-1) increase in stream discharge from the upper GLV in September and October has been derived from melting of subsurface ice.

J	Balestrini, R; Polesello, S; Sacchi, E				Balestrini, Raffaella; Polesello, Stefano; Sacchi, Elisa			Chemistry and isotopic composition of precipitation and surface waters in Khumbu valley (Nepal Himalaya): N dynamics of high elevation basins	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												We monitored the chemical and isotopic compositions of wet depositions, at the Pyramid International Laboratory (5050 m a.s.l.), and surrounding surface waters, in the Khumbu basin, to understand precipitation chemistry and to obtain insights regarding ecosystem responses to atmospheric inputs. The major cations in the precipitation were NH4+ and Ca2+, whereas the main anion was HCO3-, which constituted approximately 69% of the anions, followed by NO3-, SO42- and Cl-. Data analysis suggested that Na+, Cl- and K+ were derived from the long-range transport of marine aerosols. Ca2+, Mg2+ and HCO3- were related to rock and soil dust contributions and the NO3- and SO42- concentrations were derived from anthropogenic sources. Furthermore, NH4+ was derived from gaseous NH3 scavenging. The isotopic composition of weekly precipitation ranged from -1.9 to -23.2% in delta O-18, and from -0.8 to -174% in delta H-2, with depleted values characterizing the central part of the monsoon period. The chemical composition of the stream water was dominated by calcite and/or gypsum dissolution. However, the isotopic composition of the stream water did not fully reflect the composition of the monsoon precipitation, which suggested that other water sources contributed to the stream flow. Precipitation contents for all ions were the lowest ones among those measured in high elevation sites around the world. During the monsoon periods the depositions were not substantially influenced by anthropogenic inputs, while in pre- and post-monsoon seasons the Himalayas could not represent an effective barrier for airborne pollution. In the late monsoon phase, the increase of ionic contents in precipitation could also be due to a change in the moisture source. The calculated atmospheric N load (0.30 kg ha(-1) y(-1)) was considerably lower than the levels that were measured in other high-altitude environments. Nevertheless, the NO3- concentrations in the surface waters (from 2 to 17 mu eg L-1) were greater than expected based on the low N inputs from wet deposition.(C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Effect of seasonal variations on the surface sediment heavy metal enrichment of a lake in South India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Environmental effects due to continuous accumulation of hazardous materials like heavy metals in the surface sediments of lake systems can stress fragile ecosystems. Elucidating the mechanisms influencing the concentration and distribution of heavy metals becomes vital in formulating lake management strategies to preserve the quality of the water environment. Studying of the effect of seasonal variations on surface sediments will help in understanding the different factors and sources contributing and diluting these persistent pollutants. In this study, heavy metal pollution in a tropical shallow lake (Akkulam-Veli) in South India was investigated by monitoring the seasonal variations of heavy metals and major elements in surface sediments. The metallic pollutants (Cr, Ni, Co, Cu, Zn, Pb, Fe, and Mn) and major elements (Si, Ti, Al, Ca, Mg, Na, K, and P (measured as oxides) in the surface sediments of this lake were monitored during four consecutive seasons. The results were subjected to correlation analysis and principal component analysis to study the interrelationships of different parameters as well to determine the possible origin of pollutants. Although metal concentrations were found to be unaffected by seasonal variations, the factors contributing to occurrence of these heavy metals were found to be affected by seasonal fluctuations.

Spatial and temporal variability in stream dissolved organic carbon quantity and quality in an Adirondack forested catchment	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) quantity and quality in streams regulate many ecosystem processes at the watershed scale. There is, however, a dearth of information on the spatial variability of in-stream DOC quality in small catchments. Our study used direct DOC concentration measurements and fluorescence spectroscopy indices to determine how stream DOC quantity and quality changed over space and time in a forested catchment of the US Northeast, and provided insight into how these systems might respond to changes in land use and/or climate in the coming years. Land cover (e. g., wetlands, lakes) exerted a dominant role over changes in flow and/or air temperature at regulating DOC concentrations in the watershed. Wetland areas acted as large sources of humic-rich DOC, while lakes were DOC sinks, especially for humic-rich DOC. DOC quality indices were generally significantly (p < 0.05) correlated to DOC concentrations regardless of location and time of year, with high DOC concentrations (> 7 mg C L-1) primarily tied to the mobilization of terrestrial highly degraded humic rich DOC, likely to be less bioavailable (and less fresh) than the DOC exported at times when DOC concentrations are low (< 7 mg C L (-1)). Overall, results pointed to a two-phase DOC export whereby mobile and bioavailable fractions of DOC in surface water (protein-like DOC) are produced throughout the watershed (including the wetland), while recalcitrant humic-like DOC fractions are predominantly generated by the wetland, before preferentially sedimenting out in the lake. As the climate continues to change, we will likely find not only an increase in the amount of DOC exported at the watershed scale, but also a shift in the quality of this DOC toward less bioavailable DOC fractions rich in humic substances.

J	Grunert, P; Harzhauser, M; Rosenthal, Y; Carnevale, G				Grunert, Patrick; Harzhauser, Mathias; Rosenthal, Yair; Carnevale, Giorgio			Estuarine Lago Mare fauna from the Tertiary Piedmont Basin indicates episodic Atlantic/Mediterranean exchange during the final stage of the Mediterranean Salinity Crisis	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The geochemical signature of fossils from Lago Mare deposits at Moncucco Torinese (NW Italy) indicates a temporary marine ingression into the Tertiary Piedmont Basin just before the Miocene/Pliocene boundary. Isotope (delta O-18, delta C-13, Sr-87/Sr-86) and trace element (Sr/Ca, Ba/Ca) data from mollusk shells of multiple species and croaker otoliths indicate an upper estuarine environment with considerable seasonal variability in evaporation and freshwater input. Reconstructed salinities < 10 psu and low Sr-87/Sr-86 values indicate the close proximity of a watershed draining off of Mesozoic ophiolites and carbonates of the Alps and/or Apennines. Communication with an open marine environment is supported by otoliths of fully marine fishes such as lanternfishes, codlets, and slimeheads found in the same assemblage that carry a euhaline signature close to open ocean values. A thorough taphonomic evaluation renders reworking of the otoliths from pre-evaporitic deposits unlikely; instead we explain their presence in the Lago Mare assemblage as related to large predatory marine fish that periodically migrated into marginal marine and estuarine environments. The presence of a paralic paleobiotope with thalassogenic water in the Tertiary Piedmont Basin contradicts ideas of the Mediterranean as a brackish lake fed by the Paratethys during the latest stage of the Mediterranean Salinity Crisis. Instead, our data support previous notions of temporary Atlantic/Mediterranean exchange during sea-level highstands preceding the permanent re-connection at the Miocene/Pliocene transition. The establishment of short-lived and disjunct estuarine and lagoonal environments such as in the Tertiary Piedmont Basin during marine ingressions also puts highly variable Sr-87/Sr-86 values and occurrences of shallow water benthic foraminifera in Lago Mare deposits of other Mediterranean basins into a new perspective.

J	Zarczynski, M; Zander, PD; Grosjean, M; Tylmann, W				Zarczynski, Maurycy; Zander, Paul D.; Grosjean, Martin; Tylmann, Wojciech			Linking the formation of varves in a eutrophic temperate lake to meteorological conditions and water column dynamics	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Despite varved sediments being widely used for paleolimnological studies, little information is available about how climate and meteorological signals are recorded in varves at sub-seasonal to annual scale. We investigate links between meteorological and limnological conditions and their influence on biochemical varve formation and preservation of sub-seasonal climate signals in the sediments. Our study site is postglacial Lake Zabinskie located in NE Poland, in which thick and complex varved sediments have been studied for the last decade. These sediments provide an excellent material for studying the influence of short-term weather conditions on geological records. For this, we use an almost decade-long (2012-2019) series of observational data (meteorological conditions, physicochemical water parameters, and modern sedimentation observations) to understand varve formation processes. Then we compare these results with a high-resolution biogeochemical proxy dataset based on mu XRF and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) measurements of a varved sediment core spanning the same period. Here we show direct links between the meteorological and limnological conditions and varve formation processes. This is particularly the case for air temperature which governs calcite laminae formation and primary production. We further show that calcite grain size is influenced by lake mixing intensity resulting from the wind activity, and that holomixis events lead to the formation of distinct manganese (Mn) peaks in the typically anoxic sediments. Our findings show that high-resolution non-destructive spectroscopy methods applied to complex biochemical varves, in combination with long observational limnological datasets, provide useful information for tracking meteorological and limnological processes in the past.

We investigated habitats at various depths and the macrobenthic communities; samples were collected by scuba divers. Although rush and submerged vegetation in the subsaline pit lake was abundant and provided potentially good habitat conditions for mayflies, caddisflies, coleopterans, or damselflies, the native insects were scarce. The taxa do not have many representatives in waters with elevated salinity, so those present in the Machow pit lake were mainly euryhaline species. Chironomids were the most abundant macroinvertebrates in shallower zones, whereas non-native zebra mussels were the quantitatively dominant taxon in deep-water zones. Moreover, these non-native mussels were the dominant biomass of invertebrates at all sites in all seasons. The current composition of the invertebrate assemblage was probably primarily determined by the salinated water, which limited the abundance of native species and gave non-native species an edge.					; Kukuła, Krzysztof/IVH-4929-2023; Bylak, Aneta/JWP-7997-2024	Kukula, Krzysztof/0000-0002-9685-7994; Bylak, Aneta/0000-0002-7617-5814; Kukula, Ewa/0000-0001-7780-6561													1025-9112	1616-1068				SEP	2019	38	3					536	550		10.1007/s10230-019-00624-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10230-019-00624-2													WOS:000484535700008
J	Cui, Z; Huang, JC; Tian, F; Gao, JF				Cui, Zhen; Huang, Jiacong; Tian, Feng; Gao, Junfeng			Modeling the response of river nutrient conditions to land use changes in lowland artificial watersheds (polders)	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Excess nutrient export from lowland artificial watersheds (polders) led to severe eutrophication and harmful algal blooms of their surrounding rivers and lakes. Taking River Zhong in Lake Taihu basin as the study area, this study attempted to quantify the impacts of polders' land use changes on river nutrient conditions. A Nitrogen (N) Dynamic Polder model and a Phosphorus (P) Dynamic Polder model was used to estimate N and P export from lowland polders in the context of land use change. The investigation results showed that N and P contribution to River Zhong increased by 7-30% in case that 30% of agricultural lands (paddy lands or dry lands) were changed into residential areas. In case that 30% agricultural lands were changed into water areas, N and P contribution can be decreased by 6% and 35%, respectively. Fertilization period especially during rainy season (from June to August) were the hot moments of nutrient loss, accounted for above 50%. Infiltration was the main pathway of N and P export from polders, accounting for more than 60%. Therefore, from management perspective, we argued controlling urban areas, maintaining water areas and controlling fertilization for polders could be potential strategies for reducing river nutrient concentration in River Zhong.

Despite the increasing understanding of metabolic processes in tropical lakes, our knowledge on how morphometric and catchment characteristics affect metabolic responses to those changes in tropical lakes is still very scarce. We investigated how metabolic rates in the upper mixed layer of twelve Brazilian tropical lakes responded to reduced rainfall, considering their lake area and drainage area ratio and the percentage of native forest cover in their drainage area. An 80% reduction in the 2013 rainy season rainfall, compared with 2012, resulted in a reduction of approximated 1 m in the water column depth, a 1-2 m deepening of the upper mixed layer, a 50% reduction in mean light availability, and a doubling in total phosphorus concentrations. These changes were associated with 38% increases in gross primary production (GPP), stimulated by higher nutrient concentrations and reduced photoinhibition. These effects of reduced rainfall were strongest in lakes with a small volume in relation to their catchment areas. Our results show that climatic-related reductions in precipitation in this tropical region will reduce lake volumes, affect temperature, water mixing, and nutrient supply with pronounced effects on lake metabolic processes and carbon cycling in this region.

The present work deals with the study on the actual water quality monitoring data obtained from the Miju River monitoring sections in the Erhai Lake during 2011-2016. Six water quality indicators were selected for investigation using the comprehensive pollution index method and the principal component analysis method, in order to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of water quality in the Miju River Basin. The results of the comprehensive pollution index method showed that the water quality of the Miju River has not changed much in the past 6 years, and the water body has only been slightly polluted. Additionally, the water quality of the Jiangweiqiao section was slightly inferior to that of the Yinqiaocun section. Principal component analysis method showed that the nitrogen pollution was the dominant factor in the wet season, followed by phosphorus, pH and dissolved oxygen. In the normal season, the dissolved oxygen and pH of the water were the main factors, followed by phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen. In the dry season, the dissolved oxygen, ammonia nitrogen and organic matter pollution were the main influencing factors followed by phosphorus and pH. The water quality of the Miju River in the past 3 years was slightly worse than that in the initial 3 years, and the overall performance of the water quality of the Miju River was relatively best during the dry season followed by the normal season, while the water quality was worst during the wet season. Furthermore, the water quality variation trends of Yinqiaocun and the Jiangweiqiao sections were observed to be similar.																			0749-0208	1551-5036				FAL	2019					93		31	38		10.2112/SI93-005.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2112/SI93-005.1													WOS:000487997100006

Escherichia coli (E. coli) distribution in the Lake Malawi nearshore zone	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Residents along the shoreline of lake Malawi depend on nearshore water for drinking, cooking, and bathing. Despite the importance of clean nearshore waters to public health, we are aware of no published studies of shoreline water quality in the lake. To address this gap, we explore seasonal and temporal trends of the fecal indicator bacteria Escherichia coli (E. coli) in nearshore water and sand. E. coli concentrations in sand ranged from 0 to 17,600 colony forming units (CFU)/100 ml, and in water concentrations ranged from 0 to 21,200 CFU/100 ml. Fifty-three percent of water samples exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Recreational Water Quality Criteria of 126 CFU/100 ml, and 90% exceeded the World Health Organization drinking water standard of 0 CFU/100 ml. Distance from shore was the variable most predictive of E. coli concentration, with the level of beach use also playing a significant role. At 15 m from the shore, E. coli concentrations dropped to between 0.3% and 17% of shoreline values. Results suggest that the collection of water at distances >15 m from the beach could substantially decrease exposure to fecal bacteria. Further studies are needed to identify sources of fecal pollution and to determine the utility of E. coli as a predictor of the potential for waterborne disease.

Lateral migration of fish between an oxbow lake and an Amazonian headwater river	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												We report on lateral movements of fish between an Amazonian headwater river (Manu River in Manu National Park, Peru) and a 24-ha oxbow lake (Cocha Cashu) in the adjacent floodplain. During wet season flood pulses, or 'crecientes,' fish can enter and exit the lake through a connecting channel that is normally dry. To investigate fish movements, we operated a bi-directional funnel trap in the connecting channel during high water interludes. We captured 4090 fish of 60 species during the 2005 and 2006 rainy seasons and sub-sampled the adults for gonadal state and stomach contents. We found that most exiting fish were gravid and that most entering fish had recently spawned, suggesting that fish were leaving the lake to spawn in the river or elsewhere. Entering fish had full stomachs more often than exiting fish and entering and exiting individuals of most species were of similar size.					; Andrade, H./G-8245-2016	Ortega, Hernan/0000-0002-4396-2598; Davenport, Lisa Clare/0000-0002-2573-1622; Quispe Chuquihuamani, Roberto Sabino/0000-0002-4143-6295													0906-6691	1600-0633				DEC	2011	20	4					619	627		10.1111/j.1600-0633.2011.00511.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2011.00511.x													WOS:000296448500014

Stable isotope analysis of benthic fauna and their food sources in boreal lakes	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY												The origin of organic C supporting zoobenthic communities in 8 boreal lakes with different concentrations of dissolved organic C (DOC) was assessed by stable-isotope analysis. Profundal zoobenthos was depleted in C-13 compared to littoral zoobenthos, and this difference increased with decreasing DOC concentration. The delta C-13 of littoral zoobenthos suggested reliance on benthic algae, whereas depleted C-13 of profundal zoobenthos could be explained by contributions from allochthonous and autochthonous C sources. In deeper lakes, profundal zoobenthos diets also included C processed by methanotrophic bacteria. Littoral zoobenthos delta C-13 decreased with increasing DOC concentration in the lake water. Our results suggest that littoral benthic fauna are mainly supported by benthic algae in low-DOC lakes and by phytoplankton and allochthonous organic C in high-DOC lakes and that this difference is a result of light absorbance and energy supply by allochthonous organic C. Increasing allochthonous DOC inputs, as expected in a warmer and wetter climate, might reduce benthic algal production and alter the organic C base for benthic food webs in lake ecosystems.

J	Kataoka, T; Kondo, R				Kataoka, Takafumi; Kondo, Ryuji			Protistan community composition in anoxic sediments from three salinity-disparate Japanese lakes	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Community composition patterns of benthic protists were investigated in salinity-disparate lakes, including a coastal saline lake (Lake Hiruga), a brackish lake (Lake Suigetsu) and a freshwater lake (Lake Biwa). Samples were collected from the surface layer of anoxic sediment (0-5 cm depth horizon) at each lake; two sets of samples were collected 2 months apart. Sequences of 18S rRNA genes were analysed using high throughput sequencing. We obtained 63,619-389,041 sequences per sample, resulting in 4,331 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on 98% similarity. Cluster analysis showed that the community structures between seasons in each lake were similar, while there were marked differences among lakes. Other than photosynthetic organisms, Metazoa and Fungi, 3,018 (70%), 1,132 (26%) and 391 (9%) of protistan OTUs were obtained from lakes Biwa, Hiruga and Suigetsu, respectively. Taxonomic analysis showed 23 OTUs (5.3%) were common to the three lakes, and were composed of 19 Alveolata-, three Stramenopiles- and one unclassified-related taxa. Our results suggest that salinity is an important environmental variable that determines community composition of protists in anoxic sediments in lakes.																			0272-7714	1096-0015				AUG 31	2019	224						34	42		10.1016/j.ecss.2019.04.046	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2019.04.046													WOS:000472813500004

Paleohydrology on Mars constrained by mass balance and mineralogy of pre-Amazonian sodium chloride lakes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS												Chloride-bearing deposits on Mars record high-elevation lakes during the waning stages of Mars' wet era (mid-Noachian to late Hesperian). The water source pathways, seasonality, salinity, depth, lifetime, and paleoclimatic drivers of these widespread lakes are all unknown. Here we combine reaction-transport modeling, orbital spectroscopy, and new volume estimates from high-resolution digital terrain models, in order to constrain the hydrologic boundary conditions for forming the chlorides. Considering a T = 0 degrees C system, we find that (1) individual lakes were > 100 m deep and lasted decades or longer; (2) if volcanic degassing was the source of chlorine, then the water-to-rock ratio or the total water volume were probably low, consistent with brief excursions above the melting point and/or arid climate; (3) if the chlorine source was igneous chlorapatite, then Cl-leaching events would require a (cumulative) time of > 10 years at the melting point; and (4) Cl masses, divided by catchment area, give column densities 0.1-50 kg Cl/m(2), and these column densities bracket the expected chlorapatite-Cl content for a seasonally warm active layer. Deep groundwater was not required. Taken together, our results are consistent with Mars having a usually cold, horizontally segregated hydrosphere by the time chlorides formed.					; Melwani, Mohit/AAM-4901-2021	Melwani Daswani, Mohit/0000-0002-4611-3209; 													2169-9097	2169-9100				SEP	2017	122	9					1802	1823		10.1002/2017JE005319	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017JE005319													WOS:000416493400001
J	de la Fuente, A; Meruane, C				de la Fuente, Alberto; Meruane, Carolina			Spectral model for long-term computation of thermodynamics and potential evaporation in shallow wetlands	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Altiplanic wetlands are unique ecosystems located in the elevated plateaus of Chile, Argentina, Peru, and Bolivia. These ecosystems are under threat due to changes in land use, groundwater extractions, and climate change that will modify the water balance through changes in precipitation and evaporation rates. Long-term prediction of the fate of aquatic ecosystems imposes computational constraints that make finding a solution impossible in some cases. In this article, we present a spectral model for long-term simulations of the thermodynamics of shallow wetlands in the limit case when the water depth tends to zero. This spectral model solves for water and sediment temperature, as well as heat, momentum, and mass exchanged with the atmosphere. The parameters of the model (water depth, thermal properties of the sediments, and surface albedo) and the atmospheric downscaling were calibrated using the MODIS product of the land surface temperature. Moreover, the performance of the daily evaporation rates predicted by the model was evaluated against daily pan evaporation data measured between 1964 and 2012. The spectral model was able to correctly represent both seasonal fluctuation and climatic trends observed in daily evaporation rates. It is concluded that the spectral model presented in this article is a suitable tool for assessing the global climate change effects on shallow wetlands whose thermodynamics is forced by heat exchanges with the atmosphere and modulated by the heat-reservoir role of the sediments.					de la Fuente Stranger, Alberto/G-7018-2016	de la Fuente Stranger, Alberto/0000-0001-5415-9816; Meruane, Carolina/0009-0000-4887-3124													0043-1397	1944-7973				SEP	2017	53	9					7696	7715		10.1002/2017WR020515	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017WR020515													WOS:000413484200012

Population Dynamics of the Cockle Cerastoderma glaucum: A comparison between Lake Qarun and Lake Timsah, Egypt	TURKISH JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The cockle Cerastoderma glaucum represents one of the most common marine mollusc species present in Egyptian waters. This study aims to investigate the population structure, growth, mortality, and exploitation status of this cockle along Lake Qarun and Lake Timsah in order to make a comparison study. Cockles were collected from Lake Qarun at monthly intervals between February 2008 and May 2009 and collected from Lake Timsah at four seasons only. Length frequency data were analyzed using FiSAT software for estimation of population parameters to evaluate the stock. Asymptotic length (L infinity) was smaller in Lake Qarun (28.35 mm) compared to that in Lake Timsah (33.60 mm). Growth coefficient (K) was higher in Lake Qarun (0.450 yr(-1)) than in Lake Timsah (0.280 yr(-1)). Growth performance index (Phi) values were similar (2.56) in both cockle stocks. The theoretical maximum age (T-max) was higher in Lake Timsah (12.6 yr(-1)) than in Lake Qarun (7.4 yr(-1)). Total mortality (Z) was estimated by length-converted catch curve at 1.02 and 0.24 yr(-1), fishing mortality (F) at -0.04 and 0.47 yr(-1) and natural mortality (M) at 1.06 and 0.71 yr(-1) for Lake Qarun and Lake Timsah, respectively.

To evaluate nu-trient dynamics in aquatic ecosystems, previous studies have analyzed the determining factors of sediment nutrient content and stoichiometry on whole sediment profiles without depth separation on SEW sites. Such a methodology as-sumes that SEW sediment is a uniform unit and its nutrient dynamics are regulated by the same mechanism at various depths (uniformity assumption). We tested this assumption using sediment samples from six depth increments of 154 sediment profiles (1 m depth) on SEW sites at Shengjin Lake in subtropical China. We measured sediment total nitro-gen (STN), total phosphorus (STP), nutrient fractions, and the molar ratio of STN to STP (RSNP), and investigated their determining factors at various depths. STN, STP, and RSNP were averaged at 1.34 g/kg, 0.55 g/kg, and 5.43, respec-tively, and all gradually decreased with depth. STN was positively affected by moisture and flooding duration in all depth increments. Instead, the major determining factors of STP changed from particle size at 0-20 cm of depth to pH and electrical conductivity at 30-100 cm of depth. These vertical patterns have close connections with sediment nutrient fractions since sediment N fractions did not shift along profile depths (i.e., over 99 % of STN was organicN) but sediment P fractions did (the percentage of Fe-P and Al-P decreased by 6.25 % but those of Ca-P increased by 4.31 % along the sediment depth gradient). The major determining factors of RSNP showed no obvious vertical patterns because they frequently varied along depth gradients. The results demonstrate that SEW sediment is not a uniform unit and the determining factors of nutrient dynamics change with depth. Our study highlights the importance of improved methodological reflection in studies addressing sediment nutrient dynamics on SEW sites.					; Song, Hocheol/ABD-7214-2021; Shen, Ruichang/O-4305-2017; HUANG, XINGYUN/LIC-2734-2024; 郑, 博福/JAX-5796-2023; Rinklebe, Joerg/Y-2398-2019	Huang, Xingyun/0000-0001-6450-8522; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				JAN 15	2023	856		1						158972	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158972	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158972		OCT 2022						36179838					WOS:000973021400012

Relating river discharge and water temperature to the recruitment of age-0 White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus Richardson, 1836) in the Columbia River using over-dispersed catch data	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY					5th Annual Meeting of the North-American-Sturgeon-and-Paddlefish-Society (NASPS)	SEP 19-22, 2016	Hood River, OR	N Amer Sturgeon & Paddlefish Soc				The goals were to (i) determine if river discharge and water temperature during various early life history stages were predictors of age-0 White Sturgeon, Acipenser transmontanus, recruitment, and (ii) provide an example of how over-dispersed catch data, including data with many zero observations, can be used to better understand the effects of regulated rivers on the productivity of depressed sturgeon populations. An information theoretic approach was used to develop and select negative binomial and zero-inflated negative binomial models that model the relation of age-0 White Sturgeon survey data from three contiguous Columbia River reservoirs to river discharge and water temperature during spawning, egg incubation, larval, and post-larval phases. Age-0 White Sturgeon were collected with small mesh gill nets in The Dalles and John Day reservoirs from 1997 to 2014 and a bottom trawl in Bonneville Reservoir from 1989 to 2006. Results suggest that seasonal river discharge was positively correlated with age-0 recruitment; notably that discharge, 16 June-31 July was positively correlated to age-0 recruitment in all three reservoirs. The best approximating models for two of the three reservoirs also suggest that seasonal water temperature may be a determinant of age-0 recruitment. Our research demonstrates how over-dispersed catch data can be used to better understand the effects of environmental conditions on sturgeon populations caused by the construction and operation of dams.																			0175-8659	1439-0426				APR	2018	34	2			SI		279	289		10.1111/jai.13570	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jai.13570													WOS:000428797200004

Atmospheric nitrogen (N) is an important component of the lake's N loading, but how long-term and seasonal changes in precipitation affect this loading still needs clarification. This study aimed to improve our understanding of the seasonal features of N deposition in the lake, by monitoring atmospheric N deposition concentrations and fluxes from March 2013 to February 2014. There was a significant temporal variation in wet N depositions in the study area. The distribution of the annual rainfall into major (March-May 299.8 mm) and minor (October-December 343.2 mm) rainy seasons translated into 20 and 30% of N deposition. In September and January-February, there was 10 and 12% precipitation, representing 43 and 7% of N deposition in the lake. Nitrogen deposition was highest in September due to farmlands' burning during the dry season (June-August), leading to N accumulation in the atmosphere. In conclusion, the pattern of N deposition appears to be driven by the unique climatic characteristics of the lake basin and to be closely associated with local anthropogenic activities.

Physicochemical characteristics of a southern Lake Michigan river plume	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Riverine inputs are a major source of nutrients to the Laurentian Great Lakes and have important effects on nearshore biological processes, where mixing between river and lake water leads to formation of heterogeneous river plumes. We examined the physical and chemical characteristics of the St. Joseph River plume in southern Lake Michigan between May and October 2011, and in October 2012, June 2013 and April 2014. Specific electric conductivity and stable isotopes of water were used to quantify the fraction of river water (FRW) at sampling sites in Lake Michigan. Both tracers predicted similar patterns of FRW among sites; however, there was a systematic offset between the two methods, and specific electric conductivity method under-predicted the FRW by similar to 5%. We observed a distinct, seasonally varying river plume, with plume size correlated with flow rate of St. Joseph River. Within the plume, sediments and nutrients were non-conservative and exhibited significant and seasonally varying losses that we attribute to settling of particle-bound nutrients and/or nutrients in particulate phase below the plume. The characteristics and the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the river plume documented here may have important implications for the nearshore biogeochemistry of the Great Lakes and for understanding the roles of these features in ecological processes in nearshore areas.

Influences of ENSO and PDO phenomena on the local climate variability can drive extreme temperature and depth conditions in a Pampean shallow lake affecting fish communities	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												The aim of this study was to characterize occurrence of extreme temperature and depth conditions affecting fish community in a shallow lake as result of local climate variability, in turn influenced by the ENSO and PDO phenomena. Extreme depth and water temperature events (modeled from local weather conditions) were characterized from 1966 to 2012 to estimate changes in ChascomAs lake fish communities. The ENSO and PDO influences on the occurrence probability of these ecosystem changes were investigated. Four significant changes in ChascomAs Lake fish assemblage were identified during period assessed, as response to extreme temperature and depth events. Extreme high depth conditions would have changed fish community during 1987 and 2002, leading to a configuration characterized by the absence of the most emblematic fish species in ChascomAs Lake, the pejerrey (Odontesthes bonariensis). On the other hand, extreme low water temperatures would have promoted a fish community characterized by the dominance of this last species during 1966-1986, 1997-2001 and 2008-2013 periods. Furthermore, extreme shortening in pejerrey spawning season was significantly related with decrease of its relative abundance. The occurrence probability of the extreme physical conditions modifying ChascomAs Lake fish communities was significantly explained by ENSO (by depth influences) and by PDO (by water temperature influences). Thus, this study showed strong correlations between the ENSO and PDO influences and the occurrence probability of the extreme physical conditions changing fish community in ChascomAs Lake.

A regional study of Holocene climate change and human occupation in Peruvian Amazonia	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY					Annual Meeting of the Association-for-Tropical-Biology-and-Conservation	2005	Uberlandia, BRAZIL	Canadian Assoc Phys Anthropol				Aim To investigate the influence of Holocene climatic and human-induced changes on a region of high biodiversity in southern Peruvian Amazonia. Location Four palaeoecological records from separate lakes within a lake district close to the modern city of Puerto Maldonado, Peru. Results The lakes provide a palaeoecological record spanning the last 8200 years. A mid-Holocene dry event is documented in all of the records that extend back > 6000 years. The dry event appears to have lasted from c. 7200 yr BP until c. 3300 yr Bp. The onset of wetter conditions coincides with the formation of the youngest of the four lakes. The earliest occupation of these sites is inferred from the presence of charcoal at 7200 yr Bp, and the first crop pollen is found at 3630 yr Bp. Lakes that were regularly occupied were colonized soon after they formed. A reduction in charcoal concentration and the absence of crop pollen after c. 500 BP in all lakes is consistent with site abandonment following conquest. Main conclusions The mid-Holocene dry event is suggested to be part of a time-transgressive drying that tracked from north to south in both the Andes and the Amazon lowlands. The last millennium may represent the period of highest sustained lake levels within the Holocene. The proximity of the four lakes allows a landscape-scale analysis of the spatial extent of human disturbance centred on a known site of human occupation and reveals the highly localized nature of pre-Columbian anthropogenic disturbance in Amazonian landscapes. Inferences regarding widespread pre-Columbian landscape modification by indigenous peoples must take into account key site attributes, such as seasonality and proximity to rivers.

It was shown that the feedback between the biocenosis and abiotic properties was of key importance for the lake environment, especially for features shaped by oxygen content. During vegetation season in a shallow trophogenic zone supersaturated with oxygen, quick depletion of some nutrients (mineral forms of nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon) were noted. In a tropholytic zone, which constituted the major part of the lake water column, the mineralization of organic matter concentrations of mineral compounds were high. This layer was completely and permanently deoxygenated (anoxia). The reductive conditions intensified the release of biogenic compounds from bottom sediments. Many correlations between abiotic properties of water reflecting the complex interrelationships between biocenosis and biotope were stated. The relationship between photosynthesis and alkalinity and calcium distribution in the water column also was explained. On the basis of historical data (since the 1930s), tendencies of temporal changes in lake water chemistry were discussed as well as causes and effects of eutrophication.					; Joniak, Tomasz/K-5802-2019	Joniak, Tomasz/0000-0001-7395-1585; 													1230-1485	2083-5906					2013	22	1					227	237																WOS:000315177800026

Plant Trait Diversity Buffers Variability in Denitrification Potential over Changes in Season and Soil Conditions	PLOS ONE												Background: Denitrification is an important ecosystem service that removes nitrogen (N) from N-polluted watersheds, buffering soil, stream, and river water quality from excess N by returning N to the atmosphere before it reaches lakes or oceans and leads to eutrophication. The denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) assay is widely used for measuring denitrification potential. Because DEA is a function of enzyme levels in soils, most ecologists studying denitrification have assumed that DEA is less sensitive to ambient levels of nitrate (NO3-) and soil carbon and thus, less variable over time than field measurements. In addition, plant diversity has been shown to have strong effects on microbial communities and belowground processes and could potentially alter the functional capacity of denitrifiers. Here, we examined three questions: (1) Does DEA vary through the growing season? (2) If so, can we predict DEA variability with environmental variables? (3) Does plant functional diversity affect DEA variability? Methodology/Principal Findings: The study site is a restored wetland in North Carolina, US with native wetland herbs planted in monocultures or mixes of four or eight species. We found that denitrification potentials for soils collected in July 2006 were significantly greater than for soils collected in May and late August 2006 (p<0.0001). Similarly, microbial biomass standardized DEA rates were significantly greater in July than May and August (p<0.0001). Of the soil variables measured soil moisture, organic matter, total inorganic nitrogen, and microbial biomass-none consistently explained the pattern observed in DEA through time. There was no significant relationship between DEA and plant species richness or functional diversity. However, the seasonal variance in microbial biomass standardized DEA rates was significantly inversely related to plant species functional diversity (p<0.01). Conclusions/Significance: These findings suggest that higher plant functional diversity may support a more constant level of DEA through time, buffering the ecosystem from changes in season and soil conditions.

Impact of recreational power boating on two populations of northern map turtles (Graptemys geographica)	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												1. Recreational power boating is growing in popularity in North America. This activity is known to have lethal and sub-lethal effects on aquatic wildlife and freshwater turtles may be particularly sensitive to this activity. 2. This study reports on patterns of traumatic injuries inflicted by powerboat propellers to northern map turtles (Graptemys geographica) from two sites differing in boat traffic intensity in Ontario, Canada. 3. The relative vulnerability of turtles was assessed, in light of seasonal patterns in boat traffic, as a function of sex-and age-specific movement patterns, habitat use, and basking behaviour obtained by radio-telemetry. Population viability analyses (PVA) were also conducted to evaluate the potential demographic consequences of mortality induced by powerboats. 4. The prevalence of propeller injuries was two to nine times higher in adult females than in adult males and juvenile females. Patterns of movement, habitat use, and aquatic basking indicated that adult females are more exposed to collisions with boats. PVA showed that boat-induced mortality in adult females could lead to rapid population extinction if the risk of mortality when hit by a boat is greater than 10%. 5. The results of this study showed that recreational power boating is a serious threat to northern map turtles, even under moderate boat traffic. The need to adopt measures restricting boat traffic in areas important to turtles is discussed. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Nyberg, B; Sayre, R; Luijendijk, E				Nyberg, Bjorn; Sayre, Roger; Luijendijk, Elco			Increasing seasonal variation in the extent of rivers and lakes from 1984 to 2022	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Knowledge of the spatial and temporal distribution of surface water is important for water resource management, flood risk assessment, monitoring ecosystem health, constraining estimates of biogeochemical cycles and understanding our climate. While global-scale spatiotemporal change detection of surface water has significantly improved in recent years due to planetary-scale remote sensing and computing, it has remained challenging to distinguish the changing characteristics of rivers and lakes. Here we analyze the spatial extent of permanent and seasonal rivers and lakes globally over the past 38 years based on new data of river system extents and surface water trends. Results show that while the total permanent surface area of both rivers and lakes has remained relatively constant, the areas with intermittent seasonal coverage have increased by 12 % and 27 % for rivers and lakes, respectively. The increase is statistically significant in over 84 % of global water catchments based on Spearman's rank correlations (rho) above 0.05 and p values less than 0.05. The seasonal river extent is nearly 32 % larger than the previously observed annual mean river extent, suggesting large seasonal variations that impact not only ecosystem health but also estimations of terrestrial biogeochemical cycles of carbon. The outcomes of our analysis are shared as the Surface Area of Rivers and Lakes (SARL) database, serving as a valuable resource for monitoring and research of hydrological cycles, ecosystem accounting, and water management.					; Nyberg, Bjorn/AAN-9885-2020; Luijendijk, Elco/H-3837-2019	Nyberg, Bjorn/0000-0002-4910-2417; Luijendijk, Elco/0000-0003-4140-2455													1027-5606	1607-7938				APR 11	2024	28	7					1653	1663		10.5194/hess-28-1653-2024	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1653-2024													WOS:001199727300001

The concentrations were determined with GC-MS, and their spatial and seasonal distribution characteristics were interpreted. The results show that 2-ring PAHs present considerably higher concentrations in warm seasons than cold seasons, but the concentrations of the other higher-ring PAHs are rather stable in warm and cold seasons. The distribution patterns of these PAHs might be mainly attributed to ambient temperature effects on the PAH solubility in the water body. Meanwhile, the spatial distributions of the PAH concentrations in cold seasons were rather various in the sampling area, while the distributions in the warm seasons were homogeneous. The different distributions could result from the water recharge from the Yangtze River during cold seasons, which diluted PAH concentrations in the northeastern part of the lake. Furthermore, via literature review on PAH concentrations in water body, PAHs are in a wide range of levels and their patterns are different among the studies, which should be more effected by local factors instead of general PAH properties. The results from this study also present special characteristics of PAHs in Taihu Lake, which exhibit more insight on PAHs existence in water bodies.

J	Fraisse, S; Bormans, M; Lagadeuc, Y				Fraisse, Stephane; Bormans, Myriam; Lagadeuc, Yvan			Morphofunctional traits reflect differences in phytoplankton community between rivers of contrasting flow regime	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												A morphofunctional traits approach has been adopted to identify how environmental factors shape the phytoplankton community. This approach has been applied in two rivers where hydrodynamical conditions are expected to be the main factor acting on the phytoplankton community. Hence, morphological traits (motility, shape, size, mucilage, and silica) related to sedimentation resistance have been chosen. We have shown that differences in flow regulation through differences in flow velocities induce shifts in phytoplankton community. These shifts depend mostly on shape, buoyancy regulation, and motility of phytoplankton cells. Elongated shapes are the characteristic of unregulated sites with high flow velocities, while cells able to regulate actively their position or to reduce their density (mucilaginous colonies) are found in regulated sites with low flow velocities. Flattened shapes are also the characteristic of sites with rather low flow velocities. These results highlight the key role of flow velocity as a driving factor controlling the structure of phytoplankton community. In this study, flow velocity also structures phytoplankton community according to location rather than seasonality.

In response to increased wetness in 2010 and 2011 over the region, prevalent surface water bodies accounted for a significant fraction of the terrestrial water budget of the PC, whereas the NGP, an area with sparse surface water, exhibited a greater increase in groundwater storage concomitant with enhanced seasonal variability. Over the study period from 2003 to 2011, GRACE-based estimates of terrestrial water storage agreed well with combined groundwater, soil moisture, snow water equivalent, and total canopy water storage over the NGP, as surface water is not a significant component in this area. However, closure was improved over the PC if surface water changes were included in the water budget.					; VanLooy, Jeffrey/ABE-2004-2020	Kirilenko, Andrei/0000-0001-6372-5904; VanLooy, Jeff/0000-0002-7424-5516; Proulx, Rob/0000-0003-0923-7963; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				SEP	2013	49	9					5756	5764		10.1002/wrcr.20455	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/wrcr.20455													WOS:000325991100045

Temporal and spatial variability of the internal wave field in a lake with complex morphometry	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												To quantify the effect of basin morphometry on internal wave dynamics, we installed thermistor arrays around the perimeter of Mono Lake, California. The lake's complex bathymetry includes alongshore bottom slopes ranging from < 1% up to 9% and a steep-sided peninsula-like island. Under the influence of the dominating winds from the south, isopycnals downwelled along the long axis of the lake as well as along an axis parallel to the peninsula, generating vertical mode 2 horizontal mode 2 internal waves. On relaxation of the wind, a horizontal mode 2 Kelvin wave evolved with a period of similar to 22 h in each of the two sub-basins. The response of the internal wave field to high winds was spatially variable, with higher vertical excursions of isopycnals and higher rates of strain, indicative of non-linearity and turbulence, at both sides of the peninsula and near steep sloping boundaries to the south. Rate of strain squared was enhanced up to three orders of magnitude relative to background rates depending on bottom slope. Model comparisons in which the island was moved to the center of the lake or removed showed a dominant horizontal mode 1 wave and stronger influence of rotation. Increased complexity of basin morphometry modified the horizontal and vertical phase structure of dominant basin-scale waves, redistributed the potential energy in the internal wave field over space, and shifted the positions of the basins in which the waves rotated. Whether turbulence increased with these shifts depended on the incidence of steep topography.

Epiphytic diatoms as flood indicators	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The hydroecology of floodplain lakes is strongly regulated by flood events. The threat of climate warming and increasing human activities requires development of scientific methods to quantify changes in the frequency of short-lived flood events, because they remain difficult to identify using conventional paleolimnological and monitoring approaches. We developed an approach to detect floods in sediment records by comparing the abundance and composition of epiphytic diatom communities in flooded and non-flooded ponds of the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD), Canada, that grew on submerged macrophytes (Potamogeton zosteriformis, P. perfoliatus) and an artificial substrate (polypropylene sheets) during the open-water season of 2005. Analysis of similarity tests showed that epiphytic diatom community composition differs significantly between flooded and non-flooded ponds. After accounting for the "pond effect," paired comparisons of the three substrates determined that variation in community composition between the artificial substrate and macrophytes was similar to that between the macrophyte taxa. Similarity percentage analysis identified diatom taxa that discriminate between flooded and non-flooded ponds. The relative abundance of 'strong flood indicator taxa' was used to construct an event-scale flood record spanning the past 180 years using analyses of sedimentary diatom assemblages from a closed-drainage pond (PAD 5). Results were verified by close agreement with an independent paleoflood record from a nearby flood-prone oxbow pond (PAD 54) and historical records. Comparison of epiphytic diatoms in flooded and non-flooded lakes in this study provides a promising approach to detect changes in flood frequency, and may have applications for reconstructing other pulse-type disturbances such as hurricanes and pollutant spills.					; Hall, Roland/K-3165-2019	Hall, Roland/0000-0002-0314-6449; Wiklund, Johan/0000-0002-2327-5651; 													0921-2728					JUN	2010	44	1					25	42		10.1007/s10933-009-9383-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-009-9383-y													WOS:000277939200003
J	Al-Handal, A; Hu, CM				Al-Handal, Adil; Hu, Chuanmin			MODIS Observations of Human-Induced Changes in the Mesopotamian Marshes in Iraq	WETLANDS												With a total area of > 7,750 km(2), the Mesopotamian marshes near the border between Iraq and Iran provide habitats for millions of birds and most of the commercial fisheries in this region. Beginning in the 1990s, human activities such as war, dam construction, restoration, and water supply diversions significantly influenced the ecosystems. Yet, to date only a handful of reports document changes in the marshes, all using field measurements or sporadic satellite observations. Here, using long-term MODIS observations between 2000 and 2012 we quantified the annual changes and long-term trends in both the vegetation and water coverage (i.e., the areas of vegetation and water) in the Al-Hammar, Al-Huwaiza, and the Central marshes, the three major marshes in this region. In addition to seasonality, the most notable patterns are the three distinctive regimes within the observation period: the 2000-2003 regime for low coverage of both vegetation and water, the 2004-2008 regime for significantly increased coverage, and the 2009-2012 regime for reduced coverage (almost back to the 2000-2003 levels). Relative to the 2000-2003 regime, increases in the vegetation coverage during 2004-2008 ranged from 50 to > 100 %. It is likely that these changes are the result of human induced activities, with weather fluctuations (e.g., precipitation) playing a minor role. Continuous and sustainable monitoring through combining satellite and field measurements is required to fully understand the consequences of such changes as well as to evaluate the impacts of future restoration programs.

According to the histological examinations of the specimens that were caught between February 2009 and January 2010, three testicular stages were determined. Those stages were as follows: (1) recrudescence or prespawning (July-April), (2) spawning (May-June), and (3) postspawning (July). It was observed that the GSI increased gradually, starting from the recrudescence stage, and it reached peak values at the spawning stage, while the lowest values were in the postspawning. Germ cell proliferation in the testis was detected using a proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and germ cell apoptosis was detected by transferase dUTP nick end labeling staining. The germ cell PCNA and apoptosis index values were calculated. It was indicated that germ cell proliferation was observed in all of the testicular stages. The highest germ cell PCNA index (PI) levels were detected in July, August, and September, which then dropped in October and stabilized between February and April. The lowest PI values were detected in the spawning stage (May-June). Germ cell apoptosis was observed in all of the months, and the highest apoptotic index values were detected in August, September, October, May, and June. Plasma 11-KT and T levels were at their highest levels in May and June, and it was detected as stabile in the other months. There was a correlation between GSI, PI, and plasma androgen levels. In conclusion, the present data illustrate testicular development stages for C. tarichi and show changes in the level of GSI and sex steroid biosynthesis through spermatogenesis.

A case study from the southern Baltic Vistula Lagoon	OCEANOLOGIA												Most knowledge on the feeding ecology of fish has been based on the analyses of food remains from the alimentary tracks. This traditional method, however, only provides in-formation about recently consumed food, and is burdened with a risk of incorrect assessment of the role of individual diet components due to the different rates of digestion. A method free from such limitations is the analysis of fatty acids. The objective of our study was to recognise the potential of fatty acid signatures in providing information on the diet and feeding habits of six fish species from the shallow brackish Vistula Lagoon, southern Baltic Sea ( Anguilla an-guilla, Abramis brama, Rutilus rutilus, Pelecus cultratus, Perca fluviatilis, Sander lucioperca). Multivariate statistical analyses of fatty acid signatures permitted relevant grouping of the fish according to species and their diet, as well as evidenced substantial ontogenetic changes in perch, roach, and bream. They might be caused by dietary changes but can also result from internal regulatory processes. The obtained results confirmed that fatty acids provide useful, time-integrated dietary information, contributing to expanding knowledge regarding the feed-ing ecology of fish in shallow coastal water ecosystems. They also pointed to the necessity of assessment of the invertebrates and fish's ability to perform endogenous synthesis of polyun-saturated fatty acids, particularly in research on benthic communities. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt to investigate the feeding habits of fish and food-web relationships in the coastal waters of the Baltic Sea using fatty acids.(c) 2022 Institute of Oceanology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

J	Jahan, S; Wang, Y; Burnett, WC; Means, GH; Sun, FJ				Jahan, Shakura; Wang, Yang; Burnett, William C.; Means, Guy H.; Sun, Fajun			Evaluating organic geochemical proxies for application to coastal lake sediments along the Gulf Coast of Florida for paleotempestology	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Organic geochemical proxies (OGPs) preserved in coastal lake sediments have recently been used to reconstruct millennia-long hurricane records. Although OGPs (delta C-13, delta N-15 and C/N) appear to be a more sensitive indicator of past storm events than traditional proxies used in paleotempestology, the method has not been tested in many lakes with modern data. In this study, we measured the delta C-13, delta N-15 and C/N values of particulate organic matter (POM), along with the salinities and stable isotopic compositions of water (delta O-18 and delta D), in two coastal lakes on seasonal or much shorter time scales throughout a 3-year period. This work was intended to develop a better understanding of the dynamics of OGPs in these lakes. The time-series data not only show that geochemical properties of these lakes varied seasonally, reflecting variations in lake biological and environmental conditions, but displayed unique variation patterns in response to storms that caused either seawater flooding or freshwater flooding of the lakes. The data show that seawater flooding led to higher delta C-13 and delta N-15 values, with either lower or no change in the C/N ratios of the POM, generally consistent with a previously proposed conceptual model for detecting seawater flooding events. The data also show that freshwater flooding reduces delta N-15 and increases the C/N values of POM, in addition to lowering the salinity, delta O-18 and delta D of lake water. These time series modern data demonstrate the feasibility of detecting past storm events that were large enough to cause either seawater or freshwater flooding by examining variation patterns of multiple OGPs in coastal lake sediments. Applying this understanding to a sediment core from one of the study lakes (Mullet Pond, Florida), we reconstructed a centuries-long record of storms based on the variation patterns in OGPs together with Pb-210 ages. The OGP-based storm record suggests that 30 flooding events, including 15 seawater flooding and 15 freshwater flooding incidents, occurred over the last 165 years. Almost all of these flooding events can be matched (within the dating uncertainty) to the historic hurricanes that are known to have passed within 150 km of the study site. This further confirms that OGPs preserved in sediments in coastal lakes of Florida or similar regions may be used as reliable recorders of past storm activity. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The deepest sediments (between 1000 and 967 cm) in Lake Vrana could correspond to Late Pleistocene to Holocene transition. Although this interval is not dated, it is indicated by the palynological record. After that, the Holocene warming is evident and the observed dark layers are identified as Holocene sapropel S1, known in the eastern Mediterranean (10.8-6.1 cal kyr BP). Sapropelic layer S1a in Lake Vrana sediment core is evident between 905 and 790 cm and it ended at 7.9 cal kyr BP. It is formed in a very shallow freshwater ecosystem, dominated by cyanobacteria Gleocapsa and terrigenous detritus as a consequence of runoff. Periodically anoxic condition occurred. The geochemical signature of sapropelic layer S1a from Lake Vrana is consistent with post-depositional oxidation due to transition to the bottom water oxygenation evidenced in elevated Mn and Mn peak at the end of sapropelic layer S1a deposition. Sapropelic layer S1b, deposited between 7.4 and 6.4 cal kyr BP, is characterized by amorphous organic matter. The two sapropelic layers are separated by the horizon at 7.9-7.4 cal kyr BP, corresponding to the drier climate conditions, indicated by the presence of Poaceae, Ericaceae, Juniperus and Pistacia. This horizon reflects regional climatic cooling associated with reduced levels of precipitation that interrupted a period of generally higher precipitation. Based on geochemical data, Total organic carbon (TOC) and Nitrogen (N), the sapropelic layers are characterized by elevated values comparing to the rest of the core. The new records allow reconstruction of paleoenvironmental changes on land, which give insight into the processes and climate conditions that led to the formation of S1. The evidence indicates that: (i) S1 sapropelic layer in Lake Vrana sediments is an organic-poor deposit; (ii) the S1 period in the study area can be divisible into two sub-phases (S1a and S1b). The key factor that initiated the formation of S1 was increased discharge of freshwater into the Lake Vrana basin during warmer and wetter climate in the Early Holocene.

The Okavango Delta in Botswana, Southern Africa, is the largest inland delta in the world and a wetland ecosystem that experiences dramatic annual flooding of large tracts of seasonal floodplains. The Delta was, therefore, expected to be home to high mercury levels in fish and to be an area where local subsistence fishing communities would be at substantial risk of mercury toxicity from fish consumption. Total mercury concentrations measured in 27 species of fish from the Okavango Delta averaged (mean +/- s.d., wet weight) 19 +/- 19 ng g(-1) in non-piscivorous fish, and 59 +/- 53 ng g(-1) in piscivorous fish. These mercury concentrations are similar to those reported for fish from lakes in other areas of tropical Africa, demonstrating that not all wetlands are sites of elevated mercury concentrations in biota. Even more intriguing is that concentrations of mercury in fish from across tropical Africa are systematically and substantially lower than those typically reported for fish from freshwater ecosystems elsewhere globally. The reasons for this apparent "African mercury anomaly" are unclear, but this finding poses a unique opportunity to improve our understanding of mercury's biogeochemical cycling in the environment. Mercury concentrations measured in human hair collected in subsistence fishing communities in the Okavango Delta were similarly low (0.21 +/- 0.22 mu g g(-1) dry weight) despite high levels of fish consumption, and reflect the low mercury concentrations in the fish here.

Temporal and spatial patterns of abundance and occurrence of planktonic shrimps in the Songkhla Lagoon System, southern Thailand	BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE					3rd International Symposium on Mangroves as Fish Habitat (MAFH)	NOV 12-14, 2018	Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA					Temporal and spatial distributions of planktonic shrimps from the hyperbenthos of Thale Sap and Thale Sap Songkhla lakes in the Songkhla Lagoon system, southern Thailand, were investigated using modified Riley push nets with a mesh size of 0.5 mm between June 2017 and June 2018. Three species of Mysida and two species of Dendrobranchiata shrimps were revealed, among which Nanomysis siamensis was dominant, representing more than 90% of the catch throughout the year. The Songkhla Lagoon system experiences extreme changes in temperature, salinity, pH, and water levels due to seasonal monsoons. A significant difference in the planktonic shrimp assemblages between Thale Sap and Thale Sap Songkhla was observed across the sampling months. Significant differences in the assemblage structure were also evident between Thale Sap and Thale Sap Songkhla and among sampling months. Dissimilar assemblage patterns were prominent temporally during the shift from southwest to northeast monsoon seasons and from the intermediate to southwest monsoon. Lake (Thale Sap or Thale Sap Songkhla) was the most important environmental parameter affecting occurrence patterns for N. siamensis, Mesopodopsis tenuipes, and Belzebub hanseni in the Songkhla Lagoon system. Salinity governed the spatial distribution of M. tenuipes and B. hanseni. Nanomysis siamensis was the only species that was regularly present in high abundance in Thale Sap and Thale Sap Songkhla over the entire salinity range. This suggest that N. siamensis is likely a resident species of the Songkhla Lagoon system.					; Yolanda, Rofiza/GPC-4756-2022	Yolanda, Rofiza/0000-0002-7792-0783; 													0007-4977	1553-6955				JUL	2020	96	3			SI		521	538		10.5343/bms.2019.0006	http://dx.doi.org/10.5343/bms.2019.0006													WOS:000553865200009

The relative sequence abundance of attached fungi was negatively correlated with that of the photosynthetic picoeukaryotes (PPEs). PPE-attached fungal communities were mainly composed of Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota and Ascomycota. Temperature, Si and PPE community structure are the most important driving factors for the temporal succession of PPE-attached fungal communities. In particular, PPE-attached fungi can be divided into three groups from high to low temperatures. Phylogenetic molecular ecological network results indicated that the connectivity and the total number of links in the network of the high-temperature group (> 21.82 degrees C) are higher than those in the other two temperature groups (between 9.67 and 21.82 degrees C, and < 9.67 degrees C, respectively). Moreover, the interaction between PPE-attached fungi and the PPEs changed from antagonistic to cooperative, with the decline in temperature. The most abundant operational taxonomic units of PPE-attached fungi were affiliated with the Cladosporium, the most common saprophytic fungus, whereas most fungal hub taxa were Chytridiomycota, the main parasite fungi of phytoplankton.					zhang, min/IYI-9869-2023; Gao, Guang/AAJ-8676-2021; Wu, Qinglong/B-7625-2011	Liu, ChangQing/0000-0002-4690-6161; 													0168-6496	1574-6941				JUL	2020	96	7							fiaa123	10.1093/femsec/fiaa123	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fiaa123								32556146					WOS:000565899500021

Cow efficiency: modeling the biological and economic output of a Michigan beef herd	TRANSLATIONAL ANIMAL SCIENCE												In recent decades, beef cattle producers have selected cattle for biological traits (i.e., improved growth) to maximize revenue, leading to an increase in average cow body size. However, matching cow size to the production environment would allow producers to maximize productivity and economic returns per unit of land. This may help meet the goals of sustainable intensification, but environmental complexity and varying cow-calf production systems dictates a regional approach. The objective of this experiment was to examine the biological efficiency and economic returns of a Northern Michigan cow-calf system. We hypothesized that biological efficiency and economic returns would decrease with increasing cow body size. Data were collected from a Red Angus cow herd located at the Lake City AgBio Research Center in Lake City, MI from 2011 to 2018 on cow age, weight, and body condition score at weaning, and subsequent 205 d adjusted calf weaning weight (WW), sex, and yearling weight. Biological efficiency was defined as WW as a percentage of cow body weight (DBW). Enterprise budgeting techniques were used to calculate expected net returns from 2011 to 2018 after classifying cows into 11 BW tiers at 22.67 kg intervals beginning at 430.83 kg. Forward-looking net present value (NPV) was calculated using the same tier system, for a 10-yr production cycle with the baseline being a 200 d grazing season. Weaning weight increased with increasing DBW (P < 0.01), but the percentage of cow body weight weaned was reduced by -38.58 x Ln(DBW) (P < 0.01). This led to cows weaning 26.38 kg/ha more with every 100 kg drop in DBW. Expected net returns from 2011 to 2018 did not differ by DBW tier on a per cow basis but did on a per ha basis with a decrease in $10.27/ha with each increase in DBW tier (P < 0.01). Net present value was maximized in the baseline scenario at 453.51 kg DBW and decreased in value as DBW increased. These results suggest that for a Northern Midwestern cow-calf herd, comparatively lighter cows provide a higher economic value on a land basis.

Dissolved organic matter (DOM), a major fraction of organic matter, causes various problems in water use. DOM sources in lakes are diverse. Moreover, DOM properties can be altered biologically and physicochemically during retention time. However, DOM in lakes consists of complex unknown substances. In the present study, high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry (Orbitrap MS) was employed to determine the molecular-level composition of low-molecular-weight DOM in Lake Inba, the most polluted eutrophic lake in Japan. One-year monitoring demonstrated that the lake's DOM consisted of core components that were detected year-around and season-specific components. Although most DOM components extracted by solid phase extraction in the lake came from inflow rivers, lake-specific components were present, which could be associated with algal growth in the lake. Permanganate pretreatment was integrated with Orbitrap MS to screen for components contributing to dissolved chemical oxygen demand (DCODMn), an environmental parameter used in Japan to define the water quality of lakes and reservoirs. Results indicated that only minor and highly unsaturated components were responsible for DCODMn. With this approach, we were able to shed light on how the DOM composition in a eutrophic lake was shaped at molecular level, which cannot be achieved by conventional analysis.					; Furumai, Hiroaki/L-8574-2017; Kurisu, Futoshi/AAF-1750-2020	Yuthawong, Vitharuch/0000-0001-9855-9205; Kurisu, Futoshi/0000-0003-1567-4852													2053-1400	2053-1419				JUL 1	2020	6	7					1816	1827		10.1039/d0ew00129e	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ew00129e													WOS:000545743800005

Biomass and nutrient stock of submersed and floating macrophytes in shallow lakes formed by rewetting of degraded fens	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Ecosystem restoration by rewetting of degraded fens led to the new formation of large-scale shallow lakes in the catchment of the River Peene in NE Germany. We analyzed the biomass and the nutrient stock of the submersed (Ceratophyllum demersum) and the floating macrophytes (Lemna minor and Spirodela polyrhiza) in order to assess their influence on temporal nutrient storage in water bodies compared to other freshwater systems. Ceratophyllum demersum displayed a significantly higher biomass production (0.86-1.19 t DM = dry matter ha(-1)) than the Lemnaceae (0.64-0.71 t DM ha(-1)). The nutrient stock of submersed macrophytes ranged between 28-44 kg N ha(-1) and 8-12 kg P ha(-1) and that of floating macrophytes between 14-19 kg N ha(-1) and 4-5 kg P ha(-1) which is in the range of waste water treatment plants. We found the N and P stock in the biomass of aquatic macrophytes being 20-900 times and up to eight times higher compared to the nutrient amount of the open water body in the shallow lakes of rewetted fens (average depth: 0.5 m). Thereafter, submersed and floating macrophytes accumulate substantial amounts of dissolved nutrients released from highly decomposed surface peat layers, moderating the nutrient load of the shallow lakes during the growing season from April to October. In addition, the risk of nutrient loss to adjacent surface waters becomes reduced during this period. The removal of submersed macrophytes in rewetted fens to accelerate the restoration of the low nutrient status is discussed.					; Zak, Dominik/GFL-5719-2022; Schulz, Katja/AAH-7987-2021	Zak, Dominik/0000-0002-1229-5294; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				AUG	2012	692	1					99	109		10.1007/s10750-011-0833-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-011-0833-y													WOS:000305215700009

Fire and climate change impacts on lowland forest composition in northern Congo during the last 2580 years from palaeoecological analyses of a seasonally flooded swamp	HOLOCENE												The mixed semi-evergreen forests in lowland central equatorial Africa can contain many elements of secondary vegetation. This raises the question of what factors have determined the current forest composition in this region. Is this forest in the process of succession after natural climatic variation and/or anthropogenic disturbances in the past, or is it a stable forest type? This paper presents a multiproxy palaeoecological analysis of a sedimentary sequence taken from a small sedimentary basin located in logged semi-evergreen lowland forest in northern Congo-Brazzaville which addresses these questions. Analyses undertaken included fossil pollen, geochemical and microscopic charcoal. Geochemical results were interpreted as a proxy for rainfall, and showed that northem Congo has experienced changes in rainfall during the past 2580 years, while microscopic charcoal concentrations indicated increased burring from approximately 1240 cal. yr BP to the present. Analysis of the fossil pollen assemblages showed that although light-demanding taxa were a major constituent of this forest throughout the sequence, shade-tolerant taxa were more abundant in the forest prior to 1345 cal. yr BP. Increases in aridity and/or droughts after 1345 cal. yr BP, and an increase in fire after 1240 cal. yr BP resulted in a semi-evergreen forest with abundant pioneers that persisted with minor changes in composition during the last 900 years, even during a period of increased rainfall from 400 to 100 cal. yr BP. These data may guide conservation policy by predicting potential consequences of future climate change and the impact of logging.

A case study: Gdynia, Poland (Southern Baltic Sea)	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Annual study on the benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) concentration in aerosols in the coastal zone of the Gulf of Gdansk (southern Baltic) has been performed at Gdynia station. Combustion processes, especially domestic heating of both local and regional origin, were identified as the main sources of benzo(a)pyrene in this area. Concentrations observed during the heating season (mean 2.18 ngm(-3)) were significantly higher than these recorded in the non-heating season (mean 0.05 ngm(-3)). High benzo(a)pyrene concentrations were associated with low temperature and high humidity. Whereas high levels of precipitation usually decreased the BaP concentration in aerosols. The concentration of this factor in the studied area depended also on the wind direction and air masses trajectories. During heating season, continental air masses (coming from S, SE, SW) seemed to increase benzo(a)pyrene concentration, while maritime air masses (from N, NE, NW) caused its decrease. The differences in the BaP concentration resulting from potentially different emission levels of this compound during working and non-working days were not clearly pronounced.					; Bełdowska, Magdalena/AFZ-2912-2022; Saniewska, Dominika/G-1472-2015; Staniszewska, Monika/B-1939-2015	Graca, Bozena/0000-0001-8840-8665; Staniszewska, Marta/0000-0002-2516-6280; Saniewska, Dominika/0000-0002-0630-9602; Beldowska, Magdalena/0000-0002-3585-9283; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2013	20	6					4154	4163		10.1007/s11356-012-1315-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-012-1315-0								23247515					WOS:000318779200063

In this study, net ecosystem production (NEP), community/ecosystem respiration (R), and gross primary production (GPP) rates were estimated in relation to physicochemical and climatic variables for 18 months in La Salada, a saline shallow lake. Net autotrophic conditions prevailed during the study period (NEP: 64.05 +/- A 44.22 mmol O-2 m(-2) day(-1)). GPP and R were positively correlated and were synchronized on a daily timescale, with GPP typically greater than R. Principal component analysis revealed that monthly rates of GPP, R, and NEP responded, as expected, to temperature and light seasonal patterns. Water level and conductivity fluctuations, because of evapoconcentration and water management, were relevant as a driver of the physicochemical and biological characteristics of the lake. In saline lakes as La Salada, an adequate management of water resources will be relevant to maintain the ecosystem equilibrium and the quality of its resources.					; Perillo, GME/AAV-3784-2021; Alfonso, Maria/JNS-2767-2023	Perillo, Gerardo/0000-0002-1200-5138; Piccolo, Maria Cintia/0000-0002-5184-9149; Perillo, Vanesa/0000-0002-6031-3119; Alfonso, Maria Belen/0000-0003-0543-8098													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2015	752	1					223	237		10.1007/s10750-014-2092-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-014-2092-1													WOS:000352652500017

Secretive Marsh Bird Species Co-Occurrences and Habitat Associations Across the Midwest, USA	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Because secretive marsh birds are difficult to detect, population status and habitat use for these birds are not well known. We conducted repeated surveys for secretive marsh birds across 264 sites in the Upper Mississippi River and Great Lakes Joint Venture region to estimate abundance, occupancy, and detection probabilities during the 2008 and 2009 breeding seasons. We identified species groups based on observed species co-occurrences. Two species, least bittern Ixobrychus exilis and American bittern Botaurus lentiginosus, co-occurred with other species less often than expected by chance, and two species groups, rails (Virginia rail Rallus limicola and sora Porzana carolina) and open-water birds (pied-billed grebe Podilymbus podiceps, common moorhen Gallinula chloropus, and American coot Fulica americana; coots were only surveyed in 2009), co-occurred more often than expected by chance. These groupings were consistent between years. We then estimated the relation of these species and groups to landscape and local site characteristics by using zero-inflated abundance models that accounted for incomplete detection. At the landscape level (5-km radius), the amount of emergent herbaceous wetland was positively associated with least bittern occupancy, whereas the amount of woody wetland was negatively associated with least bittern, rail, and open-water bird occupancy. At the local level, habitat variables that were associated with abundance were not consistent among groups or between years, with the exception that both least bitterns and open-water birds had a strong positive association between abundance and water-vegetation interspersion. Land managers interested in marsh bird management or conservation may want to consider focusing efforts on landscapes with high amounts of emergent herbaceous wetland and low amounts of woody wetland, and managing for high amounts of water-vegetation interspersion within the wetland.					; Lehnen, Sarah/OFM-5974-2025	Lehnen, Sarah/0000-0003-0337-5070; 													1944-687X					JUN	2011	2	1					49	60		10.3996/012011-JFWM-001	http://dx.doi.org/10.3996/012011-JFWM-001													WOS:000311625000007

The majority of the world's freshwater area is shallow, typically <= 3 m deep, and polymictic. Freshwaters are rather versatile in their use and have great economical and conservation value. They can be/are often dominated by littoral communities as the water depth is generally shallow enough to support the growth of submerged macrophytes, and the species richness of invertebrates, fish and waterfowl communities is more diverse than in deep lakes. Eutrophication or nutrient enrichment affects the entire aquatic system by altering trophic structure, biodiversity and biogeochemical cycles, as well as seasonal dynamics. In shallow lakes with low nutrient concentrations (<0.025 mg TP L-1), a clear state dominated by submerged plants often occurs as phytoplankton is nutrient limited. In north temperate shallow lakes, the TP range for coexistence of alternative states varies from ca. 0.025 to ca. 0.15 mg TP L-1. In these lakes, submerged plants stabilize the clear water state through several physico-chemical buffer mechanisms of which some have proven to be weak in warm lakes. An abrupt shift to a turbid state may occur after surpassing a lake-specific nutrient threshold. In warm lakes, internal nutrient cycling is relatively more important and external loading relatively less important than in cold temperate lakes. Warm lakes tend to be more productive than cold lakes with similar nutrient concentrations. With a diverse and abundant omnivorous fish community, the predation pressure on zooplankton is strong, top-down control becomes less important and nutrient control thus emerges as a decisive factor for the water clarity. For cold lakes, restoration methods encompass both bottom-up and top-down controls; however, for warm lakes bottom-up or nutrient control methods appear to be most significant for eutrophication control. As for climate change, warming is likely to exacerbate some symptoms of eutrophication in both cold and warm climates. The structure and functioning of cold temperate shallow lakes are expected to become more similar to those of (sub)tropical shallow lakes, as the temperature increase will enhance the top-down controls of omnivorous and benthivorous fish as well as the nutrient cycling.					beklioglu, meryem/ABA-1630-2020; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019; Søndergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019; Jeppesen, Erik/A-4463-2012; Sondergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019	Jeppesen, Erik/0000-0002-0542-369X; Sondergaard, Martin/0000-0002-1514-0482															978-90-481-9624-1				2011							91	108		10.1007/978-90-481-9625-8_4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-9625-8_4	10.1007/978-90-481-9625-8												WOS:000283620400004

Contrasting the influences of stream inputs and landscape position on bacterioplankton community structure and dissolved organic matter composition in high- elevation lake chains	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We examined bacterioplankton community composition (BCC; using polymerase chain reaction-based phylogenetic fingerprinting) and the composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM; using scanning fluorometry) within lake chains in high-elevation catchments of the Sierra Nevada, California. We compared temporal BCC dynamics in two connected cirque lakes and their inlets and found that lake : inlet community similarity of both lakes declined with increasing residence time because of seasonal snowpack melting. However, for over 3 yr the headwater lake remained distinct from its inlet even during peak snowmelt (residence time < 5 d), whereas the downstream lake was consistently similar to both its inlet and the upstream lake. We subsequently sampled 17 lake chains (4-8 lakes each) throughout the Sierra Nevada longitudinally to examine how landscape position and catchment characteristics influenced the similarity in BCC and DOM among lakes and their connecting streams. Headwater lakes were significantly less similar to their inlet streams than were downstream lakes. BCC was heterogeneous throughout each catchment, but headwater inlet BCC was consistently distinct from all downstream samples. In contrast, DOM exhibited a trend of increasing homogeneity as water moved downstream: upstream and downstream waters were distinct but without clear headwater outliers. The similarity in BCC and DOM between any two lakes within a chain declined with geographic distance. Our results illustrate the contrasting roles of environmental selection and dispersal in structuring bacterioplankton communities, supporting both strong within-lake environmental selection for communities distinct from terrigenous inputs and a weaker effect of geographic dispersal differentiating communities among lakes linked by advective flow.					; Nelson, Craig/H-3323-2019; Sadro, Steven/AGC-7944-2022	Sadro, Steven/0000-0002-6416-3840; Nelson, Craig/0000-0003-2525-3496; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	2009	54	4					1292	1305		10.4319/lo.2009.54.4.1292	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2009.54.4.1292													WOS:000268325100022

Yet our knowledge of these microbial communities in wild fish populations in their natural ecosystems is insufficient. This study systematically examined the gut microbial communities of seven wild fish species in Chaohu Lake, a fishing-restricted area with minimal water turnover, across four seasons. We found significant variations in gut microbial community structures among species. Additionally, we observed significant seasonal and regional variations in the gut microbial communities. The Chaohu Lake fish gut microbial communities were predominantly composed of the phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria(Gamma), Proteobacteria(Alpha), Actinobacteriota, and Cyanobacteria. At the genus level, Aeromonas, Cetobacterium, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Romboutsia, and Pseudomonas emerged as the most prevalent. A co-occurrence network analysis revealed that C. auratus, C. carpio, and C. brachygnathus possessed more complex and robust gut microbial networks than H. molitrix, C. alburnus, C. ectenes taihuensis, and A. nobilis. Certain microbial groups, such as Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Romboutsia, and Pseudomonas, were both dominant and keystone in the fish gut microbial network. Our study offers a new approach for studying the wild fish gut microbiota in natural, controlled environments. It offers an in-depth understanding of gut microbial communities in wild fish living in stable, limited water exchange natural environments.

Lake Ice From Historical Records to Contemporary Science	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Lake ice phenology is a critical component of the cryosphere and a sensitive indicator of climate change that has some of the longest records related to climate science. Records commenced for numerous reasons including navigation, hydropower development, and individual curiosity, demonstrating the value of lake ice as a seasonal event of significant importance to a broad swath of peoples and countries. At the same time, lake ice loss has been rapid and widespread with lakes losing ice at an average rate of 17 days per century. In this Perspective, we examine the earliest known records of ice cover and the scientific studies that developed from that practice of record keeping. Studies in lake ice began in the nineteenth Century and have included relationships between climate, biology, and ice cover. Early studies developed some of the foundational principles that limnologists and climate scientists are still exploring, such as the relationship between ice phenology and climate variables, large-scale climate oscillations, and morphological characteristics, with implications for lake ice physical structure and under-ice ecosystems in a warming climate. We conclude with an examination of the state of the field and how these centuries-long lake ice records can continue to inform cutting edge science by validating satellite remote sensing techniques, in addition to modeling approaches and collaborations across disciplines, that can improve our understanding of the loss of lake ice in a warmer world. The extensive study of lake ice began in the 1800s along with the collection of many long-term ice records Lake ice has long been used and understood as a sensitive indicator of climate change and variability Opportunities abound for harmonizing diverse data, modeling approaches, and connecting research ideas across all cryospheric components					; Culpepper, Joshua/ITV-3885-2023	Sharma, Sapna/0000-0003-4571-2768; Culpepper, Joshua/0000-0002-0468-0539; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				APR	2024	129	4							e2023JG007670	10.1029/2023JG007670	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023JG007670													WOS:001193979600001

A good understanding of the relationship between fish communities, hydrological dynamics, and other water environment factors in these waters is important. In this study we examined the status of fish resources in the river-lake transitional zone of Poyang Lake, from 2021 to 2022. We collected 3880 fish individuals, belonging to five orders, ten families, and 54 species. The largest number of fish species were cypriniformes, accounting for 64.81% of the total number of fish species. Overall, the composition of fish species was mainly carnivorous fish, demersal fish, resident fish, and viscous egg fish. According to the relative importance index, there were eight dominant species (including Coilia brachygnathus and Megalobrama mantschuricus). Fish species was more abundant and community structure was more complex during the flood period and in the downstream area. The regional differences in the fish community in the river-lake transitional zone of Poyang Lake were significant, whereas seasonal differences were not significant. Our analysis showed that the water level and flow correlated significantly with the Margalef richness index and Shannon-Wiener diversity index. Redundancy analysis showed that pH, oxidation-reduction potential, dissolved oxygen, and the water level were key environmental factors affecting the spatiotemporal variation of fish species composition and community structure. This led to the conclusion that high water levels in the flood period and in the downstream area are important factors affecting the river-lake transitional zone of Poyang Lake. Taken together, the results of this study support the protection and management of fish resources in the river-lake transitional zone of Poyang Lake.

In this study, the updated process-based Barman model was applied to three reservoirs of the Seine Basin during 2019-2020, considering the variations of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations and key water quality variables. The model simulations captured well the observed seasonal variations of water quality variables, although discrepancies remained for some variables. According to the model, we found that: (1) the three reservoirs are autotrophic ecosystems and showed high removal efficiency of dissolved inorganic carbon and nutrients during 2019-2020; (2) phytoplankton assimilation, benthic denitrification, precipitation and dissolution of calcium carbonate, and gas exchange at the water-air interface are the dominant processes for water quality variations in reservoirs; (3) based on scenarios results, trophic state and mean water depth of reservoir would impact the biogeochemical processes and the retention efficiency of nitrate and dissolved silicate. Finally, we expect that the successful application of Barman model in the reservoirs of the Seine Basin could provide a useful tool for simulating reservoir water quality changes and thus evaluating the impacts of reservoirs on downstream water quality.					; Yan, Xingcheng/JNE-4605-2023; Garnier, Josette/T-2111-2019	WANG, Shuaitao/0000-0002-1145-5938; Thieu, Vincent/0000-0002-5753-8624													0043-1354	1879-2448				OCT 15	2022	225								119135	10.1016/j.watres.2022.119135	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.119135		SEP 2022						36155003					WOS:000870161400005

Ecological Status as the Basis for the Holistic Environmental Flow Assessment of a Tropical Highland River in Ethiopia	WATER												There is an increasing need globally to establish relationships among flow, ecology, and livelihoods to make informed decisions about environmental flows. This paper aimed to establish the ecological foundation for a holistic environmental flow assessment method in the Gumara River that flows into Lake Tana in Ethiopia and the Blue Nile River. First, the ecological conditions (fish, macro-invertebrate, riparian vegetation, and physicochemical) of the river system were characterized, followed by determining the hydrological condition and finally linking the ecological and hydrological components. The ecological data were collected at 30 sites along the Gumara River on March 2016 and 2020. River hydrology was estimated using the SWAT model and showed that the low flow decreased over time. Both physico-chemical and macroinvertebrate scores showed that water quality was moderate in most locations. The highest fish diversity index was in the lower reach at Wanzaye. Macroinvertebrate diversity was observed to decrease downstream. Both the fish and macroinvertebrate diversity indices were less than the expected maximum, being 3.29 and 4.5, respectively. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for 30 m and 60 m buffer distances from the river decreased during the dry season (March-May). Hence, flow conditions, water quality, and land-use change substantially influenced the abundance and diversity of fish, vegetation, and macroinvertebrate species. The pressure on the ecology is expected to increase because the construction of the proposed dam is expected to alter the flow regime. Thus, as demand for human water consumption grows, measures are needed, including quantification of environmental flow requirements and regulating river water uses to conserve the ecological status of the Gumara River and Lake Tana sub-basin.					; Atanaw, Fasikaw/AGL-4262-2022; Abebe, wubneh/E-7774-2019; Moges, Michael/HGC-1516-2022; Mhiret, Demesew/KUC-9862-2024; Abebe, Wubneh Belete/GXG-2437-2022; Tilahun, Seifu/ABE-2501-2020; Abera, Wuletawu/JBS-3008-2023; Adem, Anwar/F-2612-2018; Assefa, Workiye/ABB-8710-2020	Tilahun, Seifu/0000-0002-5219-4527; steenhuis, tammo/0000-0003-0508-9350; Adem, Anwar Assefa/0000-0001-6374-745X; Gitaw, Minychl/0000-0003-2778-6210; Assefa, Workiyie Worie/0000-0002-4029-9022; Alemaw Mhiret, Demesew/0000-0002-6318-3612; Abebe, Wubneh Belete/0000-0003-2072-7146; Abera, Wuletawu/0000-0002-3657-5223; Zimale, Fasikaw/0000-0001-9778-2712; 														2073-4441				JUL	2021	13	14							1913	10.3390/w13141913	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13141913													WOS:000677082800001

Remote Sensing (RS) may provide new opportunities to integrate with situ traditional monitoring techniques. Nonetheless, wide regional and temporal variability in freshwater optical constituents makes it difficult to design universally applicable RS protocols. Here, we assessed the potential of two neural networks-based models, namely the Case 2 Regional CoastColour (C2RCC) processor and the Mixture Density Network (MDN), applied to MSI Sentinel-2 data for monitoring Chlorophyll (Chl) content in three monomictic volcanic lakes while accounting for the effect of their specific water circulation pattern on the remotely-sensed and in situ data relation. Linear mixed models were used to test the relationship between the remote sensing indices calculated through C2RCC (I-NN) and MDN (I-MDN), and in situ Chl concentration. Both indices proved to explain a large portion of the variability in the field data and exhibited a positive and significant relationship between Chl concentration and satellite data, but only during the mixing phase. The significant effect of the water circulation period can be explained by the low responsiveness of the RS approaches applied here to the low phytoplankton biomass, typical of the stratification phase. Sentinel-2 data proved their valuable potential for the remote sensing of phytoplankton in small inland water bodies, otherwise challenging with previous sensors. However, caution should be taken, since the applicability of such an approach on certain water bodies may depend on hydrological and ecological parameters (e.g., thermal stratification and seasonal nutrient availability) potentially altering RS chlorophyll detection by neural networks-based models, despite their alleged global validity.

Volcanic lake temperatures and geochemical compositions therefore typically serve as warnings for resumed unrest or prior to eruptions. If acidic and hot, these lakes are usually considered to be too convective to allow any stratification within their waters. Kawah ljen volcano, featuring the largest hyperacidic lake on Earth (volume of 27 million m(3)), is less homogeneous than previously thought. Hourly temperature measurements reveal the development of a stagnant layer of cold waters (<30 degrees C), overlying warmer and denser water (generally above 30 degrees C and density similar to 1.083 kg/m(3)). Examination of 20 yrs of historical records and temporary measurements show a systematic thermal stratification during rainy seasons. The yearly rupture of stratification at the end of the rainy season causes a sudden release of dissolved gases below the cold water layer which appears to generate a lake overturn, i.e. limnic eruption, and a resonance of the lake, i.e. a seiche, highlighting a new hazard for these extreme reservoirs. A minor non-volcanic event, such as a heavy rainfall or an earthquake, may act as a trigger. The density driven overturn requires specific salinity temperature conditions for the colder and less saline top water layer to sink into the hot saline water. Spectacular degassing occurs when the dissolved gases, progressively stored during the rainy season due to a weakened diffusion of carbon dioxide in the top layer, are suddenly released.

A circumpolar perspective of atmospheric organochlorine pesticides (OCPs): Results from six Arctic monitoring stations in 2000-2003	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Air concentrations of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) were measured on a weekly basis in 2000-2003 at six Arctic stations, which include Alert, Kinngait, and Little Fox Lake in Canada; Point Barrow in the USA; Valkarkai in Russia; and Zeppelin in Norway. These stations cover a large region in the Arctic, providing a comprehensive perspective on OCPs in the circumpolar atmosphere. Currently used pesticide endosulfan I had similar concentrations across the stations in November-May, whereas large spatial divergence was found in June-October. This implies the extensive usage of endosulfan during summertime followed by long-range transport to the Arctic. The median air concentration of endosulfan I was 3.2 pg m(-3) (n = 245). Seasonally and spatially uniform concentrations of legacy chlordane-related compounds indicated that the influence of primary emissions on Arctic air has become less important than volatilization emissions. Median air concentrations (pg m(-3)) of trans-chlordane, cis-chlordane, trans-nonachlor, oxychlordane, and heptachlor exo-epoxide were 0.20 (n = 413), 0.58 (n = 413), 0.44 (n = 413), 0.30 (n = 245), and 0.54 (n = 244), respectively. Although extensive usage was banned in the 1970s, large spatial variations reflected that DDT-related compounds were not well mixed in Arctic air. Concentrations of DDT-related compounds were low in general, and median concentrations of p,p'-DDT, o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE, o,p'-DDE, and Sigma 4DDT were 0.10, 0.18, 0.37, 0.10, and 0.79 pg m(-3) (n = 418), respectively. Air concentrations of pentachloroanisole and dieldrin showed strong seasonal/spatial variations with median values of 3.8 and 0.48 pg m(-3) (n = 245). Uniform concentrations were observed for octachlorostyrene with a median of 0.32 pg m(-3) (n = 245). Arctic air concentrations of other measured OCPs, such as endrin, heptachlor, methoxychlor, mirex, photomirex, tetrachloroveratrole, trichloroveratrol, and trifluralin, were generally low and mostly below method detection limits.

However, most research was performed on specific processes and did not consider ecosystem 'multifunctionality'. There is also little information on the relationship between genetic and functional diversity. To analyze this relationship, we performed a microcosm experiment on a complex lake assemblage of decomposers, in the presence of the green alga Scenedesmus obliquus, which acted as carbon source for decomposers. By manipulating nutrient enrichment and the N : P input ratio, we observed that the structures of particle-associated and free bacterial assemblages were highly predictable in response to stoichiometric constraints. For a given treatment, the taxonomic compositions of free and particle-associated bacterial communities appeared close to each other only when phosphorus was not depleted. A coinertia analysis revealed a clear coupling between the genetic diversity of the microbial community, assessed using PCR-denatured gradient gel electrophoresis, and its potential functional diversity, studied with Biolog Ecoplates. This suggests that an ecologically relevant fraction of bacterial communities is characterized by lower level of redundancy than frequently thought, highlighting the necessity of exploring further the role of biodiversity in multifunctionality within ecosystems.					; Leflaive, Josephine/F-2075-2018; Ten-Hage, Loïc/T-2789-2019; Lyautey, Emilie/OEM-8549-2025	Lyautey, Emilie/0000-0003-0754-197X; Leflaive, Josephine/0000-0003-3605-349X; 													0168-6496					NOV	2008	66	2					379	390		10.1111/j.1574-6941.2008.00593.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.2008.00593.x								18811649					WOS:000260051300018

Thus, in this study, we investigated the bioaccumulation of three MC congeners (-LR,-RR and -YR) in the chironomid larvae of Tanypus chinensis (an excellent food source for certain fishes), the potential sources of these MCs, and potentially relevant environmental parameters over the course of one year in Lake Taihu, China. MC concentrations in T. chinensis varied temporally with highest concentrations during the warmest months (except August 2013) and very low concentrations during the remaining months. Among the three potential MC sources, only intracellular MCs were significantly and positively correlated with MCs in T. chinensis. Although MC concentrations in T. chinensis significantly correlated with a series of physicochemical parameters of water column, cyanobacteria species explained the most variability of MC accumulation, with the rest primarily explained by extraMC-LR. These results indicated that ingestion of MC-producing algae of cyanobacteria accounted for most of the MC that accumulated in T. chinensis. The high MC concentrations in T. chinensis may pose a potential health threat to humans through trophic transfer.

Interactions of temperature and nutrient changes: effects on phytoplankton in the Piburger See (Tyrol, Austria)	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Contemporary limnological and palaeolimnological data from Piburger See (Eastern Alps, Austria) allowed the reconstruction of its trophic state since the late 19th century and the assessment of changes in phytoplankton biomass and species composition in relation to selected environmental parameters. 2. A radiometrically dated sediment core from Piburger See was analysed for geochemical parameters, spheroidal carbonaceous particles (SCPs), bacterial and algal pigments, and diatoms. The low SCP sediment inventory assigns Piburger See to the cleaner sites in Europe with respect to fossil-fuel related air pollution. The sedimentary pigment and diatom record reveals moderate eutrophication during the 20th century, followed by a slow re-oligotrophication since the mid-1980s because of lake restoration starting in 1970. 3. Epilimnetic temperature for Piburger See was reconstructed using air temperature records. A pronounced temperature increase has been recorded during the mid-1940s and since the late-20th century, both promoting algal growth and changes in species composition (e.g. increase in centric diatoms and recent bloom of Asterionella formosa). 4. Climate scenarios project additional substantial warming for this mountain lake by the end of the 21st century which will be most pronounced during the growing season. The predicted change in lake water temperature and thermal dynamics represents a key driver for the trophic and ecological status of Piburger See in the future.

Besides, the water masses of these waterbodies reflect the balance of the rainfall and evaporation with Surface and ground waters. The lake's water Volume is estimated combining water level variations with accurate bathymetry and shore topography maps Lake Izabal is the largest waterbody of Guatemala (approximately 673 29 km(2)) Its water volume has been estimated in the past but the volume variations are still unknown The lake water level variations are monitored in situ since 2004, but regrettably accurate information about the bathymetry and shore topography is not available The main objective Of this Study was to make a first estimate of the Lake Izabal water Volume variations To do this, we combined level variations and Inundated area variations The lack of accurate bathymetry and topography maps was overcame by using Inundated area variations in the assumption that every level change reflects an inundated area response. depending on bathymetry and shore topography The level variations were estimated from an in Situ moored gauged in the lake and from the ENVISAT Radar Altimeter (RA-2). The inundated area variations were obtained using 12 ENVISAT Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) images. Prior to the area estimates the lake's shoreline was extracted making Use of a chain of existing image processing algorithms. The correlation analysis between in situ lake levels and inundated area variations yielded a correlation coefficient of 0 9 The volume variations of the lake were then estimated on the dates of the acquired SAR images Then, a group of rating curves relating level, area and volume were developed In order to extend the area and Volume estimates to the whole Study time period (February 2003 to December 2006) the lake levels from the RA-2 dataset were entered to the rating curves The estimated water volume variations of Lake Izabal range between 8271 2 x 10(6) m(3) (17th December of 2005) and 9018 15 x 10(6) m(3) (15th July of 2006) in agreement with the most recent estimation of the Lake Izabal water Volume (8300 x 10(6) m(3)) Regarding the Inundated area variations, they range between 672 44 x 10(6) m(2) (17th December of 2005) and 677.2 x 10(6) m(2) (15th July of 2006) in agreement with the Guatemalan government information (673.29 km(2)) The water volume, inundated area and water level fluctuations of the Lake Izabal show a strong seasonal signal with high stages during the rainy season (May-November) and low stages during the dry seasons (December-April) These results give valuable information for the Lake Izabal management and strengthen the idea of using remote sensing as a powerful and cheap complementary tool for hydrologic purposes (C) 2009 Elsevier B V All rights reserved					Gómez-Enri, Jesús/G-2726-2010; del Rosario, Jose/AAU-2288-2020; Gomez-Enri, Jesus/G-2726-2010	Gomez-Enri, Jesus/0000-0001-6053-5160; Villares Duran, Maria Pilar/0000-0002-4946-8072													0022-1694	1879-2707				MAR 1	2010	382	1-4					34	48		10.1016/j.jhydrol.2009.12.016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2009.12.016													WOS:000275769000004

Manchar Lake, located in the arid part of Pakistan, is one of the most vulnerable freshwater lakes and has continuously been exposed to direct pollutants influx. Its vulnerability demands an assessment of pollution loads of trace elements in bed sediments. This study was carried out with sediment samples from 21 locations. Nine trace elements (As, Pb, Fe, Cr, Hg, Cu, Ni, Mn, and Zn) were detected using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry. Pollution load-related analytical approaches were applied to estimate the contamination loads of individual elements and the aggregated ecological risks. Overall, the mean concentrations of all trace elements in lakebed sediments were detected as: As 5.4, Pb 2.2, Cr 17, Cu 1.5, Fe 165.1, Hg 0.028, Mn 2.6, Ni 7.5, and Zn 64.9 in mg/kg. Results revealed that the lakebed sediment is significantly polluted, primarily with Fe, Zn, Hg, Cr, and As. The spread of these trace elements also varies across locations as many locations do not receive polluted water during dry seasons due to the low water level in the lake. The ecological risk assessment and multivariate analysis findings establish that the Main Nara Valley Drain comprising drainage water from agricultural fields and in part from municipalities is the greatest pollution source to the lake. This dangerous pollution problem calls for action to restore the purity of the natural lake ecosystem.

J	Yihdego, Y; Reta, G; Becht, R				Yihdego, Yohannes; Reta, Gebrehiwet; Becht, Robert			Hydrological analysis as a technical tool to support strategic and economic development: A case study of Lake Navaisha, Kenya	WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL												Effective integrated water resources management requires reliable estimation of an overall basin water budget and of hydrologic fluctuations between groundwater and surface-water resources. Seasonal variability of groundwater-surface water exchange fluxes impacts on the water balance. The long term lake water balance was calculated by Modflow using the stage-volume rating curve of Lake Package LAK3. The long term average storage volume change is 8.4 x 10(8) m(3)/month. The lake water balances suggests that the lake is not in equilibrium with the inflow and outflow terms. Using field abstraction data analysis and model simulation, the combined volume of lake-groundwater used for industrial abstraction since the last three decades was estimated. This requires an average abstraction amount of 7.0x 10(6) m(3)/month with a long term trend of abstraction ratio 30% (groundwater) and 70% (lake water) since 1980. The amount resulted in a lake which might have been 4.8 m higher than was observed in the last stress period (2010). A long term regional groundwater budget is calculated reflecting all water flow in to and out of the regional aquifer. The model water balance suggests that lake Navaisha basin is in equilibrium with a net outflow about 1% greater than the inflow over the calibrated period of time (1932-2010). The regional model is best used for broad-scale predictions and can be used to provide a general sense of groundwater to surface water and groundwater to groundwater impacts in the basin. Abasin wide water resource management strategy can be designed by integrating the lake/wetland within the regional groundwater model to increase the level of sustainable production and good stewardship in Lake Navaisha. Such hydrological analysis is crucial in making the model serve as simulator of the response of lake stage to hydraulic stresses applied to the aquifer and variation in climatic condition.

J	Mohammed, KA; Mahran, BN				Mohammed, Khadra Ahmed; Mahran, Belal Nodhy			Environmental studies on phytoplankton diversity in drainage water of main drains in Eastern Delta, case study	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC RESEARCH												In order to monitor the ecological status of the largest Egyptian northern drains, an environmental comparison is performed between Bahr El Baqar Drain and Hadous Drain based on water quality and the community composition of their phytoplankton groups to assess the environmental hazard impacts on Lake Manzala. From both drains during the period 2015-2020 (5 years average), fourteen parameters were seasonally recorded; Hydrogen Ion, biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, electric conductivity, total suspended solids, total dissolved solids, bicarbonates, cations and anions (nitrates, sulfates, Calcium, Sodium, Potassium, Magnesium and Chloride), as well as seven heavy metal parameters (Copper, Iron, Manganese, Nickel, Lead, Boron, and Zinc). Statistically, phytoplankton seasonal dominance and abundance, diversity indices, species richness, evenness, Shannon and Simpson indices, and Pearson correlation were statistically calculated. The results showed that the average values of pH, HCO3, BOD, COD, EC, TSS, TDS, NO3, anions and cations in Bahr El Baqar Drain were higher than those in Hadous Drain. Phytoplankton groups in both drains belonged to five major groups with a descending order of dominance; Cyanophyta > Chlorophyta > Bacillariophyta > Euglenophyta > Dinophyta. Bicarbonates positively correlated with Chlorophyceae (evenness = 0.871, Shannon = 2.029), Cyanophyceae (1.964, 0.853), Euglenophycea (0.857, 1.535), and Dinophyceae (0.836, 0.918). BOD and COD positively correlated with Nitzschia sp., Euglena velata, and Peridinium volzii, and negatively correlated with Amphora sp., Euglena viridis, and Ceratium hirundinella. Chlorophyceae correlated positively with K, Mg, Cl, SO4 and NO3. Cyanophyceae correlated negatively with K, Mg, Na, B, Cl and SO4. Bacillariophycea positively correlated with Ni and NO3. Dinophyceae negatively correlated with Cl and SO4. Phytoplankton species expressed different dominance, diversity indices and statistical correlation with each water quality parameter, which reflected the selectivity and growth manners of algae. From the former mentioned results, it was concluded that the phytoplankton groups are very sensitive and useful indicator of the health status of any water stream. Concerning the bad quality of water in Bahr El Baqar Drain and Hadous Drain, management plan should be implemented for both drains, in particularly Bahr El Baqar Drain, to preserve the environmental status of Lake Manzala.

Characterisation of Bolivian savanna ecosystems by their modern pollen rain and implications for fossil pollen records	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												The majority of vegetation reconstructions from the Neotropics are derived from fossil pollen records extracted from lake sediments. However, the interpretation of these records is restricted by limited knowledge of the contemporary relationships between the vegetation and pollen rain of Neotropical ecosystems, especially for more open vegetation such as savannas. This research aims to improve the interpretation of these records by investigating the vegetation and modern pollen rain of different savanna ecosystems in Bolivia using vegetation inventories, artificial pollen traps and surface lake sediments. Two types of savanna were studied, upland savannas (cerrado), occurring on well drained soils, and seasonally-inundated savannas occurring on seasonally water-logged soils. Quantitative vegetation data are used to identify taxa that are floristically important in the different savanna types and to allow modern pollen/ vegetation ratios to be calculated. Artificial pollen traps from the upland savanna site are dominated by Moraceae (35%), Poaceae (30%), Alchornea (6%) and Cecropia (4%). The two seasonally-inundated savanna sites are dominated by Moraceae (37%), Poaceae (20%), Alchornea (8%) and Cecropia (7%), and Moraceae (25%), Cyperaceae (22%), Poaceae (19%) and Cecropia (9%), respectively. The modern pollen rain of seasonally-inundated savannas from surface lake sediments is dominated by Cyperaceae (35%), Poaceae (33%), Moraceae (9%) and Asteraceae (5%). Upland and seasonally-flooded savannas were found to be only subtly distinct from each other palynologically. All sites have a high proportion of Moraceae pollen due to effective wind dispersal of this pollen type from areas of evergreen forest close to the study sites. Modern pollen/vegetation ratios show that many key woody plant taxa are absent/under-represented in the modern pollen rain (e.g., Caryocar and Tabebuia). The lower-than-expected percentages of Poaceae pollen, and the scarcity of savanna indicators, in the modern pollen rain of these ecosystems mean that savannas could potentially be overlooked in fossil pollen records without consideration of the full pollen spectrum available.

We analyzed eddy covariance-based evaporation measurements from the Ross Barnett Reservoir (32 degrees 26'N, 90 degrees 02'W; which is always ice-free) in central Mississippi during the cool months (i.e., September-March) of 2007 and 2008, and found that the variability in cold front activities (i.e., passages of cold fronts and cold/dry air masses behind cold fronts) played an important role in modulating the exchange of sensible (H) and latent (lambda E) heat fluxes. Our analysis showed that 2007's warmer cool season had smaller mean H and lambda E than 2008's cooler cool season. This implies hat the warmer cool season did not accelerate evaporation and heat exchange between the water surface and the atmosphere. Instead, more frequent cold fronts and longer periods of cold/dry air masses behind the cold fronts in 2008 resulted in overall larger H and lambda E as compared with 2007, this primarily taking the form of sporadic short-term rapid 'pulses' of H and lambda E losses from the water's surface. These results suggest that future climate-induced changes in frequency of cold fronts and the meteorological properties of the air masses behind cold fronts (e.g., wind speeds, temperature, and humidity), rather than other factors of climate change, would produce significant variations in the water surface's energy fluxes and subsequent evaporation rates.					; Vesala, Timo/C-3795-2017	BLANKEN, PETER/0000-0002-7405-2220; Vesala, Timo/0000-0002-4852-7464													1748-9326					APR-JUN	2011	6	2							024022	10.1088/1748-9326/6/2/024022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/6/2/024022													WOS:000295326800022
J	Magny, M; Leuzinger, U; Bortenschlager, S; Haas, JN				Magny, M; Leuzinger, U; Bortenschlager, S; Haas, JN			Tripartite climate reversal in Central Europe 5600-5300 years ago	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												The history of variations in water level of Lake Constance, as reconstructed from sediment and pollen analysis of a sediment sequence from the archaeological site of Arbon-Bleiche 3, shows an abrupt rise in lake level dendrochronologically dated to 5375 yr ago (5320 yr relative to AD 1950). This event, paralleled by the destruction of the Neolithic village by fire, provoked the abandonment of this prehistoric lake-shore location established in the former shallow bay of Arbon-Bleiche, and was the last of a series of three episodes of successively higher lake level, the first occurring at 5600-5500 cal yr B.P. The dendrochronologically dated rise event was synchronous with an abrupt increase in atmospheric C-14. This supports the hypothesis of an abrupt climate change forced by varying solar activity. Moreover, the three successive episodes of higher lake level between 5600 and 5300 cal yr B.P. at Arbon-Bleiche 3 coincided with climatic cooling and/or changes in moisture conditions in various regions of both hemispheres. This period corresponds to the mid-Holocene climate transition (onset of the Neoglaciation) and suggests inter-hemispheric linkages for the climate variations recorded at Arbon-Bleiche 3. This mid-Holocene climate reversal may have resulted from complex interactions between changes in orbital forcing, ocean circulation and solar activity. Finally, despite different seasonal hydrological regimes, the similarities between lake-level records from Lake Constance and from Jurassian lakes over the mid-Holocene period point to time scale as a crucial factor in considering the possible impact of climate change on environments.

Amino acid nitrogen isotopic composition patterns in lacustrine sedimenting matter	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Amino acids (AAs) comprise a large fraction of organic nitrogen (N) in plankton and sedimenting matter. Aquatic studies of organic N compounds in general and of AAs in particular, mostly concentrate on marine environments. In order to study the cycling and fate of organic N and AAs in lakes, we measured the N isotopic composition (delta N-15) of bulk organic matter (OM) and of single hydrolysable AAs in sediment trap and sediment samples from two Swiss lakes with contrasting trophic state: Lake Brienz, an oligotrophic lake with an oxic water column, and Lake Zug a eutrophic, meromictic lake. We also measured the N isotopic composition of water column nitrate, the likely inorganic N source during biosynthesis in both lakes. The delta N-15-AA patterns found for the sediment trap material were consistent with published delta N-15-AA data for marine plankton. The AA composition and primary delta N-15-AA signatures are preserved until burial in the sediments. During early sedimentary diagenesis, the delta N-15 values of single AAs appear to increase, exceeding those of the bulk OM. This increase in delta N-15-AA is paralleled by a decreased contribution of AAs to the total OM pool with progressed degradation, suggesting preferential AA degradation associated with a significant N isotope fractionation. Indicators for trophic level based on delta N-15-AAs were determined, for the first time in lacustrine systems. In our samples, the trophic AAs were generally enriched in N-15 compared to source AAs and higher trophic delta N-15-AA values in Lake Zug were consistent with a higher trophic level of the bulk biomass compared to Lake Brienz. Especially the difference between average trophic delta N-15-AAs and average source delta N-15-AAs was sensitive to the trophic states of the two lakes. A proxy for total heterotrophic AA re-synthesis (Sigma V), which is strongly associated with heterotrophic microbial reworking of the OM, was calculated based on delta N-15 values of trophic AAs. Higher Sigma V in Lake Brienz indicate enhanced heterotrophic bacterial reworking of AAs under oligotrophic conditions. Despite changes in the delta N-15-AA values within the sediments, the proxies based on these values were consistent over the studied sediment profile, indicating the preservation of trophic signatures; therefore, our results underscore that delta N-15-AA analysis of sedimentary records represents a promising tool to assess trophic levels and bacterial re-synthesis in lakes.

Water was sampled from the Kuke River flowing out from Koigi Bog (eastern Saaremaa, Estonia) and in comparison the water samples from the bog lake (Lake Pitkjarv) were analyzed regularly during 18 months. Absorptions of water samples were measured at 250, 254, 285, 365 and 436 nm on UV-Vis spectrophotometer and pH, conductivity and concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were measured. Specific ultraviolet absorptions (SUVA) and the ratios of absorptions were calculated to characterize the nature of dissolved organic carbons. The significant changes of the concentration of DOC were determined in water sampled from the Kuke River during the dry days, but it was much steadier during rest sampling time. Analysis of water from the Lake Pitkjarv showed relatively high content of macromolecular organic compounds rich in aromatics (SUVA(254) = 4.58 L mg(-1) m(-1)), whereas water samples from the Kuke River contained predominantly more homogeneous low-molecular-weight materials poor in aromatics (SUVA(254) = 2.96 L mg(-1) m(-1)). Calculated values of SUVA(285) confirmed that organic carbon in river water can be also originated from the decomposition of root litter. The values of ratio of UVA(250)/A(365) for water samples from Kuke River indicated the fulvic nature of DOC as conformed by the SUVA(254) and SUVA(285) values. The values of A(254)/A(436) for river were higher than 14 indicating that the organic matter in water from lake and river contained lots of UV absorbing functional groups. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Trigg, MA; Cook, PG; Brunner, P				Trigg, Mark A.; Cook, Peter G.; Brunner, Philip			Groundwater fluxes in a shallow seasonal wetland pond: The effect of bathymetric uncertainty on predicted water and solute balances	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The successful management of groundwater dependent shallow seasonal wetlands requires a sound understanding of groundwater fluxes. However, such fluxes are hard to quantify. Water volume and solute mass balance models can be used in order to derive an estimate of groundwater fluxes within such systems. This approach is particularly attractive, as it can be undertaken using measurable environmental variables, such as; rainfall, evaporation, pond level and salinity. Groundwater fluxes estimated from such an approach are subject to uncertainty in the measured variables as well as in the process representation and in parameters within the model. However, the shallow nature of seasonal wetland ponds means water volume and surface area can change rapidly and non-linearly with depth, requiring an accurate representation of the wetland pond bathymetry. Unfortunately, detailed bathymetry is rarely available and simplifying assumptions regarding the bathymetry have to be made. However, the implications of these assumptions are typically not quantified. We systematically quantify the uncertainty implications for eight different representations of wetland bathymetry for a shallow seasonal wetland pond in South Australia. The predictive uncertainty estimation methods provided in the Model-Independent Parameter Estimation and Uncertainty Analysis software (PEST) are used to quantify the effect of bathymetric uncertainty on the modelled fluxes. We demonstrate that bathymetry can be successfully represented within the model in a simple parametric form using a cubic Sexier curve, allowing an assessment of bathymetric uncertainty due to measurement error and survey detail on the derived groundwater fluxes compared with the fixed bathymetry models. Findings show that different bathymetry conceptualisations can result in very different mass balance components and hence process conceptualisations, despite equally good fits to observed data, potentially leading to poor management decisions for the wetlands. Model predictive uncertainty increases with the crudity of the bathymetry representation, however, approximations that capture the general shape of the wetland pond such as a power law or Bezier curve show only a small increase in prediction uncertainty compared to the full dGPS surveyed bathymetry, implying these may be sufficient for most modelling purposes.

The coastal lake exhibited much lower concentrations of organic matter and nutrients than the upstream sources. The spectroscopic properties of the lake DOM were easily distinguished from those of the catchment sources as revealed by a lower absorption coefficient, lower degree of humification, and higher spectral slopes. The observed DOM properties suggest that the lake DOM may be dominated by smaller molecular size and less condensed structures. For the lake and the upper streams, higher absorption coefficients and fluorescence peak intensities but lower spectral slopes and humification index were found for the premonsoon versus the monsoon season. However, such seasonal differences were less pronounced for the industrial channels in the upper catchments. Three distinctive fluorophore groups including microbial humic-like, tryptophan-like, and terrestrial humic-like fluorescence were decomposed from the fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) of the DOM samples by parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) modeling. The microbial humic-like component was the most abundant for the industrial channels, suggesting that the component may be associated with anthropogenic organic pollution. The terrestrial humic-like component was predominant for the upper streams, and its relative abundance was higher for the rainy season. Our principal component analysis (PCA) results demonstrated that exchange of seawater and seasonally variable input of allochthonous DOM plays important roles in determining the characteristics of DOM in the lake.

J	Hood, E; Williams, MW; Mcknight, DM				Hood, E; Williams, MW; Mcknight, DM			Sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in a Rocky Mountain stream using chemical fractionation and stable isotopes	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an important vehicle for the movement of nutrients from terrestrial to aquatic systems. To investigate how the source and composition of aquatic DOM change in both space and time, we used chemical, spectroscopic, and isotopic analyses to characterize DOM in a headwater catchment in the Colorado Front Range. Streamwater samples for DOM analyses were collected from 2 sites, a lightly vegetated alpine site and a forested, subalpine site, in the North Boulder Creek catchment during the snowmelt runoff season (May-September). Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) peaked on the ascending limb of the snowmelt hydrograph at both the alpine (2.6 mg C l(-1)) and the subalpine sites (7.0 mg C l(-1)) and decreased sharply on the descending, limb of the hydrograph. Fractionation of DOM into operationally defined humic and non-humic components showed that the fulvic acid content of DOC decreased through the season at both sites and that spectroscopic (fluorescence and ultraviolet) properties of the humic DOM fraction shifted in a manner consistent with an increase in the proportion of humic DOM derived from instream sources as compared to terrestrial catchment sources. Humic and non-humic fractions of DOM isolated near peak flow in June and during low flows in September showed a seasonal enrichment in N-15 and C-13 as well as a seasonal decrease in the ratio of aromatic to aliphatic carbon, both of which were correlated with a decrease in the C:N ratio of the DOM fractions. These results suggest that seasonal shifts in the isotopic and chemical characteristics of DOM are a result of changes in catchment sources of DOM. In particular, it appears that DOM production in alpine lakes is an important contributor to the streamwater DOM load during late season low flows, especially in the alpine reach of the catchment. Our results further suggest that stable isotopes of C and N are useful tools, particularly when combined with ancillary data such as elemental analyses and catchment discharge, for evaluating sources and transformations of DOM at the catchment scale.

More than one third of human cases occurred in Serres regional unit in northern Greece, which is characterized by the presence of a major wetland (Kerkini lake and Strimon river). A total of 2809 Culex pipiens mosquitoes collected in Serres were grouped into 70 pools and tested for WNV. Ten (14.3%) pools were found positive, and all WNV sequences belonged to the Central European subclade of WNV lineage 2. The first human case occurred in a village nearby the lake, and all following cases occurred across the connected river and its tributaries. Similar distribution presented the sites where WNV-positive mosquitoes were detected. The number of Culex spp. mosquitoes per trap per night was higher in 2020 than in previous years (2017-2019). The spatial and temporal distribution of human cases and WNV-positive mosquitoes in 2020 in Serres regional unit suggest that the upsurge of the virus circulation was probably related with factors that affected the ecosystem of the wetland.					; Gewehr, Sandra/LFS-9007-2024; Papadopoulou, Marianna/AAP-5027-2021	PAPA, ANNA/0000-0002-6643-3322; Mourelatos, Spiros/0000-0001-9276-0135; Pappa, Styliani/0000-0002-2249-2443													0001-706X	1873-6254				SEP	2021	221								106010	10.1016/j.actatropica.2021.106010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2021.106010		JUN 2021						34129841					WOS:000677683300006

The Kokemaenjoki River is dominated by great lake basins whereas the Vantaanjoki River has been reported having a significant groundwater component. The mean residence time of the young surface flow component could be resolved by sine function fitting onto the annual fluctuations of the isotopic signal, and the amount of base flow was estimated by using the isotopic composition of the river and groundwater. In this study, we found that the methods work for simple two component catchments. In more complex cases with three different components mixing, the solution becomes increasingly difficult and requires more study.

Semi-automated detection of annual laminae (varves) in lake sediments using a fuzzy logic algorithm	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Annual laminae (varves) in lake sediments are typically visually identified, measured and counted, although numerous attempts have been made to automate this process. The reason for the failure of most of these automated algorithms for varve counting is the complexity of the seasonal laminations, typically rich in lateral fades variations and internal heterogeneities. In the manual counting of varves, the investigator acquired and interpreted flexible numbers of complex decision criteria to understand whether a particular simple lamination is a varve or not. Fuzzy systems simulate the flexible decision making process in a computer by introducing a smooth transition between true varve and false varve. In our investigation, we use an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to detect varves on the basis of a digital image of the sediment. The results of the application of the ANFIS to laminated sediments from the Meerfelder Maar (Eifel, Germany) and from a landslide-dammed lake in the Quebrada de Cafayate of Argentina are compared with manual varve counts and possible reasons for the differences are discussed.

Temperature and depth mediate resource competition and apparent competition between Mysis diluviana and kokanee	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												In many food webs, species in similar trophic positions can interact either by competing for resources or boosting shared predators (apparent competition), but little is known about how the relative strengths of these interactions vary across environmental gradients. Introduced Mysis diluviana shrimp interact with planktivorous fishes such as kokanee salmon (lacustrine Oncorhynchus nerka) through both of these pathways, and effective management depends on understanding which interaction is more limiting under different conditions. An `` environmental matching'' hypothesis predicts the ecological impacts of Mysis are maximized under cool conditions near its thermal optimum. In addition, we hypothesized Mysis is more vulnerable to predation by lake trout in relatively shallow waters, and therefore Mysis enhances lake trout density and limits kokanee through apparent competition more strongly in shallower habitats. We tested whether these hypotheses could explain food web differences between two connected lake basins, one relatively shallow and the other extremely deep. The shallower basin warmed faster, thermally excluded Mysis from surface waters for 75% longer, and supported 2.5-18 times greater seasonal production of cladoceran zooplankton than the deeper basin, standardized by surface area. Mysis consumed 14-22% less zooplankton in the shallower basin, and lower ratios of total planktivore consumption to zooplankton production (C: P) indicated less potential for resource competition with kokanee, consistent with environmental matching. Lake trout diets contained more Mysis in the shallower basin and at shallower sampling sites within both basins. The catch rate of lake trout was seven times greater and the predation risk for kokanee was 4-5 times greater in the shallower basin than in the deeper basin, consistent with stronger apparent competition in shallower habitats. Understanding how the strengths of these interactions are mediated by temperature and depth would enable managers to select appropriate strategies to address the unique combinations of conditions in hundreds of affected systems.

Methane emissions from lakes and floodplains in Pantanal, Brazil	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												To evaluate the tropical wetlands contribution to the methane (CH4) burden better, field campaigns were performed during 2004 and 2005 near the Miranda River, in five sites inside the Brazilian Pantarial region. The CH4 fluxes were determined using the static chamber technique. Environmental variables that may affect. CH4 emissions, as the water depth, the water and air temperatures were also measured. The overall average of the 320 individual CH4 flux measurements made between March/2004 and March/2005 was 142 +/- 314 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1), which is a value near the ones observed in other tropical flooded regions. About 47% of the fluxes measurements presented nonlinear increases in the chamber concentrations, which were assumed to be linked to CH4 losses through bubbles. The bubble flux represented about 90% of the total CH4 losses in the measurements and ranged from 1 to 2187 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) with an average of 292 +/- 410 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) (median: 153 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)). The diffusive flux ranged from 1 to 124 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1), with an average of 10 +/- 17 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) (median: 5 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)). The fluxes from lakes were smaller than those observed in the floodplains, where the flooding was more dependent on the seasonal cycle. The diffusive flux showed a slight, but not statistically significant seasonal variation, following the seasonal variation of the flooding of the Pantanal region. A rough estimative of the total annual CH4 emission show that the contribution of the Pantanal is about 3.3 Tg CH4 yr(-1), which represents about 3.3% of the total CH4 emissions estimated to be originated in wetlands ecosystems. It may be a conservative estimate, which may present a large interannual variation, since it was obtained during one of the lowest flood of the Pantanal in recent years. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Twelve layers intercalated in coals and sands were examined using Hydrogen Index (HI) of Rock Eval analysis, biomarkers in saturated HC fractions, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and stable carbon (delta C-13(org)) and nitrogen (delta N-15(tot)) isotope ratios. The coaly shales showed a wide range of total organic carbon (TOC) content (2.3-30.3 wt%), intermediate to high TOC/TN ratios (14-39) and low total sulfur (TS) contents (<0.3 wt%), suggesting deposition in a freshwater environment occasionally influenced by brackish water. OMs with low to moderate HI (20-204 mg HC/g TOC) were deposited in a shallow terrestrial basin. The HC potentials are high in the middle and lower parts of the succession, with increasing TOC content dominated by terrestrial plants. The higher total HC generation potential up to 60.1 mg HC/g is attributed to coaction of high TOC and HI values. The HI values show good positive correlations with Pr/Ph ratios (r = 0.90), n-C->25/n-C-total alkanes (r = 0.86), phenanthrene (r = 0.75), methylphenanthrene (MP, r = 0.75), Tm/Ts (r = 0.74), sterane C29/C(27+28+29) (r = 0.69), Pr/n-C-17 ratio (r = 0.69) and TS (r = 0.68). The coaly shales also contain abundant retene. Higher delta N-15 ratios coupled with high HI values suggest that the climate had a dry season. Very small amounts of oleanane and low ratios of oleanane/C-30-hopane show negative correlations with HI values (r = -0.68). A significant input of algae and/or planktonic organisms occurred in the upper part of the core, estimated based on regular sterane compositions, but this did not increase the HI values. Relatively abundant hopanes (steranes/hopanes = 0.11-0.40) implied greater contribution of methanogen in the upper part of the succession and increased activity of aerobic bacteria in the middle to lower parts, respectively. Organic maturity is considered to be in the early to medium stage of oil generation, according to C-29 sterane 20S/(20S + 20R) ratios of 0.28-0.49. Based on these results, most OMs originated from ferns, pteridospermic gymnosperms, peat mosses and/or submerged/floating plants, occasionally supplemented by a specific gymnosperm OM with epicuticular wax. Potential of HC generation of these coaly shales probably increased with increasing deposition of liptinite materials. Fluoranthene (Fla), pyrene (Py), benzo[e]pyrene (BePy) and benzo[bjk]fluoranthene (Bflas) are abundant PAHs in the coaly shales, and the ratios of low Fla/Py, benzo[a]anthracene (BaAn)/228 and indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene/(indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene + benzo[ghi]perylene) (InPy/(InPy + BghiP)) suggest that these 4- to 6-ring PAHs were mainly formed by small- to medium-scale wildfires during the dry season.

As a prerequisite for development of the ETo dataset, a correction procedure is applied to the NLDAS-2 downward solar radiation to account for overall bias and a tendency to underestimate the range of solar radiation on hourly and daily timescales. New hydrological insights: Analyses of spatial and temporal variability reveal that the lakes play an important role in modulating seasonal and geographical variability in evaporative demand. An example application of the gridded historical ETo dataset to irrigation management is provided. A 30-year climatology of crop irrigation for field maize is developed from the ETo dataset and is applied in a hypothetical irrigation-scheduling scenario. Overall, the study illustrates the utility of the NLDAS-2 ETo dataset in describing spatial and temporal patterns of evaporative demand across the Great Lakes region, and as a source of reference climatological information for irrigation management.

One of the popular methods adopted for lake restoration is chemical inactivation of phosphates using iron coagulants. This paper presents the findings of laboratory experiments on the effects of iron sulphates on the growth and production of oospores in the charophyte Chara hispida L In the course of the investigations, responses of this species to three dosages (Low, Medium, High) of iron (III) sulphate corresponding to the Fe concentrations of: 5.4, 10.8 and 21.6 g m(-3) Fe were analysed. The results demonstrated there was a decrease in the speed of growth of the major axis and reduced production of oospores on the one hand (differences were statistically significant only between High vs. Control), and stimulation of the development and growth of side branches of the first order on the other. Several factors that cause disorders in oospore growth and production were encountered, with a wide spectrum of physico-chemical changes in the water, which resulted in the charophyte thallus being coated by a brown colloid film (limiting access of light) and lowered pH level. The study showed that the use of iron coagulants for lake restoration poses a threat to the development (growth) of charophytes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Olivares, BO				Orlando Olivares, Barlin			TROPICAL RAINFALL CONDITIONS IN RAINFED AGRICULTURE IN CARABOBO, VENEZUELA	GRANJA-REVISTA DE CIENCIAS DE LA VIDA												Variability and climate change are having a strong impact on different meteorological variables; inducing changes in the precipitation pattern that directly affects water availability in agroecosystems. It is for this reason that the objective of this work was to analyze the interannual variability of tropical rainfall and its influence on rainfed agriculture of the Lake of Valencia basin in Venezuela. For this, the monthly and annual precipitation data (1969-1999) of eight climatological stations were used. Subsequently, the basic descriptive statistics were calculated, the evolution of the precipitation was described and finally, it was calculated from the P90% -10% percentile range as an indicator of the variation of the series amplitude. The results establish that there are changes in the interannual precipitation regime and, after analyzing trends in annual precipitation in Yuma Caserio, Colonia El Trompillo, Agua Blanca and Las Dos Bocas, there is a generalized reduction in rainfall, would negatively affect the generation and availability of moisture in agricultural locations, which depend heavily on rainwater. The agricultural vocation in the lowlands of the lake basin of Valencia makes it very vulnerable to persistent dry episodes, where rainfed crops such as industrial sorghum, maize, vegetables, fruits (musaceas) and citrus fruits diminish their yield during the absence prolonged rainfall, affecting the agricultural sector of the region.

Postglacial fire, vegetation, and climate history across an elevational gradient in the Northern Rocky Mountains, USA and Canada	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												A 13,100-year-long high-resolution pollen and charcoal record from Foy Lake in western Montana is compared with a network of vegetation and fire-history records from the Northern Rocky Mountains. New and previously published results were stratified by elevation into upper and lower and tree line to explore the role of Holocene climate variability on vegetation dynamics and fire regimes. During the cooler and drier Lateglacial period, ca 13,000 cal yr BP, sparsely vegetated Picea parkland occupied Foy Lake as well as other low- and high-elevations with a low incidence of fire. During the warmer early Holocene, from ca 11,000-7500 cal yr BP, low-elevation records, including Foy, indicate significant restructuring of regional vegetation as Lateglacial Picea parkland gave way to a mixed forest of Pinus-Pseudotsuga-Larix. In contrast, upper tree line sites (ca >2000 m) supported Pinus albicaulis and/or P. monticola-Abies-Picea forests in the Lateglacial and early Holocene. Regionally, biomass burning gradually increased from the Lateglacial times through the middle Holocene. However, upper tree line fire-history records suggest several climate-driven decreases in biomass burning centered at 11,500, 8500, 4000, 1600 and 500 cal yr BP. In contrast, lower tree line records generally experienced a gradual increase in biomass burning from the Lateglacial to ca 8000 cal yr BP, then reduced fire activity until a late Holocene maximum at 1800 cal yr BP, as structurally complex mesophytic forests at Foy Lake and other sites supported mixed-severity fire regimes. During the last two millennia, fire activity decreased at low elevations as modern forests developed and the climate became cooler and wetter than before. Embedded within these long-term trends are high amplitude variations in both vegetation dynamics and biomass burning. High-elevation paleoecological reconstructions tend to be more responsive to long-term changes in climate forcing related to growing-season temperature. Low-elevation records in the NRM have responded more abruptly to changes in effective precipitation during the late Holocene. Prolonged droughts, including those between 1200 and 800 cal yr BP, and climatic cooling during the last few centuries continues to influence vegetation and fire regimes at low elevation while increasing temperature has increased biomass burning in high elevations.

For this purpose, knowledge of wind speed distribution is an essential task. This paper proposes a comprehensive statistical evaluation of monthly, annual, and interannual variabilities of mean wind speeds and wind power densities of 2745 different sites over an area covering the whole of Cameroon. We used wind speed data obtained from ERA-5 for the period 2000-2017. In addition to the popular Weibull probability density function (WPDF), other continuous distributions such as the Normal PDF (NPDF) and the Lognormal PDF (LPDF) were used to investigate their suitability for the description of the wind regimes. We also established the analytical expression of the Normal power density. Three statistical analysis tools were used to determine the goodness of fit of the curves and the parameters of the PDFs were determined by the maximum likelihood method. We found that the theoretical power (TP) and power densities based on WPDF and NPDF are closely related. We observed the highest wind speeds and power densities in a few areas in the Lake Chad Basin and the Gulf of Guinea (GoG) which did not exceed class 2. It is seen that most of the areas studied show relatively low wind speeds and power densities that belong mostly to class 1 during all seasons. These results are useful for sizing wind turbines specific for different locations in Cameroon and making good decisions in terms of budgetary optimization of investments in the energy sector.					; KENFACK, Christian/HMD-1878-2023	Kenfack Sadem, Christian/0000-0003-2177-0824; PELAP, Francois B/0000-0001-9660-3874; 													2008-9163	2251-6832				DEC	2021	12	4					761	786		10.1007/s40095-021-00402-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40095-021-00402-3		JUN 2021											WOS:000661765900002

Spatial variation in fish-assemblage structure and the abundance of five species in disconnected waterholes early in the dry season (April 2001) were related to the extent of floodplain inundation 14 months previously, and to the interconnectedness of waterholes and waterhole habitat structure. As the dry season progressed, waterhole volumes decreased owing to evaporative water loss and structural habitat elements (anabranches, bars, boulders) became exposed. Marked changes in fish assemblage structure between the early (April) and late (September) dry season were related to habitat loss but not to water chemistry. Interactions between flow and habitat across a nested hierarchy of spatial scales (the floodplain, the waterhole and habitat patches within waterholes) were crucial to the persistence of fish assemblages through the 2001 dry season. We conclude that the magnitude, timing and frequency of floodplain inundation and natural variations in waterhole volume must be maintained if we wish to sustain the distinctive habitats and fish assemblages of this arid-zone floodplain river.					; Arthington, Angela/I-1689-2019; Balcombe, Stephen/C-5237-2008; Thoms, Martin/D-5049-2011	Marshall, Jonathan/0000-0002-7177-4543; Thoms, Martin/0000-0002-8074-0476; Wilson, Glenn/0000-0002-8683-4721; Arthington, Angela/0000-0001-5967-7954													1323-1650						2005	56	1					25	35		10.1071/MF04111	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF04111													WOS:000226762000004

Use of geographical information systems (GIS) in assessing ecological profile, fish community structure and production of a large reservoir of Himachal Pradesh	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The present study demonstrates the spatial analysis and mapping of fish and different measures of environmental parameters and fish diversity of Pong reservoir, Himachal Pradesh, using Kriging spatial interpolation methods for geographical information system mapping. Seasonal data on environmental parameters, potential fish habitat and fish diversity was collected from lentic (dam), lentic (reservoir), transitional and lotic zone of the reservoir.. Important environmental parameters like water temperature, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, water depth and transparency showed variations across the different zones of the reservoir. The sediment of the reservoir was sandy clay loam in nature as per texture analysis. Fish species richness, Shannon index and evenness index showed a similarity of the lotic and lentic (reservoir) zones of the reservoir. Six potential fish breeding grounds were identified in the reservoir indicating high conservation significance. The analysis of data showed a declining trend in fish production from 456.9 tonnes during the decade 1976-1987 to 347.91 tonnes during 2009-2020. The factors like anthropogenic climate change, predation of a stocked fish juvenile by water birds, undersized fish stocking and unscientific management are the probable reasons for the decreasing fish production. The spatial variation pattern of the water spread area, environmental parameters, fish catch and potential fish breeding grounds depicted in the GIS platform can be used as an important information base by the policy makers for fisheries management. The stocking of large size fish as a stocking material and adequate protection of the potential fish breeding grounds are the key advisories for the sustainable enhancement of fisheries as well as conservation.					; SARKAR, UTTAM/K-3247-2019; Sahoo, Bijaya/R-6356-2019	DAS, BASANTA/0000-0002-6629-8992; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				SEP	2022	194	9							643	10.1007/s10661-022-10292-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-10292-5								35930070					WOS:000836637900007

Cool-Season Evaluation of FV3-LAM-Based CONUS-Scale Forecasts with Physics Configurations of Experimental RRFS Ensembles	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												To help inform physics configuration decisions and help design and optimize a multi-physics Rapid Refresh Forecasting System (RRFS) ensemble to be used operationally by the National Weather Service, five FV3-LAM-based convection allowing forecasts were run on 35 cases between October 2020 and March 2021. These forecasts used similar to 3-km grid spacing on a CONUS domain with physics configurations including Thompson, NSSL, and Ferrier-Aligo microphysics schemes, Noah, RUC, and NoahMP land surface models, and MYNN-EDMF, K-EDMF, and TKE-EDMF PBL schemes. All forecasts were initialized from the 0000 UTC GFS analysis and run for 84 h. Also, a subset of 8 cases were run with 15 combinations of physics options, also including the Morrison-Gettelman microphysics and Shin-Hong PBL schemes, to help attribute behaviors to individual schemes and isolate the main contributors of forecast errors. Evaluations of both sets of forecasts find that the CONUS-wide 24-h precipitation > 1 mm is positively biased across all five forecasts. NSSL microphysics displays a low bias in QPF along the Gulf Coast. Analyses show that it produces smaller raindrops prone to evaporation. Additionally, TKE-EDMF PBL in combination with Thompson microphysics displays a positive bias in precipitation over the Great Lakes and in the ocean near Florida due to higher latent heat fluxes calculated over water. Furthermore, the K-EDMF PBL scheme produces temperature errors that result in a negative bias in snowfall over the southern Mountain West. Finally, recommendations for which physics schemes to use in future suites and the RRFS ensemble are discussed.

In this paper, we report alluvial trace fossil assemblages from the Upper Triassic Tiki Formation of the Rewa Basin, central India. Based on detailed facies analysis and architecture, two depositional environments are identified in this formation: (1) perennial braided channel belts and (2) extensive and complex floodplains containing ephemeral small fluvial channels, lakes, and crevasse splay deposits. Upper flow regime primary structures in laterally extensive sandstones encased in the floodplain deposits indicate short-lived high magnitude flood discharge, suggestive of seasonal climates. Trace fossils are sporadically distributed through these facies, generally in suites of low abundance, although in places the bioturbation index is higher. Three major ichnofacies, namely Skolithos, Scoyenia and Mermia are recognized, based on the association of different trace fossils preserved in the channel, crevasse splay of proximal floodplain and pond/lake of distal floodplain deposits, respectively. Vertical Beaconites in palaeosols and an abrupt change from Skolithos to Scoyenia ichnofacies indicate a highly variable water table, controlled by seasonal precipitation. The transitions between the Skolithos, Scoyenia and Mermia ichnofacies reveal that trace fossil preservation was variously controlled by channel abandonment, floodplain dewatering, substrate desiccation or periodic waterlogging of overbank areas. Specifically, increased water discharge over the floodplain during high precipitation, followed by post-flood recovery of hot, dry, low-water table conditions may have been a key controlling factor in shaping the ichnological characteristics of these Upper Triassic red beds.

To explore degradation mechanisms of submerged plants during the growing season, we determined chlorophyll and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations in Vallisneria natans (Lour.) Hara cultivated under four different nutrient concentrations (N/P, mg/L): T1 = 0.5/0.05, T2 = 2.5/0.25, T3 = 4.5/0.45, and T4 = 12.5/1.25) and under low and high density of epiphytic algae. With the increase in nutrients, the content of chlorophyll in the leaves of V. natans varied in the order T3 > T2 > T1 (T4) at low density (grazed) of epiphytic algae and varied in the order T3 > T2 > T1 > T4 in the high density (ungrazed) of epiphytic algae. With the increase in nutrients, the content of MDA in the leaves of V. natans varied in the order T4 >T1 (T2, T3) at the low density (grazed) of epiphytic algae and varied as T4 > T3 > T2 > T1 at the high density of epiphytic algae. At the same time, chlorophyll content of V. natans was significantly higher (p < 0.01 and the content of MDA was significantly lower (p < 0.01) in the grazed treatment than in the non-grazed treatment under the same nutrient concentrations. During the growing season, total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations were low (N < 4.5 mg N/L, P < 0.45 mg P/L) in Lake Taihu, a large shallow eutrophic lake in China; consequently water column nutrient loading benefited the growth of V. natans, but the high biomass of epiphytic algae and planktonic algae caused by the high nutrient loading of water column inhibited the growth of V. natans.

These communities are consortia that make important contributions to carbon and nitrogen input in non-marine Antarctic ecosystems. Here, we study the effect of increasing temperatures on the carbon and nitrogen metabolism of two benthic communities on Byers Peninsula (Livingston Island, Maritime Antarctica): a biofilm dominated by green algae growing on seasonal ice, and a land-based microbial mat composed mainly of cyanobacteria. Inorganic carbon photoassimilation, urea and nitrate uptake and N-2-fixation (acetylene reduction activity) rates were determined in situ in parallel at five different temperatures (0, 5, 10, 15, 25A degrees C) using thermostatic baths. The results for the cyanobacterial mat showed that photosynthesis and N-2-fixation responded positively to increased temperatures, but urea and NO (3) (-) uptake rates did not show a significant variation related to temperature. This microbial mat exhibits relatively low activity at 0A degrees C whereas at higher temperatures (up to 15A degrees C), N-2-fixation rate increased significantly. Similarly, the maximum photosynthetic activity increased in parallel with temperature and showed no saturation up to 25A degrees C. In contrast, the ice biofilm displayed higher photosynthetic activity at 0A degrees C than at the other temperatures assayed, and it showed elevated photoinhibition at warmer temperatures.

J	Pospieszny, L				Pospieszny, Lukasz			Freshwater reservoir effect and the radiocarbon chronology of the cemetery in Zabie, Poland	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE												In the 3rd millennium BC an island on the Lanskie Lake in north-eastern Poland was seasonally settled by a group of people practicing a syncretic burial ritual, exhibiting indigenous and foreign patterns. They left behind a small cemetery consisting of at least six graves. C-14 dates made for samples of human bones until 2009 did not coincide with the expected age of the graves. Under a new pilot program in 2010-2013, a series of radiocarbon measurements was made for the human bones and an artefact of red deer antler, along with analyses of the stable isotopes ratios of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) in the collagen. The results indicate a significant proportion of freshwater food in the diet, which caused the radiocarbon dates to be too old due to the freshwater reservoir effect (FRE). Based on the dating of the antler, unaffected by FRE, and comparative analysis, the reservoir offset for one of the graves was estimated to 740 radiocarbon years. The results, although limited by a low number of investigated humans and animals, indicate indirectly a specialization in the exploitation of local water resources. Such an economic strategy seems to be characteristic for the societies inhabiting the coasts of the Baltic Sea and littoral zones of large lakes in the Final Neolithic and at the beginning of the Early Bronze Age.

With this aim, at Sabocos, a Pyrenean cirque glacial lake or tarn, this study shows the main results of a morphological and catchment characterization, along with statistical analyses of its hydrochemical trends and their concomitant driving factors from 2010 to 2013. Dissolved oxygen, water temperature stratification, and its snow and ice cover composition and dynamics have been also investigated. According to morphological analyses, Sabocos can be classified as a medium- large and deep lake, having a circular contour and a long water retention time as compared to Pyrenean glacial lake average values. Sabocos hydrochemistry is mainly determined by very high alkalinity, pH and conductivity levels, and high Ca2+, Mg2+, and SO42- content, coming from the easily weatherable limestone-dolomite bedrock. Thus, lake water is well buffered, and therefore, Sabocos tarn is non-sensitive to acidification processes. On the other hand, the main source of K+, Na+, and Cl- (sea salts) and nutrients (NH4+, NO3-, and phosphorous) to lakewater appears to be atmospheric deposition. Primary production is phosphorous limited, and due to the N-saturation stage of the poorly developed soils of Sabocos catchment, NO3- is the chief component in the total nitrogen pool. External temperature seems to be themajor driver regulating lake productivity, since warm temperatures boot primary production. Although precipitation might also play an important role in lake dynamics, especially regarding to those parameters influenced by the weathering of the bedrock, its influence cannot be easily assessed due to the seasonal isolation produced by the ice cover. Also, as occurs in the whole Pyrenean lake district, chemical composition of bulk deposition is highly variable due to the contribution of air masses with different origin.

In this study, we develop an adaptive classification method to identify and map these supra-glacial lakes using high temporal resolution satellite images from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. Surface reflectance images from 2007 are used to extract information about the lakes, their morphologies and their surroundings. Using a multiclass approach we can recognize lake types that have previously been difficult to classify, such as deep lakes, lakes within cryoconite areas and lakes with floating ice. Given significant increases in melting in recent years relative to the long term record the inclusion of deep lakes might prove particularly important.

Seasonal variation and drivers of zooplankton, macroinvertebrate and littoral fish communities from irrigation ponds in a semi-arid region in the Eastern Cape (South Africa)	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												Irrigation ponds are increasingly abundant globally, particularly in water-stressed countries with limited natural surface waters, yet knowledge of their ecology is limited. Here, we assessed zooplankton, macroinvertebrate, and littoral fish communities from irrigation ponds located in the Sundays River Valley in South Africa. This study assessed the seasonal community patterns in response to physico-chemical and biotic components. Water temperature, water depth, Secchi depth, and ammonium concentrations differed significantly across seasons. Similarly, Chlorophyll-a concentrations differed seasonally, with water transparency identified as the main driver. Zooplankton was dominated by Rotifera, Copepoda and Cladocera. Seasonal changes in temperature and subsequent fluctuations in water levels resulted in changes in zooplankton community. Macroinvertebrates were dominated by insects, notably the families Corixidae and Naucoridae. The littoral fish community comprised of Glossogobius callidus, Oreochromis mossambicus and Gambusia affinis. Zooplankton, macroinvertebrates and littoral fish abundances, species richness, diversity and assemblage composition differed significantly across seasons with temperature identified as the main driver of these differences. This study demonstrates that bottom-up processes are the dominant drivers of the irrigation pond communities in the Sundays River Valley and highlights the relevance of seasonal abiotic drivers in structuring these communities, particularly G. callidus and G. affinis.					; Dalu, Tatenda/K-3089-2012; Mofu, Lubabalo/IUN-1198-2023; Khosa, Dumisani/AAK-4416-2020; Wasserman, Ryan/D-5492-2012	Wasserman, Ryan J/0000-0002-4162-1503; Woodford, Darragh/0000-0002-9460-5195; Weyl, Olaf/0000-0002-8935-3296; Dalu, Tatenda/0000-0002-9019-7702; Khosa, Dumisani/0000-0002-3088-4797; Mofu, Lubabalo/0000-0002-1269-8835; 													1608-5914	1727-9364				OCT 2	2021	46	4					452	463		10.2989/16085914.2021.1924608	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16085914.2021.1924608		JUN 2021											WOS:000658552600001

On the basis of systematically collecting and collating historical documents related to natural disasters, and by adopting mathematical statistics, geological succession, correlation and other methods, analysis and comparison were made on the spatial-temporal differentiation of disasters and correlation between various major natural disasters taking place in the Chaohu Lake Basin during the Ming & Qing Dynasties (1368-1912AD). The results show that 753 major disasters took place in the Chaohu Lake Basin during the Ming & Qing Dynasties. Among these, floods and droughts accounted for the largest percentage, while other disasters occurred occasionally. The Little Ice Age (1550-1850AD) was the period with a high incidence of natural disasters, and in the years from 1701 to 1750 natural disasters took place most frequently; between 1651-1700AD there was a declining period of flood frequency, though there were historically high occurrences of droughts and earthquakes. There were more floods than droughts suffered by Hefei, Shucheng, Chaohu, Wuwei and Hexian, while more droughts than floods suffered by Hanshan and Lujiang. Earthquakes in the basin mainly occurred in Chaohu, Shucheng, Hexian and Hefei, which are all near the Tan-Lu Fracture. The opposite is true for changes in the time scale of floods and droughts; this was probably caused by intra-seasonal oscillations of the subtropical high. The correlation between hails and wind disasters is significant, while other disasters are weakly correlated. There exists a certain association between spatial differentiation of occurrence frequency of natural disasters and landforms in the basin. The disaster-prone environment features landforms including plains, hills, low mountains, and these have a significant impact on the spatial distribution of five major natural disasters in the Chaohu Lake Basin.

Beryllium-7 in soils and vegetation along an arid precipitation gradient in Owens Valley, California	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Beryllium-7 is a potentially powerful tracer of atmospheric deposition and recent sediment transport, but the quantity and distribution of (7)Be on arid landscapes have not been described. We measured (7)Be in soil, vegetation, and dust in Owens Valley, California, and describe its distribution in aridisols and mollisols to evaluate its potential as a sediment tracer in desert environments. Beryllium-7 in vegetation and the upper few cm of soil is low but detectable (>20 Becquerels [Bq] m(-2)). Surface inventories of (7)Be at sites on the valley floor vary by a factor of five between the end of the rainy season (April) and the end of the dry season (November). In mollisols, live grasses hold similar to 50 Bq (7)Be m(-2), which is on the order of half of the total springtime surface inventory. We find that within-site variability at the 5 m scale is 5 to 22% (1 relative standard error) and can be explained by localized rain shadowing and erosion, but between site variability at the km scale can be explained by differences in rainfall. Our alpine site has more than triple the inventory that is predicted from the rainfall- (7)Be flux relationship that we generate using our springtime soil measurements and previously reported deposition data. Dust deposition does not appear to contribute significantly to (7)Be inventories, but anomalously high (7)Be on the eastern flank of the Sierras may be explained by a higher altitude air mass source and better scavenging efficiency of snow.

Lake/watershed mass balances were developed to examine MMHg cycling in four northern Alaska lakes near the ecological research station at Toolik Lake (68 degrees 38' N, 149 degrees 36' W). Primary features of the cycle are watershed runoff, sedimentary production and mobilization, burial, and photodecomposition in the water column. The principal source of MMHg is in situ benthic production with 80-91% of total inputs provided by diffusion from sediments. The production and contribution of MMHg from tundra watersheds is modest. Photodecomposition, though confined to a short ice-free season, provides the primary control for MMHg (66-88% of total inputs) and greatly attenuates bioaccumulation. Solid-phase MMHg and gross potential rates of Hg methylation, assayed with an isotopic tracer, vary positively with the level of inorganic Hg in filtered pore water, indicating that MMHg production is Hg-limited in these lakes. Moreover, sediment-water fluxes of MMHg (i.e., net production at steady state) are related to sediment Hg loadings from the atmosphere. These results suggest that loadings of Hg derived from atmospheric deposition are a major factor affecting MMHg cycling in arctic ecosystems. However, environmental changes associated with warming of the Arctic (e.g., increased weathering, temperature, productivity, and organic loadings) may enhance MMHg bioaccumulation by stimulating Hg methylation and inhibiting photodecomposition.					; Hammerschmidt, Chad/M-3139-2014	TSENG, CHUN-MAO/0000-0003-1922-3936; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				FEB 15	2006	40	4					1204	1211		10.1021/es051322b	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es051322b								16572776					WOS:000235478700021

Spatial and Seasonal Variability of Dissolved Methylmercury in Two Stream Basins in the Eastern United States	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												We assessed methylmercury (Me He concentrations across multiple ecological scales in the Edisto (South Carolina) and Upper Hudson (New York) River basins. Out-of-channel wetland/floodplain environments were primary sources of filtered MeHg (F-MeHg) to the stream habitat in both systems. Shallow, open-water areas in both basins exhibited low F-MeHg concentrations and decreasing F-MeHg mass flux. Downstream increases in out-of-channel wetlands/flood-plains and the absence of impoundments result in high MeHg throughout the Edisto. Despite substantial wetlands coverage and elevated F-MeHg concentrations at the headwater margins, numerous impoundments on primary stream channels favor spatial variability and lower F-MeHg concentrations in the Upper Hudson. The results indicated that, even in geographically, climatically, and ecologically diverse streams, production in wetland/floodplain areas, hydrologic transport to the stream aquatic environment, and conservative/nonconservative attenuation processes in open water areas are fundamental controls on dissolved MeHg concentrations and, by extension, MeHg availability					; Bradley, Paul/AAC-2451-2020; Burns, Douglas/A-7507-2009	Brigham, Mark/0000-0001-7412-6800; Bradley, Paul/0000-0001-7522-8606; Journey, Celeste/0000-0002-2284-5851; Burns, Douglas/0000-0001-6516-2869; 													0013-936X					MAR 15	2011	45	6					2048	2055		10.1021/es103923j	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es103923j								21341694					WOS:000288146200004

On the role of the planetary boundary layer depth in the climate system	ADVANCES IN SCIENCE AND RESEARCH					9th Annual Meeting of the European-Meteorological-Society (EMS) / 9th European Conference on Applications of Meteorology (ECAM)	SEP 28-OCT 02, 2009	Toulouse, FRANCE	European Meteorol Soc				The planetary boundary layer (PBL) is a part of the Earth's atmosphere where turbulent fluxes dominate vertical mixing and constitute an important part of the energy balance. The PBL depth, h, is recognized as an important parameter, which controls some features of the Earth's climate and the atmospheric chemical composition. It is also known that h varies by two orders of magnitude on diurnal and seasonal time scales. This brief note highlights effects of this variability on the atmospheric near-surface climate and chemical composition. We interpret heat capacity parameter of a Budyko-type energy balance model in terms of quasi-equilibrium h. The analysis shows that it is the shallowest, stably-stratified PBL with the smallest h that should be of particular concern for climate modelling. The reciprocal dependence between the PBL depth and temperature (concentrations) is discussed. In particular, the analysis suggests that the climate characteristics during stably stratified PBL episodes should be significantly more sensitive to perturbations of the Earth's energy balance as well as emission rates. On this platform, h from ERA-40 reanalysis data, the CHAMP satellite product and the DATABASE64 data were compared. DATABASE64 was used to assess the Troen-Mahrt method to determine h through available meteorological profile observations. As it has been found before, the shallow PBL requires better parameterization and better retrieval algorithms. The study demonstrated that ERA-40 and CHAMP data are biased toward deeper h in the shallow polar PBL. This, coupled with the scarcity of in-situ observations might mislead the attribution of the origins of the Arctic climate change mechanisms.

The sulfur isotopic mass balance shows that the main sulfur source is groundwater inflow (delta S-34 = -15.0%). The sulfate influx is approximately 20% reduced by microbial sulfate reduction and deposited as sulfide (delta S-34 = -22.2%; 34 kmol yr(-1)); the remaining exits from the outflow channel (delta S-34 = -12.6%). In the water column, microbiological analyses reveal that green sulfur bacteria dominate more than 90% of the population in the anoxic layer. A monthly decrease in sulfate concentration at each depth indicates that sulfate reduction proceeds within the water column as a first-order reaction because of low sulfate concentration (< 600 mu mol L-1). The isotopic fractionation factor of sulfate reduction is estimated to be 0.980 by the isotopic and concentration data of sulfate and sulfide from April to August. Numerical simulation indicates that the relative contribution of phototrophic sulfide oxidation is over 50 times slower than sulfate reduction from April to August but over two times higher from October to November because of lower sulfate conditions (<300 mu mol L-1). Sulfate concentration is the factor for controlling the relative contribution of sulfate reduction and phototrophic sulfide oxidation in monomictic lakes, which contrasts with that observed in permanently stratified lakes.

The daily and monthly N2O emissions were positively correlated with air temperature and the variation of aboveground biomass of reeds (p < 0.05). respectively. The N2O emissions from reeds were about 45.8-52.8% of that from the sediments. In terms of the effect of hydrological conditions, N2O emissions from the aquatic-terrestrial ecotone were 9.4-26.1% higher than the submerged zone, inferring that the variation of water level would increase N2O emissions. The annual N2O emission from Baiyangdian Lake was estimated to be about 114.2 t. This study suggested that N2O emissions from shallow lakes might be accelerated by the climate change as it has increased air temperature and changed precipitation, causing the variation of water level.

This time scale, which is generally referred to as the hydraulic residence time, provides a first order description of multiple and complex processes that create transport. This manuscript reviews the procedures to estimate transport time scales in reservoirs and explores, through the analysis of numerical simulations, the links between these time scales and the underlying hydrodynamic processes in a reservoir in North-Eastern Spain. The mean residence time scales undergo dramatic variations in time and in general, are comparable to the time scales of the systems' variability itself, such as those associated with seasonal changes in stratification, allowing complex patterns of intermittent mixing events to determine residence time scales. We demonstrate that the temporal variations of mean residence times occur not only at seasonal time scales, but also at shorter scales. The time scales are closely related to mixing and transport processes occurring within the reservoir, at the inflow sections and at the watershed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Moreover, how the environment governs diversity patterns remains a key issue in aquatic microbial ecology. In this study, we used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of PCR-amplified partial 16S rRNA gene fragments and multivariable statistical approaches to explore the patterns of change in the free-living bacterial community in the mesotrophic and mono-meromictic Lake Bourget (France). A monthly sampling was conducted over two consecutive years (2007 and 2008) and at two different depths characterizing the epi- and hypolimnion of the lake (2 and 50 m, respectively). Temporal shifts in the bacterial community structure followed different patterns according to depth, and no seasonal reproducibility was recorded from 1 year to the next. Our results showed that the bacterial community structure displayed lower diversity at 2 m (22 bands) compared to 50 m (32 bands) and that bacterial community structure dynamics followed dissimilar trends between the two depths. At 2 m, five shifts in the bacterial community structure occurred, with the temporal scale varying between 2 and 8 months whereas, at 50 m, four shifts in the bacterial community structure took place at 50 m, with the temporal scale fluctuating between 3 and 13 months. More than 60% of the bacterial community structure variance was explained by seven variables at 2 m against eight at 50 m. Nutrients (PO4-P, NH4-N and NO3-N) and temperature were responsible for 49.6% of the variance at 2 m whereas these nutrients, with dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a accounting for 59.6% of the variance at 50 m. Grazing by ciliates played also a critical role on the bacterial community structure at both depths. Our results suggest that the free-living bacterial community structure in the epi- and hypolimnion of Lake Bourget is mainly driven by combined, but differently weighted, top-down and bottom-up factors at 2 and 50 m.

The current gross sedimentation was characterized from a moored sediment trap array deployed over 2 years. The past net sedimentation was investigated with three short cores from two different basins. Diatom assemblages from cores were interpreted as reflecting changes in mixing depth, surface salinity and nutrient availability. The contemporary sediment trap data indicate seasonal variability, governed by diatom blooms during the annual mixing in the dry season, similar to Lakes Malawi and Tanganyika. The ratio of settling fluxes to net sediment accumulation rates implies mineralization rates of 80-90% at the sediment-water interface. The sediment cores revealed an abrupt change similar to 40 years ago, when carbonate precipitation started. Since the 1960s, deep-water methane concentrations, nutrient fluxes and soil mineral inputs have increased considerably and diatom assemblages have altered. These modifications probably resulted from a combination of three factors, commonly altering lake systems: the introduction of a non-native fish species, eutrophication, and hydrological changes inducing greater upwelling. Both the fish introduction and increased rainfall occurred at the time when the onset of carbonate precipitation was observed, whereas catchment population growth accompanied by intensified land use increased the flux of soil minerals already since the early twentieth century due to more intense erosion.					; Ryves, David/D-6434-2011; Wehrli, Bernhard/A-4406-2013; Schmid, Martin/C-3953-2009	Tofield Pasche, Natacha/0000-0002-9578-9301; Fabrice Amisi, Muvundja/0000-0003-1675-570X; Wehrli, Bernhard/0000-0001-7029-1972; Schmid, Martin/0000-0001-8699-5691													0921-2728	1573-0417				DEC	2010	44	4					931	946		10.1007/s10933-010-9465-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-010-9465-x													WOS:000283360800004

Role of Lakes, Flood, and Low Flow Events in Modifying Catchment-Scale DOC:TN:TP Stoichiometry and Export	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The balance of organic carbon (OC), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) plays a crucial role in determining the processing, retention, and movement of these solutes across the aquatic continuum. Floods and droughts can significantly alter the quantity and ratios of OC:N:P export within inland waters, but how these ratios change, and are coupled within watersheds that integrate rivers and lakes, is not well known. We investigated the stoichiometry and export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total N (TN) and total P (TP) in two lake watersheds (10 inflows, 2 outflows) in the southern Boreal Shield over a 37-year period. Although DOC, TN, and TP concentration behaved similarly, DOC:TN:TP ratios varied seasonally, strongly modulated by stream discharge. DOC:TN, DOC:TP and TN:TP export initially increased rapidly with increasing discharge, peaking at 10%-20% exceedance of the annual discharge for DOC:TP and TN:TP ratios, indicating a rapid depletion of catchment OC sources. Both flood and low flow events resulted in lower DOC:TN and lower DOC:TP export-thereby increasing the relative contributions of stream TN and TP. Consequently, elevated annual discharge coupled with infrequent but high floods and periods of low flow events increased the contributions of TN and TP relative to DOC. Overall, the lakes retained DOC, while increasing TN relative to TP. Nonetheless, the flow regime played a role in modulating nutrient retention in the lakes, likely due to changes in residence time, and the interplay of physical, photochemical, and biological degradation processes.					; Boodoo, Kyle/HCI-7577-2022; Fasching, Christina/F-8057-2018	Xenopoulos, Marguerite A./0000-0003-2307-948X; Yao, Huaxia/0000-0001-5875-7215; Rusak, James/0000-0002-4939-6478; Fasching, Christina/0000-0001-5362-0156; Boodoo, Kyle/0000-0001-7063-5042													0043-1397	1944-7973				MAR	2024	60	3							e2023WR034839	10.1029/2023WR034839	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023WR034839													WOS:001185636200001

However, this information is extremely hard to obtain using conventional hydroacoustic methods. For this reason, the mobile hydroacoustic upward-looking system (38 kHz split-beam echosounder) in combination with a passive sampling method (gillnets) was tested to investigate the fish community (fish larger than 8 cm total length) in the upper 3 m of water column of the.Rimov Reservoir (Czech Republic) during the growing season. We found most fish located in the depth layer closest to the surface down to 1 m - 50-78 % by acoustics (layer 0.3; 1 m) and 55-1 m) and 55-71 % by gillnets. The size structure of both methods was generally similar, but the acoustic results contained a higher proportion of small fish (<12 cm TL). The upward-looking system is a promising approach to study the fish community in the neglected surface layer, but more studies of its efficiency for large fish monitoring are needed.					; Juza, Tomas/G-3159-2014; Riha, Milan/G-1065-2014; Vejrik, Lukas/E-1607-2017; Draštík, Vladislav/G-2222-2014; Blabolil, Petr/K-9548-2015; Smejkal, Marek/E-1269-2017; Cech, Martin/C-5797-2014; Šmejkal, Marek/E-1269-2017; Prchalova, Marie/F-8664-2014; Muska, Milan/A-7978-2014; Peterka, Jiří/C-7218-2014; Tušer, Michal/F-8548-2014; Vejřík, Lukáš/E-1607-2017; Koliada, Ievgen/F-9795-2015; Holubová, Michaela/F-2507-2019; Prchalová, Marie/F-8664-2014; Frouzova, Jaroslava/F-8518-2014; Sajdlova, Zuzana/R-1383-2018; Kubecka, Jan/A-8230-2011	Blabolil, Petr/0000-0003-1344-9627; Riha, Milan/0000-0002-3930-420X; Vejrik, Lukas/0000-0001-8911-9128; Smejkal, Marek/0000-0002-7887-6411; Holubova, Michaela/0000-0003-0475-307X; Prchalova, Marie/0000-0001-5000-2918; Muska, Milan/0000-0001-6659-986X; Peterka, Jiri/0000-0001-5935-4311; Tuser, Michal/0000-0003-2881-392X; Drastik, Vladislav/0000-0002-9419-6977; Kubecka, Jan/0000-0001-9203-4854													0165-7836	1872-6763				JUN	2021	238								105907	10.1016/j.fishres.2021.105907	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2021.105907													WOS:000758744600001

Abiotic Drivers of a Deep Cyanobacteria Layer in a Stratified and Eutrophic Lake	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Harmful algal blooms (HABs), in particular those consisting of the cyanobacteria Microcystis, are becoming increasingly more common across the globe. Despite the growing body of evidence that suggests vertical heterogeneity of Microcystis can be a precursor to HAB formation, the abiotic drivers of vertical distribution of Microcystis are poorly understood in the field environment. The prediction of subsurface cyanobacteria is also pertinent because subsurface concentrations are not easily recognizable to the public or lake system managers, creating a risk of exposure to harmful algal toxins. High-frequency temporal and vertical data were collected from a research station anchored in a stratified and eutrophic lake for five months. Using a combination of dimensional analysis and machine learning approaches, data show that the magnitude of the subsurface Microcystis concentration peak and the center of gravity of the deep cyanobacteria layer are statistically significantly mediated by the thermal structure of the lake. The peak subsurface cyanobacteria biovolume is related to the thermocline depth and temperature, whereas the center of gravity of the subsurface cyanobacteria biovolume is related to the mixed layer depth and temperature. Furthermore, our data suggest there is a seasonal evolution of the subsurface cyanobacteria center of gravity that could potentially indicate timing of HAB onset. Based on easily measured parameters associated with the vertical lake temperature profile and meteorological conditions, we provide evidence of predictable trends in subsurface cyanobacteria variables.

Water samples were collected from 10 sampling points during the premonsoon, monsoon and postmonsoon season of 2016 and 2017. The general water parameters such as low DO, high BOD, and high fluoride imply the wetland water's deteriorated quality. The mean TOC of water was estimated to be 2.4 +/- 0.33 ppm, the first report from Deepor Beel. Pearson's correlation coefficient showed a significant positive relation (> 0.7) between TOC, phosphate, and nitrate, which indicates the seasonal inflow of these parameters from a similar source. The computed heavy metal indices revealed that most of the water samples were highly contaminated by metals. The metal concentration recorded in the selected macrophytes and fishes species was far above the concentration of the respective metal in the water samples. Metal distribution in plant samples disclosed that Euryale ferox showed better accumulation ability than Hydrilla verticillata and Eichhornia crassipes. Among the fish species, the highest metal accumulation was recorded in Xenentodon cancila (zinc, iron, manganese, and nickel) and Channa punctatus (lead and cadmium). In the fish samples, metal accumulation was found to be higher in the organs (particularly in the kidney) than in the muscles. Bioconcentration factor revealed a high metal accumulation in the submerged type plants and surface feeder fishes.																			0306-7319	1029-0397				DEC 18	2023	103	16					4488	4502		10.1080/03067319.2021.1928104	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03067319.2021.1928104		MAY 2021											WOS:000656811600001

Planktonic bacterial community dynamics over short timescales can be of great importance for food webs and ecosystem functioning but are rarely described when microbial community and composition are assessed. To study the significance of such dynamics we sampled the surface water at the deepest point of a mesotrophic lake (Lake Erken, Sweden) every third hour over two days. 2. By combining 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes with bromodeoxyuridine immunocapturing of DNA, replicating populations were identified and compared to the community retrieved from total DNA samples. This comparison revealed a significant difference between the actively replicating and total community. 3. The high-frequency diurnal sampling was compared to a year-long survey conducted in the same lake in order to compare the diurnal and seasonal variation in bacterioplankton community composition. At the diurnal-scale, the variation was significantly higher in the replicating than in the total community. However, variation in both active and total diurnal community was significantly lower than the variation in the seasonal total community. 4. Our analysis revealed pronounced short-term dynamics of individual bacterial populations uncoupled from the diurnal light cycle. For example, the proliferating fraction of the most abundant bacterial tribe (LD12) followed a cyclic pattern that covaried with viral abundance. This implies that environmental factors other than light may act as important drivers of microbial community composition, at least in mesotrophic Lake Erken.

J	Hatano, N; Yoshida, K				Hatano, Nozomi; Yoshida, Kohki			Sedimentary environment and paleosols of middle Miocene fluvial and lacustrine sediments in central Japan: Implications for paleoclimate interpretations	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Sedimentary facies analysis and description of paleosols were carried out for the middle Miocene Tokiguchi Porcelain Clay Formation (PCF) in central Japan in order to interpret the soil-forming environments during a long hiatus in the Japanese Islands. The sedimentary facies suggests that deposition occurred mainly in a lacustrine environment, with minor channel-fill and debris-flow deposits associated with alluvial fan environments. The coarse-grained sediments, which are inferred to have been deposited in channel-bar and debris-flow deposits, are present only in the marginal area of the sedimentary basin. Mature paleosols are identified in the Tokiguchi PCF, characterized by illuviated clay, identifiable soil horizons including Bt horizons and many in situ plant fossils, and are then similar to Ultisols. Most tree trunk fossils, however, were preserved by burial beneath debris-flow deposits. Most of paleosols formed on lacustrine deposits and were covered by lacustrine clay and silt deposits, without intervening coarse-grained deposits, such as flood-flow deposits. This change of sedimentary fades indicates a dramatic change of hydrologic environment, from stagnant water to entirely desiccated conditions, promoting weathering and soil formation. The relationship between sedimentary facies and Pedotypes, consequently, implies the repetition of specific events, i.e., submergence and emergence of lake bottom, most likely due to formation and drainage of a dammed lake. These isolated events and development of mature paleosols might suggest specific characteristics of middle Miocene weathering conditions, such as seasonally heavy rainfall and/or warm climatic conditions in the Japanese Islands.

In this context, satellite-derived soil moisture data are valuable for modeling purposes. Assessing the applicability of such data at high latitudes is essential but has, until recently, been given little attention. Recent studies have pointed out that seasonal land cover variations and the presence of small water bodies, which are typical in the Arctic, can cause complications for soil moisture retrieval. Here, it is hypothesized that a bias related to water fraction is caused by variations in the water surface roughness. The impact is quantified for the Metop Advanced Scatterometer by investigations of the higher spatial resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data acquired by ENVISAT Advanced SAR over 11 sites across the Siberian Arctic. The bias calculated as an average over time can be explained by the lake fraction: a water fraction higher than 20% causes a bias of more than 10% relative surface soil moisture. This can, to a great extent, be attributed to wind, based on which a bias correction was developed. The correction was applied and evaluated with in situ soil moisture data, which were available from one of the sites: the Lena Delta. Weak results are obtained because water surfaces correspond mainly to rivers at this site. Variations in discharge, water height, and streams may therefore also affect the water surface roughness.

We took samples of zooplankton and phytoplankton at four habitats of the lake characterized by the presence-absence of emergent or free-floating macrophytes along a 18-month period after the drought. Microzooplankton dominated along the study and macrozooplankton showed seasonal increments in cold seasons. Temporal patterns of broad taxonomic zooplankton groups were associated to hydrology-driven factors, like changes in water depth, conductivity and edible phytoplankton and seasonal changes and not related with free-floating plants. Nevertheless, spatial and temporal patterns of species composition were closely linked to the dynamics of free-floating plants. A clear shift from pelagic to littoral zooplankton taxa was registered when free-floating plants colonized. This study expands the knowledge on the composition and dynamics of zooplankton from floodplain lakes after the disturbance caused by a severe drought. Our results highlight the influence of water level fluctuations as drivers of zooplankton abundance and the joint effect of seasonal changes and free-floating plant dynamics on zooplankton species composition and richness.

There is an increasing interest in using these viruses for water quality monitoring and forecasting; however, the ability to use statistical models to predict the concentrations of coliphage, as often done for cultured fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) such as enterococci and E. coli, has not been widely assessed. The same can be said for FIB genetic markers measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) methods. Here we institute least-angle regression (LARS) modeling of previously published concentrations of cultured FIB (E. coli, enterococci) and coliphage (F+, somatic), along with newly reported genetic concentrations measured via qPCR for E. coli, entemcocci, and general Bacteroidales. We develop site-specific models from measures taken at three beach sites on the Great Lakes (Grant Park, South Milwaukee, WI; Edgewater Beach, Cleveland, OH; Washington Park, Michigan City, IN) to investigate the efficacy of a statistical predictive modeling approach. Microbial indicator concentrations were measured in composite water samples collected five days per week over a beach season (similar to 15 weeks). Model predictive performance (cross-validated standardized root mean squared error of prediction [SRMSEP] and R-PRED(2)) were examined for seven microbial indicators (using log(10) concentrations) and water/beach parameters collected concurrently with water samples. Highest predictive performance was seen for qPCR-based enterococci and Bacteroidales models, with F+ coliphage consistently yielding poor performing models. Influential covariates varied by microbial indicator and site. Antecedent rainfall, bird abundance, wave height, and wind speed/direction were most influential across all models. Findings suggest that some fecal indicators may be more suitable for water quality forecasting than others at Great Lakes beaches.

We examined the relationship between the source of organic matter and the structure and function of lake bacterial communities. Differences and seasonal changes in bacterial community composition in two lakes differing in their source of organic matter were followed in relation to environmental variables. We also performed batch culture experiments with amendments of various organic substrates, namely fulvic acids, leachates from algae, and birch and maple leaves. Differences in bacterial community composition between the lakes, analysed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, correlated with variables related to the relative loading of autochthonous and allochthonous carbon (water colour, dissolved organic carbon, nutrients, and pH). Seasonal changes correlated with temperature, chlorophyll and dissolved organic carbon in both lakes. The substrate amendments led to differences in both structure and function, i.e. production, respiration and growth yield, of the bacterial community. In conclusion, our results suggest that the source of organic matter influences community composition both within and among lakes and that there may be a coupling between the structure and function of the bacterial community.

Christopher			Climate vulnerability of ecosystems and landscapes on Alaska's North Slope	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												Alaska's North Slope is especially vulnerable to climatic change because higher latitudes are subject to positive snow- and sea ice-atmosphere feedbacks under warming conditions and because the dynamics of frozen seascapes and landscapes are tightly determined by thermal regime. Shifts in timing and magnitude of freeze-thaw processes are observed to have or expected to have non-linear, threshold-crossing impacts on sea ice, landforms, and biota. Observed changes in North Slope surface air temperatures and precipitation were non-monotonic over the last century, but have trended upward for the last several decades. These changes are linked to hemispheric climate dynamics, reflected in North Pacific and Arctic Oscillation circulation indices. Projected anthropogenic climate changes-with the possibility of continued warming, increased storm frequency and intensity, and decreased insulating snow cover-portend an uncertain future for this domain. Current or foreseen physical system shifts include: (1) declining seasonal and permanent sea ice extent and character, (2) rapid coastal erosion due to storm exposure over a longer near-shore ice-free season, (3) deeper soil active layer over warmer permafrost, along with altered thermokarst processes-contributing to thaw lake expansion, surface drainage re-organization, and hillslope instability. Biogeophysical responses encompass (1) modified surface-atmosphere energy balance from snow cover, vegetation, and hydrologic change and (2) shifted soil and wetland biogeochemical dynamics, including accelerated carbon efflux. Climate-driven plant community shifts on the North Slope result from the interplay of climate, vegetation response, and landscape processes. Some transitions involve stabilizing, others destabilizing plant-permafrost feedbacks. Impacts on caribou, migratory avifauna, and freshwater biota are through direct effects of climate on organism physiology and reproductive biology and indirectly through disruption of habitat mosaics (including along migratory routes) and shifts in competition and trophic linkages. The North Slope's physical and biological vulnerabilities to shifting climate and observed leading indicators of change are compelling reasons for land managers to consider climatic instability as a threat in conjunction with other known stressors while seeking strategies for protection of this domain's natural heritage and ecosystem services.

J	Zilli, FL; Marchese, MR				Lucila Zilli, Florencia; Rosa Marchese, Mercedes			Patterns in macroinvertebrate assemblages at different spatial scales. Implications of hydrological connectivity in a large floodplain river	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The habitat heterogeneity generated and sustained by the connectivity of floodplain habitats, the seasonal flood pulse, and the variability of the physical structures typically found in floodplains of large rivers results in a variable space-time mosaic of water sources that results in a high biodiversity of the river-floodplain system. In order to assess the implications of natural connectivity and the heterogeneity on the patterns of macroinvertebrate assemblages at different spatial scales, monthly samplings in six different mesohabitats (lakes with different hydrological connection and secondary channels with permanently and intermittent flow) of the Parana River floodplain were performed from April 2005 to March 2006. The mesohabitats had different granulometry and detritus composition of their bottom sediments. They also had different conductivity, transparency, and depth in relation to the different connectivity degrees. Mesohabitats differed in the abundance of macroinvertebrates of different taxonomic groups and diversity. The environmental variables were correlated to the patterns of macroinvertebrate abundance, with dominance of different species of annelids and mollusks at the patch, mesohabitats, and island scales. An alpha diversity gradient from the isolated lake (65 taxonomic units) to the secondary channels (25 taxonomic units) was obtained. The analyzed mesohabitats showed a high taxa turnover, with high values not only among the mesohabitats located in the different islands, but also among the mesohabitats in relation to different connectivity degrees. The mesohabitats showed negative co-occurrence of macroinvertebrate assemblages. The spatial heterogeneity, sustained by the connectivity degree, played a key role in structuring benthic assemblages at different scales, positively influencing the regional diversity.

J	Kirkwood, AE; Jackson, LJ; McCauley, E				Kirkwood, Andrea E.; Jackson, Leland J.; McCauley, Edward			Are dams hotspots for Didymosphenia geminata blooms?	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												P>1. The diatom Didymosphenia geminata has emerged in recent years as a globally invasive species. Although considered native to North America, reports of nuisance blooms have increased over the last decade. 2. Previously, we determined that D. geminata was ubiquitous in two major headwaters of the South Saskatchewan River Basin (SSRB), Alberta, Canada, but found it only bloomed at certain sites, including those immediately downstream from dam outfalls. To evaluate the role of dams in the abundance and blooming of D. geminata, we compared sites just below dams to unregulated upstream reference sites in six dammed rivers of the SSRB. 3. There was a high degree of seasonal variability in D. geminata abundance among sites, but statistical analyses showed a significant propensity for the diatom to have higher cell densities and an increased frequency of blooms at dam sites. 4. Important predictor variables of D. geminata abundance included dam presence, water clarity and total phosphorus concentration. When data from dam sites were analysed, a multiple regression model using mean discharge and pH as independent predictors explained 73% of the variation in D. geminata cell density. 5. Analysis of 3 years of data from one study river (Red Deer River) revealed consistently higher D. geminata cell densities at the dam site compared to the upstream reference. This analysis also showed that average cell density fluctuated by orders of magnitude from year-to-year. 6. Due to the ecological and aesthetic concerns regarding the global spread and blooming of D. geminata, we recommend that dams be viewed as key candidates for mitigating blooms in flow regulated systems.

Moran Eigenvector Maps were used to generate spatial variables representing spatial patterns at different scales. We sampled 35 lakes from the Pantanal floodplain, Brazil. To understand the effects of environmental and spatial variables, we performed Redundancy Analyses and variation partitioning to separate environmental and spatial pattern effects. Environmental variables explained almost twice the variation in the Pantanal mussel assemblages than did spatial variables. Unionida species presence was driven mainly by variations in sediment coarse sand and silt contents. The weak spatial patterns observed may be related to increased connectivity between lakes during floods, which facilitates mussel host fish dispersal. Mussel abundances were driven mainly by organic matter availability, but varied between species. Changes in lake connectivity can affect the regional sediment dynamics and affect mussel assemblages.

J	Bleicher, N; Schubert, C				Bleicher, Niels; Schubert, Carsten			Why are they still there? A model of accumulation and decay of organic prehistoric cultural deposits	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE												The circumalpine lake side settlements are a unique source of detailed information on the past. Nevertheless, little has been published by now on why the organic matter (fumier lacustre) in these settlements has been preserved and how exactly this happened. It is, therefore, necessary to closely explore the decomposition of organic matter under different conditions. We present data from the literature and a decomposition model simulating the outcome of different archaeological hypotheses and comparing the result with the actual archaeological record. We conclude that different scenarios of deposition should result in clearly discernible and measurable features in the archaeological record, whose presence or absence allows deducing the mode of deposition. The best conditions of organic preservation are to be expected under such conditions where a large organic input happens in shallow still water. Seasonal flooding and a later rise in lake level can also result in good preservation but imply a greater loss through mechanical erosion and in many cases clear preservation gradients within the deposits. The theoretical outcomes presented here find clear analogs in the archaeological record. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Early Middle Jurassic (possibly Aalenian) Tsagan-Ovoo Flora of Central Mongolia	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												The Tsagan-Ovoo Flora from terrigenous, coal-bearing deposits of the Bakhar Formation, central Mongolia, is documented for the first time. The Tsagan-Ovoo Flora contains 32 megafossil plant taxa belonging to horsetails, ferns, cycadaleans, ginkgoaleans, leptostrobaleans, conifers and gymnosperms of unknown systematic affinity. The floristic composition of the plant-bearing beds allows us to date them as early Middle Jurassic (possibly Aalenian). This flora is typical of the West Siberian Province of the Siberian Region and corroborates our previously obtained conclusion that the boundary between this province and the North Chinese Province of the same region should be positioned further south than its previous placement. The plants of the Tsagan-Ovoo Flora probably formed a mosaic of communities that inhabited swampy lowlands and lake margins. The flora reflects a wet, most probably warm-temperate climate with some seasonality in temperature and/or precipitation. Three new ginkgoalean species of the Tsagan-Ovoo Flora are described: Ginkgo badamgaravii Kostina et Herman, Pseudotorellia gobiense Kostina et Herman, and Pseudotorellia mongolica Kostina et Herman.

The annual mean concentration ranges of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), Chl-a, MC-LR and MC-RR were 0.17-10.53 mg/L, 0.027-0.581 mg/L, 0.10-129.75 mu g/L, 0.013-2.019 mu g/L and 0.002-0.794 mu g/L, respectively. The average TN, ammonium (NH4+) and TP concentrations in Meiliang Bay decreased from 3.54 to 2.26 mg/L, 0.63 to 0.31 mg/L and 0.150 to 0.124 mg/L, respectively, when compared with values from 2006-2008, indicating that water quality has improved in severe cyanobacterial bloom areas in recent years. Additionally, the distribution of MCs was northern lake areas > western lake areas > central lake areas > macrophyte-dominated areas. Correlation analysis revealed that nutrients were the most important variable accounting for the variation of extracellular MC-LR concentration in heavy cyanobacterial bloom areas of Lake Taihu. During the study period, the maximum MCs concentration reached 2.75 +/- 0.27 mu g/L in the bloom period in the northern lake areas, which is more than two times the safety limit of 1 mu g/L MCs required for drinking water. However, microcystins decreased gradually as the water quality improved from 2009 to 2011, indicating that the risk of MCs exposure was slightly decreased in Lake Taihu.					zhang, ruibin/JXL-6292-2024; Xiong, Wenjie/ABB-3806-2021															1660-4601				MAY	2014	11	5					5155	5169		10.3390/ijerph110505155	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph110505155								24830449					WOS:000337251900037

Are fire temperatures and residence times good predictors of survival and regrowth for resprouters in Florida, USA, scrub?	FIRE ECOLOGY												Background Fire is a dominant ecological disturbance in many ecosystems. Post-fire resprouting is a widespread response to fire, but resprouting vigor varies with many components of the fire regime, including fire intensity. We measured responses in 46 species of resprouting plants of Florida, USA, scrub and related habitats, marking and measuring individual plants before fires. We then measured fire temperatures and residence times (time above 60 degrees C) during 13 fires, at the base of each plant. We measured post-fire plant sizes for up to six years. We hypothesized that high temperatures and long residence times would reduce survival and growth, and that these vital rates would vary by burn season, habitat type, and species group. Results Fires had variable intensities with maximum temperatures ranging from 47 to 890 degrees C (mean temperature = 549 degrees C) and residence times ranging from 0 to 83 minutes (mean time = 10 minutes). Consumed plants experienced higher fire intensity than scorched plants, and residence times were higher during the wet season (July through October), than the dry season (November through April), and fire season (May to June) and with drier conditions. Across all species affected by fire, 86% of plants survived and resprouted post fire. First year survival was unrelated to fire variables, with high survival across all maximum temperatures and residence times. Burn season, habitat, and species group did not significantly affect survival. On average across all species, post-fire growth recovered to pre-fire heights within four years. Growth was not significantly affected by species group or burn season. Conclusion Resprouting perennial plants that dominate Florida scrub and surrounding habitats appear resilient to a wide range of fire intensities, as measured by maximum temperatures and residence times. Post-fire growth was rapid, with recovery of pre-fire heights in four years. Species groups varied in post-fire recovery rates. In these habitats, fire is critical to maintain the habitat structure for many animals and plants, including many rare species. The slower recovery of biomass for resprouting shrubs results in the longer availability of gaps for rare herbaceous species. In addition, variability in post-fire survival and growth among species groups likely contributes to the persistence of species diversity and complexity across habitats. However, variation in fire intensity appears to have little effect on resprouting species or subsequent habitat structure. A range of fire regimes can be used in prescribed fire management without having major impacts on resprouting plants in Florida scrub and related vegetation.

Seasonal patterns were analyzed for the interaction of water chemistry. Encrustation followed a seasonal pattern for Chara contraria, Chara subspinosa, and Nitellopsis obtusa in Lake Kruselin and for Chara globularis and Chara tomentosa in Lake Lutzlow. However, no seasonality in the precipitated CaCO3 was observed for C.subspinosa in Lake Lutzlow and for C.tomentosa in Lake Kruselin, indicating a lake-specific dependency. Species-specific encrustation was found. Chara contraria and N.obtusa encrusted the most in June and August, whereas C.subspinosa and Nitella flexilis/opaca exhibited lowest encrustation in March and April. The precipitated CaCO3 of charophytes correlated negatively to the concentration of total inorganic carbon in both lakes. Element content of plant dry weight was species-specific for Ca and K, and lake-specific for Mg. No specific pattern was found for the TP and Fe contents. The results showed seasonal, species, and lake-specific influences on the encrustation of charophytes.					von Tümpling, Wolf/H-9032-2013	von Tumpling, Wolf/0000-0003-1815-4764													0022-3646	1529-8817				OCT	2018	54	5					630	637		10.1111/jpy.12772	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpy.12772								30055056					WOS:000446171600005

Origins and variability of extreme precipitation in the Santa Ynez River Basin of Southern California	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: Santa Ynez River Basin, Santa Barbara County, California. Study focus: Lake Cachuma, a reservoir on the Santa Ynez River, provides water for over 280,000 residents and agricultural lands of Santa Barbara County, California. This area experiences high inter-annual precipitation variability, which we hypothesize is driven by the presence or absence of a few large precipitation events each year. We use daily precipitation observations from 1965 to 2017 to identify extreme precipitation events, defined as those exceeding the 90th percentile. We examine the role of these events, their associated synoptic patterns, and the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in driving inter-annual precipitation variability in this basin. New hydrological insights for the region: On average, a we year features three or more extreme events, a normal year 1-2 events, and a dry year 0-1 events. We identify four distinct synoptic-scale weather patterns associated with extreme events and find that 74% of events are associated with atmospheric rivers. El Nino years tend to have a greater number of extreme events, though this relationship is not dependable. The reliance on just a few extreme precipitation events and diversity among these events highlights the challenges of seasonal prediction and resource management in this area. This novel approach to defining variability on a watershed scale can support ecological, geological, and hydrological studies as well as regional water resource management.

J	Cañedo-Argüelles, M; Rieradevall, M				Canedo-Argueelles, Miguel; Rieradevall, Maria			Early succession of the macroinvertebrate community in a shallow lake: Response to changes in the habitat condition	LIMNOLOGICA												In the present study the initial succession of the aquatic macroinvertebrate communities of a newly created shallow lake in a wetland area was monitored during 15 months. Three different types of macroinvertebrate samples (multihabitat, associated to the Phragmites australis stands and associated to the sediment) were collected monthly from May 2004 to July 2005. Additional samples were collected in the reed stand in 2007, when the reed belt had become much taller and thicker. Colonization of the lake was fast, and the colonization sequence was mainly related to the dispersal abilities of the taxa. Habitat-specific changes in the assemblage's structure and composition were registered. The communities associated to the sediment showed a decrease in overall biomass, density and species richness along time. The density of the gastropod Physella acuta and the chironomid species Dicrotendipes pallidicornis, Polypedilum nubifer and Tanytarsus horni decreased significantly, after Chara stands declined; while the chironomid Chironomus riparius became dominant. The epiphytic macroinvertebrate communities associated with the reed stands followed a seasonal pattern, with a warm-period community dominated by the chironomid species Ablabesmyia monilis and Psectrocladius sordidellus-group, and a cold-period community dominated by the chironomid species Cricotopus ornatus and D. pallidicornis.

J	Li, YY; Yang, SL; Luo, P; Xiong, SF				Li, Yangyang; Yang, Shiling; Luo, Pan; Xiong, Shangfa			Aridity-controlled hydrogen isotope fractionation between soil n-alkanes and precipitation in China	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Leaf-wax n-alkane hydrogen isotope composition (delta D-alk) is widely applied as a proxy for paleohydroclimatic changes, but the factors controlling delta D-alk remain to be clarified. In this study, in order to determine the dominant controls, we measured delta D-alk in 54 surface soils along a southeast-northwest transect across a steep climatic gradient in China. delta D-alk is positively correlated with annual precipitation delta D (delta D-pann) and better correlated with growing season (April-October) precipitation delta D (delta D-pgs). However, the variability of delta D-pann (38 parts per thousand) and delta D-pgs (35 parts per thousand) does not explain all of the variance in delta D-alk (84 parts per thousand). The apparent fractionation of hydrogen isotopes between n-alkanes and precipitation (epsilon(alk/p)) is significantly correlated with variables related to aridity: relative humidity, rainfall amount, and aridity index (defined as the ratio of average precipitation to average potential evapotranspiration). This result demonstrates the important control of aridity on delta D-alk, which may result from the increasing soil evaporation and plant transpiration, as well as decreasing biosynthetic fractionation, in arid climates. We compiled published delta D-alk data from surface lake/soil sediments in China, and found that aridity effects are pronounced in regions with mean annual precipitation (MAP) < 800 mm. Therefore, we suggest that soil delta D-alk reflects precipitation delta D modified by aridity, with a greater degree of modification in arid environments (e.g., MAP < 800 mm). Future work to quantitatively determine the effects of aridity on delta D-alk is needed to improve the reliability of the application of delta D-alk in paleoenvironmental studies.

Understanding the effects of grazing and prescribed fire on hydrology of Kentucky bluegrass-dominated rangelands in the northern Great Plains	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												According to National Resources Inventory data, Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) is now present in over 85% of the areas sampled. This invasive, perennial, cool season grass can serve to stabilize soils and increase site stability; however, it also alters nutrient flows, soil structure, and plant community composition, ultimately degrading biotic integrity. In addition, Kentucky bluegrass alters the hydrologic function of an area by changing root structure and the way in which water flow is captured and released back into the ecosystem. To clarify the effect of Kentucky bluegrass on hydrological characteristics of invaded sites, rainfall simulation experiments and hydrophobicity measurements with water drop infiltration time and molarity of ethanol droplet tests were conducted at three locations all within the same ecological site in the northern Great Plains. Rainfall simulation experiments were performed on 24 large plots (6 x 2 m) at 63.5 mm h(-1) and 127 mm h(-1) intensities and on 16 small plots (0.7 x 0.7 m) at 63.5 mm h(-1) and 103 mm h(-1). Rainfall was maintained on the large plots until 10 minutes of steady-state runoff was measured or for a maximum of 30 minutes in the absence of runoff, while on the small plots, rainfall duration was set at 25 minutes. The soil layer was divided into four strata (litter, thatch, root mat, and mineral soil), which were physically separated for their hydrophobic behavior in laboratory and field water drop penetration tests and molarity analyses. Our results indicate that on dry soil strata, water drop penetration time increased by 20 seconds on litter and 3 seconds on thatch for every percentage point increase in Kentucky bluegrass in the vegetation, confirming the close association between this grass species and the development of soil hydrophobicity. Rainfall simulation on dry soils (less than 20% volumetric water content) also revealed that the time needed to initiate runoff was shortened by 5 minutes, and the runoff ratio increased by 0.004 for every percentage point increase of Kentucky bluegrass in the vegetation cover. Hydrophobicity dramatically declined in the thatch layer by a factor of 4 and was completely absent from the litter layer after wetting. In contrast to the rainfall simulations on dry soils, wet runs (volumetric water content >= 20%) showed a beneficial effect of Kentucky bluegrass on hydrologic response with delayed runoff by 5 minutes and reduced runoff ratios by 0.003 for 1% increase in Kentucky bluegrass in the vegetation cover. Prescribed fire increased litter hydrophobicity, but this did not adversely affect hydrologic response. This study highlights the need for further research contrasting detrimental effects of Kentucky bluegrass on hydrologic response in dry soil conditions with the beneficial effect of this grass on infiltration under wet conditions to better predict the overall ecohydrological outcome of an invasion by this grass species.

Water quality parameters, such as temperature, water transparency, water depth, dissolved oxygen, pH, total dissolved solids, phosphate, nitrate, and silicate were measured in situ from two sites (littoral and open water zone) of the reservoir. Phytoplankton compositions and abundances were analyzed in Tana fisheries and other aquatic organisms' research center. ANOVA result of the physicochemical parameters included chlorophyll-a showed the presence of significance difference among seasons and between sites (P < 0.05). A total of seven families, 36 genera from three groups (Diatom, Blue green algae and Green algae) of phytoplankton were identified during the study period. From all groups, diatoms were the most abundant at both sites and Blue green algae were the least abundant. ANOVA of all phytoplankton showed highly significant difference among seasons and between sites (P < 0.05). ANOVA of all phytoplankton showed highly significant difference among seasons and between sites (P < 0.05). Based on the stepwise regression, a total number of phytoplanktons had positive correlation with some of the physicochemical parameters (R2 = 0.99, P < 0.001, N = 16). The study concluded that some of physicochemical parameters (NO3-N and PO4-P) indicated the presence of reservoir water pollution. This is supported by the presence of pollution-resistant phytoplankton species such as Melosira and Microcystis. The reservoir water was eutrophic (productive) throughout the year. To avoid such pollution, basin and reservoir management are recommended.																			2190-5487	2190-5495				JUL	2017	7	4					1791	1798		10.1007/s13201-015-0352-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13201-015-0352-5													WOS:000411095500019

We used several data sets to determine how water column nutrients and nonnutrient factors are linked to periphytic biomass and if the ecoregion concept is applicable to nutrient-periphyton relationships. Literature values for seasonal means of biomass of periphyton, nutrient concentrations, and other stream characteristics were collected for almost 300 sampling periods from temperate streams. Data for benthic chlorophyll and nutrient concentrations from a subset of 620 stations in the United States National Stream Water-Quality Monitoring Networks were also analyzed. The greatest portion of variance in models for the mean and maximum biomass of benthic stream algae (about 40%) was explained by concentrations of total N and P. Breakpoint regression and a two-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical technique established significant breakpoints of about 30 mug total P.L-1 and 40 mug total N.L-1, above which mean chlorophyll values were substantially higher. Ecoregion effects on nutrient-chlorophyll relationships were weak. Ecoregion effects were cross-correlated with anthropogenic effects such as percent urban and cropland area in the watershed and population density. Thus, caution is necessary to separate anthropogenic effects from natural variation at the ecoregion level.

The study sites were selected in order to obtain a gradient in thermal regimes and particular organic matter (POM). Differences in the faunal composition of lakes were tested for the ability of these differences to indicate climatic changes, and species/taxa were identified that could be used for the purposes of monitoring and climate change assessment. Macroinvertebrates were sampled quantitatively during the ice-free seasons of 2000 and 2001, and lake surface water temperature (LSWT) and POM were measured. LSWT and POM were negatively correlated with elevation, whereas ice cover was positively correlated with elevation. A total of 60 oligostenothermic macroinvertebrate species/taxa were collected belonging to ten higher taxonomic groups. Statistical analysis showed trends in several biotic metrics with altitude. More specifically, there was a clear increase in the number of species/taxa, genera, and higher taxonomic groups, as well as an increase in the Shannon-Wiener diversity with decreasing altitude. On the contrary, evenness and density of benthic macroinvertebrates did not show any clear relationship with altitude. Gatherers of detrital particles dominated the assemblages' trophic structures, but no distinct changes in the proportion of functional feeding groups along the altitudinal gradient were found. While the non-insect fauna of the lakes was rather uniform across the elevational gradient, the insect fauna composition was highly correlated with altitude, as confirmed by Detrended Correspondence Analysis. Aquatic insects, in particular chironomids and caddisflies, can therefore be used as good indicators of temperature changes. Our results suggest that under warmer conditions, non-insect benthic macroinvertebrates will remain more or less stable, while aquatic insects will undergo an increase in the number of thermophilic species typical for lower altitudes. These colonizers will increase the diversity of alpine lakes, while the extinction of cold stenothermal species will lead to impoverishment of the native fauna. An indirect impact on benthic macroinvertebrates through changes in food sources is likely, and changes in trophic structure of the littoral assemblages can be expected.

ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment in the Czech Republic are commonly planted with reed canarygrass (Pholaris arundinacea). Phalaris is a fast-growing grass which may be cut several times during the growing season. During 2005, the experiments were carried out at horizontal sub-surface flow constructed wetland Brehov to evaluate whether multiple harvest may increase the amount of 23 trace elements removable via mowing. The plants were cut in mid-June and re-harvested in mid-August. The single harvest was carried out at the end of July during the peak standing crop of this species. The biomass of Phalaris cut once and twice during the year was nearly identical but analyses of the biomass indicated that the amount (standing stock) of trace elements varied. For 13 elements (As, Ba, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ga, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb and U) the standing stock was higher for single harvest, indicating that these trace elements are transported to the aboveground biomass later in the growing season. Standing stock found in the biomass harvested at the peak standing crop as percentage of the cumulative standing stock from two harvests was highest for Hg (385%), PI) (249%) and U (244%). On the other hand, for 10 elements (Al, Cd, Li, Mo, Rb, Se, Sn, Sr. Tl and Zn) cumulative standing stock was higher than the standing stock for one harvest, indicating high accumulation during the early growth stages. For those elements, multiple harvest could be beneficial for element removal from wastewater. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effects of alum treatment on water quality and sediment in the Minneapolis Chain of Lakes, Minnesota, USA. Lake Reserv Manage. 27: 220-228. The effects of aluminum sulfate (alum) treatment on water quality in 4 lakes of the Minneapolis Chain of Lakes (MN, USA) were examined. Lakes Harriet and Calhoun (treated in 2001) and Cedar Lake and Lake of the Isles (treated in 1996) all showed initial water quality improvement based on surface water total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll a (Chl-a), and Secchi disk depth. Three lakes (Harriet, Calhoun, and Cedar) were at or below historical estimates of growing season average TP after treatment and showed continued improvement in surface water quality through 2005. Lake of the Isles, which received the lowest alum dose, returned to pretreatment conditions after 6 years. Estimates of sediment phosphorus (P) release rates, however, indicated that alum treatment still limited internal P release in all 4 lakes. Although the alum application to Lake Harriet was a littoral-only treatment, water quality improved in this lake as well. The aluminum hydroxide floc drifted to the deeper part of the lake, reducing internal P release from deeper sediments by 85% in the 2 years following treatment, leading to unexpected improvements in surface water Chl-a and TP concentrations.

Assessment of treatment capabilities of Varthur Lake, Bangalore, India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Manmade waterbodies have traditionally been used for domestic and irrigation purposes. Unplanned urbanisation and ad-hoc approaches have led to these waterbodies receiving untreated sewage. This enriches and eutrophies the waterbody. A physico-chemical and biological analysis of sewage-fed Varthur Lake in Bangalore was carried out and its treatment capabilities in terms of BOD removal, nutrient assimilation and self-remediation were assessed. Anaerobic conditions (0 mg/L) prevail at the inlet which improves towards the outlets due to algal aeration. This removed>50% BOD in the monsoon season but was inhibited by floating macrophytes in all other seasons. Alkalinity, TDS, conductivity and hardness values were higher when compared to earlier studies. This study shows the lake behaves as an anaerobic similar to aerobic lagoon with a residence time of 4.8 d treating the wastewater to a considerable extent. Further research is required to optimise the system performance.

River dolphins do not have natural predators but inhabit dynamic systems with predictable seasonal shifts. These ecological features may provide some insight into the forces driving group formation and help us to answer questions such as why river dolphins have some of the smallest group sizes of cetaceans, and why group sizes vary with time and place. We analyzed observations of group size for Inia and Sotalia over a 9 yr period. In the Amazon, largest group sizes occurred in main rivers and lakes, particularly during the low water season when resources are concentrated; smaller group sizes occurred in constricted waters (channels, tributaries, and confluences) that receive an influx of blackwaters that are poor in nutrients and sediments. In the Orinoco, the largest group sizes occurred during the transitional water season when the aquatic productivity increases. The largest group size of Inia occurred in the Orinoco location that contains the influx of two highly productive whitewater rivers. Flood pulses govern productivity and major biological factors of these river basins. Any threats to flood pulses will likely have an effect on the functionality of these ecosystems and the species living in them.

We hypothesized that dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) and/or nitrogen concentrations (DIN) describe the state of nutrient limitations on phytoplankton production. Using the 38 years of monthly limnological data at eight stations in Lake Kasumigaura, we analyzed the relationships between the available nutrients for building phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll a (Chla). Better correlations were obtained by subtracting the nutrients in tripton (non-living particulate matter) from the total P and N (available nutrients: TP' and TN'). We determined the thresholds for P and N limitation (DIP: 0.01 mg l(-1); DIN: 0.15 mg l(-1)) using the slopes of regression, and we examined this assessment in one of four limitation conditions (only P, only N, both, or none) for the respective times and stations. Close relationships between TP' and Chla for only the P limitation data and between TN' and Chla for only the N limitation data were observed. Multiple regression models confirmed that TP' and TN' predominantly determined Chla in only the P and N limitation conditions, respectively. Factors affecting nutrient use efficiency were also discussed.

In spite of this, the quantitative identification of FWS classification so far remains elusive. In this study, we quantitatively examined the typical matching patterns of FWS based on flood peak magnitude and timing between the upstream and tributary discharge, to evaluate the flood severity for both present-day conditions and future climate projections. The future FWS projection was realized using hydrological modeling coupled with multiple outputs of global climate models (GCMs) under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5 emission scenarios. A triple point of discharge stations, including upstream, downstream and tributary stations, located at a river confluence of the Poyang Lake Basin, China, was selected as the study area. The results revealed that the frequency of perfect temporal matching (0-day time lag) of projected peaks between upstream and tributary floods increased from 61% in the reference period to >68% and > 66% in the future under RCPs 2.6 and 8.5, respectively. Furthermore, both the future numbers and frequencies of the projected peaks between upstream and tributary floods with both perfect temporal and magnitude matching (the classification associated with the most damage in FWS) would substantially increase across all GCMs under RCPs 2.6 and 8.5. These findings indicate that future FWS is expected to experience increasing severity due to the changing climate under no matter RCP 2.6 or 8.5 emission scenarios. Overall, it is suggested that effective adaptation strategies be developed in order to stagger the timing of upstream and tributary floods in the future.

Machine Learning Model-Based Ice Cover Forecasting for a Vital Waterway in Large Lakes	JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING												The St. Marys River is a key waterway that supports the navigation activities in the Laurentian Great Lakes. However, high year-to-year fluctuations in ice conditions pose a challenge to decision making with respect to safe and effective navigation, lock operations, and ice breaking operations. The capability to forecast the ice conditions for the river system can greatly aid such decision making. Small-scale features and complex physics in the river system are difficult to capture by process-based numerical models that are often used for lake-wide applications. In this study, two supervised machine learning methods, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model and the Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) algorithm are applied to predict the ice coverage on the St. Marys River for short-term (7-day) and sub-seasonal (30-day) time scales. Both models are trained using 25 years of meteorological data and select climate indices. Both models outperform the baseline forecast in the short-term applications, but the models underperform the baseline forecast in the sub-seasonal applications. The model accuracies are high in the stable season, while they are lower in the freezing and melting periods when ice conditions can change rapidly. The errors of the predicted ice-on/ice-off date lie within 2-5 days.

In this study, the Wanggang River, which is a seagoing river that passes through Yancheng City, was selected as the research object. Three-dimensional (3D) fluorescence spectral data and UV-visible spectral data were used for component identification and source analysis of DOM based on the PARAFAC model. The results showed that the DOM content of the Wanggang River during the dry season was significantly higher than during the wet season; the DOM content increased gradually from the upper to lower reaches; the proportion of terrigenous components was higher during the wet season than during the dry. UV-Vis spectral data a(280) and a(355) indicated that the relative concentrations of protein-like components in the DOM of the Wanggang River were higher than those of humic-like components, and the ratio of aromatic substances in the DOM of the Wanggang River water was higher during the wet season. The DOM in the Wanggang River was dominated by protein-like components (>60%), and the protein-like components were dominated by tryptophan proteins (>40%). This study showed that the temporal and spatial distributions of DOM in rivers can be accurately determined using 3D fluorescence spectroscopy combined with the PARAFAC model. This provides useful insight into the biogeochemical process of DOM in rivers of coastal areas.

Short-tailed mice with a long fossil record: the genus Leggadina (Rodentia: Muridae) from the Quaternary of Queensland, Australia	PEERJ												The genus Leggadina (colloquially known as 'short-tailed mice') is a common component of Quaternary faunas of northeastern Australia. They represent a member of the Australian old endemic murid radiation that arrived on the continent sometime during the late Cenozoic. Here we describe two new species of extinct Leggadina from Quaternary cave deposits as well as additional material of the extinct Leggadina macrodonta. Leggadina irvini sp. nov. recovered from Middle-Upper (late) Pleistocene cave deposits near Chillagoe, northeastern Queensland, is the biggest member of the genus, being substantially larger than any other species so far described. Leggadina webbi sp. nov. from Middle Pleistocene cave deposits at Mount Etna, central eastern Queensland, shares features with the oldest species of the genus, the Early Pleistocene L. gregoriensis. Based on the current palaeoecological interpretation of the type locality, L. webbi, represents the only member of the genus that inhabited rainforest. The succession of Leggadina species through the late Quaternary suggests an ecological replacement of the extinct large-bodied L. irvini with the extant, small-bodied L. lakedownesis at Chillagoe. At Mt. Etna, the extinct rainforest species L. webbi is replaced with the extant xeric-adapted L. forresti during the latest Middle Pleistocene. This replacement is associated with a mid-Pleistocene shift towards progressive intensifying seasonal and arid climates. Our study adds to the growing list of small-bodied faunal extinctions during the late Quaternary of northern Australia.					; Price, Gilbert/N-3282-2013	Hocknull, Scott/0000-0003-4157-8434; Price, Gilbert/0000-0001-8406-4594; Cramb, Jonathan/0000-0001-6671-6130													2167-8359					SEP 21	2018	6								e5639	10.7717/peerj.5639	http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.5639								30258727					WOS:000446941300006
J	Liang, ZY; Wu, SF; Chen, HL; Yu, YH; Liu, Y				Liang, Zhongyao; Wu, Sifeng; Chen, Huili; Yu, Yanhong; Liu, Yong			A probabilistic method to enhance understanding of nutrient limitation dynamics of phytoplankton	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Determination of the limiting nutrient of phytoplankton is critical to the lake eutrophication management. The average value of total nitrogen/total phosphorus (TN/TP) ratio is widely used to determine the limiting nutrient; while it suffers from the risk of the incorrect description of data and neglecting dynamics of the nutrient limitation. A probabilistic method was thereby proposed in this study to explore dynamics of nutrient limitation, including (a) indicator definition as the probability of TN/TP ratio failing in Redfield ratio line (PFR), indicating the possibility of TN limitation, to improve a probabilistic measure for the nutrient limitation; (b) Bayesian ANOVA analysis for posterior distributions of different treatments; and (c) dynamics determination as PFRs to show dynamics of nutrient limitation. Lake Xingyun in Southwestern China was taken as a case to explore the interannual and seasonal dynamics of the nutrient limitation. According to modeling results, we deducted that (a) for the interannual dynamics, the limiting nutrient shifted from TP to TN; and (b) for the seasonal dynamics, TN and TP were co-limiting. Deductions were further confirmed by the observed data. With the proposed probabilistic method, the co-limitation of TN and TP was identified for the seasonal dynamics; while using the average ratio solely denied the possibility of co-limitation. The current study also revealed that, due to neglecting the interannual and seasonal dynamics of nutrient limitation, the average ratio might mislead the eutrophication management strategy by recommending reducing TN and TP concentration together. The proposed probabilistic method demonstrated that TN was the limiting nutrient during the growing season of the phytoplankton in recent years and actions should focus on the TN concentration reduction.

J	Sarmento, H; Amado, AM; Descy, JP				Sarmento, Hugo; Amado, Andre M.; Descy, Jean-Pierre			Climate change in tropical fresh waters (comment on the paper 'Plankton dynamics under different climatic conditions in space and time' by de Senerpont Domis et al., 2013)	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. de Senerpont Domis etal. (2013, Freshwater Biology, 58, 463-482) forecasted changes in plankton dynamics in temperate, polar and tropical regions resulting from climate change. For tropical regions, they predicted an increase in precipitation intensity that would increase nutrient loading, increasing phytoplankton biomass and select for plankton adapted to flushing. 2. We do not agree with these predictions, as regional projections from the IPCC did not forecast a major increase in precipitation in tropical regions. The only regions where a slight increase in precipitation was projected were eastern Africa and South-East Asia. In eastern Africa, the major freshwater bodies are large, deep lakes that have very long residence times and are unlikely to be affected by flushing. Moreover, nutrient inputs from their catchment represent a small fraction of their total nutrient loading. 3. Several independent studies carried out in this region have provided evidence of a decrease in primary productivity in some of these large tropical lakes due to climate change. The major process providing nutrients to the euphotic layer is internal loading, which has been reduced as warming of the surface waters has increased the temperature gradient and the water column stability. Moreover, reduced velocity of trade winds during the dry season has affected the mixed layer depth and decreased internal nutrient fluxes. Therefore, the trend for large tropical lakes in a warming climate is oligotrophication, not eutrophication. 4. In tropical South America, the rainfall increase is not the dominant scenario; thus, the predicted changes in plankton dynamics do not stand. 5. Therefore, we believe that the predictions presented in the paper for tropical systems under a changing climate are invalid for most tropical systems.

In recent decades, a number of exotic fish species have been introduced into the lake and the fish community has changed considerably. We evaluated the status of the fish community based on surveys with multimesh gillnet, trap net, and benthic fyke-net between May 2009 and April 2012. In addition, we evaluated the change in the community using historical data (1952-2010) describing the fish community and fishery harvest. The current fish community is dominated by small-sized fishes, including Pseudorasbora parva, Rhinogobius giurinus, Micropercops swinhonis, Hemiculter leucisculus, and Rhinogobius cliffordpopei. These accounted for 87.7% of the 22 546 total specimens collected. Omnivorous and carnivorous species dominated the community. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) plot revealed that the distribution of fishes in the lake is influenced by aquatic plants, water temperature, pH, and season. The abundance of indigenous species has declined sharply, and a majority of endemic species have been extirpated from the lake (a decrease from seven to two species). In contrast, the number of exotic species has increased since the 1960s to a total of 22 at present. The fishery harvest decreased initially following the 1960s, but has since increased due to the introduction of non-native fish and stocking of native fish. The fishery harvest was significantly correlated with total nitrogen, not total phosphorus, during the past 20 years. Based on our results, we discuss recommendations for the restoration and conservation of the fish resources in Erhai Lake.					; Li, Zhongjie/J-1474-2018; LI, WEI/ISS-1208-2023; Liu, Shengbo/JAZ-9733-2023	Tang, Jianfeng/0000-0001-8974-5831; Ye, Shaowen/0000-0003-3932-8401													0254-4059	1993-5005				JUL	2013	31	4					712	723		10.1007/s00343-013-2324-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-013-2324-7													WOS:000321629400002

Factors affecting occurrence and bloom formation of the nuisance flagellate Gonyostomum semen in boreal lakes	HARMFUL ALGAE												We examined changes in G. semen occurrence and bloom incidence in 146 boreal lakes in Sweden sampled at least once between 1992 and 2010, and used a time-by-space model to assess the environmental variables that best explain patterns in G. semen distribution and bloom formation. We showed that G. semen has become more common, although there were no significant shifts in its geographical distribution during the study period. In particular, G. semen was spreading into new lakes in the Central Plains ecoregion (southern Sweden), whereas its occurrence and biomass usually remained low in the Borealic Upland and Fennoscandian Shield ecoregions. G. semen biomass and the incidence of blooms did not increase significantly during the study period, but fluctuated among years and reached a maximum in 2003. The occurrence of G. semen was mainly explained by temperature and the length of the growing season, whilst local-scale variables, such as pH and water color, were the best predictors of blooms. Analysis of bloom formation at three different levels of G. semen dominance: G. semen >50%, >75%, and >90% of total phytoplankton biomass revealed a wide range of responses to environmental variation. For example, pH, water color and to a lesser extent temperature explained bloom formation at the 50% level, whereas lake morphometry was important at the 90% level. These results suggest that with ongoing brownification and climate warming boreal systems will likely become more susceptible to invasions of G. semen. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Phosphorus and Water Budgets in an Agricultural Basin	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Water and phosphorus (P) budgets of a large agricultural basin located in South Florida (Everglades Agricultural Area, EAA) were computed from 2005 to 2012. The annual surface outflow P loading from the EAA averaged 157.2 mtons originating from Lake Okeechobee (16.4 mtons, 10.4%), farms (131.0 mtons, 83.4%), and surrounding basins (9.8 mtons, 6.2%) after attenuation. Farms, urban areas, and the adjacent C-139 basin contributed 186.1, 15.6, and 3.8 mtons/yr P to the canals, respectively. The average annual soil P retention was estimated at 412.5 mtons. Water and P budgets showed seasonal variations with high correlation between rainfall and P load in drainage and surface outflows. Moreover, results indicated that the canals acted as a P sink storing 64.8 mtons/yr. To assess the P loading impact of farm drainage on the canals and on the outflow, dimensionless impact factors were developed. Sixty-two farms were identified with a high and a medium impact factor I-1 level contributing 44.5% of the total drainage P load to the canals, while their collective area represented less than 23% of the EAA area (172 farms). Optimizing the best management practice (BMP) strategies on these farms could minimize the environmental impacts on the downstream sensitive wetlands areas.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				AUG 5	2014	48	15			SI		8481	8490		10.1021/es500738v	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es500738v								24955757					WOS:000340080600021
J	Lv, YP; Gu, LH; Xu, JZ; Liu, XY				Lv, Yuping; Gu, Linhui; Xu, Junzeng; Liu, Xiaoyin			A coupled hourly water-carbon flux model at plot and field scales for water-saving irrigated rice paddy	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Based on spot-scale measurements of lysimeter-based water fluxes and chamber-based carbon fluxes (ETWML or FSTC), and field- scale measurements of eddy covariance-based water and carbon fluxes (ETEC or FEC), a coupled water-carbon flux model was developed to predicted simultaneously hourly water and carbon fluxes at either spot or field scale in the water-saving irrigated paddy in Tai Lake Region of China. The coupled model integrated Penman-Monteith and Farquhar-von Caemmerer-Berry (FvCB) sub-models with the Jarvis sub-model, and was calibrated based on measured fluxes in 2015 and validated using data in 2016-2017. The performance of the coupled model was assessed by comparing simulated values with measured hourly ETWML, FSTC, ETEC and FEC under various conditions, including day/night/all day periods, different canopy coverage levels, and seasonal variations during rice seasons. The results revealed notable differences in the parameters of the Jarvis sub-model between plot and field scales. The ratio of leaf dark respiration to leaf maximum carboxylation rate were respectively calibrated as 0.041 and 0.047 to reflect the respiration of soil-vegetation system at plot and field scales. The maximum carboxylation rate (Vm) reached its peak during the jointing-booting stage and then decreased until the end of the rice season, and the Vm values at the plot scale were considerably higher than those at the field scale. The coupled model respectively exhibited poor and acceptable performance in estimating water and carbon fluxes during nighttime, and performed well during daytime or throughout the day. Additionally, the coupled model performed much better in estimating diurnal and seasonal variations in fluxes under high leaf area index conditions compared to low leaf area index conditions.

Nile Perch densities were estimated through echo-counting, while Dagaa and haplochromines by echo-integration. Mixed generalized linear model estimates indicated up to 30% decline in Nile Perch densities in the deep and coastal areas and up to 65% reduction in the shallow inshore areas over the study period. There was a twofold increase in Dagaa densities and a 10% increase in haplochromines. The distribution and densities of these species were influenced by season, stratum and year of survey. In addition to fish exhibiting seasonal clustering in the upper layers of the water column, they also appeared to spread to shallow inshore waters. The Nyanza, Speke, and Emin Pasha Gulfs demonstrated diverse spatial stock oscillations in abundance, and distribution which call for a need to include area disaggregated considerations in stochastic models when predicting dynamics of fish stocks.					; Nyamweya, Chrispine/I-5429-2019	Nyamweya, Chrispine/0000-0002-7135-7379; Marteinsdottir, Gudrun/0000-0001-6939-2434; Kayanda, Robert/0000-0002-6085-1267													1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN 2	2014	17	1			SI		52	61		10.1080/14634988.2014.876886	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634988.2014.876886													WOS:000334040200007

Impacts of rainfall on the water quality of the Newport River Estuary (Eastern North Carolina, USA)	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												The Newport River Estuary (NPRE), an important North Carolina (NC) shellfish harvesting area, has been experiencing alterations to the land-water interface due to increasing population and coastal development. Water quality degradation in the estuary over the last decade has led to an increase of shellfish harvesting area closures, and has been postulated to be due to non-point source contamination in the form of stormwater. Water samples were taken in the NPRE (n = 179) over a range of weather conditions and all seasons from August 2004 to September 2006. Fecal coliform (FC), as estimated by E. coli (EC), and Enterococcus (ENT) concentrations (MPN per 100 ml) were examined in relation to rainfall levels and distance from land. The relationships among the fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) and environmental parameters were also examined. The data revealed a significant increase in FC concentrations after measured rainfall amounts of 2.54cm (general threshold) and 3.81cm (management action threshold). However, higher than expected FIB concentrations existed during conditions of negligible rainfall (<0.25 cm), indicating a possible reservoir population in the sediment. Overall, stormwater runoff appears to be adversely impacting water quality in the NPRE.

Ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase, glutathion S-transferase, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, acid phosphatase, and alanine and aspartate amino transferase activities have been measured in liver samples of Cyprinus carpio and Capoeta tinca. Also, brain acetylcholinesterase and carboxylesterase activities have been measured for the same samples. Selected enzymes confirmed that Sariyar basin is polluted by urban wastes and agricultural and industrial activities for many years. Organochlorine (OC) pesticide residues, caused by intensive agricultural activities, have also been observed in water, sediment samples, and adipose tissues of carp. Monitored results showed that SDL was polluted by different kinds of OC compounds such as DDT and its derivatives which are accumulated in adipose tissues of carp. Highest accumulation was found for beta-BHC in carp. The changes of enzyme activities in this study may be related to environmental pollution, while enzyme activity variations could be attributed to variable pollutants and variable concentrations of these pollutants. The results highlighted the potential convenience of these biomarkers to be used as components of environmental monitoring program in risk assessment studies in SDL. Since a seasonal variation in selected enzyme activities was found, the possible implications of such variability in the use of these enzymes as environmental biomarkers are also discussed. Hepatic cytosolic EROD did not show any significance according to the pollution factors in the lake which may be attributed to relatively less contamination by organic compounds such as PAH products.

Flow pathways and nutrient transport mechanisms drive hydrochemical sensitivity to climate change across catchments with different geology and topography	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Hydrological processes determine the transport of nutrients and passage of diffuse pollution. Consequently, catchments are likely to exhibit individual hydrochemical responses (sensitivities) to climate change, which are expected to alter the timing and amount of runoff, and to impact in-stream water quality. In developing robust catchment management strategies and quantifying plausible future hydrochemical conditions it is therefore equally important to consider the potential for spatial variability in, and causal factors of, catchment sensitivity, as it is to explore future changes in climatic pressures. This study seeks to identify those factors which influence hydrochemical sensitivity to climate change. A perturbed physics ensemble (PPE), derived from a series of global climate model (GCM) variants with specific climate sensitivities was used to project future climate change and uncertainty. Using the INtegrated CAtchment model of Phosphorus dynamics (INCA-P), we quantified potential hydrochemical responses in four neighbouring catchments (with similar land use but varying topographic and geological characteristics) in southern Ontario, Canada. Responses were assessed by comparing a 30 year baseline (1968-1997) to two future periods: 2020-2049 and 2060-2089. Although projected climate change and uncertainties were similar across these catchments, hydrochemical responses (sensitivities) were highly varied. Sensitivity was governed by quaternary geology (influencing flow pathways) and nutrient transport mechanisms. Clay-rich catchments were most sensitive, with total phosphorus (TP) being rapidly transported to rivers via overland flow. In these catchments large annual reductions in TP loads were projected. Sensitivity in the other two catchments, dominated by sandy loams, was lower due to a larger proportion of soil matrix flow, longer soil water residence times and seasonal variability in soil-P saturation. Here smaller changes in TP loads, predominantly increases, were projected. These results suggest that the clay content of soils could be a good indicator of the sensitivity of catchments to climatic input, and reinforces calls for catchment-specific management plans.

Tracking Centimeter-Scale Water Level Changes in Swedish Lakes Using D-InSAR	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Lakes are valuable water resources that support aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and supply fresh water for the agricultural, industrial, and urban sectors worldwide. Although water levels should be tracked to monitor these services, conventional gauging is unfeasible in most lakes. This study applies Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (D-InSAR) to estimate small water level changes, less than 2 cm, in Swedish lakes over 6-day intervals. We validated the method across the shores of 30 Swedish lakes with gauged observations in 2019. We used Sentinel-1A/B images with a 6-day temporal separation to construct consecutive interferograms and accumulated the phase changes in pixels of high coherence to build a time series of water levels. We find that the accumulated phase change obtained by D-InSAR replicates the magnitude of water levels in seven lakes in Southern Sweden, where water levels change slowly, less than 2 cm per 6-day period, as validated by in-situ gauges. In addition, this study demonstrates the application of D-InSAR to estimate the long-term direction of water level change (i.e., increase or decrease) in all 30 lakes. This work reveals the utility of high temporal resolution water level observations in support of other satellite water level instruments such as conventional altimeters and the recently launched Surface Water and Ocean Topography Mission.

Hence, as global temperatures rise due to climate change, some Cyanobacterial species will thrive in warmer temperatures, which will result in increased blooms during the growing season. The MIKE-3 model is calibrated to existing (2022) conditions and is used to assess the impact of the RCP 4.5 scenario for the year 2050 in Fairy Lake (a shallow urban lake in Ontario). The simulations projected indicate that in 2050, in the central parts of Fairy Lake's central basin, water temperatures will be above 20 degrees C for 2281 h compared to 2060 h in 2022. This situation indicates there will be a 10.7% increase in the duration of Cyanobacteria blooms in the central area of Fairy Lake. Similarly, in the northern area of Fairy Lake, the MIKE-3 model results indicate that surface temperature durations above 20 degrees C will increase from 1628 h to 2275 h for the year 2050, resulting in an additional 647 h of increased temperatures at the surface under RCP 4.5 scenario conditions. This situation indicates there will be a 39.7% increase in the duration of Cyanobacteria blooms in the northern portion of Fairy Lake. These modeling conditions indicate there will be significantly more habitat amenable to Cyanobacteria growth when surface water temperatures are above 20 degrees C, indicating substantial increases in the available growth time of Cyanobacteria due to climate change, all of which translate to major concerns caused by climate change.

A better understanding on grassland changes at a fine scale may provide important guidance for local government policy and grassland management. Using two of the most reliable satellite NDVI products (MODIS NDVI and SPOT NDVI), we evaluated the dynamic of grasslands in the Zhegucuo valley on the southern Tibetan Plateau from 2000 to 2020, and analyzed its driving factors and relative influences of climate change and anthropogenic activities. Here, the key indicators of climate change were assumed to be precipitation and temperature. The main results were: (1) the grassland NDVI in Zhegucuo valley did not reflect a significant temporal change during the last 21 years. The variation of precipitation during the early growing season (GSP) resembled that of NDVI, and the GSP was positively correlated with NDVI. At the pixel level, the partial correlation analysis showed that 37.79% of the pixels depicted a positive relationship between GSP and NDVI, while 11.32% of the pixels showed a negative relationship between temperature during the early growing season (GST) and NDVI. (2) In view of the spatial distribution, the areas mainly controlled by GSP were generally distributed in the southern part, while those affected by GST stood in the eastern part, mainly around the Zhegucuo lake where most population in Cuomei County settled down. (3) Decreasing NDVI trends were mainly occurred in alpine steppe at lower elevations rather than alpine meadow at higher elevations. (4) The residual trend (RESTREND) analysis further indicated that the anthropogenic activities played a more pivotal role in regulating the annual changes of NDVI rather than climate factors in this area. Future studies should pay more attention on climate extremes rather than the simple temporal trends. Also, the influence of human activities on alpine grassland needs to be accessed and fully considered in future sustainable management.						zhang, lin/0000-0002-3252-0751													1672-6316	1993-0321				FEB	2024	21	2					607	618		10.1007/s11629-023-8299-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-023-8299-8													WOS:001173920000010

Water-lifting aeration (WLA) is a technology known to solve this problem by elevating near-sediment dissolved oxygen (DO) and increasing mixing in the water column in a canyon reservoir with deep water (>20 m). The influence of WLA in reservoirs with large surface area and small water depth has not been adequately evaluated. For this purpose, the efficiency of an innovative WLA system was reviewed in Zhoucun Reservoir (ZCR), a mildly eutrophic reservoir with a mean depth of 15 m. Methods Three years of field experiment was performed in ZCR. Water and sediment samples were collected before and after the operation of the WLA system to explore the causes for the deterioration of water quality in ZCR, and the efficiency of the innovative WLA system installed in 2015. With the use of a microporous aerator and a kinetic energy dissipator, the new-style WLA system is different from WLA studied before. Results and discussion As a result of thermal stratification and the long duration of anaerobic environment in the hypolimnion, the sediment oxygen consumption rate in ZCR was calculated to be 16.14 mg m(-2) h(-1), which was much higher than other reservoirs, and the main pollutants in ZCR were ammonia, phosphorus, manganese and sulphide. After the operation of the new WLA system, the anaerobic environment in the bottom water was completely reversed and the DO concentration in the hypolimnion water has been maintained at more than 6 mg L-1. The release of pollutants from sediments, such as ammonia, phosphorus, manganese and sulphide, was inhibited significantly. Ammonia, phosphorus, manganese and sulphide in water decreased by 89%, 84%, 97% and 87%, respectively. Conclusions The results of this study demonstrate that employing WLA systems to oxygenate and mix stagnant water bodies is a viable and potentially favourable management strategy for reservoirs with large surface area and relatively small water depth.

The mutagenicity of the water samples was evaluated using the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. According to the results, the organic compounds in the water were largely frame-shift mutagens, as positive results were found for most of the tests using TA98. All of the finished water samples exhibited stronger mutagenicity than the relative raw and distribution water samples, with water samples collected from Plant B presenting stronger mutagenic strength than those from Plant A. The finished water samples from Plant A displayed a seasonal-dependent variation. Water parameters including COD (r = 0.599, P = 0.009), TOC (r = 0.681, P = 0.02), UV254 (r = 0.711, P = 0.001), and total nitrogen (r = 0.570, P = 0.014) exhibited good correlations with mutagenicity (TA98), at 2.0 L/plate, which bolsters the argument of the importance of using mutagenicity as a new parameter to assess the quality of drinking water.					yang, xiaoming/E-9823-2013														2045-2322					MAR 31	2015	5								9572	10.1038/srep09572	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep09572								25825837					WOS:000351944600002
J	Karanovic, T; Cooper, SJB				Karanovic, Tomislav; Cooper, Steven J. B.			Molecular and morphological evidence for short range endemism in the Kinnecaris solitaria complex (Copepoda: Parastenocarididae), with descriptions of seven new species	ZOOTAXA												Recent investigation of one of the larger calcretes in the uppermost reaches of the Carey palaeochannel in the Yilgarn region of Western Australia revealed an unprecedented diversity of copepod crustaceans. Twenty-two different species and subspecies, from six copepod families, represent 70% of the previously recorded copepod a-diversity in the whole region, although the area investigated is less than 3% of its surface. The aims of this study were to explore the diversity of the harpacticoid genus Kinnecaris Jakobi, 1972 using both molecular and morphological methods, establish precise species boundaries, find their accurate area of distribution, reconstruct phylogenetic relationships, and explore colonisation pathways. To achieve this we sampled very intensively in the area, as well as in two neighbouring palaeochannels, analysing more than 700 samples from 230 different localities, half of which contained copepods. Seven species are described here as new, five of them from the Yeelirrie palaeochannel (K. esbe sp. nov., K. lined sp. nov., K. linel sp. nov., K. linesae sp. nov., and K. uranusi sp. nov.) and one each from two neighbouring palaeochannels (K. barrambie sp. nov. and K. lakewayi sp. nov.). Parastenocaris jane Karanovic, 2006 from the Pilbara region, along with a newly described third Australian parastenocaridid genus from the Yilgarn, were used as outgroups in our molecular analysis. The COI fragment was successfully PCR-amplified from 12 parastenocaridid specimens using a nested combination of primers. All analyses supported the presence of at least seven genetically divergent lineages, most supported with very high bootstrap values. Three genera formed three separate clades, and the average pairwise distances between Kinnecaris morpho-taxa were found to be very high (8.2-16.8 %), while the highest divergences within morpho-taxa were 0.3%. Some conflict between molecular phylogenies and morphological data was observed when it came to recognizing different groups of species. While morphology indicates that K. esbe, K. linel, and K. uranusi represent a group of very closely related species, supported by a number of synapomorphies, molecular analyses suggest that K. linel and K. uranusi are only remotely related. We argue in favor of morphological data, until more markers can be studied to try to resolve these differences. In Yeelirrie, morphological evidence would suggest a downstream colonisation history in the genus Kinnecaris, where the most plesiomorphic form (K. linesae) lives in the uppermost reaches of the palaeochannel, and the trend in the caudal rami elongation and denser somite ornamentation is obvious downstream the palaeochannel (K. uranusi, K. linel, and then K. esbe), with the only exception being K. lined, which probably represents an independent colonisation event. Parastenocarids are copepods of freshwater origin, and we argure that they can probably disperse downstream during periods of increased rainfall, evolving into separate species in isolated calcrete pockets during periods of increased aridity. Although some of the questions remained unanswered in this study, detailed morphological and molecular observations indicate that we are not dealing with one widely distributed and variable species in the Yilgarn region, but rather with a complex of short range endemics.

Phosphorus sequestration in soil aggregates after long-term tillage and cropping	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH					HighLand 2006 International Symposium	SEP 21-25, 2006	Mekelle, ETHIOPIA					Cultivated soils in the Everglades are being converted to their historic use as pastures or seasonally flooded prairies as parts of restoration efforts, but long-term cultivation may have altered soil P distribution and availability which may pose eutrophication hazards upon change in land use. The objectives of this study were to determine the distribution of P in soil chemical and physical fractions for contrasting long-term land management practices. The distribution of P in labile, Fe-Al bound, Ca bound, humic-fulvic acid, and residual pools in five aggregate-size fractions were measured for fields under sugarcane (Saccharum sp.) cropping for 50 years and perennial pasture for 100 years. Both land uses were characterized by a high degree of macroaggregation, as aggregates >0.25 mm contained 76 and 83% of the total soil under cultivation and pasture, respectively. Soils under sugarcane sequestered a total of 77 kg ha(-1) more P than pasture at 0-15 cm. The distribution of P in chemical fractions significantly varied between land uses as cultivation increased P sequestration in Ca-bound fractions more for sugarcane (244 kg P ha(-1)) than pasture (65 kg P ha(-1)). Pasture sequestered more P in organic pools, as storage in humic-fulvic acid and residual fractions were 26 and 25%, respectively. higher than sugarcane. Labile P was 100% higher for pasture than sugarcane, but Fe-Al bound P storage did not differ between land uses. Aggregation increased P sequestration in humic-fulvic acid and residual fractions, and P storage in organic pools increased with increasing aggregate size. In contrast, cultivation decreased aggregation and increased P accumulation in inorganic fractions. Long-term cultivation altered the distribution of soil P from organic to inorganic pools. The P stored in inorganic pools is stable under current land use, but may be unstable and pose eutrophication hazards upon onset of future land use change to the seasonally flooded prairie ecosystem.

Inflow and lake controls on short-term mass accumulation and sedimentary particle size in a High Arctic lake: implications for interpreting varved lacustrine sedimentary records	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Sedimentary processes were monitored in a varved lake in the Canadian High Arctic through three melt seasons and revealed that seasonal sediment deposition rates were highly dependent on short-lived inflow events driven by high suspended sediment concentrations that varied with runoff intensity. Our results illustrate that in accordance with the suspended sediment discharge into the lake, the rate of sediment accumulation changed over short distances down-lake, in a given year. This result indicates that there is a rate and accumulation dependence on short-lived, intense inflow conditions. In addition, there was strong evidence for substantial decoupling between deposition rate and mean grain size of sedimentary deposits. These results have important implications for paleoclimate interpretation of annually laminated sedimentary records from dynamic lake environments and suggest that grain size measures may not be representative proxies of inflow competence. Grain size indices based on a measure of the coarser fraction, rather than the bulk sediment, may be more appropriate to use as a link between contemporary runoff processes and sedimentary characteristics.

In these optically complex waters, the amounts of suspended matter and dissolved organic matter vary greatly and independently of the phytoplankton biomass. We demonstrate that MCI is a. useful, new tool for detecting and estimating cyanobacterial biomass (R-2 = 0.73), phytoplankton biomass (R-2 = 0.70) and chlorophyll a concentration (R-2 = 0.64). The MCI-derived results are consistent with known patterns of phytoplankton dynamics in these lakes, whose optical properties are in the same range as in many coastal regions of the Baltic Sea.

In this study, syngenetic and diagenetic aspects of the Ipubi Formation at Santana do Cariri (Ceara State) were investigated by means of fades analysis, petrography, and mineralogical/chemical analyses of evaporites and shales. The results show that the contact relationship between evaporites and manly shales, without signs of subaerial exposure and laterally adjacent, was associated with shallow, calm and somewhat anoxic waterbodies, locally salt-supersaturated (brines) but under seasonal variations of water levels. This scenario could have shared place with hydrothermal phenomena in a playa lake depositional system. Regarding diagenesis, although there is evidence supporting pseudomorphic replacement of gypsum by anhydrite, the burial of the Ipubi Formation would have been limited due to the frequent occurrence of gypsum without any trace of chemical replacement.

We sampled tetragnathid spiders (terrestrial predators), larval chironomids (spider prey of aquatic origin) and terrestrial insects (terrestrial prey) from two contaminated and two control sites in the Norfolk Broads (U.K.) to determine whether the organotin compound tributyltin (TBT) is transferred by emergent aquatic insects. TBT, a biocide in antifoulant paints, was prohibited in the U.K. in 1987 and globally since 2008 but persists in sediments for decades. Combining stable-isotope analyses commonly used in ecology with ecotoxicological methods enabled us to test whether aquatic subsidies could transport organotin to terrestrial predators. Stable-isotope mixing models (N-15 and C-13) indicated that chironomids contributed 31-98% to spider biomass. Subsequent organotin analyses revealed consistent, low-level butyltin (dibutyltin; DBT) contamination of chironomids from the most contaminated site but not from the other three sites. Spiders from the most contaminated site had DBT concentrations similar to those of their chironomid prey. To assess bioaccumulation, we used N-15 values as a proxy for trophic position of sediments, chironomids and spiders, and correlated these values with the respective DBT concentrations. Notwithstanding indications of N-15-enrichment along this short food chain, chironomid DBT concentrations were significantly greater than those of their spider predators. Biota sediment accumulation factors (sediments to chironomids) and biomagnification factors (chironomids to spiders) were below the thresholds defining the occurrence of bioaccumulation and biomagnification. Although biomagnification was not detected, it is of concern that butyltins are still present in freshwater food webs c.25years since last known TBT use in the U.K., and continue to be transferred to terrestrial consumers.					; Grey, Jonathan/B-3346-2012	Grey, Jonathan/0000-0001-9069-2271; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				DEC	2016	61	12			SI		2051	2062		10.1111/fwb.12733	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12733													WOS:000387504700006

Results showed that 50-70% of the annual N2O emission was emitted during wheat season and 30-50% during rice season. During rice seasons, greatest flux occurred immediately after preflooding at the start of rice season, accompanied by peaks of NO3 concentrations in soil water. N2O emission during the preflooding period contributed 80-84% of seasonal emission, far higher than 7.6-8.4% released during midseason aeration and 5.0-7.4% during drainage period. Variation of N2O emission in wheat season was much greater than that in rice season. In the Taihu lake region, controlled water management determined emissions of N2O in rice season, whereas variation of natural precipitation and temperature determined N2O emission pattern during wheat season.

The long ice season necessitates study of the widespread ice covers in the region. An unprecedented multidisciplinary field campaign was conducted on lake ice processes in the central QTP during the period 2019-13. The study lake generally froze up in late October or early November, and broke up in mid or late April, with a maximum ice thickness of 50-70 cm. The mass balances at both ice surface and bottom were measured continuously. Significant ice surface sublimation/ablation was detected and accounted for up to 40% of the whole ice thickness over the ice season. A simple heat-transfer model was developed for the surface ice loss. The calculated values were in good agreement with the observations. They also indicated that atmospheric conditions, including low air humidity and prevailing strong winds, are the primary drivers of the ice surface sublimation.

Barriers to implementing poverty alleviation through livelihood strategies: A participatory analysis of farming communities in Ethiopia?s upper Blue Nile basin	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY												Poverty is multi-dimensional global challenge that impedes individual and community capacities to satisfy basic needs. These capacities are shaped by locally configured institutional and biophysical processes that are often hidden from external researchers and practitioners. To explore this worldwide aspect, we adopt participatory rural appraisal (PRA) methods to expose barriers to implementing livelihood strategies to address poverty in Ethiopia's upper Blue Nile basin, where 85 % of the population are subsistence farmers reliant on local ecosystem services (ES). We identify local barriers to poverty alleviation in three steps. First, we classify major ES-livelihood interrelationships among communities of Debre Mawi catchment in upper Blue Nile. Secondly we assess ongoing struggles in these interrelations using combined biophysical and social assessment criteria to evaluate how poverty relates to current patterns of ES management. The analysis identifies complex interdependencies between livelihoods and regulating (crop pest controls), provisioning (water, land, and feed availability, soil fertility) and cultural (top-down ES management, population growth) ES that create bottlenecks to effectively 'lock in' poverty. Thirdly, we identify potential new ES management strategies, focused on dry season water availability. We conduct participatory field experiments on rooftop water harvesting to show this is a promising approach for increasing water availability to enhance agricultural production. Depending on the rooftop area, our modelling suggests that farmers can improve household income by US$136- 14,876 from 5 months beef fattening and US$69-7704 from 4 months sheep fattening. Except these specific livelihood strategies, the findings are replicable to the world's ES-dependent regions.

Movement and home range of introduced Nile perch (Lates niloticus) in Lake Nabugabo, Uganda: Implications for ecological divergence and fisheries management	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Nile perch (Lates niloticus) was introduced to the Lake Victoria basin in the 1950s and 1960s and eventually became one of the most valuable commercial species of East Africa's inland fisheries. Intense fishing-induced mortality may be contributing to dramatic ecological change in this species (reductions in body size and catch rate) and reinforcing patterns of ecological divergence in some lakes in the region. We used radio telemetry to characterize Nile perch movement and home range size in Lake Nabugabo, Uganda and quantified patterns of habitat selection by Nile perch in the heavily-fished near-shore areas of this system. Nile perch exhibited high site tenacity with daily movement averaging similar to 400 m/day and home range size averaging 0.83 km(2). Body size and water temperature were both important predictors of Nile perch movement patterns. In the near-shore area of the lake, Nile perch selected regions characterized by low temperature and high oxygen conditions, and tended to prefer forest edge over wetland edge. The level of site tenacity exhibited by Nile perch suggests that ecological isolation between fish using forest and wetland ecotones may be higher than expected. These results also have important implications for development of territorial jurisdiction by Beach Management Units, the decentralized structure of fisheries management in the region.

Relationship Between Greenland Ice Sheet Surface Speed and Modeled Effective Pressure	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												We use a numerical subglacial hydrology model and remotely sensed observations of Greenland Ice Sheet surface motion to test whether the inverse relationship between effective pressure and regional melt season surface speeds observed at individual sites holds on a regional scale. The model is forced with daily surface runoff estimates for 2009 and 2010 across an similar to 8,000-km(2) region on the western margin. The overall subglacial drainage system morphology develops similarly in both years, with subglacial channel networks growing inland from the ice sheet margin and robust subglacial pathways forming over bedrock ridges. Modeled effective pressures are compared to contemporaneous regional surface speeds derived from TerraSAR-X imagery to investigate spatial relationships. Our results show an inverse spatial relationship between effective pressure and ice speed in the mid-melt season, when surface speeds are elevated, indicating that effective pressure is the dominant control on surface velocities in the mid-melt season. By contrast, in the early and late melt seasons, when surface speeds are slower, effective pressure and surface speed have a positive relationship. Our results suggest that outside of the mid-melt season, the influence of effective pressures on sliding speeds may be secondary to the influence of driving stress and spatially variable bed roughness.

Factors affecting recruitment dynamics of Great Lakes sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) populations	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Knowledge of stock-recruitment dynamics is as important for control of pest species such as the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) as it is for sustainable harvest management of exploited fish species. A better understanding of spatial and temporal variation in recruitment of pest populations may inform managers on where and when to effectively apply different control methods. Sea lamprey stock-recruitment data combined from streams across the Great Lakes basin into a Ricker stock-recruitment model indicated both compensation (density-dependent survival) and a large amount of density-independent recruitment variation. We evaluated the use of a mixed-effects model to look at common year effects and stream-level variables that could affect productivity and growing season length, with the objective of identifying factors that may explain this density-independent variation in recruitment. After selecting the "best model", we tested factors that might affect recruitment variation, using a Great Lakes dataset comprising 97 stream-years. Lake Superior tributaries, streams with larger numbers of lamprey competitors, and streams regularly requiring lampricide treatment showed significantly higher recruitment. Alkalinity and thermal regulation did not affect the observed recruitment pattern among streams. In four long-term study streams we observed significant variation among streams, tested as a fixed effect, but no evidence suggested a common pattern of variation among years. Differences in recruitment among streams were consistent with evidence of quality of spawning and larval habitat among streams. Our findings suggest that management models should account for differences in recruitment dynamics among sea lamprey-producing streams, but not common year effects. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Yulong, a remote site in southeastern Tibetan Plateau	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The unique geographic location of Mt. Yulong in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) makes it a favorable site for mercury (Hg) study. Various snow samples, such as surface snow, snow pit, and snowmelt water were collected from Mt. Yulong in the southeastern TP. The average concentration of Hg was found to be 37 +/- 26ngL(-1) (mean +/- SD), comparable to Hg concentration from other parts of TP in the same year, though it was comparatively higher than those from previous years, suggesting a possible increase of Hg concentration over the TP. The concentration of Hg was higher in the lower elevation of the glaciers possibly due to the surface melting concentration of particulates. Higher concentration of Hg was observed in the fresh snow, suggesting the possibility of long-range transportation. The average concentration of Hg from the snow pit was 1.49 +/- 0.78ngL(-1), and the concentration of Hg in the vertical profile of the snow pit co-varied with calcium ion (Ca2+) supporting the fact that the portion of Hg is from the crustal origin. In addition, the principal component analysis (PCA) confirmed that the source of Hg is from the crustal origin; however, the presence of anthropogenic source in the Mt. Yulong was also observed. In surface water around Mt. Yulong, the concentration of Hg-T was found in the order of Lashihai Lake > Reservoirs > Rivers > Swamps > Luguhu Lake. In lake water, the concentration of Hg-T showed an increasing trend with depth. Overall, the increased concentration of Hg in recent years from the TP can be of concern and may have an adverse impact on the downstream ecosystem, wildlife, and human health.					; Tripathee, Lekhendra/T-4350-2019; Sharma, Chhatra/A-6168-2009; Kang, Shichang/I-6830-2018; Niu, Hewen/AHC-3884-2022; junming, guo/JZC-7672-2024; Guo, Junming/JZC-7672-2024; Huang, Jie/GWQ-5005-2022	Tripathee, Lekhendra/0000-0001-6210-5105; Niu, Hewen/0000-0001-7804-217X; Kang, Shichang/0000-0003-2115-9005; Guo, Junming/0000-0002-3133-5597; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2019	26	16					16457	16469		10.1007/s11356-019-05005-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-05005-4								30980371					WOS:000468977800060

Simulated mechanical control of flowering rush (Butomus umbellatus) under mesocosm conditions	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												Flowering rush (Butomus umbellatus L.) is an invasive aquatic and wetland plant capable of developing monotypic stands in emergent and submersed sites. This plant can rapidly outcompete native vegetation and impede human practices by reducing recreation (boating, fishing, and skiing) and disrupting agricultural use of water resources (irrigation canals). Mechanical removal practices occurring biweekly, monthly, bimonthly, and once per growing season were compared with chemical control with diquat applied sequentially at 0.19 ppmv ai for two consecutive months over 2 yr (2016 and 2017). Biweekly removal gave the most consistent control of B. umbellatus biomass and propagules. Diquat application along with monthly and bimonthly clippings gave varying degrees of B. umbellatus control. Clipping once per growing season did not control B. umbellatus when compared with reference plants, while clipping B. umbellatus every 2 wk (biweekly) controlled rush propagules most effectively. However, it is unlikely this method will be sufficient as a stand-alone control option due to the slow speed of harvester boats, the potential these boats have to spread B. umbellatus propagules to more sites, and the expense of mechanical operations. However, clipping could be used as part of an integrated strategy for B. umbellatus control.																			1939-7291	1939-747X				JUN	2019	12	2					120	123		10.1017/inp.2019.6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/inp.2019.6													WOS:000482292900005

A lightning climatology of the South-West Indian Ocean	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) data have been used to perform a lightning climatology in the South-West Indian Ocean (SWIO) region from 2005 to 2011. Maxima of lightning activity were found in the Maritime Continent and southwest of Sri Lanka (> 50 fl km(-2) yr(-1)) but also over Madagascar and above the Great Lakes of East Africa (> 10-20 fl km(-2) yr(-1)). Lightning flashes within tropical storms and tropical cyclones represent 50% to 100% of the total lightning activity in some oceanic areas of the SWIO (between 10 degrees S and 20 degrees S). The SWIO is characterized by a wet season (November to April) and a dry season (May to October). As one could expect, lightning activity is more intense during the wet season as the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is present over all the basin. Flash density is higher over land in November December January with values reaching 3-4 fl km(-2) yr(-1) over Madagascar. During the dry season, lightning activity is quite rare between 10 degrees S and 25 degrees S. The Mascarene anticyclone has more influence on the SWIO resulting in shallower convection. Lightning activity is concentrated over ocean, east of South Africa and Madagascar. A statistical analysis has shown that El Nino-Southern Oscillation mainly modulates the lightning activity up to 56.8% in the SWIO. The Indian Ocean Dipole has a significant contribution since similar to 49% of the variability is explained by this forcing in some regions. The Madden-Julian Oscillation did not show significative impact on the lightning activity in our study.

On at least 8 occasions over the past century, hurricanes have driven petrels far inland (sometimes as far as the Great Lakes), suggesting the demise of 10s to 100s of individuals. This paper models >100 yr of data to characterize and compare key aspects of hurricanes that did and did not drive petrels inland. Our model suggests that the predicted increase in the frequency of Category 3 to 5 hurricanes in the region due to climate change could nearly double the expected number of wrecked petrels over the next century and place an endangered species at greater risk of extinction.

However, there is an increasing concern that increasing human activities around these lakes and their main inflows can result in increased contamination of these water bodies. Information on total concentrations of some trace elements is available for these lakes and their inflows; however, data on the trace element speciation is lacking. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the low molecular mass (LMM) trace element species and also, evaluate the influence of flooding episodes on the LMM trace element fractions. At-site size and charge fractionation system was used for sampling of water from the lakes Koka, Ziway and Awassa and their main inflows during the dry and wet seasons. The results showed that chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and lead (Pb) in Lake Koka and its inflows as well as in Lake Ziway were predominantly present as HMM ( high molecular mass, i.e., > 10 kDa) forms, while arsenic (As), selenium (Se), cadmium (Cd) were more mobile during the dry season. In Lake Awassa, all except Cr and Mn were predominantly found as LMM species (low molecular mass, i.e. < 10 kDa) which can be attributed to the high concentrations of LMM DOC (dissolved organic carbon). During the wet season, results from the Lake Koka and its inflows showed that all trace elements were predominantly associated with HMM forms such as colloids and particles, demonstrating that the mobility of elements was reduced during the wet season. The colloidal fraction of elements such as Cr, Ni, and Cd was also correlated with dissolved Fe. As the concentration of LMM trace element species are very low, the mobility, biological uptake and the potential environmental impact should be low. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Temporal and spatial variations of common aquatic bacterial genera were observed, but no clear seasonal variations could be depicted. The major bacterial genera identified from these two sites were members of the Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chlorobi, Chloroflexi, Verrucomicrobia, and Firmicutes. Among the proteobacterial groups, members of the alpha-, beta-, and gamma- Proteobacteria predominated. gamma- Proteobacteria belonging to the Escherichia coli/Shigella group even the diarrheagenic pathotypes of E. coli e.g., EPEC and ETEC were detected in most samples throughout the year, with no apparent correlations with other microbial groups. The other pathotypes, EHEC, EAEC, and EIEC/Shigella spp. were also detected occasionally.

Understanding Shallow Slope Failures on Expansive Soil Embankments in North Texas Using Unsaturated Soil Property Framework	PANAM UNSATURATED SOILS 2017: APPLICATIONS	Geotechnical Special Publication				2nd Pan-American Conference on Unsaturated Soils ((PanAm-UNSAT)	NOV 12-15, 2017	Dallas, TX	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Geo Inst, Int Soc Soil Mech & Geotechn Engn				Slopes constructed with expansive soils are prone to shallow slope failures when subjected to seasonal wetting-drying. This article presents a field experimental study and corresponding modeling analysis to understand slope failures at shallow depths, typically ranging from 1 to 5 ft (0.3-1.5 m) from the surface. Previous studies (Brand 1981; Cho et al. 2002; Chen et al. 2004) revealed that the major cause of shallow slope failures for earthen dams is due to the formation of surficial cracks due to rapid matric suction change occurring during cyclic wetting-drying from seasonal changes. The purpose of this study is to identify the influential factors such as soil matric suction on the stability of unsaturated soil slopes. In this study, soil from a test section at Joe Pool Lake dam, Texas is considered. Test soil was subjected to basic soil characterization and later studied for their engineering behavior. Unsaturated soil properties for Joe Pool Lake soil are obtained by evaluating the soil water characteristic curve (SWCC) using pressure cell and filter paper technique. Rainfall and temperature data collected at the site were utilized for modeling the unsaturated condition of the slope using VADOSE/W software. Results showed that consistent matric suction variation contributed to the reduction in the stability of the slopes. This analysis also provided valuable insight into the formation of fully softened zones at shallow depths due to the formation of desiccation cracks.

Comparison of seasonal distribution patterns of Discostella stelligera and Lindavia bodanica in a boreal lake during two years with differing ice-off timing	DIATOM RESEARCH												Widespread changes in the relative abundances of Cyclotella sensu lato taxa have occurred in lakes of the Northern Hemisphere over the last similar to 150 years, with these changes often attributed to climate-driven physical changes in lakes. While the links between Cyclotella ecology and lake thermal structure have been investigated extensively now, the role of the timing of ice-off in driving these diatom patterns remains unclear. We compared the seasonal distribution patterns of Cyclotella taxa in a boreal lake with high water transparency during two years with differing timing of ice-off. Vertical distributions of taxa in Jordan Pond (Maine, USA) were assessed every 5-24 days from early May to late October during an early ice-off year (19 March 2012) and a late ice-off year (29 April 2015). Seasonal succession patterns differed over the two years. During the early ice-off year, Lindavia bodanica cell densities were higher and peaked in the hypolimnion from July to October. The abundance of this taxon during the late ice-off year may have been negatively affected by fungal infection, which was visible with microscopic investigation. In contrast, Discostella stelligera cell densities were higher during the late ice-off year and peaked from May to August. This taxon was distributed uniformly in the water column throughout July, during phosphorus-limited conditions, and was then more abundant in the epilimnion during August, during nitrogen-limited conditions. Multiple linear regression models suggested that variation in D. stelligera cell densities was explained by year, number of days since ice-off and mixing depth (R-2 = 0.55), while variation in L. bodanica cell densities was explained by year, number of days since ice-off, total phosphorus, dissolved oxygen, and Secchi disk depth (R-2 = 0.16). Our results reveal variable seasonal distribution patterns of these two taxa over the two years and suggest that these patterns are the result of many drivers, some of which may be affected by ice-off timing.																			0269-249X	2159-8347					2018	33	1					1	11		10.1080/0269249X.2018.1464522	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0269249X.2018.1464522													WOS:000435674500001

Temperature exposure and possible thermoregulation strategies in the Titicaca water frog Telmatobius culeus, a fully aquatic frog of the High Andes	ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH												Temperature has an important effect on amphibians, influencing virtually all physio logical systems. Thermoregulation is used to manage unfavourable thermal conditions, but has been poorly studied in aquatic amphibians, and no information is available for adult aquatic anurans. We studied the temperatures to which the Critically Endangered and high Andean fully aquatic Titicaca water frog Telmatobius culeus is exposed and investigated possible thermoregulation strategies of the species in the wild. We measured water temperature in different seasons, microhabitats and depths at which T. culeus is most abundant. We established transects to obtain population densities and activity patterns of the species during the day. Seasonal and daily temperature variations as well as temperature variations among depths and microhabitats were noted. These variations were associated with densities of visible T. culeus, where adult densities were higher at depths with more stable temperatures. T. culeus behaviour associated with thermo regulation strategies in the aquatic habitat included depth selection and movement of individuals between different microhabitats. Selection of microhabitat depended on the temperature at a site and the hour of the day. These results indicate possible behavioural thermoregulation strategies such as movement to different sites or basking used by a highly specialized amphibian, and provide insights into how aquatic benthic organisms use strategies for thermoregulation in aquatic heterogeneous environments. These strategies are probably also used by other aquatic organisms from the tropical Andes. Knowledge of how these organisms respond to temperature could also help to understand the impact of global warming on their status.

Plant-fungal symbiosis affects litter decomposition during primary succession	OIKOS												Microbial symbionts of plants can affect decomposition by altering the quality or quantity of host plant tissue (substrate) or the micro-environment where decomposition occurs (conditioning). In C-3 grasses, foliar fungal endophytes (Clavicipitaceae) can increase plant resistance to drought and/or produce alkaloids that reduce herbivory - effects that may also influence host litter composition and subsequent litter decomposition. We studied the effect of the endophyte Epichloe sp. on litter decomposition in the Great Lakes dunes (USA) using a reciprocal design altering endophyte presence/absence in both American beachgrass Ammophila breviligulata substrate (litter bags) and its conditioning of the decomposition microenvironment. Symbiont treatments were crossed with rain-out shelters that altered growing season precipitation. The first year of decomposition, senesced leaf substrate from A. breviligulata with Epichloe decomposed 21% faster than endophyte-free substrate. By the third year, conditioning by live symbiotic plants reduced cumulative decomposition by 33% compared to plots planted with endophyte-free plants. Of the traits we examined - litter quantity, C:N ratio, mineral composition, fungal colonization, and carbon chemistry - increased litter quantity via greater tiller production was the primary trait shift associated with endophyte symbiosis. Epichloe in A. breviligulata litter also altered litter nitrogen decomposition dynamics, as evidenced by lower nitrogen and protein content in decomposed tissue from plants that hosted the endophyte. Differences in initial litter quality and subsequent colonization by saprotrophic fungi were ruled out as key drivers. Altered precipitation had negligible effects on decomposing processes in the dunes. Grass-Epichloe symbiosis altered nutrient cycling through increasing the rate of litter decomposition when present in the litter and through reducing litter decomposition by conditioning the decomposition microenvironment. Epichloe are widespread symbionts of grasses. Thus, their effects on decomposition could be an important, but often overlooked, driver of nutrient cycling in grass-dominated ecosystems.					; Emery, Sarah/AFR-1495-2022; Bell-Dereske, Lukas/AEP-1692-2022; Masiello, Caroline/A-2653-2011; Gao, Xiaodong/C-5291-2012	Bell-Dereske, Lukas/0000-0001-9951-2222; Emery, Sarah/0000-0003-2496-6152; 													0030-1299	1600-0706				JUN	2017	126	6					801	811		10.1111/oik.03648	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.03648													WOS:000402820600005

Here, we test how basal carbon sources fueling the benthic food web responded to two millennia of environmental changes. Sedimentary organic matter characteristics were strongly variable over time, and were mainly influenced by human activities within the watershed basin. During the pre-eutrophication phase, subfossil chironomid C-13 (C-13(HC)) values were lower than those of sedimentary organic matter. These results suggested that chironomid larvae preferentially fed on the autochthonous part of the total sedimentary organic matter. During the modern period, higher accumulation rates of organic matter and a decrease in C/N ratio suggested a steep rise in aquatic productivity for both lakes. As suggested by the synchronous increase in organic matter C-13 values, this higher productivity and the subsequent increase in dissolved CO2 uptake may have induced either a marked increase in atmospheric CO2 uptake by phytoplankton or a reduction in the phytoplankton trophic fractionation. These changes led to overlaps in terrestrial and aquatic carbon stable-isotopic baselines, hampering the reliable reconstruction of the chironomid palaeo-diet. These results seem to indicate the minor role of allochthony to sustain aquatic food webs of large and soft-water lakes, and underscore the necessity to apply an independent compound-specific stable-isotope analysis to better estimate the temporal changes in isotopic baseline and, thus, strengthen the reliability of the chironomid palaeo-diet reconstructions.					; Millet, Laurent/F-8730-2014	Millet, Laurent/0000-0003-2050-206X; BELLE, Simon/0000-0002-3786-5011													0046-5070	1365-2427				JUN	2017	62	6					1105	1115		10.1111/fwb.12931	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12931													WOS:000400571200013

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of human-induced disturbance on bird species richness and abundance of natural wetlands in southwest Ethiopia. Bird surveys were performed at 56 locations during both the wet and dry seasons in 2010 and 2011. Generalized linear modeling (G) was used to correlate species richness with environmental variables. It was found that wetlands with low human disturbance were characterized by a higher richness (n > 10) of wetland dependent specialist birds (depending completely on wetlands for food and nesting) than the highly disturbed wetlands. However, for wetland-associated birds (those able to nest and feed in wetlands as well as in other habitats), there was no significant difference (P = 0.31) in species richness between disturbed and non-disturbed wetlands. The abundance of wetland dependent specialist birds was significantly affected (P < 0.001) by human disturbance, whereas the abundance of wetland associated birds was not (P = 0.39). Fifty-three percent of the variation in species richness of wetland dependent birds was explained by a combination of water depth, sludge depth, conductivity, chlorophyll a, total phosphorus, human disturbance and vegetation cover. It is recommended that anthropogenic activities should be minimized and controlled in and around these wetlands to conserve biodiversity.					; Goethals, Peter/A-1116-2008; Boets, Pieter/KEJ-0594-2024; Mereta, Seid Tiku/HIA-0661-2022	Lens, Luc/0000-0002-0241-2215; Mereta, Seid Tiku/0000-0001-8036-4995													1524-4695	1938-5390				JUN	2017	40	2					129	143		10.1675/063.040.0205	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/063.040.0205													WOS:000403128000004

Traditionally it has been assumed that their hydrology is determined by precipitation and evaporation, and that they are isolated from the adjacent river network. Recent studies, however, have shown that ponds contribute to river runoff for at least part of the year. Their existence is therefore additionally based on fluvial and underground water sources. In order to establish the principles of water circulation in typical ponds, we selected 14 ponds with seasonally intermittent streams. We measured water levels in these ponds and flows in the river segments that connect them. We also determined subsurface exchange fluxes from the water balance equation. Our results demonstrated that the hydrological functions of the ponds varied throughout the year and depended on the level of water storage in the pond's catchment. When the level of retention in the pond's catchment is low, the pond becomes a water body without surface outflow and a drainage base for groundwater. As the level of retention in the catchment rises, ponds develop surface outflows and reconnect with the river network. At this point, their main function becomes retention of water originating from subsurface and surface inflows. Any surplus water may be fed to underground or surface waters.

We conducted field monitoring in Isahaya Bay to clarify the short-term dynamics of MCs discharged from a reservoir following a cyanobacteria bloom in the warm season. MCs were detected in the seawater of the bay (max. 0.10 mu g L-1), and were deposited on the sea floor, with the MC content of the surface sediment increasing by approximately five times (0.11 +/- 0.077-0.53 +/- 0.15 mu g kgww(-1), mean SD) at the four stations near the reservoir drainage gate before and after the discharge. The MCs was then transported from the mouth of the bay by tidal currents during the period of the study. Therefore, the MCs were moved away from the closed water area where the cyanobacteria blooms, and spread throughout the coastal area. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

There was a good agreement between LC-MS and HPLC-UV determinations. Average recoveries of spiked fish samples were 63% for MC-RR and 71% for MC-LR. The highest MC contents in intestine, liver, kidney and spleen were 85.67, 2.83, 1.70 and 1.57 mu g g(-1) DW, respectively. MCs were much higher in mid-gut walls (1.22 mu g g(-1) DW) than in hind- and fore-gut walls (0.31 and 0.18 mu g g(-1) DW, respectively), suggesting the importance of mid-gut wall as major site for MC absorption. A cysteine conjugate of MC-LR was detected frequently in kidney. Among the muscle samples analyzed, 25% were above the provisional tolerable daily intake level by WHO. Bighead is strongly resistant to microcystins and can be used as biomanipulation fish to counteract cyanotoxin contamination in eutrophic waters. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Human activities are the direct cause of changes in the water quality of rivers entering lakes, and land use intensity is the direct manifestation of human activities on the land surface. Although significant progress has been made in studying the relationship between land use changes and water quality in lakes, there is still a lack of research on exploring the relationship between land use intensity and water quality at multiple scales, especially in comparative studies of different pollution source areas. To address this problem, this study used Pearson's correlation analysis and land use intensity index method to explore the response relationship between river water quality and land use intensity at different spatial and temporal scales and different pollution source areas using three lakes in central Yunnan as examples. The results showed that land use intensity was generally positively correlated with water quality, but the response relationship between land use intensity and different water quality indicators was significantly different at different scales and for different pollution source areas. Compared to non-urban areas, the impact of land use intensity on water quality is more significant in urban areas. Compared to the rainy season, the correlation between CODNa, TP, and NH3-N values and land use intensity is stronger during the dry season, while the correlation between COD, TN, and land use intensity is weaker during the dry season. When viewed at different scales, different water quality indicators have different scale effects, but overall, the larger the scale, the stronger the correlation. Therefore, in the work of lake water environmental governance, it is necessary to consider comprehensively from multiple scales and perspectives and adopt measures that are more suitable for regional water pollution prevention and control.

The spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of the water pollutants were comprehensively identified by the water pollution index method (WPI), Mann-Kendall trend test, cluster analysis and box-plot analysis method, and the effects of the pollution source, runoff and sluice regulation were analyzed for water pollutants. The results indicated that the water quality standard of classes mainly belonged to class IV or above in Shayinghe River Basin, accounting for about 70%, but the water quality standard reached class I and class II for less than 15%. The water pollutants presented a significant decreasing trend, and the NH3-N and TP were the key control indexes for the monitoring stations in the Shayinghe River Basin. The exceeding rates of WPI values showed a significantly decreasing trend at Baidukou, Mawan, Huangqiao, Zhoukou Sluice, Jieshou, Fuyang Sluice and Yingshang Sluice by controlling the NH3-N and TP. The WPI values showed obvious variations in January 2011, March 2013 and October 2014 at the Baisha Reservoir, Mawan and Chengwan. The WPI values were divided into two major categories with respect to time. The non-flood season should be used as the key period for water quality management and control; the variability of WPI values was relatively large from January to June, November, and December, and the variability of WPI values was relatively low from July to October. The monitoring sections were spatially divided into three major categories.

The study results could provide the scientific basis for realizing targeted pollution source treatment, improving the effectiveness of water quality management and ecological environment, and a theoretical foundation for pollution control and water quality improvement in the Shayinghe River Basin.						li, ping/0000-0001-8322-2327													1535-1459	1535-1467				OCT	2021	37	8			SI		1089	1103		10.1002/rra.3623	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.3623		APR 2020											WOS:000524315200001
J	Mueller, RG; Joyce, AA; Borejsza, A				Mueller, Raymond G.; Joyce, Arthur A.; Borejsza, Aleksander			Alluvial archives of the Nochixtlan valley, Oaxaca, Mexico: Age and significance for reconstructions of environmental change	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												A reconnaissance of the Nochixtlan valley confirms that thick alluvial deposits of the late Quaternary are both well preserved and well exposed along the heavily incised modern streams. Their geometry and age were ascertained by logging representative cutbank exposures and radiocarbon dating buried palaeosols. The last four cut-and-fill cycles recorded cover the period since 14,000 BP, but older alluvial insets are also present. Contrary to previous reconstructions, the streams have had an arroyo-type morphology throughout the late Quaternary. The climatic oscillations at the transition from the Pleistocene to the Holocene seem to be expressed in the alternating formation of clayey organic-rich cumulic A horizons, and the precipitation of secondary carbonates. Rapid though intermittent aggradation set in after 10,300 BP in response to the establishment of a rather dry, warm and strongly seasonal climate and of open canopy forest or scrub on slopes. The unstable arroyo floodplains offered a favorable niche for the establishment of secondary vegetation and foragers exploiting annual and heliophilous plants. After 4000 BP sedentary farmers cleared the valley of its natural vegetation increasing sediment transfers and the frequency of local cut-and-fill cycles. They modified streams intentionally by building long flights of cross-channel agricultural terraces known as lama-bordos, the remains of which are preserved in many cutbanks. The oldest specimen dated goes back to ca. 3000 BP. A remarkably synchronous incision swept through the fluvial system close to 800 BP, possibly as a result of a marked climatic shift or valley-wide changes in land use. The widespread gullying of the latest pre-Conquest settlements and fields suggests the introduction of grazing or the collapse of hillside terraces as cause, but coeval alluvial fills have not yet been positively identified.

In contrast to previous metrics, this index is not built on selected 'indicative' taxa, but uses all available taxonomic information at genus and species level. Taxa optima with respect to lake trophic status (derived from total phosphorus concentrations) are used to calculate a phytoplankton trophic index (TI) for each sample. Analysis of the TI shows that phytoplankton communities exhibit highly non-linear responses to eutrophication in Norwegian lakes. Reference lakes are characterized by very similar TIs despite having considerable variation in total phosphorus and chlorophyll a concentrations. TI exhibits a non-linear distribution along the eutrophication gradient which separates unimpacted from impacted sites in the study area. We further show that TI exhibits smaller seasonal variations than chlorophyll a, making it a more reliable indicator for lake monitoring. Implications for its applicability within the WFD are discussed.

J	Qu, SH; Zhou, JX				Qu, Senhu; Zhou, Junxiao			Phytoplankton community structure and water quality assessment in Xuanwu Lake, China	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Phytoplankton community structure influences the water quality of freshwater lakes and attracts the attention worldwide. The physicochemical parameters including dissolved oxygen (DO), total nitrogen, total phosphorus, NH4+-N and CODMn and biological index such as Chl.a concentrations were measured in water of different sites of Xuanwu Lake, China in varied seasons. The Trophic level index (TLI) was calculated to evaluate the trophic status of the lake based on critical water quality parameters. The phytoplankton community structure and biomass in the water was also identified and detected. Obvious change of physicochemical parameters and biological index was detected in varied sampling time. The results showed that TN, TP, NH4+-N, CODMn and Chl.a had higher concentrations in June and August with higher temperature. Obtained Trophic level index values from key water quality indicators revealed that Xuanwu Lake exhibited a state of mesotrophic level in December 2021, mild eutrophic level in October and February, and remained in a state of moderate eutrophication during other periods having higher temperature. Chlorophyta exhibited the highest species diversity and accounted for 48.1% of the entire community. Cyanobacteria had higher density compared to other phytoplankton, which suggesting the potential ecological risk in the lake. These findings aligned with the outcomes of the analysis of the phytoplankton community structure, underscoring a certain degree of correlation between the primary water quality indicators and phytoplankton abundance in Xuanwu Lake. That is, higher discharge of contaminant including nutrients potentially dominated the phytoplankton community structure. The continuous monitoring of phytoplankton community and water quality enabled the assessment of its trophic status of urban lake. Appropriate measures such as adjustment of phytoplankton community structure were proposed to mitigate the eutrophication status of lake. The investigation indicated that phytoplankton variation was the important indicator of water quality and supplied direct evidence for the water quality management and ecosystem restoration of urban lakes.

Alpine mountain basins on the QTP are mainly water supply areas. This paper studied hydrological linking of precipitation, river and groundwater in an alpine mountain river basin of northeastern (NE) QTP in warm seasons based on the 3-year and high-density sampling data of stable water isotope (delta H-2, delta O-18). Results showed that the isotopic (delta H-2 and delta O-18) values in precipitation in the warm seasons from 2018 to 2020 ranged from - 82.99 to - 8.07 parts per thousand, from - 13.02 to - 3.48 parts per thousand, with the average of - 37.97 +/- 1.85 parts per thousand and - 7.13 +/- 0.21 parts per thousand, respectively. The isotopic values in river water varied from - 67.15 to - 31.21 parts per thousand for delta H-2 and from - 10.27 to - 5.07 parts per thousand for delta O-18, with the average of - 45.29 +/- 0.27 parts per thousand and - 7.6 +/- 0.04 parts per thousand, respectively. The delta H-2 (delta O-18) values of groundwater varied from - 55.44 (- 9.31 parts per thousand) to - 33.86 parts per thousand, (5.76 parts per thousand), with the mean of - 42.06 +/- 0.29 parts per thousand (- 6.95 +/- 0.05 parts per thousand). Spatially, river water delta O-18 and line-conditioned excess (lc-excess) values exhibited a decreasing trend from the river source to the lower estuary region, d-excess values were adverse; groundwater delta O-18, d-excess and lc-excess values did not show remarkable variations. The local meteoric water line (LMWL) in the three-year studying warm seasons was delta H-2 = (8.79 +/- 0.2) delta O-18+ (24.72 +/- 1.46), R-adj(2) = 0.95, p < 0.0001, n = 102. The river water line (RWL) was delta H-2 = (5.54 +/- 0.13) delta O-18+ (- 3.21 +/- 0.98), R-adj(2) = 0.84, p < 0.0001, n = 360. The groundwater lines (GWL) was delta H-2 = (5.72 +/- 0.18) delta O-18+ (- 2.28 +/- 1.26), R-adj(2) = 0.82, p < 0.0001. Both RWL and GWL were located on the right side of the LMWL, and the RWL and GWL were close to each other in the warm seasons of three studying years. Those results indicated precipitation commonly replenished river water and groundwater, and river water was more closely connected with groundwater in the alpine mountain basin, NE Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in warm seasons. We should strengthen the protection of water sources to maximize function of water conservation, as well as maintain nature channels between river water and groundwater in the alpine mountain river basin on the QTP.

J	Ferone, JM; Devito, KJ				Ferone, JM; Devito, KJ			Shallow groundwater-surface water interactions in pond-peatland complexes along a Boreal Plains topographic gradient	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Shallow pond-peatland complexes are important water resources and waterbird habitat on the Boreal Plains of Canada, and are potentially threatened by accelerated resource development. We examined two shallow pond-peatland complexes located in contrasting topographic positions within a clay-rich till region: one on a moraine and one on a lowland clay plain, to evaluate the influence of landscape position on wetland groundwater- surface water interactions, hydrologic function, and potential response to disturbance. Hydrometric and geochemical measurements indicated that precipitation and evaporation dominated the annual water balance of both ponds. Forested mineral uplands adjacent to the pond-peatland complexes contributed no runoff inputs. Small recharge rates (< 5 mm year (-1)) from the ponds through low-permeable clay to the underlying aquifer were measured at both topographic locations. Shallow groundwater fluxes to/from the pond were controlled by water storage in and exchange with the adjacent riparian peatlands. Shallow groundwater fluxes may have contributed as much as 23% of inputs and outputs. and influenced pond chemistry and permanence. Shallow groundwater exchange between the pond and adjacent peatlands varied seasonally and differed between the moraine and lowland complex. Groundwater flow reversals occurred around the entire perimeter of the moraine pond; recharge from the moraine pond to the peatland during dry periods was off-set by discharge to the pond from the peatland during wet periods. In contrast, shallow groundwater 'flow-through' conditions were observed at the lowland pond for most of the study; however, during a high-rainfall event, a groundwater flow reversal within the outflow peatland initiated discharge back into the pond. These results suggest that the hydrologic regimes of some pond-peatland complexes in clay-rich till within the Boreal Plains will be more sensitive to local-scale disturbances that impact flow dynamics and storage of near-shore peatlands, rather than larger-scale disturbances of mineral upland regions.

Eutrophication, agriculture and water level control shift aquatic plant communities from floating-leaved to submerged macrophytes in Lake Chini, Malaysia	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												In this study we: (1) present a quantitative spatial analysis of the macrophyte communities in Lake Chini with a focus on the biogeographical distributions of the native Nelumbo nucifera and the invasive Cabomba furcata; (2) examine the environmental changes that affect plant community composition; and (3) outline a conceptual model of the variation of ecological processes that shape the macrophyte communities. Plant species cover, biomass of C. furcata and N. nucifera, and water quality and environmental variables were measured before and after monsoonal floods in September 2009 and April 2010. Permutational multivariate analysis was used to examine the significance of the invasion of C. furcata at different spatial scales. Relationships between plant species cover and environmental variables before and after flooding were examined using principal coordinates analysis and non-parametric multivariate multiple regressions. Our findings suggest that (1) Variation in plant communities was significant at the lake scale and the distribution of plant species changed after annual floods. (2) Invasion by C. furcata significantly affected the overall plant community composition. (3) C. furcata biomass increased after the monsoonal season, which indicates that C. furcata is adapted to flooding events and that it is becoming increasingly abundant. (4) In addition to the strong monsoonal effect, total depth, nutrient concentration, and sediment type were important environmental variables that significantly affected plant community composition. The macrophyte community in Lake Chini is highly dynamic. The spatial and temporal plant community dynamics are associated with flood regime, water quality, and substrate. Human-induced changes in these parameters are likely shifting the macrophyte dominance from floating-leaved to submerged species.

In this study, we performed comprehensive research on turbulent exchanges of a shallow, large but highly fetch limited lake employing 5 months of simultaneous eddy-covariance (EC), wave, energy, and water budget measurements. Based on the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory, wind and wave age-related drag coefficients and roughness lengths were derived for very young wave ages. The new drag functions showed an increased water surface resistance compared to marine conditions. In terms of water vapor roughness length and transfer coefficients, an apparent intra-seasonal variation was observed. Turbulent heat fluxes were evaluated by closing the lake's energy budget using the Bowen ratio method. Furthermore, we aimed to close the energy budget by assuring the water balance closure as well through the evaporation (latent heat flux), resulting in significant deviations from the EC-based results. EC-based heat fluxes and transfer coefficients were found to be underestimated on average by 29% and 33%, respectively. The water balance closure suggested that the energy residual should not be distributed based on the Bowen ratio, and sensible heat fluxes were more underestimated than latent heat fluxes. In the case of Lake Balaton, atmospheric stability plays a minor role; however, our analysis revealed significant effects caused by the surrounding topography and water side stratification.

Klein			The health status of European silver eels, Anguilla anguilla, in the Dutch River Rhine Watershed and Lake IJsselmeer	AQUACULTURE												The worldwide decline of the eel population is thought to be caused by several factors, among which eel diseases. To investigate diseases of European silver eels Anguilla anguilla in the Netherlands, in Nov-Dec 2004 12 silver eels, and in Aug-Dec 2005 80 eels were caught in downstream parts (rivers) of the River Rhine and in Lake IJsselmeer. The eels were measured and weighed, necrotized, and individually checked for presence of external and internal parasites, bacterial infections and viruses, and blood smears were made for haematology. This is the first multidisciplinary study of the health of Dutch silver eels. In the small (2 x 6 eels) pilot study of 2004 in the River Rhine and Lake IJsselmeer respectively, most eels showed aspecific fin haemorrhages, some had ectoparasites, nearly none had parasites in the intestine, half of the groups had Anguillicola crassus in their swimbladder, only few had Trypanosoma's in their blood, and no primary virus or bacterial infections were found, although one eel from Lake IJsselmeer was positive for anguillid herpesvirus 1 (AngHV-1, former Herpesvirus anguillae, HVA) in the PCR test only. The blood of all 6 and 2/6 of the eels respectively was considered abnormal, and the eels had a proper condition. In 2005, in 50 eels from the River Rhine and 30 from Lake IJsselmeer respectively, again aspecific fin haemorrhages were often seen, some of the eels had ectoparasites and parasites in the intestine, most eels had A crassus in their swimbladder, 32% and 53% had Trypanosoma's in their blood, from 44% and 13% of the eels AngHV-1 was isolated, and 44% and 27% were tested positive by PCR, with a peak in August, 10% of both groups of eels had an internal bacterial infection, mostly due to Aeromonas spp. The blood of about half of the eels was considered abnormal, but the eels had a proper condition. It was concluded, that the silver eels of this study had a proper Fulton condition factor (values 2.00-2.26), with aspecific fin haemorrhages, often were Trypanosoma-, A. crassus- and AngHV-1-infected, dependent on the season, and often showed an abnormal haematology. A. crassus causes injuries and is a chronic stress factor, more than the other parasites, which were mostly found less prevalent. In fact, lymphocytosis was directly related to A. crassus infection. Stress and injuries by A. crassus might induce disease through the presence of virus (AngHV-1), relevant in the health status of the silver eels during their spawning migration if ambient water temperatures would enhance a clinical infection of AngHV-1 disease. Moreover this virus might potentially decrease the survival of the silver eels by itself, because spawning migration to the Sargasso Sea takes wild eels to temperate/tropical areas in which the clinical infection by AngHV-1 is surely enhanced.

Palaeoecological evidence of Holocene climate variations in this region is presently limited. Here, we present a lake sediment record spanning approximately the last 670 years from Eilandvlei, a brackish coastal lake situated mid-way between Cape Town and Port Elizabeth. The results from geochemical and sedimentological analyses point to an increase in minerogenic sediment input from the catchment starting around ad1400. Changes in the seasonal distribution of rainfall during the Little Ice Age may have altered river discharge and increased erosion rates and fluvial sediment transport in pre-colonial times. A rising mean lake level, possibly associated with an altered water balance or relative sea-level rise, may offer an explanation for the deposition of finer sediments. After ad1450, reduced burial flux of elements associated with autochthonous sediment formation may have resulted from ecological changes in Eilandvlei. Enhanced sedimentation rates, increasing carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous and biogenic silica concentrations, as well as high concentrations of proxies for allochthonous sediment input (e.g. aluminium, titanium, zirconium) point to increasing sediment and nutrient flux into Eilandvlei from the late nineteenth century onwards. The most likely factor involved in these recent changes is land-use change and other forms of human impact.

J	Evans, ML; Chapman, LJ; Mitrofanov, I; Bernatchez, L				Evans, Melissa L.; Chapman, Lauren J.; Mitrofanov, Igor; Bernatchez, Louis			Variable extent of parallelism in respiratory, circulatory, and neurological traits across lake whitefish species pairs	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Parallel adaptive radiation events provide a powerful framework for investigations of ecology's contribution to phenotypic diversification. Ecologically driven divergence has been invoked to explain the repeated evolution of sympatric dwarf and normal lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) species in multiple lakes in eastern North America. Nevertheless, links between most putatively adaptive traits and ecological variation remain poorly defined within and among whitefish species pairs. Here, we examine four species pairs for variation in gill, heart, and brain size; three traits predicted to show strong phenotypic responses to ecological divergence. In each of the species pairs, normals exhibited larger body size standardized gills compared to dwarfs a pattern that is suggestive of a common ecological driver of gill size divergence. Within lakes, the seasonal hypoxia experienced in the benthic environment is a likely factor leading to the requirement for larger gills in normals. Interestingly, the morphological pathways used to achieve larger gills varied between species pairs from Quebec and Maine, which may imply subtle non-parallelism in gill size divergence related to differences in genetic background. There was also a non-significant trend toward larger hearts in dwarfs, the more active species of the two, whereas brain size varied exclusively among the lake populations. Taken together, our results suggest that the diversification of whitefish has been driven by parallel and non-parallel ecological conditions across lakes. Furthermore, the phenotypic response to ecological variation may depend on genetic background of each population.

The fates of Snowy Plover nests (n = 589) were determined from five locations at the Great Salt Lake in Utah during the 2003, 2005-2010 and 2012 breeding seasons. A five-stage hierarchical modeling procedure was used, and five competing models (Delta AIC(c) < 2) that best described variation in nest survival were identified. These competing models included the influences of study site and year with a quadratic time trend and covariates quantifying nest age, temperature, precipitation, distance to water control structures (dikes), and nesting substrate (barren mudflat, vegetation patches, or conspicuous objects). Among unsuccessful nests (45.6%; n = 277), the most common cause of failure was predation (72.9%), followed by weather and abandonment (10.5% and 10.1%, respectively). Daily nest survival rates ranged from 0.89 to 0.97 and varied annually and across sites. Nests located on barren flats had lower daily nest survival than those located in vegetated patches or near conspicuous objects. Proximity to dikes influenced nest survival as nests within 100 m had lower daily survival rates than nests further than 100 m from dikes. The population of Snowy Plovers on the Great Salt Lake contributes substantially to an overall imperiled North American population. Managers should consider measures to reduce the attractiveness of dikes as nesting habitat to increase nest survival rates for Snowy Plover.

Alayne; Verschuren, Dirk; Hu, Feng Sheng			A late-Quaternary perspective on atmospheric pCO2, climate, and fire as drivers of C4-grass abundance	ECOLOGY												Various environmental factors, including atmospheric CO2 (pCO(2)), regional climate, and fire, have been invoked as primary drivers of long-term variation in C-4 grass abundance. Evaluating these hypotheses has been difficult because available paleorecords often lack information on past C-4 grass abundance or potential environmental drivers. We analyzed carbon isotope ratios (C-13) of individual grains of grass pollen in the sediments of two East African lakes to infer changes in the relative abundance of C-3 vs. C-4 grasses during the past 25000 years. Results were compared with concurrent changes in pCO(2), temperature, moisture balance, and fire activity. Our grass-pollen C-13 analysis reveals a dynamic history of grass-dominated vegetation in equatorial East Africa: C-4 grasses have not consistently dominated lowland areas, and high-elevation grasses have not always been predominantly C-3. On millennial timescales, C-4 grass abundance does not correlate with charcoal influx at either site, suggesting that fire was not a major proximate control of the competitive balance between C-3 and C-4 grasses. Above the present-day treeline on Mt. Kenya, C-4 grass abundance declined from an average of 90% during the glacial period to less than 60% throughout the Holocene, coincident with increases in pCO(2) and temperature, and shifts in moisture balance. In the lowland savanna southeast of Mt. Kilimanjaro, C-4 grass abundance showed no such directional trend, but fluctuated markedly in association with variation in rainfall amount and seasonal-drought severity. These results underscore spatiotemporal variability in the relative influence of pCO(2) and climate on the interplay of C-3 and C-4 grasses and shed light on an emerging conceptual model regarding the expansion of C-4-dominated grasslands in Earth's history. They also suggest that future changes in the C-3/C-4 composition of grass-dominated ecosystems will likely exhibit striking spatiotemporal variability as a result of varying combinations of environmental controls.

J	Tziritis, EP				Tziritis, Evangelos P.			Environmental monitoring of Micro Prespa Lake basin (Western Macedonia, Greece): hydrogeochemical characteristics of water resources and quality trends	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The Micro Prespa basin is a trilateral catchment area of significant importance with a unique ecosystem closely related to the homonymous lake. In this frame, a fully operational monitoring project was carried out including continuous real-time measurements in Micro Prespa Lake with the use of a multi-sensor probe, as well as periodical sampling and analyses of all available water systems for an extended set of 85 parameters. Four main interacting water systems were identified, including alluvial and karstic aquifers, Micro Prespa Lake and adjacent drainage network. The results outlined that general environmental conditions are satisfying in respect to the relative legislation and the hydrogeochemical signatures. However, trends of environmental pressures were ascertained as a result of natural (geogenic) factors, embracing seasonal peaks for Ni, Pb, and NH4 mainly in groundwater systems. Based on chlorophyll a records, Micro Prespa is classified as oligotrophic to slightly mesotrophic, subjected to seasonal variations. Heavy metal concentrations are low, except Ni which appears to have elevated values during the dry hydrological period. Finally, the hydrogeochemistry of drainage network is primarily influenced by surface runoff of the surrounding mountainous areas, hence elevated phosphorus values of the Aghios Germanos stream are possibly linked with the leaching of the granitic formations on the east.

J	Erickson, BE; Helz, GR				Erickson, BE; Helz, GR			Molybdenum(VI) speciation in sulfidic waters: Stability and lability of thiomolybdates	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Molybdenum in sedimentary rocks and sediments has evoked interest as a paleo-environmental indicator of reducing conditions. This application demands better understanding of Mo deposition mechanisms and in turn, requires improved knowledge of Mo speciation in anaerobic natural waters. In sulfidic solution, molybdate undergoes sulfidation in four steps that conserve Mo-VI and lead to tetrathiomolybdate: MoOxS4-x2- + H2S(aq) reversible arrow MoOx-1S5-x2- + H2O(l), 1 less than or equal to x less than or equal to 4. Equilibrium constants (K(4-x)(5-x)) and rate constants (k((4-x)(5-x))) have been measured by UV-visible spectroscopy. At 25 degrees C, I = 0.8-2.2 M, log K-01 = 5.19 +/- 0.03, log K-12 = 4.80 +/- 0.12, log K-23 = 5.00 +/- 0.13, log K-34 = 4.88 +/- 0.28. The monothio to trithio-intermediates have negligible stability fields. If H2S(aq) increases slowly enough to maintain near-equilibrium conditions, a sharp switch will occur from MoO42- to MoS42- at similar to 11 mu M H2S(aq) (298 K, 1 atm). Sulfide actuation of the switch depends on a(H2S)(4), so a similar to 3-fold change in a(H2S) produces a similar to 100-fold change in MoO42-/MoS42-. Conversion of the predominant anion from a hard to a soft base alters Mo's geochemical behavior, increasing its susceptibility to scavenging. Because each successive sulfidation reaction is similar to 1 order of magnitude slower than the previous one, dithio- reversible arrow trithio- and trithio- reversible arrow tetrathiomolybdate equilibria might not be achieved in seasonally or intermittently sulfidic waters. In such environments, unstable mixtures of intermediate thiomolybdates can predominate, contradicting thermodynamic predictions. The sulfidation reactions are acid catalyzed. Anoxic sediment porewaters, which are enriched relative to overlying waters in Bronsted acids, will promote conversion of molybdate to thiomolybdates. This may account for observations that Mo deposition in euxinic environments occurs often by diagenetic pathways rather than by water column scavenging. Slow hydrolysis and oxidation of MoS42- suggests that it could serve as a reservoir of fixed, but acid-labile sulfide in oxic waters. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Lu, LC; Sun, HL				Lu, Lichen; Sun, Huiling			Dynamic monitoring of surface water areas of nine plateau lakes in Yunnan Province using long time-series Landsat imagery based on the Google Earth Engine platform	GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL												Lakes are sensitive to both climate change and human activities, especially in the Yungui Plateau zone. As the main supply of water sources, surface water has a significant impact on environment, ecological balance and socioeconomic development. However, it is unclear how the surface water areas (SWAs) of the nine Yunnan Plateau lakes (NYPLs) have changed over previous decades. In this study, the SWAs of the NYPLs were first extracted using the optimal water index (WI) based on Landsat remote sensing images and the Google Earth Engine (GEE). Then, a spatiotemporal variation analysis of the SWAs was carried out for the NYPLs from 1988 to 2021. Finally, the correlations between the SWA changes in each lake, climatic factors and human activities were analysed. We found that the total SWAs of the NYPL have remained stable over the past 30 years, reaching a maximum of 1,012.51 km(2) in 2000 and a minimum of 972.94 km(2) in 2015. From 1988 to 2015, the overall SWAs of the NYPLs fluctuated steadily within 1%. However, Lakes Qilu and Yilong shrunk significantly in 2015. Generally, the SWAs of the NYPLs during the rainy season were larger than during the dry season; however, there were some differences between each period. The seasonal change in the SWAs was approximately 10 km(2) in 1991, 1994, and 2003, but was relatively less in other years. Precipitation was a direct factor, whereas temperature and evaporation were indirect factors influencing the intra- and inter-annual SWAs of the NYPLs. The changes in the SWAs of the NYPLs were consistent with the precipitation trend and were negatively correlated with changes in temperature and evaporation. Evaporation had more of an influence on shallow lakes than on deep-water lakes. Human activities led to significant changes in individual lakes (such as lakes Dianchi, Yilong, and Qilu). The NYPLs had a spatially heterogeneous response to regional climate change caused by both global climate change and human activities. The results of this study can provide a data reference and decision support for the scientific management of the ecological environment of the Yunnan Plateau lakes.																			1010-6049	1752-0762				DEC 31	2023	38	1							2253196	10.1080/10106049.2023.2253196	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2023.2253196													WOS:001058794900001
J	Yoshikawa, K; Schorghofer, N; Klasner, F				Yoshikawa, Kenji; Schorghofer, Norbert; Klasner, Fritz			Permafrost and seasonal frost thermal dynamics over fifty years on tropical Maunakea volcano, Hawai'i	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												A unique permafrost thermal state was examined at Maunakea, HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai. The presence of the permafrost was determined in 1969. Mean annual ground surface temperature (MAGST) is significantly above zero at permafrost sites, between +2 degrees C and +5 degrees C. This indicates that subsurface thermal processes control and preserve the permafrost state (strong thermal resistance). Year-round high-resolution (1-cm intervals) active layer temperature monitoring reveals the thermal dynamics. Unlike permafrost at higher latitudes, the large thermal offset may be caused by nonconductive heat transfer in the active layer. The permafrost survived many decades because of snow cover, the structure of the ground, and hydraulic permeability. However, over the past fifty years the extent of permafrost has declined. Other periglacial geomorphology has been described in permafrost-free areas mainly above 3,500 m.a.s.l., where freeze-thaw action is ubiquitous. The seasonal frost depth is 40 to 60 cm, and seasonal and diurnal creeping has moved stones about 0.45 to 4.3 cm/year over the last fifty-two years. This research clarified the thermal dynamics of the active layer and the presence of the mountain permafrost at unusually low elevations in the tropics.					; Schorghofer, Norbert/A-1194-2007	Schorghofer, Norbert/0000-0002-5821-4066; Klasner, Frederick/0000-0002-7615-495X; Yoshikawa, Kenji/0000-0001-5935-2041; 													1523-0430	1938-4246				DEC 31	2023	55	1							2186485	10.1080/15230430.2023.2186485	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15230430.2023.2186485													WOS:000960448700001
J	Dean, A; Failler, A				Dean, Amber; Failler, Angela			'An Amazing Gift'? Memory entrepreneurship, settler colonialism and the Canadian Museum for Human Rights	MEMORY STUDIES												Drawing on research undertaken at the Canadian Museum for Human Rights, this article considers the role of memory entrepreneurship in the museum's historic launch and in a sampling of its content, social media posts, points of sale and marketing campaigns. These examples are read in tension with Roger I. Simon's conceptualization of 'the terrible gift' of what we come to know belatedly about events of mass violence, which calls into question the consolatory promises of learning from 'those who came before us' and the 'lessons of their lives'. The museum's involvement in the City of Winnipeg's tourism initiatives and the revitalization of Winnipeg's downtown are also considered, and we suggest that the museum's participation in the creative economy might affect its tendency to situate human rights violations primarily in the past. Critiques of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights' present occupation of Indigenous land and the museum (and City of Winnipeg)'s ongoing reliance on natural resources extracted at the expense of Indigenous communities remain as difficult or inassimilable knowledge. Juxtaposing Indigenous, cultural and economic critiques with the Canadian Museum for Human Rights' advancement of memory entrepreneurship, our article explores the inter-implication of consumer culture, capitalism, settler colonialism and the museum's ability to contribute to societal change. We conclude by turning to the activism of members of Shoal Lake 40 First Nation, arguing that their calls for access to safe water and an all-season road in and out of their community pose both an economic and a political challenge to the Canadian Museum for Human Rights and its brand of memory entrepreneurship by insisting that gestures to include and proffer representational forms of recognition to Indigenous peoples must simultaneously attend to sovereigntist calls for redistribution of land and resources in order to meaningfully address the historical and ongoing injustices of settler colonialism.

This study investigates breeding biology of an emblematic species of this region: The Ferruginous Duck (Aythya nyroca), a duck ranked globally 'Near Threatened' on the IUCN Red List. This study aimed to determine wetland environmental variables influencing nest site selection and breeding success of the species. Over two successive breeding seasons (2016 and 2017), the effects of habitat characteristics and nest traits on breeding parameters of 50 nests constructed on alder carr of the lake and offshore floating vegetation islets in the center of the waterbody were analyzed using generalized linear models (GLM). Clutch size averaged 9.8 +/- 0.7 eggs (range: 2-26 eggs) with 66% hatching success. Desertion of the nest (i.e. nest abandonment by the parents during the period of egg-laying and/or incubation) was the main cause for breeding failure (18% of total nests). Clutch size was positively related to nest surface and nest depth, but it decreased with the increase in the distance of nest on the vegetation platform to water. GLM revealed that breeding success was positively associated with late clutches; with a negative effect of conspecific nest density on clutch size and breeding success. Nest-site choice is resulted from interspecific competition and/or is affected by the reduced number of favorable nesting sites. Nine nests (18%) were parasitized by the same species of which 67% were central nests. Only 2% of the nests studied were parasitized by Oxyura leucocephala nesting at the site. Possible explanations of nest site selection of Aythya nyroca in the study area are discussed. Variations in selection pressures may explain the relationships between the choice and characteristics of nest site in the Ferruginous duck at Lake Tonga. (c) 2021 The Authors.

J	Araoye, PA				Araoye, P. A.			The seasonal variation of pH and dissolved oxygen (DO2) concentration in Asa lake Ilorin, Nigeria	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES												The vertical and surface water variations of pH and dissolve oxygen (DO2) concentration were studied for 12 months (March 2005 to February 2006) in Asa lake Ilorin, Nigeria. The mean surface pH values ranged between 7.30 and 8.10, with lower values (7.30 - 7.70) obtained October to December while higher values (8.0/8.10) were obtained in January to July. Vertical distribution of mean pH also ranged from 8.1 (Surface) to 5.20 (Bottom). Similarly the monthly variations of mean DO2 concentration at the surface waters were between 7.60 - 8.20 mg/l, with lower values in October/November and higher values in March/April. Vertical distribution of DO2 concentration also ranged from 8.20 (surface) to 2.50 (bottom) mg/l. A fairly defined pH and DO2 stratification were noted from March to September and also in January/February, while destratification was noted for these parameters in November and December. However a sharp drop in DO2 concentration usually occurred at the thermocline zone of 5 m depth. This sharp drop also became shifted to 7 m depth in October and November due to thermal mixing condition of the lake around this season, and DO2 concentration were almost uniform from the surface to 5 m depth (mean = 7.60 mg/l). The effects of this on some of the fish fauna of this water body were discussed. The pH and dissolved DO2 concentration were positively correlated (0.54). There were no marked variations of the pH and dissolved oxygen concentration along the 3 sampling sites across the lake hence fish species composition along the water body is likely to be less varied.																			1992-1950					MAY	2009	4	5					271	274																WOS:000268836800004

Numerous ponds are eutrophic and experience recurrent seasonal or year-round algal blooms or persistent duckweed cover, conferring a characteristic green hue. Here, we denote these eutrophic and green ponds as EGPs. The excessive proliferation of algal blooms and duckweed within these EGPs poses a significant threat to the ecological functioning of these aquatic systems, which can lead to hypoxia or the release of microcystins. To identify these EGPs automatically, we constructed an Efficient Attention Fusion Unet (EAF-Unet) algorithm using Gaofen-2 (GF2) panchromatic and multispectral imagery. The attention mechanism was incorporated in Unet to help better detect EGPs. Using the first EGP labeled dataset, we determined the best input feature combination (RGB, NIR, NDVI, and Bright) and the most effective encoding (Rasnet50) for EAF-Unet for distinguishing EGPs from other ground cover types. The evaluation indices - Precision (0.81), Recall (0.79), F1-Score (0.80), and Intersection over Union (IoU, 0.67) - indicate that EAF-Unet can accurately and robustly extract EGPs from GF2 images without relying on pond water masks. Remote-sensing EGP products can assist in identifying ponds with severe eutrophication. Moreover, these products can serve as references for identifying high-risk areas prone to improper sewage discharge or inadequate sewer construction.

The salinity dynamics in the lagoon is investigated using the 3D SYMPHONIE numerical model. We first validate the model using salinity and water level data. Simulated and observed salinity and water level variations compare well demonstrating that the reference model simulation correctly reproduces the dynamics of the lagoon. By performing several simulations with varying external forcings and freshwater fluxes, the main drivers of salinity variability in the lagoon are identified. We first focus on the salinization phase of the lagoon at the end of the tropical wet season (between November and February), and we investigate the total change in salinity and the salt fluxes involved in these variations. The high frequency salt fluxes associated with the ocean tide import salt from the ocean via the Cotonou channel to the south of the lagoon. Baroclinic fluxes, associated with the influence of salt on density and associated pressure gradient, increase this local salinity input in the south, but also play a major role in the dispersion of salt throughout the lagoon. Two rivers provide a permanent freshwater inflow in the north/ northeast of the lagoon that limits the salinization of the whole lagoon. Finally, windgenerated high frequency recirculation, partially prevents the salinisation of the North-East of the lagoon. During the desalinization period (between May and September), the lagoon salinity variations are highly sensitive to the magnitude of river inflow. At a constant river flux rate, the lagoon attains an equilibrium state in salinity. As this equilibrium is reached, both the overall salinity level and the time needed to achieve it decrease notably with higher fluxes. Beyond 100 m3 s-1, only a small area near the Cotonou channel retains higher salinity, while surpassing 500 m3 s-1 results in complete desalination of the entire Nokoue ' lagoon.					duhaut, thomas/AAX-8986-2020; Marsaleix, Patrick/Q-3389-2019; model, symphonie/C-2758-2013; Chaigneau, Alexis/E-4324-2010	Marsaleix, Patrick/0000-0002-4506-5209; OKPEITCHA, Olaegbe Victor/0000-0003-4411-1629; 													2352-4855					JAN	2024	69								103330	10.1016/j.rsma.2023.103330	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2023.103330		DEC 2023											WOS:001165479600001

We applied a published temperate zone reed model to assess growth and cycling of C and nutrients among the various organs of P. australis in this sub-tropical lake. We aim to quantify the role of reed stands for the C balance and nutrients cycling in the south Mediterranean wetland. Above-ground biomass was 3.5 times higher than the below-ground biomass. Root biomass represented 13% of the total below-ground, while leaves and panicles represented 16 and 3% of the above-ground biomass, respectively. Remobilization from rhizomes (15%) and reallocation from leaves (1%) were of little importance as assimilated sources. Nutrients accumulation by total above-ground biomass ranged between 2.7 to 46.8 gm(-2)yr(-1) for P and K, respectively. We calculated a C sequestration rate of 38.4 g C m(-2)yr(-1) for the dead rhizomes in the sediments. This value stresses the importance of P. australis stands for C sequestration in Lake Burullus. Further, as much as 254 t P and 5527 t N could potentially be removed annually from Lake Burullus by harvesting P. australis at maximum total above-ground biomass.

J	Pinder, AM; Halse, SA; McRae, JM; Shiel, RJ				Pinder, AM; Halse, SA; McRae, JM; Shiel, RJ			Occurrence of aquatic invertebrates of the wheatbelt region of Western Australia in relation to salinity	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The wheatbelt region of Western Australia has been extensively cleared of indigenous vegetation for agriculture and is now severely affected by dryland salinity. Wetlands that were once freshwater are now saline and others are under threat, as are the animals and plants that inhabit them. Rising groundwater is also affecting the many naturally saline playas. To provide a framework for setting conservation priorities in this region a biological survey was undertaken, including sampling of aquatic invertebrates at 230 wetlands. In this paper, we have used data from the survey to summarise occurrence of species in relation to salinity. Total species richness at a wetland showed no response to salinity below 4.1 g l(-1) and then declined dramatically as salinity increased. When halophilic species were excluded from consideration, species richness was found to decline from 2.6 g l(-1). These patterns are compared to previous studies of richness-salinity relationships. There is some evidence that the freshwater invertebrate fauna of the wheatbelt may be comparatively salt tolerant, with 46% of freshwater species collected at salinities above 3 g l(-1) and 17% above 10 g l(-1), though these proportions differed between various invertebrate groups. While this tolerance will provide a buffer against the effects of mild salinisation, many species are at risk of regional extinction as salinisation becomes more widespread.

However, their life cycle in the freshwater environment has not been well investigated, in particular in the tropical region. Therefore, our study aimed to elucidate the importance of the integration of life cycle and habitat conditions in modeling the biomass of migratory fish species. Focusing on the hydrological years 2000-2015, we collected the biomass of 74 migratory fish species and their seasonal habitat conditions in the floodplain of the Lower Mekong Basin, including Tonle Sap Lake. Then, generalized linear, generalized additive, and random forest models were applied to the collected data with and without life cycle information. As a result, the models and their performance indicate that the integration of the life cycle and seasonal habitat conditions in modeling the biomass is significantly important for migratory fishes. The results further showed that changing ecohydrological indices in the feeding and refuge seasons negatively affected the fish biomass. Those indices were hydrologic factors (the maximum water levels, the mean water levels, the start date of the flood, and the end date of the flood) and climate factors (water temperatures). Interestingly, the models indicated that the total area of inundated forests negatively influences the biomass of planktivorous fishes while it positively affects the biomass of piscivores. These results clearly showed the importance of a natural flow regime to ensure the fish life cycle and biomass production in the Lower Mekong Basin. The presented approach can be applied to model the biomass of migratory fishes in spatially connected and changing environments.

Aluminum, Ti, Fe, Mn, and As were part of the dust carried from the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa: these elements presented low enrichment factors and occurred (except Mn) as particles. Lead, Zn, Cd, and Cu showed a polluting character: their enrichment factors were clearly above those that can be caused by natural fractionation processes; and they were found in a variable, though always large proportion as soluble forms. Nickel had intermediate properties suggesting a balance of both natural and polluting sources. Temporal variations of trace element deposition were related to the prevailing meteorological conditions. Deposition of dust, Pb, Ni, and Cd was higher during the year in which a larger proportion of precipitation came from the Iberian Peninsula-North Africa and followed low-altitude trajectories. On a seasonal scale, deposition of dust and Pb was similarly related to southern air masses occurring during June-November. Possible changes in the general atmospheric circulation patterns as a result of climate change may cause a shift in the proportion of air masses coming from different locations and hence in the fluxes of the elements received by the catchments. Such atmospheric fluxes have caused high concentrations of several trace elements in Pyrenean lake sediments at a level which may be of ecotoxicological relevance.

Gloeotrichia echinulata blooms in an oligotrophic lake:: helpful insights from eutrophic lakes	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Nuisance algal blooms are widely reported from eutrophic and hypereutrophic systems, but are relatively rare in oligotrophic systems. Recently, the cyanobacterium Gloeotrichia echinulata has begun blooming in oligotrophic to mesotrophic lakes in the northeastern USA. We explored whether existing knowledge about G. echinulata, derived from eutrophic systems, would be useful in predicting the recruitment dynamics of G. echinulata in an oligotrophic lake in central New Hampshire, USA. Our results indicate that, as in eutrophic lakes, there was a seasonal peak in both recruitment and surface abundance, with colonies recruiting from shallow (2 m) but not deep (>= 5 m) sediments. Recruitment provided approximately 20-45% of the colonies to the 2005 G. echinulata surface bloom, within the range reported for eutrophic lakes. Thus, we conclude that observations of G. echinulata in eutrophic systems may be useful in predicting G. echinulata recruitment dynamics in oligotrophic lakes. Moreover, recruitment from the sediments appears to be an important mechanism that allows G. echinulata to bloom in low- as well as high-nutrient lakes. This benthic-pelagic coupling may, over time, result in an important transfer of nutrients in such oligotrophic lakes.

A tephra- and radiocarbon-based chronology was developed to infer the timing of marked paleolimnological changes in Lake Pupuke, Auckland, New Zealand, identified using sedimentology, magnetic susceptibility, grain size and geochemistry (carbon, nitrogen and sulphur concentrations and fluxes, carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes). Variable erosional influx, biomass and benthic REDOX conditions are linked to changing effective precipitation and seasonality within three inferred broad intervals of climatic change: (1) the Last Glacial Coldest Phase (LGCP) of reduced effective precipitation and cooler temperatures, from 28.8 to 18.0 cal kyr BP, (2) the Last Glacial Interglacial Transition (LGIT) of increasing effective precipitation and warmer conditions, from 18.0 to 10.2 cal kyr BP, and (3) a Holocene interval of high effective precipitation, beginning with a warm period of limited seasonality from 10.2 cal kyr BP and followed by increasing seasonality from 7.6 cal kyr BP. The LGCP and LGIT also contain millennial-scale climate events, including the coldest inferred glacial conditions during the LGCP from 27.8 to 26.0 and 22.0-19.0 cal kyr BP, and a climate reversal in the LGIT associated with lower lake level, from 14.5 to 13.8 cal kyr BP, coeval with the Antarctic Cold Reversal. The onset of seasonal thermal stratification occurred at 5.7 cal kyr BP and was linked to natural eutrophication of Lake Pupuke, which produced enhanced organic sedimentation.					; Augustinus, Paul/B-5125-2011; Shane, Phil/HKV-7633-2023	Stephens, Thomas/0000-0002-0003-9269; Shane, Philip/0000-0002-7824-1184; Snowball, Ian/0000-0002-6257-3088; Nilsson, Andreas/0000-0002-9528-1276; Augustinus, Paul/0000-0002-1391-2151													0921-2728	1573-0417				DEC	2012	48	4					785	800		10.1007/s10933-012-9644-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-012-9644-z													WOS:000311395000008

Millenial-scale climatic and vegetation changes in a northern Cerrado (Northeast, Brazil) since the Last Glacial Maximum	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												In the Southern Hemisphere, lacustrine sediments started to be deposited with the beginning of the deglaciation at ca 19,000 cal yr BP. At this time the region of Lake Caco was dominated by sparse and shrubby vegtation with dominance of steppic grasses in a poor sandy soil. The landscape did not present any ecological characteristics of a modern Cerrado. However single pollen grains of two Cerrado indicators, Byrsonima and Mimosa, suggest that some Cerrado species were able to survive under the prevailing and climate, probably as small shrubs. After 15,500calyrBP, a sudden increase in the moisture rates is evidenced with the progressive expansion of rainforest showing successive dominance of various associations of taxa. The development of the forest stopped abruptly at the end of the Pleistocene between 12,800 and 11,000 cal yr BP, as attested by strong fires and the expansion of Poaceae. In the early Holocene an open landscape with a relatively high level of water in the lake preceded the progressive expansion of Cerrado species towards a denser forested landscape; fires are recorded from then on, resulting in the physiognomy of the Cerrado we know today. Late Pleistocene paleoenvironmental records from northern Brazil reflect the interplay between insolation forcing of two hemispheres with the local components represented by the interannual shift of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone and the influence of seasonal equatorwards polar air incursions.

Late Holocene plant and climate evolution at Lake Yoa, northern Chad: pollen data and climate simulations	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												The discovery of groundwater-fed Lake Yoa (19.03 degrees N, 20.31 degrees E) in the hyperarid desert of northern Chad by the German research team ACACIA headed by S. Kropelin provides a unique, continuous sedimentary sequence of late Holocene age available in the entire Saharan desert. Here we present pollen data and climate simulations using the LMDZ atmospheric model with a module representing the climatologically-relevant thermal and hydrological processes occurring above and beneath inland water surfaces to document past environmental and climate changes during the last 6000 cal yr BP. Special attention is paid to wind strength and direction, length and amplitude of the rainy season, and dry spell occurrence, all of which are of primary importance for plant distribution and pollen transport. In addition to climate changes and their impact on the natural environment, anthropogenic changes are also discussed. Two main features can be highlighted: (1) the shift from an earlier predominantly monsoonal climate regime to one dominated by northern Mediterranean fluxes that occurred after 4000 cal yr BP. The direct consequence of this was the establishment of the modern desert environment at Yoa at 2700 cal yr BP. (2) Changes in climate parameters (simulated rainfall amount and dry spell length) between 6 and 4000 cal yr BP were comparatively minor. However, changes in the seasonal distribution of precipitation during this time interval dramatically affected the vegetation composition and were at the origin of the retreat of tropical plant communities from Lake Yoa.

The Permian Moradi Formation of northern Niger: Paleosol morphology, petrography and mineralogy	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Three basic paleosol morphologies, named Type A, Type B and Type C, are described from the middle-upper Permian strata of the Moradi Formation, Tim Mersoi Basin, northern Niger. The Moradi Formation is a typical alluvial redbed succession dominated by red mudrocks with fine to coarse-grained pebbly channel sandstones and matrix-breccias. Type A paleosols are hosted by well-sorted fine to medium grained trough cross bedded and massive sandstones and preserve abundant vertical to horizontal micritic and microspar calcite tubules, interpreted as rhizoliths. Lateral variability of rhizoliths in Type A paleosols, and their close association with fluvial channel-fill sediments suggests they are the roots of grove stands of phreatophytic vegetation that grew within unstable anabranching stream systems. Type B paleosols are hosted by mudrocks and preserve well-developed ped structure, abundant micritic calcite nodules and vertically-stacked micritic calcite nodular bodies, as well as rare calcite with satin-spar texture interpreted as a pseudomorphic replacement of pedogenic gypsum. The morphology of Type B paleosols suggests they were formed in well-drained floodplain deposits on stable landforms. Type C paleosols are similar to Type B but preserve pedogenic structures indicative of soil volume expansion and contraction, as well as more abundant Stage II pedogenic carbonate nodules. The morphology of Type C paleosols suggests that they developed periodically rather than seasonally in poorly-drained deposits that nevertheless occupied a relatively stable part of the landscape such as the plains flanking ephemeral lakes or sabkhas. X-ray diffraction analysis of the <2 mu m fraction from the Moradi Formation strata indicates that paleosol phyllosilicates are composed of illite, smectite, and occasionally kaolinite and talc. Illite is likely a detrital mineral, whereas smectite and kaolinite are likely pedogenic weathering products. The presence of talc in the Moradi Formation paleosols is unusual. It is limited to paleosol horizons that also preserve evidence for pedogenic gypsum accumulation and is therefore most likely related to a pedogenic weathering process. It is possible that this talc is a relatively low-temperature (similar to 50-100 degrees C) diagenetic alteration product of pedogenic Mg-phyllosilicates such as sepiolite. The range of morphologies, petrographic textures and mineralogy of the paleosol profiles indicates semi-arid to hyper-arid climatic setting. This paleoclimatic reconstruction is in agreement with Middle and Late Permian conceptual paleoclimate models and quantitative general circulation models. Nevertheless, and in spite of an arid climate, Moradi paleosols and their host strata also indicate a relatively shallow groundwater table. Importantly, this shallow groundwater resource undoubtedly helped to support the moderately diverse fossil vertebrate assemblage and large-stature macrophytes preserved in the Moradi Formation.

Changes in catfish diving behavior and temperature exposure were monitored over a period of roughly 2 years. Transmitter detections were recorded by nine autonomous receivers (VR2W, installed in 2015 between Serbia and Romania, as well as near Romanian shiplock and upstream Romanian turbines). The first signals were recorded on April 28, 2015 and the last on February 13, 2017. Altogether 59,355 and 59,175 detections of the catfish depth and water temperature were recorded, respectively. The greatest number of signals were recorded by the two receivers closest to the location where the catfish was caught, 72.3% and 27.1%, while only 0.6% of signals were recorded by other receivers. The mean catfish depth was 8.4 m, while minimum and maximum depths were 1.2 and 16.2 m. Results obtained showed that this catfish exhibited high site fidelity, while changes in depth at certain periods are possibly related to its search for prey and upstream migration during the spawning period. Hydropower dam and shiplock were obstacles on its migration upstream and telemetry studies could ensure habitat requirements and meet the development of restoration and conservation strategies for the fish resources in the future.					; Paraschiv, Marian/V-8157-2017; Stefan, Hont/U-3269-2018; Iani, Marian/KHV-9691-2024; Hont, Stefan/U-3269-2018	Spasic, Sladjana/0000-0003-1098-371X; Lenhardt, Mirjana/0000-0003-3390-3292; Suciu, Radu/0000-0001-7531-1813; Iani, Marian/0000-0002-0484-1128; Hont, Stefan/0000-0002-6806-2406; Smederevac-Lalic, Marija/0000-0003-4346-1432; Paraschiv, Marian/0000-0003-1254-4614													1434-2944	1522-2632				JUN	2021	106	3-4					191	201		10.1002/iroh.202002049	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.202002049		MAR 2021											WOS:000632483000001

This risk will increase over time as a result of climate change because of higher average temperatures, longer growing seasons, and more intense droughts. On the other hand, these communities are also faced with rising fuel costs and a growing demand for heat as suburban population increases. The fact these communities are surrounded by forests presents an opportunity to combine community wildfire risk abatement with bioenergy development. Additional co-benefits include: (1) reduced community energy expenditures; (2) the creation of local jobs; (3) climate change mitigation; and (4) increased community energy security. Here, we present results from three pilot rural communities (Burns Lake, Invermere, and Sicamous, all of them in British Columbia) designed to evaluate the feasibility of wildfire risk abatement in conjunction with bioenergy production. Maps were created showing each community's forest-urban interface area with quantified estimates of its sustainable woody biomass resource potential under different management scenarios while monitoring ecosystem and soil health. The results and experience gained through this work has been synthesized in a calculator tool to help other communities make their own screening-level assessments.

J	Yang, ZF; Mao, XF				Yang, Zhifeng; Mao, Xufeng			Wetland system network analysis for environmental flow allocations in the Baiyangdian Basin, China	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Many individual wetlands are hydraulically interconnected and present a specific network structure, which act as a large wetland system. Understanding the environmental flow allocations for a wetland system, instead of an individual wetland, is important for systems-level water resources management and ecological protection. In the present study, ecological network analysis was introduced as a powerful method for developing insights into the integral functional condition of the Baiyangdian wetland system in northern China. We investigated how 6 network functional indicators react to different environmental flow allocations in 16 sequential seasons of four-stage during the period of 1959-1978. Biological productivity in the Baiyangdian Lake was used to verify the validity of these functional indicators. A deviation index (D), which incorporates input ascendency (A(0)), output ascendency (A(e)) and internal ascendency (A(i)), was adopted to evaluate the reasonability of environmental flow allocations for the wetland system. Results show that the functional indicators of the wetland system declined continuously during the study period. The average deviation index increased from 0.69 to 1.089, indicating the environmental flow allocations for the wetland system were increasingly inadequate and unreasonable in the study period. On the basis of the above results, an adjustment coefficient was developed to direct the environmental flow allocations for the wetland system within the basin. The present study provides an example of how management actions arising out of network analysis might lead to a better understanding of a wetland system functioning and holistic environmental flow assessment.

J	Yu, ZB; Pollard, D; Cheng, L				Yu, Zhongbo; Pollard, David; Cheng, Li			On continental-scale hydrologic simulations with a coupled hydrologic model	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												A new method of coupling coarse-grid regional or global climate models with a much finer-grid hydrologic model is described, that is designed for interactive climate-hydrologic simulations with explicit changes in individual rivers, lakes, wetlands and water tables. Six vertical land-surface solutions with prescribed near-surface soil moistures or standing water depths within each coarse meteorological cell are obtained to disaggregate the relevant quantities (infiltration, runoff) to the finer hydrologic grid based on current near-surface soil moisture in the hydrologic model. Feedbacks on the climate (evaporation, surface heat flux) can be aggregated on the climate grid in the same way. The method is applied for the simulation over the North American continent using (i) NCEP/NCAR reanalyzed meteorologic data and Higgins precipitation data for recent decades, (ii) a vertical column land-surface model on the same coarse grid, and (iii) a new hydrologic model of river, lake and groundwater flow on a 20 x 20 km grid. The predicted routing of major rivers and most lake extents are realistic, reflecting the hydrologic consistency of the 20-km topography. The modeled continental patterns of water-table depths, vadose-zone soil moisture and recharge rates are reasonable. The predicted seasonal discharges at the outlets of four major US river basins are in fair to good agreement with those observed, except for the Colorado where human influences drastically reduce the natural flow.

J	Li, TY; He, BH; Zhang, YQ; Fu, S; Zhang, Y; Long, XJ				Li, Tianyang; He, Binghui; Zhang, Yuqi; Fu, Shi; Zhang, Yi; Long, Xunjian			Spatiotemporal dynamics of coupled dissolved silica and bicarbonate in a dam-induced urban lake system in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Dissolved silica (DSi) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) stoichiometric coupling is collectively regulated by chemical weathering and algal activity, and potentially indicates the aquatic silicon retention and carbon emission in aquatic systems. Damming markedly remodels the hydrological conditions and aquatic biological activity, however, its effects on the spatiotemporal dynamics of coupled DSi and HCO3- remain poorly understood. Here we deciphered a 2-year hydrological and water quality dataset collected at multiple sites within an urban lake, namely Hanfeng Lake, the largest pre-dam of the Three Gorges Reservoir, to unravel the spatiotemporal dynamics of DSi and HCO3- and selected hydrological and water quality variables using cluster analysis, and to explore the best predictors for DSi:HCO3- using partial least squares regression. The changes of DSi, HCO3- and selected water variables could be characterized by spatial east and west zones, and further by temporal periods 1, 2 and 3 corresponding respectively to fluctuation stage, fluvial stage and lacustrine stage in each zone based on the hydrographic features of Hanfeng Lake. Wet season presented higher flow velocity, permanganate index, concentrations of DSi, HCO3-, nitrate-nitrogen and total suspended solids, and lower water level, secchi depth and chlorophyll-a, but equal DSi:HCO3- relative to dry season. DSi was overall negatively correlated with HCO3-, highlighting the dominant role of chemical weathering rather algal activity. DSi:HCO3- exhibited significant relationships with various variables, but was the best predictable using water level, permanganate index and nitrogen-based variables, suggesting the strong effects of water level fluctuation and pollution discharge on the coupling of silicon and carbon. Our results have great significance for understanding and modeling the biogeochemical cycles of silicon and carbon in the dam-induced lake ecosystems worldwide.

A common feature of ponds, especially those subject to eutrophication, is mass surface coverings of lemnoid Araceae (duckweed) which have severe implications for ecological processes in small waterbodies, in particular lowered oxygen content. To help understand the implications of duckweed dominance for the long-term ecology of ponds, and to determine the potential for palaeoecological studies in ponds more generally, we develop a new diatom-based Lemna-indicator metric. Recent studies of diatom host-plant relationships have shown significant associations between duckweed and the epiphytes Lemnicola hungarica and Sellaphora saugerresii (formally known as Sellaphora seminulum). To determine the potential of these species as palaeo-indicators of long-term duckweed dynamics in ponds, we investigated the diatom composition of surface sediment assemblages in sets of duckweed and non-duckweed-dominated ponds in Norfolk, eastern England. In addition, we undertook diatom analysis of two cores from a small farmland pond (Bodham Rail Pit) subject to a known duckweed dominance event (1999-2005). Both L. hungarica and S. saugerresii were significant predictors of past Lemna dominance in the surface sediments. Further, in the core study, both diatom species accurately and closely tracked the documented "on-off" duckweed cycle. Our study suggests huge potential for using ponds in palaeoecological studies and for diatom-based investigations of floating plant histories.

A case study and a meta-analysis of seasonal variation in fish mercury concentrations	ECOTOXICOLOGY												Mercury contamination in aquatic ecosystems is a concern due to health risks of consuming fish. Fish mercury concentrations are highly variable and influenced by a range of environmental factors. However, seasonal variation in mercury levels are typically overlooked when monitoring fish mercury concentrations, establishing consumption advisories, or creating accumulation models. Temporal variation in sampling could bias mercury concentration estimates of accumulation potential. Thus, the objectives of this study were to first evaluate seasonal variation of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) axial muscle mercury concentration from two Iowa, USA impoundments. Second, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate if seasonal variation in mercury concentration is dependent upon mean mercury concentration, waterbody type, or fish trophic level or mean length. Largemouth bass were collected four times between May and October (24-36 fish per month) from Twelve Mile (2013) and Red Haw (2014) lakes. Largemouth bass axial muscle mercury concentrations were variable within and between lakes, ranging from undetectable ( < 0.05 mg/kg) to 0.54 mg/kg. Largemouth bass mercury concentrations were similar across months in Twelve Mile but varied temporally in Red Haw and were highest in July, intermediate in May and September, and lowest during October. Results of the meta-analysis suggest that seasonal variation in mercury concentrations is more likely to occur as mean mercury concentration of the population increases but is unrelated to waterbody type, trophic status, and fish size. Understanding seasonal variation in fish mercury concentrations will aid in the development of standardized sampling programs for long-term monitoring programs and fish consumption advisories.

Cyanobacterial influence on diatom community lifeform dynamics in shallow subtropical lakes of Florida USA	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Fragilarioid diatom taxa are often deemed ubiquitous in shallow lake systems. Their presence has been described as contributing to statistical noise in paleolimnological studies of cold-temperate lakes. In shallow, warm-temperate lakes of Florida, long-term transitions from assemblages dominated by Aulacoseira spp. to fragilarioid taxa, particularly Pseudostaurosira brevistriata, Staurosira construens var. venter, and Staurosirella pinnata, often occur. Distinctly higher limnetic nutrient optima are demonstrated by these fragilarioid taxa than by planktonic Aulacoseira spp. Community successions occur during eutrophication, and progressive replacement of Aulacoseira spp. and other planktonic taxa by fragilarioid taxa is concurrent with and apparently related to the onset of cyanobacterial dominance. We examine successions from Aulacoseira-dominated to fragilarioid-dominated assemblages in sediment cores from subtropical Florida lakes that have undergone eutrophication. Diatom profiles are compared with sedimented pigments, nitrogen stable isotopes of organic matter, and with silica accumulation rates. These study lakes have little if any macrophyte presence. Their light-extinction depths are extremely shallow, yet diatom communities are dominated by bottom-dwelling rather than planktonic taxa. Frequent wind-generated mixing, sometimes to lake bottoms, is sufficient to sustain the light needs of benthic and tychoplanktonic taxa. We conclude that assemblage changes generally are not caused by reduced water depths, silica limitation, nor increased incipient stratification, but that cyanobacteria are responsible for reducing planktonic Aulacoseira in favor of fragilarioid taxa. Cyanobacteria blooms persist over a wide seasonal range because of warm climate and high limnetic nutrient concentrations in Florida lakes. Cyanobacteria progressively displace and outcompete Aulacoseira and other planktonic taxa as eutrophication proceeds. Reduced light availability, changes in mineral/nutrient availability, and other aspects of competitive exclusion, such as cyanobacterial allelotoxins, might contribute to observed changes. Climate warming is not likely to account for Aulacoseira reduction as in colder regions because it is less pronounced in this subtropical district. Lakes with low nutrient levels and less cyanobacteria still sustain large Aulacoseira populations, and decreases in limnetic nutrients sometimes lead to the return of planktonic Aulacoseira. Rather than simply representing statistical noise for paleolimnological reconstructions, shifts to certain fragilarioid taxa indicate when subtropical Florida lakes progressed to hypereutrophic conditions that were marked by cyanobacterial proliferation.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				AUG	2018	60	2			SI		223	246		10.1007/s10933-018-0018-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-018-0018-z													WOS:000437128400009

However, the flow regulation of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in the middle Yangtze River has attracted much attention because the severe drought occurred in the river-lake system downstream of the TGR. In this paper, the Dongting Lake was selected as a case study in order to detect the possible relationship between the flow regulation of the TGR and the extreme drought in the river-lake system based on a coupled hydrodynamic model. The results not only confirmed the significant role of the TGR to relieve drought in the river-lake system, but also indicated that the outflow of the TGR and the hydraulic gradient between the Zhicheng to Chenglingji stations were the crucial factors to affect the water exchange between the rivers and the Dongting Lake. The adjustment of hydraulic gradient within a proper range during the water compensation of the TGR will be an effective measure to improve the water exchange and water environment in the river-lake system. These findings present the quantitative influence of these important factors on the water exchange between rivers and lakes and provide a scientific reference for environmental and ecological management of other river-lake systems.

Nine phyla of invertebrates were collected, of which oligochaetes, shrimps and Limnoperna mussels were abundant along with meiobenthic crustaceans. The macrophyte-associated invertebrates in Lake Tonle Sap might be unique in having abundant sessile animals, such as sponges, bryozoans and Limnoperna mussels. The Limnoperna mussels attached to macrophytes were more abundant in offshore and inundated forest than in secluded vegetational stands toward the shoreline. It suggests that water movement can be an important factor determining the distribution and abundance of the sessile animals by controlling larval dispersions and might be associated with the hydrological characteristic of the lake, i.e., the lake opens to the large Mekong River with drastic seasonal changes in water level.

Radiocarbon deglaciation chronology of the Thunder Bay, Ontario area and implications for ice sheet retreat patterns	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS					Biennial Meeting of the American-Quaternary-Association	JUN, 2008	Pennsylvania State Univ, University Pk, PA	Amer Quaternary Assoc, UNESCO Int Goesci Programme	Pennsylvania State Univ			The sensitivity of ice sheets to climate change influences the return of meltwater to the oceans. Here we track the Laurentide Ice Sheet along a similar to 400 km long transect spanning about 6000 yr of retreat during the major climate oscillations of the lateglacial. Thunder Bay, Ontario is near a major topographic drainage divide, thus terrestrial ablation processes are the primary forcers of ice margin recession in the study area. During deglaciation three major moraine sets were produced, and have been assigned minimum ages of 13.9 +/- 0.2, 12.3 +/- 0.2-12.1 +/- 0.1, and 11.2 +/- 0.2 cal ka BP from south to north. These define a slow retreat (similar to 10-50 m/a) prior to major climate oscillations which was then followed by a factor of similar to 2 increase during the BbIling-Allerod, and an additional increase during the early Holocene. When compared to retreat rates in other terrestrial settings of the ice sheet, nearly identical patterns emerge. However this becomes problematic because a key control on retreat rates is the surface slope of the ice sheet and this should vary considerably over areas of so-called hard and soft beds. Further these ice margin reconstructions would not allow meltwater sourced in the Hudson Basin to drain into the Atlantic basin until after Younger Dryas time. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Since the oysters filter suspended materials and excrete organic matters into the seawater, bacterial communities residing in its vicinity may show dynamic changes depending on the oyster culture activities. We employed a shotgun metagenomic technique to study bacterial communities near oyster aquaculture facilities at the center of the bay (KSt. 2) and compared the results with those of two other localities far from the station, one to the northeast (innermost bay, KSt. 1) and the other to the southwest (bay entrance, KSt. 3). Seawater samples were collected every month from January to December 2015 from the surface (1 m) and deeper (8 or 10 m) layers of the three locations, and the sequentially filtered fraction on 0.2-mu m membranes was sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq system. The acquired reads were uploaded to MG-RAST for KEGG functional abundance analysis, while taxonomic analyses at the phylum and genus levels were performed using MEGAN after parsing the BLAST output. Discrimination analyses were then performed using the ROC-AUC value of the cross validation, targeting the depth (shallow or deep), locality [(KSt. 1 + KSt. 2) vs. KSt 3; (KSt. 1 + KSt. 3) vs. KSt. 2 or the (KSt. 2 + KSt. 3) vs. KSt. 1] and seasonality (12 months). The matrix discrimination analysis on the adjacent 2 continuous seasons by ROC-AUC, which was based on the datasets that originated from different depths, localities and months, showed the strongest discrimination signal on the taxonomy matrix at the phylum level for the datasets from July to August compared with those from September to June, while the KEGG matrix showed the strongest signal for the datasets from March to June compared with those from July to February. Then, the locality combination was subjected to the same ROC-AUC discrimination analysis, resulting in significant differences between KSt. 2 and KSt. 1 + KSt. 3 on the KEGG matrix. These results suggest that aquaculture activities markedly affect bacterial functions.					Bajic, Vladimir/D-2810-2009; Reza, Md.

The Chinese government established national total emission control (TEC) policies related to the nation's surface water quality over the past 10 yr to restore, protect, and promote healthy water quality. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of China's TEC policies by analyzing three water quality constituents (ammonium nitrogen [NH4-N], dissolved oxygen [DO], and the permanganate index [CODMn]) at 73 monitoring stations, which account for most of the surface waters of eastern China. The seasonal Mann-Kendall test revealed that approximately 60, 50, and 65% of stations had nonsignificant trends for CODMn, NH4-N, and DO, respectively. Concentrations of CODMn and NH4-N significantly (a = 0.05) decreased by 27.4 and 38.4% at the monitoring stations over the 11-yr study period, whereas DO significantly (a = 0.05) increased by 24.7%. Correlation analysis indicated that the water quality improved at approximately 30% (CODMn) and 20% (NH4-N) of monitoring sites with the reduction of water pollutant emissions from industrial sources. A seasonal pattern was observed for the three water quality parameters at most of the stations but not at a regional scale. Results also indicated that CODMn concentrations decreased significantly (alpha = 0.05) at most river stations but increased significantly (alpha = 0.05) at nearly all lake stations, suggesting that TEC in China might be more effective for rivers than for lakes and reservoirs. Although there are many nonsignificant relationships with the water quality constituents selected as top pollutants in China, a few noticeable significant relationships were established.

These strata can also offer a wealth of quantitative data regarding the paleoclimate and paleoenvironment of the terrestrial Cretaceous, an important transition in Earth history. Many modern groups of organisms that dominate terrestrial ecosystems today originated or expanded in the Early Cretaceous. In addition, the Cretaceous Period, known to have been characterized by a greenhouse climate, provides opportunities to understand how the climate system functioned during greenhouse climate states. Here we utilize the clumped-isotope paleothermometer to provide paleotemperature records from a lacustrine sequence in northwestern China, previously constrained to the early Aptian. Petrographic and X-ray diffraction analyses indicate that the lake sediments produced primary to early diagenetic dolomites, likely microbially mediated due to high organic-matter input and seasonally warm arid conditions. The majority of the dolomitic carbonates formed in pore waters just below the sediment-water interface or as primary shallow-water precipitates. Clumped-isotope-derived temperatures from all carbonates range from 20.6 degrees C for early diagenetic dolomites to 47.2 degrees C for late-burial calcite cements. Accounting for seasonal biases, mean annual air temperatures are calculated to have averaged 20.2 degrees C. This is broadly consistent with local paleotemperature proxy evidence and climate-model paleotemperature estimates. The data presented provides further quantitative constraints on the Cretaceous greenhouse world, as well as insights into depositional settings that produce low-temperature dolomites.					; Gonzalez, Luis/D-5476-2011	, Gregory Alan Ludvigson/0009-0006-1814-3343; Gonzalez, Luis/0000-0001-7600-8306; You, Hai-Lu/0000-0003-2203-6461													1527-1404	1938-3681				MAY	2017	87	5					486	499		10.2110/jsr.2017.31	http://dx.doi.org/10.2110/jsr.2017.31													WOS:000402312300003

A calibration strategy for dynamic succession models including several phytoplankton groups	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												A fundamental problem in water quality modeling is adequately representing the changing state of aquatic ecosystems as accurately as possible, but with appropriate mathematical relationships without creating a highly complex and overly parameterized model. A model more complex than necessary will require more input and results in unaffordable calibration times. In this work we propose and test a calibration strategy for a one-dimensional dynamic physical ecological model (DYRESM-CAEDYM) to reproduce the seasonal changes in the functional composition of the phytoplankton community existing in El Gergal reservoir (Seville, Spain). The community is described as a succession of functional groups with different response to environmental conditions. First, we performed a sensitivity analysis to identify the parameters to include in the calibration process, and then applied a global optimization algorithm to fit the model for each algal group in a sequential fashion. Finally we simulated all the functional groups adopting parameter values established during the group-by-group calibrations. Our results show that the performance of this approach is strictly related with: (1) the level of system description (i.e. the model structure and the number of functional groups simulated); (2) the level of information included in the calibration process (i.e. the observations); and (3) the non-linear interactions among functional groups. Functional segmentation of the model should be minimized even though groups with different environmental requirements must be discriminated. Although magnitudes of biomass peaks were not always estimated correctly, the calibrated model was able to predict peak sequence and timing of dominant phytoplankton groups. Thus our study showed that: (1) model structure and nature of observations adopted have to be in agreement with the level of organization in the system; (2) integration of automatic calibration strategies is a useful approach in complex deterministic ecological models.

While temporal monitoring has shown changes in the nutrient inputs in many areas, how spatial and temporal beta diversity change along the eutrophication gradient under a changing context remains unclear. In this regard, analyses based on time series spanning multiple years are particularly scarce. We sampled benthic macroinvertebrates in 32 sites across three lake habitat types (MACROPHYTE, OPEN WATER, PHYTOPLANKTON) along the eutrophication gradient of Lake Taihu in four seasons from 2007 to 2019. Our purpose was to identify the relative contributions of spatial and temporal dissimilarity (i.e., inter-annual dissimilarity and seasonal dissimilarity) to overall benthic biodiversity. We also examined spatio-temporal patterns in community assembly mechanisms and how associated variation in benthic macroinvertebrate communities responded to nutrient indicators. Results showed that eutrophication caused macroinvertebrate community homogenization both along spatial and temporal gradients. Though spatial variability dominated the variation of species richness, abundance and community dissimilarity, seasons within years dissimilarity, inter-annual dissimilarity and seasonal dissimilarity were much more sensitive to eutrophication. Moreover, eutrophication inhibited a strong environmental control in benthic macroinvertebrate community assembly, including a dominant role of deterministic process in the spatial variation of macroinvertebrate communities and transition from stochastic to deterministic process in the temporal assembly of macroinvertebrate communities along the eutrophication gradient. In addition, some sites in PHYTOPLANKTON habitats showed similar spatial dissimilarity and spatial SES as sites in MACROPHYTE habitats, and the decreased spatial dissimilarity of three habitats implying that lake ecosystem recovery projects have achieved their goal at least to a certain degree.					; Rui, Dong/LDG-0179-2024; Heino, Jani/E-6342-2010	Cai, Yongjiu/0000-0002-3560-3798; Zhang, Qingji/0000-0002-9426-7157; 													0013-9351	1096-0953				FEB 15	2024	243								117872	10.1016/j.envres.2023.117872	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2023.117872		DEC 2023						38086502					WOS:001137619200001

It is the aggregation of salt marshes, salt meadows and wastewater-fed ponds that receive wastewater from various small and large scale industries and urban settlements. The available nutrient supports the grazing food chain of the wetland ecosystem and agriculture around it. Eutrophication is caused by the imbalance between nutrient load and utilization by the autotrophs in the system. In this wetland, there has been a gradual decrease in the fish production for the last few decades. The physical and chemical conditions of the system are deteriorating continuously. Therefore, modelling of the system is felt to be the need of the hour to mitigate the problem of eutrophication and identify the important parameters that govern the system dynamics. Here, a dynamic model is constructed to study the phosphorus dynamics of the system. The five state variable includes; inorganic phosphorus (orthophosphate), phytoplankton, zooplankton, organic phosphorus and sediment. Important processes, like mineralization, uptake, grazing, predation, settling, resuspension and sorption are considered in the model. Field data are collected over two years and incorporated in the model as graph time function. Sensitivity analysis is performed and the model is calibrated using first set data followed by the validation process. Results indicate that the wetland is in hypereutrophic condition. The model result shows that the inorganic phosphorus of the system is mainly controlled by desorption of phosphorus from the sediments and mineralization during the premonsoon. The settling of organic phosphorus and adsorption of inorganic phosphorus are major regulating processes in the postmonsoon. In monsoon, resuspension process has important role in governing the phosphorus dynamics of the wetland. Moreover, allochthonous input of phosphorus is dominant over autochthonus input and controls the system dynamics. The input rate of inorganic phosphorus from outside is the system sensitive parameter. The paper discusses the present condition of the East Calcutta Wetlands and outlines some of the important management strategies that can be applied to alleviate the eutrophication problem of the wetland ecosystem.

J	Huang, AN; Rao, YR; Lu, YY				Huang, Anning; Rao, Yerubandi R.; Lu, Youyu			Evaluation of a 3-D hydrodynamic model and atmospheric forecast forcing using observations in Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Six-month observations of surface meteorology, water temperature, and currents in Lake Ontario are used to evaluate a high-resolution, three-dimensional hydrodynamic model and the forecasted forcing from a regional version of the Canadian operational global environmental multiscale (GEM) model. The hydrodynamic model is based on the Princeton Ocean Model (POM). Driven by both the observed and modeled surface wind stress and the surface net heat fluxes (SNHF), POM is able to reproduce the observed variations of the lake surface temperature (LST) and vertical stratification conditions at the seasonal and synoptic time scales. The model also has skill in simulating the temporal and vertical variation of currents. The patterns of the simulated horizontal distributions of the LST and lake circulation are consistent with the observed climatology. Model sensitivity experiments reveal that the differences between the simulations using observed and model forcing are mainly due to the difference in wind stress instead of the SNHF. Comparison with meteorological observations suggests that GEM has good accuracy in simulating the SNHF but overestimates the wind. Model sensitivity experiments further revealed that errors in the SNHF have significant impact on simulations of water temperature in the surface and near-surface layers, whereas errors in wind stress cause significant changes of water temperature in the thermocline.					黄, 安宁/K-7473-2019	Lu, Youyu/0000-0003-2416-5443													2169-9275					FEB 3	2010	115								C02004	10.1029/2009JC005601	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2009JC005601													WOS:000274357900004

A contribution from agronomic analysis of market gardening systems around Mahajanga (Madagascar)	LAND USE POLICY												The rapid urbanization in developing countries implies an increasing pressure on urban agriculture for production. As most perishable food products come from this agriculture in close proximity to population concentrations, we analysed from an agronomic point of view how market-garden farmers can meet this increasing urban demand. This work took place in the case of Mahajanga. a secondary city with high increasing demographic rate on the Northwest coast of Madagascar. Based on preliminary surveys to characterize the farming systems (on a sample of 91 farms), 11 market-garden farmers chosen in the three main agricultural zones of the urban area were surveyed during two years. Surveys aimed at understanding their decision rules in crop choices, crop allocation to land and resource management, and to estimate their room for manoeuvre to increase their leafy vegetable areas under cultivation. The wholesalers and retailers who buy the farmers produce were also surveyed. A previous model of decision rules regarding crop location on farm territory was used to analyse the on-farm surveys and cartographic methods (GIS and on-farm manual representations) were used to quantify the land use. We highlight the following major points. (1) The leafy vegetable production in the surveyed farms already intensively uses land: farmers have complex decision rules largely depending on the water dynamics in the two main environments (lowlands and lakesides) where leafy vegetables are cultivated during the dry season. (2) The scarcity of farmers' resources (labour money and water) leads to very little internal room for manoeuvre to increase the leafy vegetable production in the farms. (3) At territorial level however, some land reserve exist in one of the lowlands, but not on lakesides. The water availability for agriculture must be better informed through specialized hydrologic studies, as one of the main constraints nowadays to extend the agricultural area. An extrapolation to other cases of urban agriculture is then discussed as well as the role of agronomy to help urban planners to consider the place of agriculture in the urban development.

Filarial parasites were detected in 23 out of 1,008 total pools. DNA from Dirofilaria immitis, the parasite causing dog heartworm, was detected in Aedes increpitus (MIR=4.62), Aedes sierrensis (MIR=6.72), Anopheles freeborni (MIR=1.08), and Culex tarsalis (MIR=0.10). Setaria yehi, deer body worm, was detected in Ae. sierrensis (MIR=13.42), Anopheles franciscanus (MIR=0.55), An. freeborni (MIR=2.69), and Culex stigmatosoma (MIR=0.41). The avian parasite Splendidofilaria could not be identified to species but was detected in Cx. tarsalis (MIR=0.20). DNA was also detected for three unidentified filarial parasites in Culex. Filarial-positive pools spanned May-August, with Splendidofilaria earlier in the season and S. yehi later. For D. immitis, MIR tended to be highest in June, when the 130 HDU development threshold was reached. Interestingly, D. immitis was also detected prior to the HDU threshold, and D. immitis was not detected August-September, though HDU remained high enough for development. This suggests that there are other factors influencing dog heartworm transmission in the area. Journal of Vector Ecology 47 (1): 61-68. 2022.

Ebullition Regulated by Pressure Variations in a Boreal Pit Lake	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												Methane ebullition from lakes is an important contributor to atmospheric greenhouse gases. However, ebullition is typically sampled at intervals greater than the duration of ebullition events, limiting our understanding of the factors controlling this flux. Here, we present high-frequency ebullition data from a single site in a boreal pit lake during the open-water season between June 24 and 21 October 2018. We record ebullition every 30 min for the first 2 months, and then every minute for the next 2 months. During the 4-month period, 24 ebullition events were recorded. These events generally lasted 2-4 days in response to low atmospheric pressure systems. The peaks in ebullition corresponded to troughs in atmospheric pressure. We provide empirical equations that incorporate a pressure threshold to model the time-series of ebullition events. Minor and gradual variations in mud temperature had no apparent effect on the observed ebullition events.

To date, 59% of Titan's surface has been imaged by radar, with significant regions imaged more than once. Radar data suffer from speckle noise hindering interpretation of small-scale features and comparison of reimaged regions for change detection. We present here a new image analysis technique that combines a denoising algorithm with mapping and quantitative measurements that greatly enhance the utility of the data and offers previously unattainable insights. After validating the technique, we demonstrate the potential improvement in understanding of surface processes on Titan and defining global mapping units, focusing on specific landforms including lakes, dunes, mountains, and fluvial features. Lake shorelines are delineated with greater accuracy. Previously unrecognized dissection by fluvial channels emerges beneath shallow methane cover. Dune wavelengths and interdune extents are more precisely measured. A significant refinement in producing digital elevation models is shown. Interactions of fluvial and aeolian processes with topographic relief is more precisely observed and understood than previously. Benches in bathymetry are observed in northern sea Ligeia Mare. Submerged valleys show similar depth suggesting that they are equilibrated with marine benches. These new observations suggest a liquid level increase in the northern sea, which may be due to changes on seasonal or longer timescales.

Reconstruction of a Pleistocene paleocatena using micromorphology and geochemistry of lake margin paleo-Vertisols, Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania contains a rich record of Pleistocene paleoclimate and paleoenvironment, as well as an abundance of paleontological and archaeological data. The 2.2 Ma of volcaniclastic infill can be divided into time-slices using dated tuffs. Sediments were deposited in a semi-arid, closed rift basin containing a shallow saline alkaline lake until similar to 1.75 Ma. Four trenches in uppermost Bed I sample a similar to 20 ka time-slice between Ng'eju Tuff (base, 1.818 +/- 0.006 Ma) and Tuff IF (top, 1.803 +/- 0.002 Ma). They form a similar to 1 km transect of the lake margin flat that contains both stacked and cumulative paleosols that are interpreted as a heterogeneous paleocatena. Closer to the lake, paleosols are thinner, vertically stacked, and separated by thin tuffs or tufa. Further from the lake margin, there is additional volcaniclastic input, and paleosols are thicker and cumulative. Macroscale and micromorphological features identify these clay-rich paleosols as paleo-Vertisols. Abundant pedogenic slickensides and a variety of ped shapes were observed in the field, as well as micro-ped structures and stress cutans in thin section. Although weakly developed, these paleo-Vertisols also have distinct horizons defined by soil color changes, differing ped shapes, and bulk geochemistry and are indicative of monsoonal precipitation seasonality. Paleosols and parent materials were analyzed for bulk geochemistry of major, rare, and trace elements. Geochemical proxies reveal changing hydrology not definitively identifiable in the field or micromorphology. Molecular weathering ratios show increased weathering, and mass-balance calculations indicate greater translocations (positive and negative) through time. Lower soil moisture due to a drier climate likely created better-drained conditions allowing for increased pedogenesis. The records of FeMn oxides and zeolites precipitated in rhizoliths are further evidence for changing redox conditions and water chemistry. Redox-sensitive elements such as Fe and Mn were mobilized during saturated soil conditions and precipitated during drier conditions. As the hydrology changed due to increased aridity, zeolites precipitated as rhizoliths due to capillary rise and evaporative pumping of saline alkaline water. The fluctuating hydrology identified in the paleo-Vertisols deposited between 1.79 and 1.81 Ma is indicative of a precession cycle and consistent with records from Olduvai Gorge and throughout East Africa. This 20 ka time-slice of the 2 Ma drying trend identified in Africa coincides with the first hominin migrations out of Africa at similar to 1.8 Ma and suggests that hominins were living in a water-stressed environment with annual precipitation seasonality and large variations in precipitation due to precession.

Some taphonomic indicators (absence of polished or abraded bone, similar representation of Voorhies' anatomical groups I and III) show that the anisotropic trend was formed under very low-energy conditions. Anisotropy can be locally produced in autochthonous assemblages. Bone orientation patterns need to be combined with other taphonomic techniques to determine the depositional nature of any given assemblage. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Data were collected from 33 sites in the 2010 dry (April) and wet (July) seasons. Global Moran's I statistics and Local Indicators of Spatial Association were used to characterize the spatial autocorrelation for phytoplankton patterns. The phytoplankton pattern was found to have significant spatial autocorrelation in both seasons. Specifically, the wet season showed more local patterns of richness and more regional evenness patterns. Spatial regression models were carried out to identify environmental factors that would control phytoplankton patterns. Results showed that diversity and composition of phytoplankton were significantly related to nutrients. Also, phytoplankton richness could be predicted by potassium permanganate. No significant relationships were identified between environmental factors and phytoplankton evenness in both seasons. Our study highlighted the importance of incorporating spatial dependence when identifying the explanatory environmental factors for phytoplankton patterns.

Spatial variability of nutrient concentrations, fluxes, and ecosystem metabolism in Nyanza Gulf and Rusinga Channel, Lake Victoria (East Africa)	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Measurements of nutrient concentrations and physicochemical parameters were carried out monthly between March 2005 and March 2006 along a transect between the Nyanza Gulf and the open waters of Lake Victoria to evaluate spatial and seasonal variations in nutrient fluxes and ecosystem metabolism. Nutrient concentration gradients were observed between the deep and seasonally stratifying main lake basin and the large, shallow river-influenced Nyanza Gulf, which are connected by the relatively deep and narrow Rusinga Channel. Nutrient gradients were steepest in the Rusinga Channel where there was always a strong gradient in electrical conductivity. A mixing-box model used to quantify nutrient fluxes and ecosystem metabolism along the gulf and the channel showed that nutrients entering the gulf through river inflows and municipal sources were largely retained in the gulf, with only a small fraction transferred into the main lake. In contrast, the main lake was a net exporter of dissolved inorganic phosphorus to the gulf (110 mg P m(-2) yr(-1)), which is in contrast to the paradigm that the gulf is a major contributor to the increasing nutrient enrichment and, hence, eutrophication of the greater Lake Victoria. The channel had net regeneration of dissolved nutrients indicating net heterotrophy; whereas in the gulf, there was net consumption of dissolved nutrients, resulting in high estimates of net ecosystem production (570 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) and, hence, net autotrophy. Nitrogen balance ranged from +3 to +15 mg N m(-2) d(-1), indicating dominance of nitrogen fixation over denitrification in both the gulf and the channel, which are both well-oxygenated.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				MAY	2013	58	3					774	789		10.4319/lo.2013.58.3.0774	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2013.58.3.0774													WOS:000322491100002

Assessing the spatial and temporal variability and related environmental risks of toxic metals in Lake Asejire, south-western Nigeria	SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN												Lake Asejire in Nigeria is polluted with untreated effluent from nearby aquacultural, urban, agricultural and industrial zones. The metal laden effluent pose a hazard to the health of fish and fish consumers in the lake. This study aimed to (1) assess the spatial and seasonal variations in the levels of cadmium, cobalt, copper, iron, lead, nickel, mercury and zinc in water, sediments and gills and stomach tissues of mud catfish, Clarias gariepinus and Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus; and (2) evaluate environmental risks posed by heavy metals in Lake Asejire. Potential ecological risks of heavy metals were assessed using the pollution loading, geoaccumulation and potential ecological risk indices. Levels of Fe, Co, Cu, Cd, Pb, Ni and Zn were high in water and sediments and in some cases exceeded the Nigerian Standards for Drinking Water Quality and World Health Organisation threshold values. There were significant (p < 0.05) seasonal variations in the levels of all metals in water and sediments. Significantly high Fe, Co, Cd, Pb, Ni and Zn levels recorded in gills and stomach tissues of mud catfish and Nile tilapia relate well with metal levels in water and sediments. The geoaccumulation index reflected heavy Cu and Zn contamination in sediments whereas Cd pose serious ecological risks to aquatic organisms in the lake. Accurate assessment of the spatial and temporal variability of heavy metal levels in Lake Asejire is crucial for pollution control and environmental management. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Exploring the Ecological Coherence between the Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Bacterioplankton in Boreal Lakes	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												One of the major contemporary challenges in microbial ecology has been to discriminate the reactive core from the random, unreactive components of bacterial communities. In previous work we used the spatial abundance distributions of bacterioplankton across boreal lakes of Quebec to group taxa into four distinct categories that reflect either hydrology-mediated dispersal along the aquatic network or environmental selection mechanisms within lakes. Here, we test whether this categorization derived from the spatial distribution of taxa is maintained over time, by analyzing the temporal dynamics of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) within those spatially derived categories along an annual cycle in the oligotrophic lake Croche (Quebec, Canada), and assessing the coherence in the patterns of abundance, occurrence, and environmental range of these OTUs over space and time. We report that the temporal dynamics of most taxa within a single lake are largely coherent with those derived from their spatial distribution over large spatial scales, suggesting that these properties must be intrinsic of particular taxa. We also identified a set of rare taxa cataloged as having a random occupancy based on their spatial distribution, but which showed clear seasonality and abundance peaks along the year, yet these comprised a very small fraction of the total rare OTUs. We conclude that the presence of most rare bacterioplankton taxa in boreal lakes is random, since both their temporal and spatial dynamics suggest links to passive downstream transport and persistence in freshwater networks, rather than environmental selection.					; del Giorgio, Paul/AAD-1315-2019; Ruiz-Gonzalez, Clara/K-7782-2017	Nino-Garcia, Juan Pablo/0000-0003-1610-3998; Ruiz Gonzalez, Clara/0000-0003-3568-4943; del Giorgio, Paul/0000-0003-1866-8159; 														1664-302X				APR 21	2017	8								636	10.3389/fmicb.2017.00636	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.00636								28484431					WOS:000399767300001

DEZA Valasske Mezirici, a coal tar and mixed tar oils processing plant, and Spolana Neratovice, a chemical factory with the history of high production of organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs), were selected as the point sources of PAHs, and OCPs, respectively. Levels of PCBs, OCPs and PAHs were determined for all sampling sites and sampling periods. The study brought useful data about the air concentrations of POPs in the investigated regions. More important, it provided information on the transport and fate of POPs in the vicinity of local sources of contamination useful for the estimation of their influence. Very good capability of passive samplers to reflect temporal and spatial fluctuation in concentrations of persistent organic pollutants in the ambient air was confirmed which makes them applicable for monitoring on the local scale.

Whole-lake nanosilver additions reduce northern pike (Esox lucius) growth	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Nanosilver (AgNP) is an anti-microbial agent widely used in consumer products, with significant potential for these nanoparticles to be released into aquatic environments. Laboratory studies involving short-term exposures of fish to AgNP show a range of toxicological effects, but these studies do not address potential responses in long-lived organisms resulting from chronic exposures. A collaborative study involving additions of AgNP to environmentally relevant concentrations over two field seasons took place at the IISD-Experimental Lakes Area, providing an opportunity to study the impacts of chronic exposures to long-lived fish species. In the present study, we evaluated the abundance and growth of an apex predator, Northern Pike (Esox lucius), collected from Lake 222 before, during and after the AgNP dosing period and compared results to those from a nearby unmanipulated lake (Lake 239). While the abundance of Northern Pike from Lake 222 during the study period was essentially stable, per capita availability of their primary prey species, Yellow Perch (Perca flavescens) declined by over 30%. Northern Pike fork length-and weight-at-age (indices of growth rate) declined following AgNP additions, most notably in age 4 and 5 fish. No similar changes in prey availability or growth were observed in Northern Pike from the reference lake. Body condition did not change in Northern Pike collected from either Lake 222 or Lake 239. Our results indicate that declines in the growth of Northern Pike chronically exposed to AgNP likely resulted from reduced prey availability but direct sublethal effects from AgNP exposure could also have been a factor. The persistence of reduced growth in Northern Pike two years after the cessation of AgNP additions highlight the potential legacy impacts of this contaminant once released into aquatic ecosystems.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				SEP 10	2022	838		2						156219	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156219	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156219		MAY 2022						35623531					WOS:000809640500004

Developing water quality maps of a hyper-saline lake using spatial interpolation methods	SCIENTIA IRANICA												Urmia Lake, the second largest hyper-saline lake in the world, has experienced a significant drop in water level during the last decade. This study was designed to examine the water quality of Urmia Lake and to characterize the spatial heterogeneity and temporal changes of the physiochemical parameters between October 2009 and July 2010. Two spatial interpolation methods, Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) and Ordinary Kriging (OK), were used and compared with each other to derive the spatial distribution of ionic constituents as well as TDS and density along the lake. Results showed that the main dominant cations and anions in Urmia Lake were Na+, Mg++, K+, Ca++, Cl-, SO4--, and HCO3-, respectively. Although water quality of the lake is homogeneous with depth, it differs between the northern and southern parts. Water quality also varies seasonally, determined by river inflows and the lake bathymetry. Moreover, with the present salinity level, salt precipitation is likely in Urmia Lake and is becoming one of the principal factors determining the distribution of solutes within the lake. This study shows that the combined use of temporal and spatial water quality data improves our understanding of complex, large aquatic systems like Urmia Lake.

FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Threats to biodiversity are fostering new collaboration between aquatic ecologists and palaeolimnologists, who have traditionally asked ecological questions on different time scales. While the differences between surface sediment and water column or snapshot sampling are well understood, less so are the consequences of comparing the predominant drivers of aquatic assemblages resulting from these two types of sampling. Using diatom data from the 2007 USEPA National Lakes Assessment (NLA) program (468 lakes), we compared the main environmental and spatial drivers of diatom community composition between samples derived from the water column and surface sediments. We hypothesised that, in explaining community variation across the conterminous United States, the effect of environment would be stronger in diatom assemblages preserved in surface sediments because of the inclusion of benthic members and temporal integration. We used a combination of ordination overlays and variation partitioning to examine differences in community drivers between palaeolimnological (surface sediment) and water column sampling. We found that these two types of sampling were significantly correlated with respect to the drivers of community composition in addition to having congruent patterns of ordination. Congruency between sampling methods further increased when the water column data were temporally integrated and may be explained by variation in seasonally dynamic taxa. To our knowledge, this is the first study that has tested for differences in environmental structuring patterns between palaeolimnological and water column samples using such a highly replicated and landscape-level approach. On the basis of our results, we encourage ecologists to consider the joint analysis of these two types of data sets where data are available.

Higher estrogenic activities were observed in the dry season, and the estrogenic potentials in water samples from Taihu Lake were greater than other river basins. None of the samples from groundwater showed estrogen receptor (ER) agonist activity. The 17 beta-Estradiol (E2) equivalents (EEQs) of water samples in the dry season ranged from 9.41 x 10(-1) to 1.20 x 10(1) ng E2 L-1. In the wet season, EEQs of all the water samples were below the detection limit as 9.00 x 10(1) ng E2 L-1 except for one sample from Huaihe River. The highest contribution of E2 was detected in Yangtze River as 99% of estrogenic activity. Nonylphenol (NP, 100% detection rate) and octylphenol (OP, 100% detection rate) might also be responsible for the estrogenic activities in water sources. Potential health risk induced by the estrogenic chemicals in source water may be posed to the residents through water drinking. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Contributions of Lake-Effect Periods to the Cool-Season Hydroclimate of the Great Salt Lake Basin	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												Although smaller lakes are known to produce lake-effect precipitation, their influence on the precipitation climatology of lake-effect regions remains poorly documented. This study examines the contribution of lake-effect periods (LEPs) to the 1998-2009 cool-season (16 September-15 May) hydroclimate in the region surrounding the Great Salt Lake, a meso-beta-scale hypersaline lake in northern Utah. LEPs are identified subjectively from radar imagery, with precipitation (snow water equivalent) quantified through the disaggregation of daily (i.e., 24 h) Cooperative Observer Program(COOP) and Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) observations using radar-derived precipitation estimates. An evaluation at valley and mountain stations with reliable hourly precipitation gauge observations demonstrates that the disaggregation method works well for estimating precipitation during LEPs. During the study period, LEPs account for up to 8.4% of the total cool-season precipitation in the Great Salt Lake basin, with the largest contribution to the south and east of the Great Salt Lake. The mean monthly distribution of LEP precipitation is bimodal, with a primary maximum from October to November and a secondary maximum from March to April. LEP precipitation is highly variable between cool seasons and is strongly influenced by a small number of intense events. For example, at a lowland (mountain) station in the lake-effect-precipitation belt southeast of the Great Salt Lake, just 12 (13) events produce 50% of the LEP precipitation. Although these results suggest that LEPs contribute modestly to the hydroclimate of the Great Salt Lake basin, infrequent but intense events have a profound impact during some cool seasons.

Due to their long life span, these predators provide us with historic contaminant annals. In this study we tried to test whether lifestyle (free-ranging vs. farm animals) and reproductive age of Morelet's crocodiles in Campeche, Mexico, affect the bioaccumulation of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Subsequently, we tested to see whether their concentration was related to steroid hormones (testosterone and estradiol-17b) levels once normal cyclic hormone variation and reproductive age had been taken into account. From the group of contaminants considered (analyzed as families), only frequency of hexachlorocyclohexanes (PHCH) and PPCB permitted analyses. Whereas there was a greater concentration of PHCH bioaccumulated by free-ranging crocodiles, PPCB was found in equal quantities in free-ranging and farm animals. No difference was observed in relation to reproductive age for any of the contaminants. However, PPCB concentrations were related to testosterone levels among female crocodiles. This androgenic effect of PPCB has not been reported previously. Because testosterone promotes aggressive behavior in vertebrates, excessive aggression during the estrous season, or when female crocodiles should be caring for their young, could result in reproductive failure in Morelet's crocodiles and potential longterm decline of the population.

In the present study, we measured CH4 fluxes in six kinds of littoral zones of Huahu Lake on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in the peak growing season of 2006 and 2007. We found that CH4 efflux (ranging from -0.1 to 90 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) from the littoral zones of this lake was relatively high among those of boreal and temperate lakes. Our results also showed that emergent plant zones (Hippuris vulgarls and Glyceria maxima stands) recorded the highest CH4 flux rate. The CH4 flux in the floating mat zone of Carex muliensis was significantly lower than those of the emergent plant zones. CH4 fluxes in the floating-leaved zone of Polygonum amphibium and bare lakeshore showed no significant difference and ranked last but one, only higher than that of the littoral meadow (Kobresia tibetica). Plant biomass and standing water depths were important factors to explain such spatial variations in CH4 fluxes. No significant temporal variations in CH4 fluxes were found due to the insignificant variations of physical factors in the peak growing season. These results may help in our understanding of the importance of the littoral zone of lakes, especially the emergent plant zone, as a hotspot of CH4 emission. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Introgressive hybridization of human and rodent schistosome parasites in western Kenya	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Hybridization and introgression can have important consequences for the evolution, ecology and epidemiology of pathogenic organisms. We examined the dynamics of hybridization between a trematode parasite of humans, Schistosoma mansoni, and its sister species, S. rodhaini, a rodent parasite, in a natural hybrid zone in western Kenya. Using microsatellite markers, rDNA and mtDNA, we showed that hybrids between the two species occur in nature, are fertile and produce viable offspring through backcrosses with S. mansoni. Averaged across collection sites, individuals of hybrid ancestry comprised 7.2% of all schistosomes collected, which is a large proportion given that one of the parental species, S. rodhaini, comprised only 9.1% of the specimens. No F1 individuals were collected and all hybrids represented backcrosses with S. mansoni that were of the first or successive generations. The direction of introgression appears highly asymmetric, causing unidirectional gene flow from the rodent parasite, S. rodhaini, to the human parasite, S. mansoni. Hybrid occurrence was seasonal and most hybrids were collected during the month of September over a 2-year period, a time when S. rodhaini was also abundant. We also examined the sex ratios and phenotypic differences between the hybrids and parental species, including the number of infective stages produced in the snail host and the time of day the infective stages emerge. No statistical differences were found in any of these characteristics, and most of the hybrids showed an emergence pattern similar to that of S. mansoni. One individual, however, showed a bimodal emergence pattern that was characteristic of both parental species. In conclusion, these species maintain their identity despite hybridization, although introgression may cause important alterations of the biology and epidemiology of schistosomiasis in this region.

The conflict between human and grivet monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops) ranks among the main threats to biodiversity conservation and has become frequent and severe in different parts of Africa. A study on population size and human-grivet monkey conflict in Zegie Peninsula was carried out from August 2019 to March 2020; the study comprised both the wet and dry seasons. The line transect method was used to collect data on the population size of grivet monkeys. Questionnaires and focus group discussions were used to study the human-grivet monkey conflict and its conservation status. Results The estimated population of grivets in the study area was 5046. Population structure of grivets indicated that there were 637 adult males, 1246 adult females, 1839 juveniles, and 1324 infants. The number of grivets in different habitat was; 1925 grivets in agricultural area, 1568 in lakeshore, 988 in forest and 565 grivets in shrub. Grivet population estimate between the wet and dry seasons did not show significant differences (chi(2) = 0.941, df = 1, p > 0.05). But there was a significant difference in the population estimate of grivets among the different habitats (chi(2) = 239.135, df = 3, p < 0.05 and among their age/sex (chi(2) = 504.102, df = 3, p < 0.05. Based on the questionnaire result the most problematic crop pests in the area were grivet monkeys (96.4%), bush pigs (52.3%), porcupine (46.3%) and squirrels cover (33.2%). The result of discussions held with focus groups and questionnaires in the study area showed that grivet monkeys damage crops (98.4%), chicken depredation (49.5%), steal and snatch human food (32%), disturbing communities (11.3%) in the area. Most (62%) of the respondents noted that guava is the most vulnerable crop followed by papaya, mango, avocado to be damaged by grivet monkeys. Conclusion The total number of grivet monkey in the study area is 5046. The number of grivet monkeys varies based on their sex/age and their habitat type. There is no significant difference in their number according to season since the movement of grivets is restricted to the area (there is no migration in the area). The increasing population number leads the occurrence of human grivet monkey conflict in the area and this inversely affects grivet monkeys. There was a human-grivet monkey conflict in the Peninsula and grivets damaged crops, not only crops but also predating poultry, stealing eggs, and human food. Consequently, grivets were killed in response to the damage they caused to crops. Grivet's habitat in the Peninsula is highly disturbed because the local people cut trees for sale to support their livelihood. Awareness creation of the residents about wildlife and their habitat is necessary, and people should understand the impact of deforestation, illegal hunting, and the role of grivets in the ecosystem at large. Hence there is a need to protect the forest in order to ensure sustainable conservation of biodiversity in general and grivet monkeys in particular.					; Mola, Misganaw/ABD-3597-2021; Ejigu, Dessalegn/AGN-9104-2022	Mola, Misganaw/0000-0002-3256-3647; 														2056-3132				MAR 6	2021	6	1							2	10.1186/s40850-021-00066-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40850-021-00066-w								37170341					WOS:000626523900001

Metabolism in a deep hypertrophic aquatic ecosystem with high water-level fluctuations: a decade of records confirms sustained net heterotrophy	PEERJ												Long-term and seasonal changes in production and respiration were surveyed in the Valle de Bravo reservoir, Mexico, in a period during which high water-level fluctuations occurred (2006-2015). We assessed the community metabolism through oxygen dynamics in this monomictic water-body affected by strong diurnal winds. The multiple-year data series allowed relationships with some environmental drivers to be identified, revealing that water level-fluctuations strongly influenced gross primary production and respiratory rates. Production and respiration changed mainly vertically, clearly in relation to light availability. Gross primary production ranged from 0.15 to 1.26 gO(2) m(-2 )h(-1), respiration rate from -0.13 to -0.83 gO(2 )m(-2) h(-1) and net primary production from -0.36 to 0.66 gO(2 )m(-2) h(-1) within the production layer, which had a mean depth of 5.9 m during the stratification periods and of 6.8 m during the circulations. The greater depth of the mixing layer allowed the consumption of oxygen below the production layer even during the stratifications, when it averaged 10.1 m. Respiration below the production layer ranged from -0.23 to -1.38 gO(2 )m(-2) h(-1). Vertically integrated metabolic rates (per unit area) showed their greatest variations at the intra-annual scale (stratification-circulation). Gross primary production and Secchi depth decreased as the mean water level decreased between stratification periods. VB is a highly productive ecosystem; its gross primary production averaged 3.60 gC m(-2) d(-1) during the 10 years sampled, a rate similar to that of hypertrophic systems. About 45% of this production, an annual average net carbon production of 599 g C m(-2) year(-1), was exported to the hypolimnion, but on the average 58% of this net production was recycled through respiration below the production layer. Overall, only 19% of the carbon fixed in VB is buried in the sediments. Total ecosystem respiration rates averaged -6.89 gC M-2 d(-1) during 2006-2015, doubling the gross production rates. The reservoir as a whole exhibited a net heterotrophic balance continuously during the decade sampled, which means it has likely been a net carbon source, potentially releasing an average of 3.29 gC m(-2) d(-1) to the atmosphere. These results are in accordance with recent findings that tropical eutrophic aquatic ecosystems can be stronger carbon sources than would be extrapolated from temperate systems, and can help guide future reassessments on the contribution of tropical lakes and reservoirs to carbon cycles at the global scale. Respiration was positively correlated with temperature both for the stratification periods and among the circulations, suggesting that the contribution of C to the atmosphere may increase as the reservoirs and lakes warm up owing to climate change and as their water level is reduced through intensification of their use as water sources.

J	Winstral, A; Elder, K; Davis, RE				Winstral, A; Elder, K; Davis, RE			Spatial snow modeling of wind-redistributed snow using terrain-based parameters	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												Wind is widely recognized as one of the dominant controls of snow accumulation and distribution in exposed alpine regions. Complex and highly variable wind fields in rugged terrain lead to similarly complex snow distribution fields with areas of no snow adjacent to areas of deep accumulation. Unfortunately, these complexities have limited inclusion of wind redistribution effects in spatial snow distribution models. In this study the difficulties associated with physically exhaustive wind field modeling are avoided and terrain-based parameters are developed to characterize wind effects. One parameter, (Sx) over bar, was based on maximum upwind slopes relative to seasonally averaged winds to characterize the wind scalar at each pixel location in an alpine basin. A second parameter, (Sb) over bar measured upwind breaks in slope from a given location and was combined with an upwind application of (Sx) over bar to create a drift delineator parameter, D(0), which was used to delineate sites of intense redeposition on lee slopes. Based on 504 snow depth samples from a May 1999 survey of the upper Green Lakes Valley, Colorado, the correlation of the developed parameters to the observed snow distribution and the effect of their inclusion in a spatial snow distribution model were quantified. The parameter (Sx) over bar was found to be a significant predictor, accounting for more of the variance in the observed snow depth than could be explained by elevation, solar radiation, or slope. Samples located in D(0)-delineated drift zones were shown to have significantly greater depths than samples located in nondrift zones. A regression tree model of snow distribution based on a predictor variable set of (Sx) over bar, D(0), elevation, solar radiation, and slope explained 8%-23% more variance in the observed snow distribution, and performed noticeably better in unsampled areas of the basin, compared to a regression tree model based on only the latter three predictors.

J	Spielhagen, RF; Tripati, A				Spielhagen, Robert F.; Tripati, Aradhna			Evidence from Svalbard for near-freezing temperatures and climate oscillations in the Arctic during the Paleocene and Eocene	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Until recently, the Arctic was assumed to be characterised by relatively warm conditions throughout the Early Cenozoic. However, recent investigations on deep-sea drilling cores from northern high latitudes, including the Arctic Ocean, give apparently contradicting results. Here we report the intermittent occurrence of certain temperature indicators in the Early Tertiary sedimentary sequence on Svalbard, which may represent the first direct northern high-latitude record of cold water temperatures for the early Cenozoic. Glendonites (calcite pseudomorphs after calcium carbonate hexahydrate) and erratics in otherwise fine-grained sediments require near-freezing temperatures and the presence of at least seasonal sea ice. This succession also contains coal seams and other warm climate indicators, but not on the same stratigraphical levels. These results imply the occurrence of cooling phases episodically during the warm background climate of the Paleocene and Eocene, suggesting that Arctic temperature variability was much greater than previously recognized.

Multivariate analysis was used to study the spatial and temporal variations of the water quality parameters and to determine the origin of the pollution sources. Three regions (low, moderate, and high pollution levels) were determined based on cluster analysis. The stepwise DA mode proposed six parameters (pH, EC, COD, NO3, TC, and Fe) with 75% correct assignations as the most significant water quality parameters to present the spatial variations. In the temporal discrimination, forward stepwise mode analysis showed eight parameters (EC, TUR, BOD, COD, AN, NO3, Cu, and Cr) with 92% correct assignations, while five parameters (EC, AN, Al, Cu, and Cr) affording 89% correct assignations in backward stepwise mode analysis. Principal component analysis and factor analysis were used to investigate the origins of each water quality parameter based on the three clustered regions and successfully yielded eight latent factors loadings for each period that significantly identified the pollution sources and types along the river. The pollution sources for moderate and high pollution level areas are anthropogenic sources (landfill, industrial activities, and sewage discharge). Agricultural runoff is the main pollution source for the low pollution level areas. This study has shown classifications of river water quality based on seasonal and spatial criteria.

However, the long-term spatiotemporal dynamics of different types of surface water bodies and their possible driving factors over large areas remain very limited. Here, we used unprecedented surface water data layers derived from all available Landsat images and further developed two databases on China's lakes and reservoirs larger than 1 km(2) to document and understand the characteristics of changes in different water body types during 2000 to 2019 in China. Our results show that China is dominated by permanent water bodies. The areas of permanent and seasonal water bodies in China increased by 16,631.02 km(2) (16.72%) and 16,994.95 km(2) (25.14%), respectively, between 2000 and 2019, with permanent and seasonal water bodies exhibiting divergent spatial variations. Lakes and artificial reservoirs larger than 1 km(2), which collectively represent a significant proportion of the permanent water bodies in China, displayed net increases of 6884.52 km(2) (10.71%) and 4075.13 km(2) (36.10%), respectively, from 2000 to 2019; these increases accounted for 41.40% and 24.50%, respectively, of the total permanent water body increment. The expanding lakes were mainly distributed on the Tibetan Plateau, whereas the rapidly growing reservoirs were mainly located on the Northeast Plain and Eastern Plain. Statistical analyses indicated that artificial reservoirs were an important factor controlling both permanent and seasonal water body changes in most of provinces. Climate factors, such as precipitation and temperature, were the main influencing factors affecting the changes in different water bodies in the sparsely populated Tibetan Plateau.					; Wu, Chunsheng/HTN-5460-2023	Cui, Baoshan/0000-0002-0830-2295; Wang, Youxiao/0000-0003-3417-0625														2072-4292				MAR	2021	13	6							1154	10.3390/rs13061154	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13061154													WOS:000652001200001

Seroreactivity to Dirofilaria antigens in people from different areas of Serbia	BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES												Background: The Northern part of Serbia is hyperendemic-endemic for canine dirofilarioses. Considering this fact, many human dirofilarial infections could be expected, however only about 30 cases in Serbia have been described until today. Aims of this survey were to assess the people reactivity to the antigens of D. repens and D. immitis and to identify risk factors for the contact exposure. Methods: Investigation included sera taken from 297 people (179 women and 118 men) living in different areas of Serbia (Pancevo, Novi Sad, Zajecar, Leskovac, Vranje, Nis, Pirot). Sera were analysed by means of two indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) home-designed that use as antigens adult somatic/metabolic polyproteins of D. repens (DR) and D. immitis (DI), respectively. The results were elaborated using the statistical method of descriptive and quantitative analysis. Results: Significant differences by area in the reactivity of human sera to dirofilarial antigens were not observed (p = 0.056). A high seroreactivity was demonstrated in people from the towns of northern Serbia (Pancevo = 27,1%; Novi Sad = 16,3%), as well as in people from Zajecar (eastern Serbia = 15,8%) and Vranje (southern Serbia = 15,1%). No differences were evidenced between people reactivity to polyproteins of the two dirofilarial species, nor differences related to the gender of examinees. Factor risks evidenced were: i) place of residence; ii) spending work time outdoors during the mosquito season; iii) spending time outdoors and nearby rivers, lakes, swamps or canals; unespectedly, iv) cat owning. Conclusion: The findings emerging from this investigation indicate that clinicians and public health authorities should pay greater attention to this zoonosis. Continuing education and training of physicians will greatly contribute to the knowledge of the actual impact of filarial worms on animal and public health, and allow for the planning of suitable measures to prevent the infections.					; Ignjatović, Aleksandra/ADB-0192-2022; Popović Dragonjić, Lidija/JZT-8434-2024; Gabrielli, Simona/H-6748-2012	Miladinovic- Tasic, Natasa/0000-0003-4078-4922; Ignjatovic, Aleksandra/0000-0002-2689-8088; Otasevic, Suzana/0000-0002-3377-9247; ARSIC ARSENIJEVIC, VALENTINA/0000-0001-8132-3300; Popovic Dragonjic, Lidija/0000-0003-3294-9803													1471-2334					FEB 8	2014	14								68	10.1186/1471-2334-14-68	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-14-68								24507413					WOS:000331207700001

Grazing rates (filter feeding rates) on 0.5-, 3-, and 6-mu m-diameter particles were measured to estimate pico- and nanoplankton grazing (filter feeding) by micro- and metazooplankton. Among grazers, HNF had a low abundance (< 50 cells mL(-1)) and, due to their low specific filtering rates, they only grazed a minor fraction of the bacterioplankton (<= 4.2% of total grazing). Ciliates were relatively abundant (<= 158 cells mL(-1)) and, considering their high specific feeding rates, were able to graze more than 100% of the bacterial biomass production in the open part of the lake, whereas the average daily grazing accounted for 9.3% of the bacterial standing stock. Ciliates were potentially important grazers of nanoplanktonic organisms (on average, approximately 20% of the standing stock of 3-mu m-size particles was grazed daily). Metazooplankton grazed a minor part of the bacterioplankton, accounting for only 0.1% of standing stock of bacteria. Grazing on nanoplankton (3-6 mu m) by metazooplankton was higher (0.4% of standing stock). The hypothesis is proposed that ciliates dominate due to a lack of top-down regulation by predators, and HNF have a low abundance due to strong grazing pressure by ciliates.

Macrophytes as bioindicators of the physicochemical characteristics of wetlands in lowland and mountain regions of the central Balkan Peninsula	AQUATIC BOTANY												The simultaneous monitoring of vegetation, water and sediments was conducted in wetlands of the central Balkan Peninsula due to the lack of available knowledge on the univariate response of macrophytes along environmental gradients. The environmental preferences and bioindicator potential of macrophytes were assessed using Huisman-Olff-Fresco (HOF) models. Bolboschoenus maritimus and Scirpus lacustris subsp. tabernaemontani are valuable bioindicators of slightly saline (electroconductivity of 2000-4000 S cm(-1) in the sediment) and alkaline habitats that are rich in SO42-. Their ecological niches are partially overlapped. Bolboschoenus maritimus prefers saltier and more alkaline habitats for optimal development. The salinity and alkalinity of habitats are decisive factors in the ecological diversification of the Boloboschoenus species. Bolboschoenus glaucus is adapted to non-saline (400-900 mu S cm(-1)) and slightly alkaline habitats, unlike Bolboschoenus maritimus. Relatively deep, slightly acid waters which are poor in SO42- (0.30 mg/I), and sediments with low values of electroconductivity and K2O (6.8 mg/100 g sediment) are preferred by Typha angustifolia, Sparganium erectum and Typha latifolia. The abundance of Phalaris arundinacea, Scirpus lacustris, Carex riparia and Eleocharis palustris increases when there is a decrease in the amount of nutrients (NH4+, PO43- and SO42-) in the water. Phragmites australis has low indicative value and regional bioindicator potential. The data obtained in the study may serve as a basis for adjusting the existing indicator values of these species and extending indicator systems by defining the indicator values of species with respect to environmental variables which have not yet been considered.

The impacts of drying of Lake Urmia on changes of degree day index of the surrounding cities by meteorological modelling	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The Lake Urmia, the largest lake in Iran and the second largest saline lake in the world, is currently faced with the threat of drying up. In the last two years, it experienced an increase in its water level, leading researchers to compare different situations. In this study, using The Air Pollution Modelling software, two scenarios, one of the lake being full of water and another of the dry lake, were projected in order to simulate changes in energy demand for four cities located in the neighbourhood of the lake. The main results, based on a dry lake scenario, showed a decrease in weather temperature during the cold season and an increase during the hot season, particularly in the day time, in respect of a full level of water in the lake. Because of this, there was an increase in energy demand for cooling degree day (CDD) for daily hours of the hot months and for heating degree day (HDD) demand in the night hours of the cold months. In particular, the overall average annual increase for HDD and CDD in the entire studied area will increase to 140.56 degrees and 105.90 degrees by day, respectively. At the same time, a significant variation of relative humidity in contraposition to temperature will occur; therefore, the thermal comfort conditions of the studied cities are expected to be worse. Finally, future research works must be done to predict the expected energy consumption in the next decades in accordance with the procedure developed.

Sediment Infill of Tropical Floodplain Lakes: Rates, Controls, and Implications for Ecosystem Services	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												Shallow lakes in tropical floodplains provide significant ecosystem services that can be altered by natural and anthropogenic forces. Despite their importance, little is known about the infill patterns and timescales and the magnitude of these changes in tropical floodplain lakes. Here, we present a global meta-analysis of sediment core-derived accumulation rate data for shallow floodplain lakes in tropical lowlands to quantify the timescales of basin infill. Environmental variables (e.g., sediment accumulation rates, bathymetry, surface area) were compiled from the literature or derived from remote sensing imagery, resulting in a database (n = 76 lakes) that includes various lake morphologies. Our results show an exponential increase in sediment accumulation rates in many of these lakes over the past 50 years, which we interpret as a response to growing human populations and deforestation, particularly in topographically steep watersheds with pronounced seasonal rainfall. Over centennial periods, tropical floodplain lakes accumulate sediment faster than many other extratropical lakes. The dataset suggests that complete infill of some tropical floodplain lakes will occur in as little as a few centuries. Our findings also reveal the critical environmental and human factors that influence sediment accumulation patterns and affect ecosystem services in shallow tropical floodplain lakes. These findings have important implications for water and sediment management in low latitude watersheds, many of which are located in densely populated and/or developing nations.					; Domingos-Luz, Leandro/AAM-9527-2020; McGlue, Michael/C-9752-2014; Domingos Luz, Leandro/M-3510-2017; Silva, Aguinaldo/AAK-8581-2021; Bergier, Ivan/H-7514-2013; Lo, Edward/JXM-5064-2024	Bergier, Ivan/0000-0002-1076-8617; Domingos Luz, Leandro/0000-0001-8477-1010; Lo, Edward/0000-0003-3299-4495; 														2296-6463				MAY 19	2022	10								875919	10.3389/feart.2022.875919	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2022.875919													WOS:000805627800001

Using logistic regression, we modelled the distribution of grizzly bear mortalities based on local landscape attributes as well as examining variation among demographic status, seasons, and mortality type. Grizzly bear mortalities were concentrated in three main regions of the CRE: (1) Lake Louise; (2) Banff town site; and (3) Alberta Provincial lands near the Red Deer River. We found no evidence for environmental differences in mortality locations between sexes or seasons, while sub-adult male and legal harvest mortalities were more dispersed than other mortalities. Models describing the relative risk of mortality were positively associated with human access, water, and edge features, while negatively associated with terrain ruggedness and greenness indices. Model predictions fit well with independent data. Overall, relatively little of the landscape was secure from human-caused mortality for grizzly bears. This would be most directly remedied by controlling human access. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A late-glacial lake-effect climate regime and abundant tamarack in the Great Lakes Region, North America	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												A unique regional climate progression, ca 14.2-11.5 cal ka BP, in the eastern Great Lakes region of North America is suggested by subfossil logs, high-resolution C-14 dates, and established proxy records in New York, USA. The progression began with a northern boreal-type climate ca. 14.2-13.1 ka coeval with the expansion of Lake Iroquois, a transition to a southern boreal-type climate similar to 13.1-12.9 ka that coincided with the transition of Lake Iroquois into progressively lower lake levels, and a continuation of the southern boreal-type climate similar to 12.9-11.5 ka. These conditions and changes are evident in the tree rings and relative dominance of tamarack (Larix laricina) and spruce species (Picea spp.) plus the presence of black ash (Fraxinus nigra) as the only thermophilous species. Together they suggest variations in atmospheric moisture levels, surface winds, temperature extremes, and/or an enhanced seasonality over time. Here we propose that the evolution of the glacial Great Lakes and their interactions with ice sheets, meltwater, winds, and regional topography created a regional glacial lake-effect climate, 14.2-11.5 cal ka BP, that was opposite to the established warming Bolling-Allerod-cold Younger Dryas climate progression.

J	Reebs, SG				Reebs, SG			Plasticity of diel and circadian activity rhythms in fishes	REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES												In many fish species, some individuals are diurnal while others are nocturnal. Sometimes, the same individual can be diurnal at first and then switch to nocturnalism, or vice-versa. This review examines the factors that are associated with such plasticity. It covers the breakdown of activity rhythms during migration, spawning, and the parental phase; reversals of activity patterns during ontogeny or from one season to the next; effects of light intensity, temperature, predation risk, shoal size, food availability, and intraspecific competition. Case studies featuring goldfish (Carassius auratus), golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas), lake chub (Couesius plumbeus), salmonids, sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), and parental sticklebacks and cichlids illustrate some of these influences. It is argued that most species have a circadian system but that having such a system does not necessarily imply strict diurnalism or nocturnalism. Rigidity of activity phase seems more common in species, mostly marine, that display behavioral sleep, and for these animals the circadian clock can help maintain the integrity of the sleep period and ensure that its occurrence takes place at that time of day to which the animal's sensory equipment is not as well adapted. However, in other fishes, mostly from freshwater habitats, the circadian clock seems to be used mainly for anticipation of daily events such as the arrival of day, night, or food, and possibly for other abilities such as time-place learning and sun compass orientation, rather than for strict control of activity phase. In these species, various considerations relating to foraging success and predation risk may determine whether the animal is diurnal or nocturnal at any particular time and place.																			0960-3166	1573-5184					2002	12	4					349	371		10.1023/A:1025371804611	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1025371804611													WOS:000184875000001

The type of regulation is important in controlling the residence time, which in turn affects the photosynthesis-respiration balance in the water. This process has a significant impact on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from reservoirs. In this study, seasonal observations were carried out from September 2020 to July 2021 at five artificial reservoirs in the Qiantang River Basin, eastern China, to reveal the characteristics of CO2 emission from the water-air interface of reservoirs with different regulating types. The results showed that the annual average CO2 emission flux of the studied reservoirs varied significantly, ranging from 4.2 to 155 3 mmol m(-2) day(-1) with an average of 48.4 mmol m(-2) day(-1), which also had a significant negative correlation with the hydraulic retention time. While downstream of the dam, the annual average CO2 emission flux was quite high with a range of 105.8 to 543 0 mmol m(-2) day(-1), averaging 381.6 mmol m(2) day(-1). This is mainly due to the release of water with high-concentration CO2 from the bottom of the reservoir. Additionally, using related data of reservoirs around the world, a CO2 emission model with hydraulic retention time, air temperature, and reservoir age as the primary parameters was developed, which was conducive to evaluate reservoir CO2 emissions on a larger scale and provided theoretical support for effective reservoir management.

J	Lister, AM				Lister, AM			The impact of Quaternary Ice Ages on mammalian evolution	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES					Royal-Society Discussion Meeting on the Evolutionary Legacy of the Ice Ages	MAY 21-22, 2003	London, ENGLAND	Royal Soc				The Quaternary was a time of extensive evolution among mammals. Most living species arose at this time, and many of them show adaptations to peculiarly Quaternary environments. The latter include continental northern steppe and tundra, and the formation of lakes and offshore islands. Although some species evolved fixed adaptations to specialist habitats, others developed flexible adaptations enabling them to inhabit broad niches and to survive major environmental changes. Adaptation to short-term (migratory and seasonal) habitat change probably played a part in pre-adapting mammal species to the longer-term cyclical changes of the Quaternary. Fossil evidence indicates that environmental changes of the order of thousands of years have been sufficient to produce subspeciation, but speciation has typically required one hundred thousand to a few hundred thousand years, although there are both shorter and longer exceptions. The persistence of taxa in environments imposing strong selective regimes may have been important in forcing major adaptive change. Individual Milankovitch cycles are not necessarily implicated in this process, but nor did they generally inhibit evolutionary change among mammals: many evolutionary divergences built over multiple climatic cycles. Deduction of speciation timing requires input from fossils and modern phenotypic and breeding data, to complement and constrain mitochondrial DNA coalescence dates which appear commonly to overestimate taxic divergence dates and durations of speciation. Migrational and evolutionary responses to climate change are not mutually exclusive but, on the contrary, may be synergistic. Finally, preliminary analysis suggests that faunal turnover, including an important element of speciation, was elevated in the Quaternary compared with the Neogene, at least in some biomes. Macroevolutionary species selection or sorting has apparently resulted in a modern mammalian fauna enriched with fast-reproducing and/or adaptively generalist species.

The Three Gorges Dam was built on the Yangtze River in China, the world's third longest river, and impounded the famous Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR). In this study, we analyzed total nitrogen (TN) concentrations and inflow data from 2003 till 2010 for the main upstream tributaries of the TGR that contribute about 82% of the TGR's total inflow. We used time series analysis for seasonal decomposition of TN concentrations and used non-parametric statistical tests (Kruskal-Walli H, Mann-Whitney U) as well as base flow segmentation to analyze significant spatial and temporal patterns of TN pollution input into the TGR. Our results show that TN concentrations had significant spatial heterogeneity across the study area (Tuo River> Yangtze River> Wu River> Min River> Jialing River> Jinsha River). Furthermore, we derived apparent seasonal changes in three out of five upstream tributaries of the TGR rivers (Kruskal-Walli H rho = 0.009, 0.030 and 0.029 for Tuo River, Jinsha River and Min River in sequence). TN pollution from non-point sources in the upstream tributaries accounted for 68.9% of the total TN input into the TGR. Non-point source pollution of TN revealed increasing trends for 4 out of five upstream tributaries of the TGR. Land use/cover and soil type were identified as the dominant driving factors for the spatial distribution of TN. Intensifying agriculture and increasing urbanization in the upstream catchments of the TGR were the main driving factors for non-point source pollution of TN increase from 2003 till 2010. Land use and land cover management as well as chemical fertilizer use restriction were needed to overcome the threats of increasing TN pollution.

The algorithm is based on direct nonlinear least squares fitting of radiances from the spectral range 319.0-347.5 nm. Radiances are modeled from the solar irradiance, attenuated by contributions from BrO and interfering gases, and including rotational Raman scattering, additive and multiplicative closure polynomials, correction for Nyquist undersampling and the average fitting residual spectrum. The retrieval uses albedo- and wavelength-dependent air mass factors (AMFs), which have been pre-computed using a single mostly stratospheric BrO profile. The BrO cross sections are multiplied by the wavelength-dependent AMFs before fitting so that the vertical column densities (VCDs) are retrieved directly. The fitting uncertainties of BrO VCDs typically vary between 4 and 7 x 10(12) molecules cm(-2) (similar to 10 %20 % of the measured BrO VCDs). Additional fitting uncertainties can be caused by the interferences from O-2-O-2 and H2CO and their correlation with BrO. AMF uncertainties are estimated to be around 10 % when the single stratosphericonly BrO profile is used. However, under conditions of high tropospheric concentrations, AMF errors due to this assumption of profile can be as high as 50 %. The retrievals agree well with GOME-2 observations at simultaneous nadir overpasses and with ground-based zenith-sky measurements at Harestua, Norway, with mean biases less than -0.22 +/- 1.13 x 10(13) and 0.12 +/- 0.76 x 10(13) molecules cm(-2), respectively. Global distribution and seasonal variation of OMI BrO are generally consistent with previous satellite observations. Finally, we confirm the capacity of OMBRO retrievals to observe enhancements of BrO over the US Great Salt Lake despite the current retrieval setup considering a stratospheric profile in the AMF calculations. OMBRO retrievals also show significant BrO enhancements from the eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano, although the BrO retrievals are affected under high SO2 loading conditions by the sub-optimum choice of SO2 cross sections.					; kurosu, thomas/F-8040-2013; Suleiman, Raid/AAD-1349-2019; LIu, Xiong/P-7186-2014; Liu, Xiong/P-7186-2014	Gonzalez Abad, Gonzalo/0000-0002-8090-6480; Suleiman, Ph.D., Raid M/0000-0003-1937-1189; LIu, Xiong/0000-0003-2939-574X; 													1867-1381	1867-8548				APR 4	2019	12	4					2067	2084		10.5194/amt-12-2067-2019	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-2067-2019													WOS:000463379600001

Several coarser sediment layers among which the two younger ones are of pyroclastic origin interrupt the fine clayey sediment of the core. The detailed chronology of the core supported by 24 radiocarbon C-14 dates and proxies data results revealed an erosive phase registered in the sedimentary column from 2200 to 1500 cal BP. The diatom ecological groups suggest that between 4100 and 2800 cal yrs BP, the lake level was much higher than after corresponding to a relatively greater precipitation minus evaporation (P E) ratio, as well as increased runoff in the lake catchment. These conditions were favourable to the development of C3 plants in the lake catchment as indicated by lower delta C-13 values and higher C/N ratios than after. This hydrological phase is also characterized by eutrophic, turbid and probably circum-neutral to alkaline waters. After this episode, higher delta C-13 values between 2800 and 2500 cal BP suggest increased water use efficiency of terrestrial plants and/or potentially more C4 plant debris input into the lake: an indication of savannas patches developing, due probably to changes in the rainfall distribution. Marked lake-level declines are recorded at 2500, 2200-2100, and at 1400-1000 cal yrs BP. These low-stands are characterized by higher inputs of windblown diatoms (up to 4.2%) than before, which confirms that the NE trade-winds were strengthening. This corresponds primarily to a reduction in the P E ratio, but probably also to greater inter-annual or seasonal variability when drier periods or seasons became more prolonged and intense than previously. Consequently, savannas were maintained as suggested by relatively higher than before delta C-13 values, as well as independently supported by regional pollen data. After 1000 cal BP, the lake-level rose towards sub-modern conditions, with a deep neutral and eutrophic water column. Carbon stable isotopes suggest a reduction of organic matter input, while savannas were maintained despite the return to more humid conditions. The trends of climatic changes observed in the Lake Tizong reveal the variability in timing, magnitude and regional extent of known climatic events. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, understanding the sources of anthropogenic REEs in urban regions has been the focus of current studies. Here, we present the dissolved REE characteristics of a typical urban river in a megacity region during the wet season. The contents of total REE (& sum;REE) varied from 2.84-89.49 ng L-1, and heavy REEs were enriched relative to light REEs (LREEs). Furthermore, a buffer zone within 3 km was established along the river to avoid the influence of upper land use variations on lower reach measurements and also to identify the origins of anthropogenic REEs via the relationships between land use proportions and REEs. Pronouncedly positive Gd anomalies of 1.41-51.22 in all river samples were revealed by normalization via the Post-Archean Australian Shale (PAAS). A three-dimensional (3D) tracing system was set up among anthropogenic Gd (Gd-anth) and two conventional ion ratios (NO3-/Na+, Cl-/Na+), which accurately obtained the impacts from the sewage treatment plant, industrial emissions, and urban sewage in the study region. Hence, more attention should be paid to the quantitative assessments of Gd-anth in megacity rivers.

A small native predator reduces reproductive success of a large invasive fish as revealed by whole-lake experiments	PLOS ONE												The extent to which native fish communities might control the success of invasive fish has been of interest to ecologists, but it has been rarely addressed using experiments. We conducted an experiment in six small lakes in the Upper Mississippi Region to test the effects of a small native predator, bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) on the recruitment of a large, invasive fish, the common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Bluegills are predominant throughout the region and were previously shown to consume carp eggs and larvae. We stocked both lakes at each of our 3 sites with adult carp (spawners) and one lake at each site with bluegills. We repeated the experiment at two of the three sites for two consecutive years. In each lake we assessed the abundance of post-larval carp one month after spawning (backpack electrofishing surveys) and at the end of the season (mark-recapture). For each site/year combination, catch rate of post-larval carp was typically an order of magnitude higher in control than bluegill lakes, but it often declined quickly over time. The abundance of end-of-seasonal juveniles was significantly higher (no 95% CI overlap) in control lakes than in bluegill lakes, except for one pair of lakes during one year when both the control and bluegill lake had similar, low abundance of end-of-season carp. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that common carp recruitment is substantially reduced in habitats dominated by bluegills. We also suggest our results may be applicable to other species, and that managers should explore how predation on early life stages may control other invasive species.																			1932-6203					APR 3	2019	14	4							e0214009	10.1371/journal.pone.0214009	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0214009								30943222					WOS:000463194300029

Seasonal variation in phytoplankton and aquatic plants in floodplain lakes (lower Vistula River, Poland)	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The study focused on three oxbow lakes which have been isolated from the water of the Vistula River for several years. The diversity of phytoplankton communities was observed biweekly in the growing season (April-October), both in the three floodplain lakes along the lower Vistula River (northern Poland) and in the main current of the river. The water level in the Vistula River remained low, so the lakes were not filled with the surface water of the river. Different phytoplankton communities occurred in the studied lakes compared to the Vistula River. The phytoplankton in the oxbow lakes consisted mainly of small unicellular and colonial flagellates: Cryptomonas, Chlamydomonas, Trachelomonas, and Dinobryon. During the limnophase, only 2-3 species co-dominated, and the reservoirs were in a stable water conditions. The river phytoplankton had both higher diversity and higher abundance compared to the floodplain lakes. In total, 4-8 species co-dominated in the river, usually Chlorococcales and diatoms. The floodplain lakes were characterized by unexpected differences in the quality, quantity, and dynamics of planktonic algae. The differences were strictly associated with the occurrence of macrophytes. During the limnophase, the investigated oxbow lakes were also diversified in terms of colonizing plant communities. Different types of vegetation-free floating plants (W-1 lake), communities of submerged macrophytes, free floating plants and algal mats detached from the bottom (W-2 lake), and submerged macrophytes (Ma lake), affected the development of the microflora to a varying extent.

Bacterial epibionts have been inferred to display diverse functions of biogeochemical significance: N-fixation and other redox reactions, phosphorus accumulation, and organic degradation. Here, we report taxonomic diversity of eukaryotic and prokaryotic epibionts and diversity of genes associated with materials cycling in a Cladophora metagenome sampled from Lake Mendota, Dane Co., WI, USA, during the growing season of 2012. A total of 1,060 distinct 16S, 173 18S, and 351 28S rRNA operational taxonomic units, from which > 220 genera or species of bacteria (similar to 60), protists (similar to 80), fungi (6), and microscopic metazoa (similar to 80), were distinguished with the use of reference databases. We inferred the presence of several algal taxa generally associated with marine systems and detected Jaoa, a freshwater periphytic ulvophyte previously thought endemic to China. We identified six distinct nifH gene sequences marking nitrogen fixation, > 25 bacterial and eukaryotic cellulases relevant to sedimentary C-cycling and technological applications, and genes encoding enzymes in aerobic and anaerobic pathways for vitamin B-12 biosynthesis. These results emphasize the importance of Cladophora in providing habitat for microscopic metazoa, fungi, protists, and bacteria that are often inconspicuous, yet play important roles in ecosystem biogeochemistry.					; Zulkifly, Shahrizim/AFD-1423-2022	Zulkifly, Shahrizim/0000-0001-7809-6469; Knack, Jennifer/0000-0003-1252-1092													0022-3646	1529-8817				JUN	2015	51	3					408	418		10.1111/jpy.12296	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpy.12296								26986658					WOS:000356627000002

Variability of Prokaryotic Community Structure in a Drinking Water Reservoir (Marathonas, Greece)	MICROBES AND ENVIRONMENTS												The structure of the Bacteria and Archaea community in a large drinking water reservoir (Marathonas, Greece; MR) was investigated in October 2007 and September 2008, using 16S rRNA gene clone libraries. The bacterial communities were more diverse than archaeal communities (Shannon diversity index H' 0.81-3.28 and 1.36-1.77, respectively). The overall bacterial community composition was comparable to bacterioplankton community described in other freshwater habitats. Within the Bacteria, Betaproteobacteria dominated, while representatives of Alpha-, Gamma- and Deltaproteobacteria also occurred. Other important phyla were Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes, while representatives of Acidobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes and Verrucomicrobia were also retrieved. Several phylotypes in Alpha-and Betaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were related to bacteria capable of cyanotoxin degradation and with aromatic compounds/iron oxidizers or polymer degraders. Euryarchaeota dominated (60.5%) the Archaea community mostly with phylotypes related to Methanobacteriales and Methanosarcinales. Among the Thaumarchaeota, the two most abundant phylotypes were affiliated (97% similarity) with the only cultivated mesophilic thaumarchaeote of marine origin, Nitrosopumilus maritimus. Temporal and spatial comparison of the prokaryotic community structure revealed that three of the most abundant prokaryotic phylotypes, belonging to Actinobacteria, were recovered from all sites both years, suggesting that these Actinobacteria could be important key players in MR ecosystem functioning.

A biogenic origin for anomalous fine-grained magnetic material at the Paleocene-Eocene boundary at Wilson Lake, New Jersey	PALEOCEANOGRAPHY												The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, which occurred similar to 55.5 Ma, was caused by a massive release of carbon, as indicated by an similar to 3% negative carbon isotope excursion recorded in the marine, atmospheric, and terrestrial reservoirs. One suggested source for the carbon, a cometary impactor, is based on the sudden appearance and high concentration of single-domain (SD) magnetite in Paleocene-Eocene (P-E) boundary cores from the North Atlantic continental margin. We evaluate the potential sources of SD magnetite at the P-E boundary by presenting new magnetic hysteresis, low-temperature magnetic remanence, and transmission electron microscopy data from the North Atlantic coastal ocean. Our results show a similar increase in SD material but demonstrate that the magnetic material has a biogenic origin. These findings indicate that the high concentrations of SD magnetite immediately above the P-E boundary are the result of unusual accumulations and/or preservation of magnetotactic bacteria. Such bacteria typically occupy the oxic-anoxic transition zone near the sediment-water interface or in the water column. The high abundances of SD magnetite in sediments from across the shelf may be an artifact of nonsteady state redox conditions and exceptional preservation of SD magnetite. It may also indicate that the oxic-anoxic redox boundary shifted into the water column. The latter explanation implies transient eutrophy of the coastal ocean in this region, most likely due to seasonally enhanced runoff, and increased stratification and nutrient loading.					; Zachos, James/A-7674-2008	Lippert, Peter C/0000-0003-1744-9982; Zachos, James/0000-0001-8439-1886													0883-8305	1944-9186				DEC 5	2007	22	4							PA4104	10.1029/2007PA001471	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2007PA001471													WOS:000251528900002

The geomorphic role of large wood in the coastal zone: Mobilization threshold and beach morphology impacts in the North American Great Lakes	GEOMORPHOLOGY												While large wood has been extensively studied in fluvial settings, where it functions as a key component of both physical and biological systems, the role of large wood in the shoreline-nearshore zone has received little attention to date. To address this gap, we examined large wood as a geomorphic agent along an eroding beach shoreline of southwestern Lake Michigan using high-resolution orthoimagery and DEM datasets. Erosion of the site and the liberation of woody materials from the strand were enhanced by rising lake levels. We digitized positions and evaluated the physical characteristics of 2627 pieces of large wood from 5 aerial images (2009-2017) and 11 seasonal drone surveys (2018-2020). This high temporal data resolution allowed us to track 374 unique pieces of large wood over time, revealing common transport pathways and sedimentary impacts of large wood along a wave-dominated beach shoreline. Results indicate that, while large wood has local, transient impacts on beach geomorphology, its presence has little bearing on longer-term beach evolutionary trajectories. Large wood offers little natural shoreline protection along high energy, dynamic shorelines, but may promote backshore accretion and foredune growth under other hydrodynamic and sediment-supply conditions. Our analysis of decadal shoreline evolution reinforces the importance of antecedent topography and coastal habitat elevation as primary controls on rates of shoreline recession.

Model-based Comparisons of the Abundance Dynamics of Bacterial Communities in Two Lakes	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Lake Lanier (Georgia, USA) is home to more than 11,000 microbial Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), many of which exhibit clear annual abundance patterns. To assess the dynamics of this microbial community, we collected time series data of 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequences, recovered from 29 planktonic shotgun metagenomic datasets. Based on these data, we constructed a dynamic mathematical model of bacterial interactions in the lake and used it to analyze changes in the abundances of OTUs. The model accounts for interactions among 14 sub-communities (SCs), which are composed of OTUs blooming at the same time of the year, and three environmental factors. It captures the seasonal variations in abundances of the SCs quite well. Simulation results suggest that changes in water temperature affect the various SCs differentially and that the timing of perturbations is critical. We compared the model results with published results from Lake Mendota (Wisconsin, USA). These comparative analyses between lakes in two very different geographical locations revealed substantially more cooperation and less competition among species in the warmer Lake Lanier than in Lake Mendota.

Phosphorus sequestration in Fe-rich sediments from two Brazilian tropical reservoirs	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												This study investigates the important role of Fe-oxide/hydroxide-rich bottom sediments, from two Brazilian tropical reservoirs, on P sequestration from the overlying waters, which decreases the risk of eutrophication. Data on P fractionation indicates that P adsorption capacity of sediments is predominantly associated with Fe, followed by orthosphosphate adsorbed onto Al hydr(oxides) and onto different forms of apatite (Ca-P). The soluble and loosely bound P-forms are low. To have a better understanding of the role of Fe oxides on the adsorption and sequestration of P in the reservoirs, data obtained by sequential extraction of P have been related to concentrations of total Fe and of various Fe-fractions extracted through an optimized fractionation scheme. These analyses indicated high levels of Fe bound to oxides/hydroxides. These mineral oxides, and the preponderance of pH-dependent charged clay minerals (kaolinite) in the clay fraction, induce the sequestration of the P entering the lakes, mainly in particulate form, by strong retention of PO43- through surface adsorption and precipitation phenomena. Phosphorus-retention provided by the replacement of OH- groups on the basal plane of the minerals, for P anions, decreases the negative impact of P inputs in these water systems. There is significant correlation between the concentrations of soluble reactive P in the water (SRP) and major chemical components of sediments (SiO2, Fe2O3, Al2O3, K2O, P2O5), which are related to the dominant bedrock geology. The interaction of SRP with bed-sediments and the chemical conditions of the environment (decrease of redox potential with depth and, in the dry period, a low O-2 abundance), can explain fluctuations of SRP and TP (total P) in the water column. Due to the dynamic equilibrium in the sediment-water interface, in the dry season, reducing conditions in hypoliminia enhance the reduction of Fe(III) to the more soluble Fe(II) with subsequent release of the strongly retained P. This mechanism increases the soluble P fraction in sediments and the soluble reactive P in the water column, in this period. The straight linkage between geochemical properties of sediments and P concentration in the water column reported in this article suggests that study of the mineralogical and geochemical composition of bottom sediments could help to improve model predictions of P concentrations in surface waters.

One hundred and forty-five cormorants were captured from 14 nesting colonies across the Great Lakes area and fitted with satellite transmitters. We first tested the hypotheses that sexual segregation, density-dependent effects, and the intensity of management operations influenced home range size during the breeding season. The influence of these factors appeared to be limited in part due to random variability in foraging and dispersal decisions at individual and colony levels. We also designed a statistical framework to investigate the degree and determinants of migratory connectivity. Our analyses revealed a significant migratory connectivity in cormorants, although we also observed a nonnegligible amount of individual variability and flexibility. Our data were most consistent with the existence of a migratory divide across the Great Lakes, with western populations using mainly the Mississippi Flyway and eastern populations the Atlantic Flyway. Previous and current studies suggest that the divide cannot be explained by past divergence in isolation, a way to diminish travel cost, or the Appalachians constituting an ecological barrier per se but is rather the consequence of the distribution of suitable stopover and nonbreeding areas. However, a parallel migration system and no migratory divide could not be entirely ruled out with present data.					; Guillaumet, Alban/MVW-5830-2025; Wang, Guiming/O-8925-2019; Bowman, Jeff/B-4147-2009; Wang, Guiming/E-4582-2011; Dorr, Brian/AAX-9033-2020	Guillaumet, Alban/0000-0002-1021-7807; Bowman, Jeff/0000-0002-1892-4469; Wang, Guiming/0000-0001-5002-0120; Taylor, Jimmy/0000-0001-6574-9686; Dorr, Brian/0000-0001-6857-8560													1045-2249	1465-7279				SEP-OCT	2011	22	5					1096	1103		10.1093/beheco/arr096	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/beheco/arr096													WOS:000294358400028

Andrea			Four decades of lake surface temperature in the Northwest Territories, Canada, using a lake-specific satellite-derived dataset	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: This study analyzed lake surface temperature (LST) trends and spatial distribution across 535 predominantly small to medium lakes across the North Slave Region (NSR) of the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada. Study focus: The NWT is characterized by a vast number of lakes covering a significant portion of its spatial extent. However, there is limited knowledge of how LST responds to climate warming in this region. To address this, LST was analyzed in four distinct periods: open water season (OW), ice cover season (IC), and the transitional months of May (TM) and October (TO). LSTs from 1984 to 2021 were retrieved from a lake-specific satellite-derived LST dataset (North Slave LST). LST trend distribution and relationships were analyzed using the Mann-Kendall test and a multilinear regression model. New hydrological insights: The analysis revealed an overall increase in LST, with average rates (max) of 0.03 degrees C/year (0.05 degrees C/year), 0.03 degrees C/year (0.06 degrees C/year), and 0.13 degrees C/year (0.27 degrees C/ year) for OW, TM, and TO, respectively accross study lakes. A faster rate of change was observed in October compared to other periods. Results indicated significant increases in LST for 411 lakes (77%) during OW, 418 lakes (78%) during TO, and 490 lakes (92%) during TM.

Recent work suggests that diversification can provide multiple benefits simultaneously, but empirical evidence of relationships between catch or crop diversification and the provision of multiple benefits is scarce. The effect of diversification on multiple benefits may vary temporally and among systems. Using long-term (11-54years) capture fishery statistics from five Japanese lakes, we examined whether catch diversity increased multiple benefits, including revenue, nitrogen and phosphorus removal, and seasonal commercial species diversity. We also assessed whether catch species diversity increased the stability of each benefit via a portfolio effect (PE). Our study revealed positive relationships between catch diversity and the bundle of benefits (the mean of all normalized benefits; i.e., the provisioning of multiple benefits) in all five lakes, even after controlling for the total catch. The effects of catch diversity on individual benefits were positive or insignificant and differed among the study lakes. These differences were likely caused by the range and variation of functional characteristics among catch species. The influence of the annual mean price on revenue suggested that market forces did have an effect. We also found that aggregated revenue as well as N and P removal were 1.6-2.1 times (four lakes), 1.5-2.2 times (four lakes), and 1.4-2.2 times (all five lakes) more stable, respectively, than would be expected if only a single species were harvested. This greater stability suggests that maintaining catch species diversity may increase the stability of multiple benefits through PEs. Synthesis and applications. Our analysis suggests that catch diversification has great potential to increase the magnitude and stability of multiple benefits. Although total catch alone was sufficient to provide multiple benefits, a goal of maximization with specialization may decrease stability and deplete resources. Under fluctuating environmental and economic conditions, diversification strategies promise to be a potential management option for achieving resilient and sustainable inland fisheries.

This time-series study used sediment traps to estimate the spatiotemporal changes in sedimentation and resuspension rates, during the four seasonal continuous deployment periods, in the littoral zone of Lake Taihu. The effect of sedimentation processes on nutrient accumulation was also investigated. Results showed that the sedimentation rates at six observation sites were highly variable, with gross sedimentation rates ranging from 184.83 to 2150.74gm(-2)day(-1). Almost 88% of the total observed sedimentation originated from sediment resuspension. Cyanobacterial blooms coupled with the frequently changeable wind conditions in the littoral zone, were the key factors in lacustrine sediment redistribution and a large pool of organic material accumulated during cyanobacterial blooms. Moreover, the contribution of resuspended total phosphorous and total nitrogen to the water column, were 0.22mgL(-1) and 0.46mgL(-1), respectively. The high rate of rapid nutrient cycling observed at the sediment water interface due to resuspension, may be a key factor in maintaining eutrophication in large and shallow lakes, which is of high relevance to the future management of aquatic ecosystems.

Geomorphological prospections and archeological excavations are performed in this area since 2011. So far the research allowed an understanding of the valley geometry and the establishment of a robust chronostratigraphical framework based on OSL and radiocarbon dating. The richness of the archeological data allows the development of a geoarcheological approach. However, the sedimentary archive of the valley constrains our research on the Pleistocene period. Since 2016, the study of a temporary affluent of the Faleme River made it possible to analyze well-preserved Recent Holocene sediments. The methodology includes field work to recognize the geomorphological forms and formations observed in the ravine during the dry season. The field and laboratory work led on the sediment of two alluvial terraces allocated to the two last ka, allow us to understand the palaeoenvironmental evolution that affect this area. They highlight morphogenesis rhythms mainly driven by climate change. Thus the population who occupied the area study during that period have been exposed to a significant environmental variability, which likely affected their practice. In turn, the sedimentary accumulation seems to have been partly controlled by the intensification of pastoral and agricultural activity in the valley. These sedimentary records provide a new milestone in the evolution of Environment/Society interactions during the Late Holocene in an area that still has few comparable studies.

Age and growth of diadromous Galaxias maculatus (Jenyns, 1842) in southernmost South America (54A° S) including contribution of age classes to reproduction	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												The population of Galaxias maculatus studied here, Arroyo Negro (54A degrees S), is located at the southern extreme of the species distribution. This is the first work on growth and other life history traits of a Fueguian diadromous population based on otoliths study. This species is part of the native fish fauna of Patagonia. Furthermore, studies on the growth and reproduction of G. maculatus in South America mostly refer to freshwater populations of Andean-Patagonian lakes and rivers (about 41A degrees S). Size cohorts were studied; age and growth parameters were estimated, the latter using the VBGM. Four size cohorts were established, and 3+ was determined as maximum age class. No differences were found in growth curves between males and females. The 1+ age class was by far not only the most numerous in the population but also the most represented in the reproductive population. The relation between mean TL and latitude was positive (r = 0.62) for South American populations; however, further studies are needed to determine whether it is this population's life strategy, the local adaptation of a peripheral population or countergradient growth. The results are interpreted in the context of the information available for other populations, and provide important information about the plasticity in life history traits of this species.

Growth rate and condition of walleye (Sander vitreus), sauger (Sander canadensis), and dwarf walleye in a large Canadian lake	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The second largest inland walleye (Sander vitreus (Mitchill, 1818)) and sauger (Sander canadensis (Griffith and Smith, 1834)) fishery in Canada is found in Lake Winnipeg, Manitoba. To manage the fishery fora sustainable future, the growth and condition of these fish must be understood. Objectives were to (1) examine baseline growth and condition of walleye and sauger in Lake Winnipeg, (2) evaluate variation between the North and South basins, and (3) contribute observational findings on the distribution of dwarf walleye. Gill nets were set to catch walleye, sauger, and dwarf walleye throughout both basins at various locations and in all seasons during 2010 and 2011. North Basin walleye and sauger had higher growth rates and condition relative to the South Basin. This may be due to differential exploitation rates or diets such as the consumption of invasive rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax (Mitchell, 1814)) in the North Basin and not in the South Basin. Dwarf walleye were observed more frequently in the South Basin than in the North Basin. Overall, this study provides important baseline data on the growth and condition of walleye and sauger populations prior to invasion of the spiny waterflea (Bythotrephes iongimanus Leydig, 1860) and zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas, 1771)).																			0008-4301	1480-3283				JUL	2018	96	7					739	747		10.1139/cjz-2017-0276	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2017-0276													WOS:000440938400011

Temperature, recreational fishing and diapause egg connections: dispersal of spiny water fleas (Bythotrephes longimanus)	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												The spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus) is spreading from Great Lakes coastal waters into northern inland lakes within a northern temperature-defined latitudinal band. Colonization of Great Lakes coastal embayments is assisted by winds and seiche surges, yet rapid inland expansion across the northern states comes through an overland process. The lack of invasions at Isle Royale National Park contrasts with rapid expansion on the nearby Keweenaw Peninsula. Both regions have comparable geology, lake density, and fauna, but differ in recreational fishing boat access, visitation, and containment measures. Tail spines protect Bythotrephes against young of the year, but not larger fish, yet the unusual thick-shelled diapausing eggs can pass through fish guts in viable condition. Sediment traps illustrate how fish spread diapausing eggs across lakes in fecal pellets. Trillions of diapausing eggs are produced per year in Lake Michigan and billions per year in Lake Michigamme, a large inland lake. Dispersal by recreational fishing is linked to use of baitfish, diapausing eggs defecated into live wells and bait buckets, and Bythothephes snagged on fishing line, anchor ropes, and minnow seines. Relatively simple measures, such as on-site rinsing of live wells, restricting transfer of certain baitfish species, or holding baitfish for 24 h (defecation period), should greatly reduce dispersal.

Here we use Hg isotope ratios to decipher Hg sources accumulated into bivalves by conducting field studies and in situ experiments. In the first part of this study, we characterized Hg isotope ratios in individual geochemical fractions of riverine sediment, contaminated by liquid Hg in South Korea (Hyeongsan River; HS). Asian clams (Corbicula fluminea) were then deployed at the contaminated sites to evaluate the isotopic turnover. Over the two-month period, the isotope ratios of the clams shifted toward the labile/exchangeable Hg pools (F1, F2 fractions) of the sediment. Conversely, in the control site where sediment Hg is low, we observed similar Hg isotope ratios between Asian clams and the samples of precipitation and dissolved phase of water column. In East Fork Poplar Creek, (Oak Ridge) U.S., Asian clams also displayed similar Hg isotope ratios with the dissolved phase of water column, which have undergone substantial in-stream processing or input from Hg-contaminated groundwater from the hyporheic zones and riparian tributary during high hydrologic flow seasons. Our study demonstrates that the dissolved Hg phases within the water column, whether originating via sediment diffusion or derived externally, act as the primary source and exposure pathways to bivalves. The results of our study also shed new light to the prior Hg isotope measurement in bivalves collected from estuarine, lake, and coastal systems, which showed significant isotopic deviation from bulk sediment. The fact that bivalves are sensitive to in situ and external dissolved Hg phases provides additional insight into the existing biomonitoring program, which uses bivalves as a bioindicator for sediment quality.

To improve this estimate, knowledge regarding underexplored ecosystems, particularly deep lakes and reservoirs in Asian monsoon regions, is needed because the magnitude of methane emissions is influenced by lake bathymetry and climatic conditions. We conducted long-term studies beginning in 2004 at Feitsui Reservoir (FTR) in Taiwan, a subtropical monomictic system with a maximum depth of 120 m to monitor seasonal and interannual variations of three key characteristics and to understand the mechanisms underlying these variations. Key characteristics investigated were as follows: (1) the balance of primary production and heterotrophic respiration as a determinant of vertical oxygen distribution, (2) methane production at the bottom of the reservoir, oxidation in the water column, and emissions from the lake surface, and (3) the contribution of methane-originated carbon to the pelagic food web through methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB). This review highlights major achievements from FTR studies integrating isotopic, microbial, and modeling approaches. Based on our findings, we proposed two conceptual models: (1) a model of methane dynamics, which addresses the differences in methane emission mechanisms between deep and shallow lakes, and (2) a spatially explicit model linking benthic methane production to the pelagic food web, which addresses the diversity of MOB metabolisms and their dependence on oxygen availability. Finally, we address why long-term studies of subtropical lakes and reservoirs are important for better understanding the effects of climate on low- to mid-latitude ecosystems.

However, little is known regarding the environmental setting associated with the fauna, and a general lack of detailed paleoclimate data exists for the late Miocene from the North American continental interior. In this study, the sedimentary environments, stratigraphy, geochronology, and paleoclimate are interpreted for a series of outcrops of the late Miocene Ogallala Formation in the Texas Panhandle that includes the Coffee Ranch locality. Updated magnetostratigraphy coupled with previously published geochronology indicates that all exposed strata were deposited over a similar to 277 kyr interval within chron C3An.2n from similar to 6.42-6.70 Ma. Depositional environments include fluvial channels, floodplain ponds, floodplain paleosols, eolian paleosols, riverine tufa, and reworked volcanic ash. Trunk and tributary fluvial channels are differentiated using channel dimensions, sedimentary structures, and bounding surface architecture, and indicate seasonally-variable discharge. Paleosols from nine pedofacies are described and preserve a spectrum of weakly developed Entisols and weakly to moderately mature Inceptisols and Vertisols. Constitutive mass-balance calculations reveal that mature paleosols formed along distinct pedogenic pathways. Calcic Vertisols accumulated pedogenic carbonate and exhibited either net volumetric dilation or collapse as a result of mineral weathering. In contrast, non-calcic Vertisols show patterns of decalcification and variable degrees of volumetric dilation and collapse. The presence of the paleosols described in this study requires paleoprecipitation between of 900-1150 mm/yr approximately double modern values and a westward shift of the continental udic-ustic soil moisture boundary by similar to 400 km during the late Miocene. This finding suggests that climates in the southern midcontinent were not sufficiently arid to select for C-4 photosynthetic pathways over C-3 photosynthesis in the late Miocene.

J	Han, L; Randhir, TO; Huang, MS				Han, Li; Randhir, Timothy O.; Huang, Minsheng			Design and assessment of stream-wetland systems for nutrient removal in an urban watershed of China	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Constructed wetlands are typical best management practices (BMPs) often used to reduce nutrient loads in streams. Evaluating the effectiveness of wetland design on nutrient removal is essential to assist watershed managers in optimal design of BMP dimensions and placement. In this study, we assess performance of two constructed wetland systems (comprising of nine wetlands) installed in downstream of Longhongjian Stream in Hangzhou City, China. These wetland systems are monitored and evaluated for their effects on nutrient removal, particularly TN, NO3-N, TP, and PO4-P. Based on wetland input-output metrics, removal efficiency (RE) is used to quantify wetland system. Results show that both wetland systems effectively removed nutrients, with RE as high as 45% of TN, 57% of NO3-N, 78% of TP, and 86% of PO4-P. In general, nutrient removal efficiency is seasonally dependent, with better removal efficiency occurring during warmer seasons than others. Macrophyte uptake is a primary removal process in these wetlands. We observe that more wetlands working concurrently can provide a greater level of control on nutrients in lotic environments. Wetland design parameters play an important role in removal of nutrients in streams. Increasing flow volume and surface area of wetland, designing curvilinear shoreline, and longer flow paths can be used as design criteria for wetland systems aimed at nutrient removal.

J	Korzeniowska, K; Korup, O				Korzeniowska, Karolina; Korup, Oliver			Object-Based Detection of Lakes Prone to Seasonal Ice Cover on the Tibetan Plateau	REMOTE SENSING												The Tibetan Plateau, the world's largest orogenic plateau, hosts thousands of lakes that play prominent roles as water resources, environmental archives, and sources of natural hazards such as glacier lake outburst floods. Previous studies have reported that the size of lakes on the Tibetan Plateau has changed rapidly in recent years, possibly because of atmospheric warming. Tracking these changes systematically with remote sensing data is challenging given the different spectral signatures of water, the potential for confusing lakes with glaciers, and difficulties in classifying frozen or partly frozen lakes. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) offers new opportunities for automated classification in this context, and we have explored this method for mapping lakes from LANDSAT images and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data. We tested our algorithm for most of the Tibetan Plateau, where lakes in tectonic depressions or blocked by glaciers and sediments have different surface colours and seasonal ice cover in images obtained in 1995 and 2015. We combined a modified normalised difference water index (MNDWI) with OBIA and local topographic slope data in order to classify lakes with an area > 10 km(2). Our method derived 323 water bodies, with a total area of 31,258 km(2), or 2.6% of the study area (in 2015). The same number of lakes had covered only 24,892 km(2) in 1995; lake area has increased by -26% in the past two decades. The classification had estimated producer's and user's accuracies of 0.98, with a Cohen's kappa and F-score of 0.98, and may thus be a useful approximation for quantifying regional hydrological budgets. We have shown that our method is flexible and transferable to detecting lakes in diverse physical settings on several continents with similar success rates.

This paper investigates how the changes in the streamflow of Xinjiang Basin in different future climate scenarios could affect the hydrodynamic conditions in Lake Poyang. First, the hydrodynamic processes in Lake Poyang (i.e., lake level and water velocity) were simulated based on the environmental fluid dynamics code (EFDC). Error statistics indicated that the hydrodynamic model reasonably reflected the hydrodynamics in Lake Poyang. Second, the future streamflow of Xinjiang Basin from 2016 to 2050, which was projected in two future climate scenarios (Sim_RCP4.5 and Sim_RCP8.5) based on the Xin'anjiang model, was applied to hydrodynamic modeling to investigate the relationship between future discharge and hydrodynamics. Results showed that the streamflow changes of Xinjiang Basin in future climate scenarios considerably affected the seasonal distribution of the flow field in Lake Poyang. The hydrodynamic change region that exceeded the threshold values under these two climate scenarios both demonstrated a fluctuating trend and nearly covered the entire lake until April. In Sim_RCP8.5 a slightly larger area was influenced than in Sim_RCP4.5, except in January, and the eastern channel was always significantly affected by streamflow change. These analyses can enhance the present understanding of the relationships between the hydrodynamics in lakes and the hydrological processes of sub-basins.

Characterized by stable stratification and weak winds, VCPs, especially those that last over multiple days, can produce adverse effects such as poor visibility and severe air pollution. Using the gridded data set of the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) for the period of 1979 through 2012, this study examines the climatology of VCPs in the western United States with a focus on spatial and temporal variability. The results reveal a widespread occurrence of short-lived (1-2 days) VCPs over both the mountainous areas of the West and the Northern Plains. Longer VCP episodes, however, tend to be limited to large basins/valleys in the Northwest and the Intermountain West. The leading mode of variability in the annual number of cold-season multi-day VCP event anomalies appears to be linked to a sea-surface temperature anomaly pattern typically found during the warm phase of Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Corresponding to the positive phase of the leading mode of variability is an anomalous 500-hPa ridge over the western United States induced by a Rossby wave train, which, by blocking cold-air intrusions and producing mid-level subsidence warming, leads to more persistent VCP episodes in the western United States. In addition to large-scale wintertime circulation anomalies, local surface temperature anomalies also contribute to the variability.

Community structure and vertical distribution of planktonic ciliates in the saline meromictic lake Shira during breakdown of meromixis	ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY												The study deals with the vertical distribution and seasonal dynamics of planktonic ciliates in the pelagic and littoral zones of a saline meromictic Lake Shira. Fourteen species of free-living ciliates have been found in the Lake, seven of them inhabiting the pelagic zone. The richness of ciliates is higher both in terms of the number of species and biomass in the littoral zone compared to the pelagic zone. Although the ciliate species diversity is low in the pelagic zone, in certain seasons, the biomass of some of the species may reach considerable values, up to 3.4 g m(-2) in the water column. The biomass of ciliates in Lake Shira is generally comparable to the average values for other mesotrophic lakes. The abundance and composition of ciliate populations in Lake Shira vary considerably with depth. Changes in the Lake ecosystem caused by meromixis breakdown in 2015-2016, which induced considerable variations in many Lake components, affected the vertical distribution of planktonic ciliates. However, the annual average biomass of the species that inhabited the Lake before meromixis breakdown remained unchanged. The total ciliate biomass increased due to the presence of the new species.

J	Welch, EB; Cooke, GD				Welch, EB; Cooke, GD			Internal phosphorus loading in shallow lakes: Importance and control	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Decreasing the algal biomass and increasing transparency in shallow, unstratified lakes is usually more difficult than for deep, stratified lakes. Eutrophic unstratified lakes (or shallow, stratified lakes susceptible to metalimmon erosion) have typically responded slowly to reduced external nutrient loading, usually because of longevity of internal loading. That is because sediment-released nutrients (especially phosphorus) readily enter the trophogenic zone of shallow lakes during the growing season and result in high lake concentrations. In stratified lakes, metalimnia may serve as barriers to phosphorus transport into the trophogenic zone. Although the whole water column in shallow lakes is usually aerobic, several mechanisms can combine to produce relatively high sediment phosphorus release rates in these lakes. These include: 1) wind resuspension and bioturbation, combined with high pH or low Fe/P ratio that maintains high P solubility, 2) periodic anoxia and reducing conditions promoted by calm, warm weather, and 3) macrophyte senescence. Attempts to reduce algal biomass by controlling internal phosphorus loading have often been effective.																			1040-2381					JUN	2005	21	2					209	217		10.1080/07438140509354430	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140509354430													WOS:000230369900010

Genetically Derived Estimates of Contemporary Natural Straying Rates and Historical Gene Flow among Lake Michigan Lake Sturgeon Populations	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Natural rates of straying are difficult to quantify over large spatial scales using direct observations, particularly for long-lived fish species characterized by delayed sexual maturity and long interspawning intervals. Using multilocus microsatellite genotypes and likelihood-based statistical methods, we quantified rates of immigration and emigration for six genetically differentiated (mean F-ST = 0.041) lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens populations in Lake Michigan based on adults (n = 437) captured in tributaries during the spawning season. Estimated rates of straying were high (mean = 0.105), asymmetrical, and highly variable across populations. We found no significant association between the total length (a surrogate measure of age) of individuals that strayed and those that did not. Linear distance between streams was more predictive of straying rates and F-ST than least-cost distances estimated based on lakescape features (bathymetry and lake current patterns). Historical rates of gene flow estimated using coalescent analysis indicated a fully parameterized model with variable evolutionarily effective population sizes (theta; range, 0.684-0.989), and variable and nonsymmetrical migration rates best explained the genetic data. Comparatively high estimates of relative historical gene flow from several numerically depressed populations suggest that these populations were once larger contributors to basinwide gene flow than indicated by estimates of contemporary straying rates. High rates of interpopulation straying contrast with high F-ST, suggesting that straying rates are poor indicators of successful reproduction following dispersal.																			0002-8487						2012	141	5					1374	1388		10.1080/00028487.2012.694829	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2012.694829													WOS:000310608700019

Bioaccumulation of non-essential trace metals in tissues and organs of Clarias gariepinus (sharptooth catfish) from the Vaal River system - strontium, aluminium, lead and nickel	WATER SA												This is the first paper reporting on results obtained in a metal bioaccumulation study in the Vaal River system. It discusses concentrations of four non-essential elements (strontium, aluminium, lead and nickel) in water, sediment and various fish tissues. A second paper will report on concentration levels of the remaining five essential trace metals (chrome, copper, iron, manganese and zinc) studied. While heavy metals did accumulate in C. gariepinus tissues, no clear trends emerged with regard to differences between localities (Vaal Dam and Vaal River Barrage) or surveys. The highest non-essential element metal concentrations were generally recorded in gill (filaments and arches), followed by muscle, liver and lastly skin. This general trend appears to be in agreement with trends observed by other workers and reported in the literature. Variability in tissue metal concentrations in C. gariepinus within locality and seasons observed in this study is also reflected in results from available literature. This accentuates the importance of factors that influence the concentrations and bioavailability of trace metals.

Refinement of a previous age model for the core has been made using 7 additional radiocarbon ages and 29 additional oxygen-isotope measurements. These analyses have substantially improved the previously published chronology, which has enabled revision of the results of sedimentological studies of the core. The pollen and re-interpreted biogenic and terrigeneous data were used to reconstruct monsoon circulation and vegetation of southwest Sumatra over the last 83,000 years (83 kyr). During marine isotope stage (MIS) 5a, southwest Sumatra was covered by rainforest, with open herbaceous swamps lining river courses and surrounding lakes. The SE component of the monsoon was stronger than the NW component, resulting in a humid climate with a short, dry season. During MIS 4, conditions were drier, fire activity increased and the monsoon was generally weaker. This latter pattern persisted until MIS1. The vegetation was most open during MIS 3, between similar to 52 and 43 kyr: identifying this phase as the driest of the last glacial. An increase in montane trees from similar to 52 kyr indicates the onset of cooler conditions, which lasted until the transition to MIS 1 at about 11.9 kyr. After similar to 43 kyr, an everwet climate gradually developed as monsoonal circulation intensified and the SE monsoon component became stronger. During this time, closed-canopy rainforest became dominant regionally over southwest Sumatra. Increased monsoonal activity during the early Holocene resulted in increased precipitation, river runoff, sediment discharge and offshore sediment transport from the continental shelf.

J	Engel, K; Tollrian, R				Engel, Katharina; Tollrian, Ralph			Inducible defences as key adaptations for the successful invasion of Daphnia lumholtzi in North America?	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												The mechanisms underlying successful biological invasions often remain unclear. In the case of the tropical water flea Daphnia lumholtzi, which invaded North America, it has been suggested that this species possesses a high thermal tolerance, which in the course of global climate change promotes its establishment and rapid spread. However, D. lumholtzi has an additional remarkable feature: it is the only water flea that forms rigid head spines in response to chemicals released in the presence of fishes. These morphologically (phenotypically) plastic traits serve as an inducible defence against these predators. Here, we show in controlled mesocosm experiments that the native North American species Daphnia pulicaria is competitively superior to D. lumholtzi in the absence of predators. However, in the presence of fish predation the invasive species formed its defences and became dominant. This observation of a predator-mediated switch in dominance suggests that the inducible defence against fish predation may represent a key adaptation for the invasion success of D. lumholtzi.

For this purpose, 80 M. cephalus (20 for each season) were captured in three different stations of Faro Lake, Messina, Sicily. Biometric indices (weight, fork length, and total length) of each fish were registered. The physico-chemical parameters of the water of the study area were also measured, and the content of trace elements in water and sediment was determined. The hematological (white blood cell, WBC; red blood cell, RBC; hemoglobin concentration, Hb; hematocrit, Hct; mean corpuscular volume, MCV; mean corpuscular hemoglobin, MCH; mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, MCHC; thrombocytes count, TC), biochemical parameters (aspartate aminotransferase, AST; alanine aminotransferase, ALT; alkaline phosphatase, ALP; lactate dehydrogenase, LDH), and the seasonal concentration of the trace elements in the different tissues of M. cephalus were assessed. Our results showed a different biodistribution of the trace elements in M. cephalus and significant variations of the blood parameters in the different seasons. This research provides a valid contribute to environmental biomonitoring techniques useful in aquatic pollution control and water management. It also contributes to broadening the studies on the improvement of the health and sustainability of aquatic environments.					; Francesco, Fazio/Q-1598-2019; Piccione, Giuseppe/P-3394-2015; Claudia, Giannetto/AAB-9730-2019	Piccione, Giuseppe/0000-0002-4736-1087; Fazio, Francesco/0000-0003-3198-2580; ARFUSO, FRANCESCA/0000-0001-6139-2691; Giannetto, Claudia/0000-0003-3049-1181													0163-4984	1559-0720				APR	2023	201	4					1987	1995		10.1007/s12011-022-03272-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-022-03272-w		MAY 2022						35508888					WOS:000790637000002

Obtaining good water quality is essential to improve sustainability of these ecosystems, both for health of fish consumers and environmental considerations. However, ponds are often located in agricultural landscape, but few study reports impact of pesticide pressure on these ecosystems. This study characterizes five sites in Northeastern France. This work establishes an initial framework for pesticide monitoring with the aim to improve understanding of the fate of pesticides in ponds. This framework is based on surveys indicating managements and Geographical Information System (GIS) for five ponds and their watersheds (sites: C-0, C-25, C-45, C-75 and C-85) and completes with some analysis of a large spectrum of pesticide residues in surface waters. Watersheds show a gradient of crop proportion ranging from 0% to 82% of the watershed area, mainly rapeseed, wheat, barley and maize. Ponds were representative of local Northeastern France management. Many pesticides, and also nutrients, were measured in water with concentrations varying between sites and seasons. The sum of quantified molecules ranged from 0.17 mu g/l for site C-0 (March) to 8.81 mu g/l for site C-25 (October). Concentrations of metaldehyde, quinmerac, isoproturon and bentazon were sometimes above 1 mu g/l. There is a strong connection between pond and watershed, due to water supply throughout the fish production cycle. Sites with small pond/big watershed are the most exposed to acute contamination a few days after spraying because water discharges are not diluted.

However, few studies have been conducted on the analysis of time-series LCFs. Although multi-scale comparisons of spectral index, hard classification, and land surface temperature images have received attention, rarely have these approaches been applied to LCFs. This study compared the LCFs derived through Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) using the time-series Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data acquired in the Poyang Lake area, China between 2004 and 2005. Specifically, we aimed to: (1) propose an approach for optimal endmember (EM) selection in time-series MESMA; (2) understand the trends in time-series LCFs derived from the TM and MODIS data; and (3) examine the trends in the correlation between the bi-scale LCFs derived from the time-series TM and MODIS data. Our results indicated: (1) the EM spectra chosen according to the proposed hierarchical three-step approach (overall, seasonal, and individual) accurately modeled the both the TM and MODIS images; (2) green vegetation (GV) and NPV/soil/impervious surface (N/S/I) classes followed sine curve trends in the overall area, while the two water classes displayed the water level change pattern in the areas primarily covered with wetland vegetation; and (3) GV, N/S/I, and bright water classes indicated a moderately high agreement between the TM and MODIS LCFs in the whole area (adjusted R-2 >= 0.6). However, low levels of correlations were found in the areas primarily dominated by wetland vegetation for all land cover classes.

This study explores the various reproductive contents (size at sexual maturity, reproductive period and fecundity) of A. testudineus in the Gajner Beel concerning the eco-climatic variabilities and suggests sustainable management policies. A total of 709 individuals were randomly collected from January to December 2019 among 371 females that were sorted out for this study. Total length (TL) ranged from 7.50 to 16.40 cm. Based on the maximum length (L-max), TL vs. gonadosomatic index (GSI), TL-standard length (SL) regression and logistic model, the size at sexual maturity (L-m) was 10.00 cm, 10.40 cm, 11.00 cm and 11.50 cm, respectively. The spawning season was May to August and peaked in June-July. The Fulton's condition (K-F) was suggested as the best condition factor (p< 0.0001), and relative weight (W-R) showed no significant difference from 100 for females (p = 0.143). Fecundity was ranged from 9459 to 35,915. A significant relationship was observed between GSI and temperature (p = 0.0016), dissolved oxygen (DO) (p< 0.0001), pH (p < 0.0001), alkalinity (p< 0.001) and climatic parameters (air temperature, p< 0.001 and rainfall, p< 0.001). The data series of 48 years (1971-2019) revealed that the rise of average air temperature by 0.029 degrees C and the reduction of rainfall by 2.96 mm per year might shift the spawning season of A. testudineus 15-20 later. Therefore, this study will be helpful for the sustainable management and conservation of the wild stocks of A. testudineus in the Gajner Beel and adjoining ecosystems.

In this paper we examine their interaction on species richness and species composition of planktonic rotifers in Turkey, controlling for other confounding effects. Eighty-four species of Rotifera belonging to 32 genera were recorded from eight sampling sites in Develi Plain (Middle Anatolia, Kayseri, Turkey), collecting repeated samples in different seasons (April, July, October and December 2007), and measuring water parameters (electrical conductivity, pH and temperature). Generalised Linear Models and Mixed Effect Models were used to disentangle the effect of the environmental parameters on species richness and composition. Temperature positively affected species richness as expected from previous studies. Whereas this effect was clear in the freshwater habitats (less than 1000 mu S cm(-1)), it was not observed at all at higher salinities. Surprisingly, species richness significantly increased with salinity in subsaline waters between 1000 and 6000 mu S cm(-1). Species composition varied among sampling sites (accounting for 36.2% of total variation), but no other factors were found to be involved.

Temperature, pH, conductance, and transparency were measured in Fubao Bay of Dianchi Lake every week. At the same time, dissolved oxygen and inorganic carbon, total nitrogen and phosphorus, chlorophyll-a and phytoplankton biomass were field-investigated. The results analyzed by CCA (canonical correspondence analysis) indicated that temperature is the most correlative impact factor on A. flos-aquae and M. aeruginosa's seasonal succession. Total nitrogen, total phosphorus and transparency are the second correlation factors. Temperature gradient experimentation in laboratory indicated that A. flos-aquae could grow under all of the 4 temperature conditions: 10, 15, 20 and 25 degrees C, but growth of A. flos-aquae at 10 and 15 degrees C was slower than that at 20 and 25 degrees C. M. aeruginosa could not grow at 10 degrees C and very slowly at 15 degrees C, but faster than A. flos-aquae at 20 and 25 degrees C. The result of the laboratory experimentation is coincident with the field investigation. It suggests that temperature may be the dominating factor on the alternation succession of A. flos-aquae and M. aeruginosa in Dianchi Lake.

Investigating Short-Period Lake-Generated Microseisms Using a Broadband Array of Onshore and Lake-Bottom Seismometers	SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Recent analyses of ambient seismic noise proximal to large lakes identify excitations between periods of 0.5 and 5 s as lake-generated microseisms, though the mechanisms producing them remain unclear in the absence of distinct spectral peaks. We present a unique data set combining onshore and offshore seismometers to investigate the dominant parameters controlling water-to-solid-earth seismic coupling in a lacustrine environment. Using a set of broadband observations that include six lake-bottom seismometers, we compare signals collected both within and around Lake Malawi (Nyasa) in southeastern Africa, the fifth largest freshwater lake in the world. We document clear evidence for two peaks within the lake microseism band, with pervasive diurnal excitations between periods of similar to 0.6-1.3 and similar to 1.3-3 s. Variations in spectral behavior as a function of recording depth and proximity to both steep lake-floor slopes and the shoreline suggest that the spectral bands may correspond to single- and double-frequency generation processes, akin to primary and secondary ocean microseisms generated by the shoaling of wind-driven gravity waves along shorelines and wave interactions within the open body of water, respectively. However, both the absolute amplitudes and temporal evolution we observe in these two bands are complex and often inconsistent with traditional microseism theory. Therefore, these spectral bands may alternatively result from complex wave-wave interaction at the lake surface within the enclosed northern end of the lake. The diurnal behavior of lake microseisms, as well as their polarizations, suggest that the wave energy is driven by a combination of seasonally varying nighttime winds funneled by lakeshore topography and waveguide effects.

This study investigated microbial communities of five landscape lakes replenished by reclaimed water, then analyzed driven factors and identified health effects of bacterial pathogens. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis demonstrated that Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, and Verrucomicrobia were the most dominant phyla in five landscape lakes. The microbial community diversities were higher in June and July than that in other months. Temperature, total nitrogen and phosphorus were the main drivers of the dominant microbial from the Redundancy analysis (RDA) results. Various potential bacterial pathogens were identified, including Pseudomonas, GKS98_freshwater_group, Sporosarcina, Pseudochrobactrum, Streptomyces and Bacillus, etc, some of which are easily infectious to human. The microbial network analysis showed that some potential pathogens were nodes that had significant health effects. The work provides a basis for understanding the microbial community dynamics and safety issues for health effects in landscape lakes replenished by reclaimed water.					王, 齐/GQQ-5976-2022; yu, jian wei/HJJ-0649-2023; Li, Luwei/AAA-5118-2019; Yu, Jianwei/HJJ-0649-2023	Liao, Yu/0000-0001-6921-817X; Li, Luwei/0000-0001-6346-7925; yu, jian wei/0000-0003-4861-0257; Wang, Qi/0000-0001-9340-7210														1660-4601				MAY	2022	19	9							5127	10.3390/ijerph19095127	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19095127								35564521					WOS:000794449000001

Propagule pressure, Allee effects and the probability of establishment of an invasive species (Bythotrephes longimanus)	ECOSPHERE												Predicting establishment of exotic species is a central goal of invasion biology, and is dependent upon propagule pressure and population processes. We introduced invading spiny water fleas, Bythotrephes longimanus at different propagule pressures into 19 experimental enclosures, following populations over asexual generations, resting egg production, and emergence in the following year. We integrated experimental results with field data to generate a stochastic population model, predicting establishment in relation to propagule pressure and introduction date. Our results suggested that Allee effects are operational at higher densities or smaller volumes than previously predicted, that stochasticity plays an important role in establishment, and demographic stochasticity may be correlated between individuals. Further, our novel theoretical derivations suggest that organisms should modify their sex ratios to reduce Allee effects. The functional form using adaptive sex-ratios was consistent with both mesocosm and field data. Despite the occurrence of Allee effects and stochasticity, there was still no date during the growing season where we predict lakes to be entirely safe from Bythotrephes invasions. A single propagule had approximately a 0.15 establishment probability in our mesocosms, if introduced early in the season; propagule pressures of 10 had > 0.50 probability, regardless of introduction date.					; Yan, Norman/H-5235-2013	Yan, Norman/0000-0003-4870-6865; 													2150-8925					MAR	2011	2	3							30	10.1890/ES10-00170.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/ES10-00170.1													WOS:000208810400006

Impacts of spatial heterogeneity patterns on long-term trends of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature time series	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												Land surface temperature (LST) is a crucial parameter for global climate change studies. LST changes are also directly associated with the large-scale changes in land cover. Previous studies carried out a comparative analysis of satellite-derived LST response between periods before and after homogenous land cover changes. We present an alternative approach that quantifies long-term LST variability in response to various land use/land cover change (LULCC) patterns over Phuket Island, Thailand, from 2003 to 2017. First, four Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) overpass times of LST time series were adjusted for seasonal effects using a cubic spline function to preserve the number of original data and enable estimates of LST dynamics and trends using the generalized least squared models. Second, LULCC patterns were classified according to land cover type conversion and spatial pattern transformations between the years 2000 and 2016. Spatial homogeneity and heterogeneity were quantified by the coverage percentage for each land use and land cover (LULC) type within a given location. Finally, the influence of LULCC patterns on the long-term spatiotemporal behavior of LST was assessed using the generalized estimating equation model. Results showed that different land cover transitions influence the dynamics of daytime LST but not the nighttime LST. The proportion of different land cover types within an LST pixel and transition amounts contributed to the quantity of increasing surface temperature, especially over impervious surface types. Diverse LULCC patterns with considerations of spatial heterogeneity improved our insight about a relatively strong effect of combined LULC types on LST responses. The climatic effect through the gradual conversion of heterogeneous land cover is necessary to be considered in climate research studies.

The ecological dynamics of Barra Bonita (Tiete River, SP, Brazil) reservoir: implications for its biodiversity	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												Barra Bonita reservoir is located in the Tiete River Basin - Sao Paulo state - 22 degrees 29 '' to 22' 44 '' S and 48 degrees 10 degrees W and it is the first of a series of six large reservoirs in this river. Built Lip in 1963 with the aim to produce hydroelectricity this reservoir is utilized for several activities such as fish production, irrigation, navigation, tourism and recreation, besides hydroelectricity production. The seasonal cycle of events in this reservoir is driven by the hydrological features of the basin with consequences on the retention time and on the limnological functions of this artificial ecosystem. The reservoir is polymitic with short periods of stability. Hydrology of the basin, retention time of the reservoir and cold fronts have an impact in the vertical and horizontal structure of the system promoting rapid changes in the planktonic community and in the succession of species. Blooms of Microcystis Sp. are common during periods of stability. Superimposed to the climatological and hydrological forcing functions the human activities in the watershed produce considerable impact such as the discharge of untreated wastewater, the high suspended material contributions and fertilizers from the sugar cane plantations. The fish fauna of the reservoir has been changed extent due to the introduction of exotic fish species that exploit the pelagic zone of the reservoir. Changes in the primary productivity of phytoplankton in this reservoir, in the zooplankton community in the diversity and organization of trophic structure are a consequence of eutrophication and its increase during the last 20 years. Control of eutrophication by treating wastewater from urban Sources, adequate agricultural practices in order to diminish the suspended particulate matter contribution, revegetation of the watershed and riparian forests along the tributaries are some possible restoration measures. Another action that can be effective is the protection of wetlands in the main tributaries as an effort to control eutrophication and particulate material load. Hydrology, climatic forcing and retention time are major forcing functions that promote the circulation (vertical and horizontal) in the reservoir and probably have a strong effect on dissolved and particulate material distribution. The 114 tributaries are systems that enhance spatial heterogeneity promoting diversity throughout ecological niches. Switches of control systems of this artificial ecosystem seems to be related with physical - physical forces; physical - biological forces during short periods of time, and biological - biological interactions at varying degrees during the seasonal cycle.

Monitoring the occurrence and distribution of selected organophosphates and carbamate pesticide residues in the ecosystem of Lake Naivasha, Kenya	TOXICOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY					4th International Conference on Environmental Management, Engineering, Planning and Economics (CEMEPE) held in conjunction with the Annual Conference of the Society-of-Ecotoxicology-and-Environmental-Safety (SECOTOX)	JUN 24-28, 2013	GREECE	Soc Ecotoxicol & Environm Safety, Univ Thessaly, Dept Planning & Reg Dev, Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Mech Engn, Sect Ind Management & Operat Res, Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Mech Engn, Technol Educ Inst Thessaloniki, Food Technol Dept, German Res Ctr Environm Hlth, Dept Environm Sci				Although use of pesticides is critical in agricultural production, their residues present a potential risk to non-target organisms and lower the quality of surface water. In Kenya for instance, widespread use of pesticides in the catchment of Lake Naivasha, has raised concern over the years due to possible pollution of the lake through discharge of runoff from agricultural fields. In this study, sediment, water, and fish samples were analyzed for selected pesticide residue contamination. Chlorpyrifos-ethyl (CPF) was detected in the range of 2.6-24.9ng/ml and 6.8-35.8ng/g dry weight (dw) in water and sediment, respectively. Meanwhile, diazinon was detected in the range of below detection limit (bdl) to 33.3ng/ml and bdl to 9.3ng/g dw in water and sediment, respectively. CPF was detected in fish tissues (Niloticus leucosticus) in the range of bdl to 8.9ng/g dw with diazinon and carbofuran not detected in any fish sample. A significant difference was observed between different seasons with wet season recording higher levels. Concentrations detected varied seasonally and on average exceeded the maximum criterion set by European Union. Therefore, data generated in this study are useful in environmental risk assessment and as a baseline in formulation of mitigation measures to protect the lake from pesticides residues pollution.

J	Danielson, B; Sharp, M				Danielson, Brad; Sharp, Martin			Development and application of a time-lapse photograph analysis method to investigate the link between tidewater glacier flow variations and supraglacial lake drainage events	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Marine-terminating glaciers may experience seasonal and short-term flow variations, which can impact rates of ice flux through the glacier terminus. We explore the relationship between variability in the flow of a large tidewater glacier (Belcher Glacier, Nunavut, Canada), the seasonal cycle of surface meltwater production and the rapid drainage of supraglacial lakes. We demonstrate a novel method for analyzing time-lapse photography to quantify lake area change rates (a proxy for net filling and drainage rates) and develop a typology of lake drainage styles. GPS records of ice motion reveal four flow acceleration events which can be linked to lake drainage events discovered in the time-lapse photography. These events are superimposed on a longer pattern of velocity variation that is linked to seasonal variation in surface melting. At the terminus of the glacier, the ice displacement associated with the lake drainage events constitutes similar to 10% of the seasonally accelerated displacement or 0.4% of the total annual ice displacement (336 m a(-1)). While the immediate ice response to these individual perturbations may be small, these drainage events may enhance overall seasonal acceleration by opening and/or sustaining meltwater conduits to the glacier bed.																			0022-1430	1727-5652					2013	59	214					287	302		10.3189/2013JoG12J108	http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/2013JoG12J108													WOS:000319716100008

While recent studies have begun to explore this question, there are no empirical studies of parasitism in evolutionary replicates of ecotype-pairs at variable stages of speciation. Such comparative studies of parasitism along continuums of host differentiation are needed as a first step towards testing the role of parasites in ecological speciation. We explored parasitism of whitefish Coregonus lavaretus in four pre-alpine lakes in Switzerland that hold replicate species radiations of whitefish. We sampled shallow and deep-spawning ecotypes on their breeding grounds. We found significant and consistent differences in infection between the ecotypes so that the shallow-spawning fish had more trematode infections, whereas the deep-spawning fish had more cestodes. The magnitude of these differences correlated positively with the degree of the genetic differentiation among the ecotypes and negatively with the extent of eutrophication of the lakes. Although the overall diversity of infections was low, some parasite species with potential effects on fish showed marked differences in infection between the ecotypes, suggesting that parasitism may have a role in maintaining ecotype differentiation in this system. Our results also indicate previously unknown habitat segregation of the better differentiated ecotypes, i.e. species, along the depth gradient outside the breeding season. Moreover, oligotrophic lakes tended to have higher parasite species richness and higher abundances of infection, than mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes, suggesting that the history of eutrophication affects parasite diversity.

Annually, 385,000 people visit the lake. The lake is threatened by a variety of causes, including industrial and agricultural pollution. To support its sustainable management and conservation, the lake's recreational value is estimated using an individual travel cost model. Randomly selected visitors are interviewed during peak season about their recreational travel behavior and perception of lake conditions. Key issues in travel cost modeling are addressed, including the opportunity cost of time, group travel, substitution and income effects, and endogenous stratification and truncation due to on-site sampling. Poisson and negative binomial regression models produce similar results. We find significant over-dispersion, and therefore, use the more conservative truncated negative binomial model results to estimate consumer surplus. The value of this assessment method for resource managers is illustrated by comparing the consumer surplus with existing pricing and budgeting mechanisms. The annual flow of benefits from lake recreation appears to be almost 50 times higher than the average entrance fee paid by the predominantly higher-income segments visiting the lake, suggesting scope for increasing fees and reallocating government budgets to finance the necessary lake protection measures.

Allochronic divergence and clonal succession: two microevolutionary processes sculpturing population structure of Brachionus rotifers	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The life cycle of cyclical parthenogens provides a unique model for the study of spatiotemporal microevolutionary processes at ecologically relevant time scales. Considerable effort has been invested to understand spatial population structure, but critical information is still missing on temporal population divergence. This study aims to provide insights toward the latter direction by investigating the year-round species and clonal variation patterns of the cyclical parthenogenetic rotifers of the genus Brachionus. For this, a nuclear SSR genetic assay with environmental measurements in sequential population samples from an inland lake (Lake Koronia, Greece) was used. Species assignment was based on a combination of mitochondrial RFLPs (COI, 16S rRNA) and phenotypic characters. Two species pairs succeeded each other, namely Brachionus plicatilis sensu stricto (s.s.)/B. sp. "Austria" and B. ibericus/B. dimidiatus. In B. plicatilis s.s., a strong positive and significant correlation between genetic divergence of temporal samples and time (r = 0.85, P < 0.05) was observed, resulting in high levels of population differentiation (F (ST) > 0.3). We also observed a progressive succession between two clonal groups of B. plicatilis s.s. There was further a marked discrimination of the abundance of cryptic species by temperature and an association between temperature and the abundance of the two B. plicatilis s.s. clonal groups was also noticed. Our results provide evidence for ecological specialization at both the inter- and the intraspecific levels. High allochronic population divergence within relatively short periods of time underlines the microevolutionary role of clonal selection behind these observations.					; Michaloudi, Evangelia/AAS-4574-2021; Papakostas, Spiros/J-7452-2012; Kappas, Ilias/AAB-5286-2021	Kappas, Ilias/0000-0002-8564-7035; Triantafyllidis, Alexandros/0000-0003-0469-011X; Michaloudi, Evangelia/0000-0001-8194-2865; Papakostas, Spiros/0000-0002-5563-0048; 													0018-8158					JAN	2013	700	1					33	45		10.1007/s10750-012-1217-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1217-7													WOS:000312073300004

We examined the ice phenology using 3 modelling approaches: a lake-specific regression model to derive a suite of local predictors; a regionally derived regression model to test larger-scale predictors; and a physically based, one-dimensional thermodynamic model. All 3 models were also applied to generate future ice cover scenarios. The local regression revealed air temperature to be an important predictor of ice phenology in our area, as reported elsewhere; however, reductions in wind speed and increases in lake heat storage over the last 35 years also contributed significantly to a delayed ice-on date. Ice-off dates were strongly correlated with the effects of warmer air temperatures but also influenced by increased snowfall and reduced wind speed. Thus, although changes in ice phenology were related to continental-scale changes in air temperature, they were also influenced by more localized climatic variables, and a careful examination of local events was needed for a complete assessment of ice phenology. Predictabilities of the regional regression model, which primarily relied on air temperature to predict phenology, and the physically based model were lower than the lake-specific local regressions, reinforcing the need for inclusion of local variables when greater accuracy is important. Finally, the 3 methods generated similar estimates of reductions in ice cover over the next 90 years, predicting a 40-50 day decrease in ice season length by 2100.					; Reagan/ABE-6875-2020	Rusak, James/0000-0002-4939-6478; Yao, Huaxia/0000-0001-5875-7215													2044-2041	2044-205X					2013	3	1					1	14		10.5268/IW-3.1.517	http://dx.doi.org/10.5268/IW-3.1.517													WOS:000318267100001

The concentration of total OCPs in surface water varied from 1.01 to 46.49 ng l(-1) (mean 10.55 ng l(-1)). The levels of total HCHs (Sigma HCH) and total DDTs (Sigma DDT) in surface water were in the range of 0.55-28.07 ng l(-1) and lower than detection limit to 16.71 ng l(-1), respectively, which was lower than Chinese standards on the whole. For OCPs residues in SPM, the mean levels varying from 0.20 to 34.72 ng l(-1) and 0.46 to 2.72 ng l(-1) for Sigma HCH and Sigma DDT, respectively, which ranked the relatively higher levels among Chinese studied rivers. Results from this investigation showed that previous excessive usage of technical OCPs was the main reason for the residues of HCHs and DDTs both in surface water and SPM, although some new sources were likely to occurred in the region. Apart from the OCPs in SPM originated from upstream in flood season, one of the important sources of OCP residues both in water and SPM in Yangtze River was supposed to be the inputs of its tributaries. Additionally, in situ water-SPM phase distributions of OCPs indicated that HCHs tended totransport with water as well as DDTs was prone to combine with SPM in Yangtze River catchment of Wuhan.

J	Mugunthan, JS; Duguay, CR; Zakharova, E				Mugunthan, Jaya Sree; Duguay, Claude R.; Zakharova, Elena			Machine learning based classification of lake ice and open water from Sentinel-3 SAR altimetry waveforms	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The aim of the study was to evaluate, for the first time, the capability of different machine learning (ML) algorithms in classifying along-track lake surface conditions (open water and ice types) across ice seasons (freeze-up, ice growth and break-up periods) from Sentinel-3 A/B synthetic aperture radar altimeter (SRAL) data. To achieve this goal, over 107,500 radar waveforms extracted from 11 large lakes across the Northern Hemisphere and three ice seasons (2018-2021) were manually labelled using complementary satellite data (Sentinel-1 imaging Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) Level 1C, and MODIS Aqua/Terra data) for the training and testing of the ML algorithms in discriminating between open water, young (thin) ice, growing ice and melting ice. The four ML algorithms tested include Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). To characterize the waveforms, seven waveform parameters were derived: Leading Edge Width (LEW), Offset Center of Gravity (OCOG) Width, Pulse Peakiness (PP), backscatter coefficient (Sigma0), late tail to peak power (LTPP), early tail to peak power (ETPP) and the maximum value of the echo power (Max). Accuracies >95% were achieved across all classifiers using a 4-parameter combination (Sigma0, PP, OCOG Width, and LEW). Among all waveform parameters, Sigma0, OCOG width and PP were found to be the most important parameters for discriminating between lake ice types and open water. Despite showing comparable classification performances in the overall classification, RF and KNN are found to be a better fit for global lake ice mapping as both are less sensitive to their internal hyperparameters. Additionally, consistent results (>93.7% accuracy in all classifiers) achieved on the accuracy assessment carried out for each lake (out-of-sample testing) revealed the strength of the classifiers for spatial transferability. Implementation of RF and KNN could be valuable in a pre-or post-processing step for identifying lake surface conditions under which the retrieval of water level and ice thickness may be limited or not possible and, therefore, inform algorithms currently used for the generation of operational or research products. While the research focused on 11 of the largest lakes of the Northern Hemisphere, the classification approach presented herein has potential for application on smaller lakes too since data in SAR mode (similar to 300 m along-track resolution) are used.

Gut contents of 435 fish were analyzed using frequency of occurrence and volumetric analysis. In frequency of occurrence method the number of gut samples was expressed as a percentage of all non-empty stomachs examined while in volumetric method the volume of each food category was expressed as a percentage of the total volume of the gut contents. Detritus, insects and macrophytes were the dominant food categories occurring in 97.0%, 85.2% and 53.3% of the guts and comprising 39.8%, 36.4% and 12.4% of the total volume of food items, respectively. The remaining food categories were of low importance in the diet. The frequency of occurrence and volumetric contributions of the different food categories of C. carpio significantly varied (U-test, p<0.05) during the dry and wet seasons. During the dry season, insects and detritus were important food categories, occurring in 94.4% and 98.6 of the guts and comprising 42.3% and 36.1% of the total volume of food, respectively. During the wet season, detritus was the most important food category. It occurred in 93.9% of the guts and accounted for 48.8% of the total volume of food. Insects and macrophytes were also important during the wet season, occurring in 68.2% and 74.3% of the guts and comprising 23.6% and 22.6% of the total volume of food, respectively. The contributions of animal origin food categories were important in the diet of juveniles whereas, food of plant origin were more important in the diet of adults. However, there were no significant variations in the diet of individuals in the different size classes. Based on the results, it was concluded that C. carpio was omnivorous in its feeding habits in Lake Koka with considerable seasonal variation but insignificant onto genetic change in its diet.

Cytotype differences in radial increment provide novel insight into aspen reproductive ecology and stand dynamics	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												High rates of triploidy have recently been described in quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) of the Intermountain West, raising questions about the contributions of triploidy to stand persistence and dynamics. In this study, we investigated cytotype differences between diploid and triploid aspen clones using dendrochronological techniques. We used tree-ring data collected from stems within an aspen stand near Fish Lake, Utah, to test for differences in stem age, population structure, growth, and response to climate. This stand contains the well-known Pando clone, which is purported to be the largest organism documented on earth. Our results show that triploid aspen stems grew more rapidly than diploids, and that this difference was most pronounced early in stand development. Growth response to climate varied little between triploids and diploids, where wide rings were associated with cool, moist years, and narrow rings were associated with above-average growing season temperatures. Stand development processes and inherent genetic differences are mechanisms possibly controlling the observed differences in aspen ring width between triploids and diploids. Regardless of the mechanism, the results have specific management implications. Conventional regeneration methods involving coppicing and the associated intermediate treatments will promote asexually reproducing triploids, leading to static or reduced genetic diversity. Enhanced genetic diversity will be favored by management actions that explicitly account for (i) the potential existence of multiple cytotypes within a stand and (ii) the observed differences in growth rates between diploid and triploid individuals.

Phosphorus and arsenic distributions in a seasonally stratified, iron- and manganese-rich lake: microbiological and geochemical controls	ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY												Environmental context Despite being present at trace concentrations, arsenic and phosphorus are among the most important of freshwater contaminants. This research highlights the biogeochemical coupling of both elements in a New Zealand lake. We find that the mineralisation of organic residues coupled to the dissolution of colloidal iron and manganese hydroxides may be an important driver of the bioavailability of phosphorus and arsenic. Abstract Seasonal stratification in temperate lakes greater than a few metres deep provides conditions amenable to pronounced vertical zonation of redox chemistry. Such changes are particularly evident in eutrophic systems where high phytoplankton biomass often leads to seasonally established anaerobic hypolimnia and profound changes in geochemical conditions. In this study, we investigated the behaviour of trace elements in the water column of a seasonally stratified, eutrophic lake. Two consecutive years of data from Lake Ngapouri, North Island, New Zealand, demonstrate the occurrence of highly correlated profiles of phosphorus, arsenic, iron and manganese, all of which increased in concentration by 1-2 orders of magnitude within the anaerobic hypolimnion. Stoichiometric and mass-balance considerations demonstrate that increases in alkalinity in hypolimnetic waters were consistent with observed changes in sulfate, Fe and Mn concentrations with depth, corresponding to dissimilatory reduction of sulfate, Fe-III and Mn-IV hydroxides. Thermodynamic constraints on Fe, Mn and Al solubility indicate that amorphous Fe-III, Mn-IV hydroxides most probably controlled Fe and Mn in the surface mixed layer (0 to 8m) whereas Al-III hydroxides were supersaturated throughout the entire system. Surface complexation modelling indicated that iron hydroxides (HFO) potentially dominated As speciation in the lake. It is likely that other colloidal phases such as allophanic clays also limited HPO42- activity, reducing competition for HAsO42- adsorption to iron hydroxides. This research highlights the coupling of P, As, Fe and Mn in Lake Ngapouri, and the apparent role of multiple colloidal phases in affecting P and As activity within overarching microbiological and geochemical processes.

We applied 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments to study the bacterial and archaeal community compositions (BCC and ACC, respectively) to provide insight into the ecology of the microbes in Lake Kivu. The vertical distribution of electron donors and acceptors in the chemically stratified water column may be responsible for the stratified distribution of microbial populations, suggesting well-defined functional specialization. The highest microbial richness was detected in the anoxic zone, which hosted high percentages of bacterial sequences related to uncultured and poorly described phyla. This suggests an under-representation of anoxic environments in current databases and the presence of previously undescribed taxa. Microbial diversity is made up of 2 fractions: abundant species (e.g. Galand et al. 2009) and rare species. Abundant species were more stable than rare species over time. The detection of rare candidate divisions (e.g. OP3, WS3, GN02) co-occurring with sulphur-oxidising Epsilonproteobacteria, sulphate-reducing Deltaproteobacteria, hydrogen-oxidising Dehalococcoidetes and methanogens might indicate interactions in the carbon and sulphur cycles in the anoxic waters.

Effects of past climate variability on fire and vegetation in the cerrado savanna of the Huanchaca Mesetta, NE Bolivia	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Cerrdo savannas have the greatest fire activity of all major global land-cover types and play a significant role in the global carbon cycle. During the 21st century, temperatures are projected to increase by similar to 3 A degrees C coupled with a precipitation decrease of similar to 20%. Although these conditions could potentially intensify drought stress, it is unknown how that might alter vegetation composition and fire regimes. To assess how Neotropical savannas responded to past climate changes, a 14 500-year, high-resolution, sedimentary record from Huanchaca Mesetta, a palm swamp located in the cerrdo savanna in northeastern Bolivia, was analyzed with phytoliths, stable isotopes, and charcoal. A non-analogue, cold-adapted vegetation community dominated the Lateglacial-early Holocene period (14 500-9000 cal yr BP, which included trees and C-3 Pooideae and C-4 Panicoideae grasses. The Lateglacial vegetation was fire-sensitive and fire activity during this period was low, likely responding to fuel availability and limitation. Although similar vegetation characterized the early Holocene, the warming conditions associated with the onset of the Holocene led to an initial increase in fire activity. Huanchaca Mesetta became increasingly fire-dependent during the middle Holocene with the expansion of C-4 fire-adapted grasses. However, as warm, dry conditions, characterized by increased length and severity of the dry season, continued, fuel availability decreased. The establishment of the modern palm swamp vegetation occurred at 5000 cal yr BP. Edaphic factors are the first-order control on vegetation on the rocky quartzite mesetta. Where soils are sufficiently thick, climate is the second-order control of vegetation on the mesetta. The presence of the modern palm swamp is attributed to two factors: (1) increased precipitation that increased water table levels and (2) decreased frequency and duration of surazos (cold wind incursions from Patagonia) leading to increased temperature minima. Natural (soil, climate, fire) drivers rather than anthropogenic drivers control the vegetation and fire activity at Huanchaca Mesetta. Thus the cerrdo savanna ecosystem of the Huanchaca Plateau has exhibited ecosystem resilience to major climatic changes in both temperature and precipitation since the Lateglacial period.					; Iriarte, Jose/A-1141-2010	Maezumi, S.

TRIASSIC SPINICAUDATAN FAUNA FROM THE CERRO DE LAS CABRAS FORMATION (CUYO BASIN), MENDOZA PROVINCE (ARGENTINA): DESCRIPTION OF NEW SPECIES AND REVISION OF PREVIOUS RECORDS	AMEGHINIANA												This is a systematic study of the Spinicaudata fauna of the Cerro de Las Cabras Formation (Middle Triassic), north of Cerro Bayo, in the classical Potrerillos area, Precordillera of Mendoza, Cuyo Basin, Argentina. Two new species are described: Estheriellites zavattieriae sp. nov. and Euestheria menendezi sp. nov.. The diagnosis of the genus and species of Challaolimnadiopsis mendozaensis Shen and Gallego, is emended; and Euestheria martinsnetoi Gallego et al., previously described for the Rio Mendoza Formation is now considered as coming from the Cerro de Las Cabras strata. The studied section consists mainly of fine-grained tuffaceous sandstones and interbedded mudstones interpreted as playa lake, ephemeral rivers and/or streams developed in the floodplain. Ephemeral to shallow lacustrine environments are characterized by interbedded siltstones, nodular-mottle and stromatolitic limestones with sub-aerial exposures and incipient soil development in depressed and flood-prone areas under seasonal semi-arid conditions. Spinicaudatans probably inhabited lacustrine shorelines and small ponds in the floodplain where plant remains (arthrophyte) and rare fish scales were also recorded. The profuse presence of pyroclastic deposits along the sequence indicates considerable explosive volcanic activity coeval with sedimentation. Based on previous lithostratigraphical, paleontological and chronological data, the age of the studied deposits was constrained to Middle Triassic (equivalent to Late Anisian-Late Ladinian of marine sequences) and therefore the E. zavattieriae-E. martinsnetoi Faunal Association is considered as a marker for such age range.																			0002-7014	1851-8044					2015	52	2					241	264		10.5710/AMGH.29.11.2014.2823	http://dx.doi.org/10.5710/AMGH.29.11.2014.2823													WOS:000353294700005

They have unique biological characteristics such as small body size, early sexual maturation, continuous reproduction, an elaborated courtship behavior, and a great reproductive capacity among fishes. The rivulids are widely distributed in North, Central and South America. In this study, the diet and reproductive biology of Cynopoecilus melanotaenia was analyzed. A total of 263 specimens were collected and the analysis of 233 gastrointestinal contents revealed an invertivorous diet composed mainly of small crustaceans (Cladocera, Amphipoda, and Ostracoda) and immature insects (Chaoboridae, Culicidae, Syrphidae, but mainly Chironomidae larvae). Lepidophagy on male's diet was also registered. Fecundity was estimated by analyzing 59 pairs of mature ovaries and ranged from 2 to 157 oocytes (mean, 19 +/- 26[SD]). The species has fractional spawning, a strategy to increase the chance of survival to prolonged depletions. This study is the first to investigate the reproductive biology of C. melanotaenia. The results confirmed the opportunistic character of the rivulid C. melanotaenia and provided unreported reproductive information that may aid conservation of the species.					; Souza, Ursulla/J-5796-2014; da Silva Gonçalves, Cristina/D-1807-2011	Goncalves, Cristina/0000-0001-5904-6271; Pereira Souza, Ursulla/0000-0002-3857-7222; 													1679-6225					JAN-MAR	2011	9	1					191	200																WOS:000290097300019

The structural equation model (SEM) was used to analyze the relationship between abundance of phytoplankton and environmental factors in order to determine the main environmental factors that affect changes in phytoplankton. A total of 110 phytoplankton taxa were obtained from six sites. They were members of seven phyla and 68 genera with 12 dominant species or genera. The SEM showed that the main environmental factors that affected the cyanobacteria and diatoms were the temperature (WT), total nitrogen (TN), nitrite nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, dissolved oxygen, and transparency (SD). Those that affected the Chlorophyta were the pH, TN, ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), and orthophosphate phosphorus (PO43--P). We concluded that changes in the WT, SD, and the concentration of nutrients significantly affected the abundance of phytoplankton and the dominance of Cyanobacteria and diatoms, whereas these factors had insignificant effects on green algae. The WT, SD, TN and NH4+-N were found to be important environmental factors that affect the structure, growth, and reproduction of the phytoplankton community in Hongfeng Reservoir. This study should provide a scientific reference for the reservoir phytoplankton community ecology and a database on the changes in water quality.					; Li, Haoyu/ACR-0968-2022	/0000-0002-0029-2416; 													1386-2588	1573-5125				DEC	2022	56	4					1297	1313		10.1007/s10452-022-09963-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-022-09963-9		APR 2022											WOS:000787134900001

We tested the hypothesis that fertility of a habitat may significantly influence the diurnal dynamics of the abundance of individual components of the microbial loop, as well as the number and intensity of correlations between bacteria and heterotrophic protists. Samples were taken in raised and carbonate peat bogs in three seasons, four times a day: at dawn, at noon, at dusk and at night. The results indicate that microbial community responses to physical and chemical parameters are complex but dependent on peatlands' type and variable among microbes. Concentrations of nutrients may significantly influence the diurnal dynamics of the microbial communities. The most significant correlations occurred in the afternoon. At that time, the number and biomass of metabolically active bacteria correlated to the highest degree with concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, while in the evening, a clearly positive correlation between the abundance of bacteria and protists was observed. In a carbonate fen, the correlations were significantly weaker. Such knowledge will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the implication of chemical disturbance on microbial functions in relation with nutrient and carbon dynamics.					; Tarkowska-Kukuryk, Monika/T-7469-2018	Mieczan, Tomasz/0000-0003-2839-1798; Tarkowska-Kukuryk, Monika/0000-0001-5328-6944													0018-8158	1573-5117				OCT	2013	717	1					189	201		10.1007/s10750-013-1582-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-013-1582-x													WOS:000323660900015

In a rice-wheat rotation system, omitting P fertilizer application in the rice-growing season is a good alternative; however, how this P fertilization reduction influences changes in P in the soil-root-above-ground system is unclear. In this study, after a seven-year rice-wheat rotation at the Yixing (YX) and Changshu (CS) sampling sites, China, compared with P fertilization in rice- and wheat-growing seasons (PR+W), reduced P fertilization (no P fertilizer application in either season, P0; P fertilization only in wheat-growing seasons, PW; and P fertilization only in rice-growing seasons, PR) did not result in substantial variation in crop biomass. The PW treatment did not reduce crop total P, root iron (Fe)-plaque P, and soil Olsen-P at three stages of rice growth (seedling, booting, and harvesting stages) at the YX and CS sites. In contrast, concentrations of soil Olsen-P, aboveground crop total P, and root Fe-plaque P decreased in the P0 treatment by 45.8%-81.0%, 24.6%-30.9%, and 45.6%-73.4%, respectively. In addition, a significant negative correlation was observed between the root Fe-plaque P and crop biomass at the two sites. Significant positive correlations were also observed between root Fe-plaque P and root total P, crop total P, and soil Olsen-P. In addition, the results of a redundancy analysis revealed that soil alkaline phosphatase (ALP) played a major role in the supply of P in soil, and was closely associated with root Fe-plaque P. The results of this study will enhance the understanding of the changes in P in the soil-root-above-ground system, particularly under P fertilizer reduction regimes.

Microcystins presence threatens the ecosystem health of a tropical National Park: Lagunas de Montebello, Chiapas	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Anthropogenic eutrophication of tropical lakes usually develops harmful cyanobacterial blooms. As algal blooms spread, the frequency of appearance of cyanotoxin producing strains increases. Within the cyanotoxins, microcystins stand out to produce numerous cases of intoxications/fatalities of livestock and humans. Since 2003, some previously crystal-clear lakes of the "Lagunas de Montebello" National Park (LMNP), Chiapas, southern Mexico, have turned brilliant green associated with perennial cyanobacterial blooms. Although these lakes are used as drinking water supply, fisheries, irrigation, and tourism, the risk of cyanotoxins' possible presence in these water bodies had not been evaluated. Therefore, this research aimed to measure the cyanobacterial biomass and identify and measure microcystins concentration in the LMNP eutrophic lakes. Phytoplankton was dominated by well-known cyanotoxins producing cyanobacteria (Planktothrix, Raphidiopsis, and Limnothrix). Microcystins in LMNP lakes were confirmed, while the microcystin concentration ranged from 2.0 to 5.3 mu g L-1. This range indicates a relatively low probability of causing acute health effects through human consumption or recreational purposes. However, these results compel the necessity of implementing a follow-up program (nonexistent in the LMNP management plan) to measure microcystins and the whole range of cyanotoxins along an annual cycle to be able to recognize the toxins' maximum concentrations and their potential bioaccumulation in the food web. It is also needed to investigate more accurately the seasonal phytoplankton dynamics together with all limnological parameters.

Jun; Tan, Zhiqiang			Integrating the JRC Monthly Water History Dataset and Geostatistical Analysis Approach to Quantify Surface Hydrological Connectivity Dynamics in an Ungauged Multi-Lake System	WATER												Determining the dynamics of surface hydrological connectivity in a landscape of multiple lakes with different sizes and depths is challenging. This is especially the case for ungagged, large areas of multi-lake systems. Integrated use of remote sensing and geostatistical analysis can be a useful approach for developing metrics that can be used to identify the hydrological connectivity and their changes. In this study, we conducted a geostatistical analysis of 18 wet and dry binary state rasters derived from Landsat images over a large ungauged multi-lake system, the Momoge National Nature Reserve in Northeast China. Our goal was to investigate applicability and dynamics of three surface hydrological connectivity metrics, namely, geostatistical connectivity function (GCF), maximum distance of connection (MDC), and surface water extent (SWE) of the top 10 largest connectomes (i.e., seasonally connected water bodies). We found that, during a dry year, the reduction rate of the GCF curve was slower along the west-east (W-E) direction than along the north-south (N-S) direction, which was contrary to the patterns exhibited in a normal or wet year. The minimum values of the MDC in W-E and N-S directions in the dry year were 22.4 km and 6.3 km, respectively, while the maximum values of the MDC along the above two directions in the wet year were 50.7 km and 65.1 km, respectively. The components and spatial distribution of the top 10 largest connectomes changed dramatically in different months of each hydrological year, resulting in a huge change in the monthly SWE of the top 10 largest connectomes. Overall, this study validated the usefulness of combining remote sensing image analysis with geostatistical methods to quantify the surface hydrological connectivity from different perspectives in an ungauged area. The approach may be applicable to studies in other geographical regions, to guide water resources and wetland management practices.					Xu, Y./A-7681-2014; Xu, Y.

Berry			Radiocarbon distribution and the effect of legacy in lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The water of the ice-covered lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys is derived primarily from glacial melt streams and to a lesser extent permafrost seeps and subglacial outflow. The result is a mixture of radiocarbon ages that reflect both the end-member water source and the biogeochemical processing of waters as they migrate to the lake-water column. Samples were collected from various locations within perennially ice-covered Antarctic lakes and the streams that feed them, and they were analyzed for radiocarbon abundance of organic and inorganic carbon. Stream gradient and length were shown to affect the degree of equilibration of water with the modern atmosphere prior to entering the lakes. Stream microbial mats assimilate inorganic carbon flowing over them. Seasonal ice-free 'moat' water dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is largely dependent on the amount of meltwater input from streams (modern) vs. that from direct glaciers input (old). Under the ice cover, C-14 ages of lake-water DIC and organic matter are dependent on lake history, composition, and quantity of particulate matter fallout. Bottom waters of the west lobe of Lake Bonney have a DIC age of similar to 27,000 C-14 yr before present, which we believe are the most radiocarbon-deficient lake waters on Earth. Comparison of the radiocarbon profiles in the two lobes of Lake Bonney, along with previously published geochemical data, provides a new chronology of the evolution of these two waterbodies and shows that currently deep saline water is being displaced over the sill separating them.

Here, we assess the role of geomorphology on the downstream flood dynamics of the Araguaia River, the largest free-flowing river in Central Brazil. The study integrates and advances existing flood-type classifications. We assess the factors that govern flood hydrograph properties and their downstream propagation by using flow time series, conducting statistical analysis, and evaluating geomorphic and flood metrics. Our findings highlight the role of geomorphology in the transmission of floods. In the upper and lowermost fluvial segments, the geological characteristics of the valley are a major factor. In the intermediate section, two main factors modulate the floods. The wide and complex floodplain plays a major role through storage and buffer effect for floods, and water diversion from the main system to a huge abandoned channel by avulsion governs seasonal flow transfers. The Araguaia is the most geodiverse floodplain of the Amazon-Cerrado ecotone, and floods play a fundamental ecological role in the river-floodplain environments. The combination of diverse factors controlling the flood mechanisms has to be considered when implementing conservation plans for the fluvial corridor and effective river management strategies.

Small Reservoirs as Nitrogen Transformers: Accounting for Seasonal Variability in Inorganic and Organic Nitrogen Processing	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) inputs to the landscape have serious consequences for inland and coastal waters. Reservoirs are effective at mitigating downstream N fluxes but measurements have generally focused on large reservoirs and have not considered seasonal variability or all N forms. In this study, we conducted an N mass balance in eight small reservoirs (surface area <0.55 km(2)) in coastal New England over annual time periods, including both inorganic and organic forms of N. We found that small reservoirs have high capacity for dissolved inorganic N (DIN) retention during low and moderate discharge, but are roughly in balance for DIN at higher discharge. Because proportional DIN retention occurred when N inputs were at their lowest, their effect on downstream N fluxes is small over annual time frames. Further, dissolved organic N (DON) was also evident during low flow late in the warm season. Accounting for DON production, the net effect of reservoirs on total dissolved N (TDN) fluxes was limited. These transformations between inorganic and organic N should be considered when evaluating the effect of small reservoirs on TDN fluxes over seasonal and annual timescales. With dam removal becoming a common solution to aging, unsafe dams, their ability to retain or produce N must be scrutinized at longer time scales while accounting for the complete N pool to better comprehend the effect their reservoirs have on downstream waters.

Treatments in three replicates comprising manure-treated and chemical fertilizer-treated groups (two factors), each having seven sub-treatments of different combinations of inorganic nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and rice straw, were randomly distributed. Results showed that the treatments of manure (pig manure from 1980 to 1996 and oil rape cake thereafter) + N + P + K (MNPK) and chemical fertilizer + N + P + K (CNPK) produced the highest and the most stable yields for both rice and wheat within the respective fertilizer treatment group. Potassium fertilization was necessary for yield sustainability in the ecosystem. Treatments of straw (as rice straw) + N (CRN) and manure + straw + N (MRN) produced more stable yield of rice but less stable of wheat. It was therefore recommended that straw should be only incorporated during the rice season. SOC contents in all treatments showed increasing trends over the period, even in the control treatment. Predicted SOC in chemical fertilizer-treated plots (mostly yet attainable) ranged from 16 to 18 g C kg(-1), indicating the high carbon (C) sequestration potential of the soil as compared to the initial SOC. SOC in manure- or straw-treated plots ranged from 17 to 19 g C kg(-1), which had been attained roughly 10 years after the experiment was initiated. Nutrient balance sheet showed that there was P surplus in all P-treated plots and a steady increase in Olsen-P over a 24-year period in 0-15 cm soil, which contributed little to crop yield increases. It was therefore suggested that P fertilization rate should be decreased to 30-40 kg P ha(-1) year(-1). Comparison of yields among the treatments showed that wheat was more responsive to P fertilizer than rice. Thus P fertilizer should be preferably applied to wheat. Soil pH decrease was significant over the 24-year period and was not correlated with fertilizer treatments. The overall recommendation is to incorporate straw at 4,500 kg ha(-1) year(-1) during the rice season only, with additional 190 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), 30-40 kg P ha(-1) year(-1) mainly during the rice season, and 150-160 kg K ha(-1) year(-1). Further research on the unusual P supply capacity of the soil is needed.

Assessment of bio-accumulation of bacteria in oysters from shellfish growing waters in Ashtamudi Lake (Kerala, India): A RAMSAR wetland	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												Oysters are commercially cultured from the Ashtamudi Lake in India, and support 12,000 tonnes of bivalve fisheries/year. Oysters and oyster growing waters were sampled from July 2012 to June 2013 for analysis of total coliforms (TC), faecal coliforms (FC), Escherichia coli, faecal Streptococci (FS) and total plate counts (TPC). E. coli MPN values in oyster growing waters were below the threshold limits set by the USFDA and EU during the months of December to April. Seasonally, the highest MPN values for E. coli were obtained during the monsoon season (June-September), and this trend gradually decreased during the post-monsoon (October-January) and pre-monsoon (February-May) periods. E. coli displayed a significant (p < 0.01) variation in accumulation during different seasons. A strong negative correlation (R-2 = -0.70, p < 0.05) between temperature and E. coli numbers in oysters was observed, while rainfall and E. coli were positively correlated (R-2 = 0.695, p < 0.05). Hence, we strongly recommend depuration and proper cooking of oysters before consumption during the monsoon season. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A modelling approach to determine systematic nitrogen transformations in a tropical reservoir	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												The systematic nitrogen transformations were investigated in a tropical freshwater system using a three-dimensional Hydro-Eutrophication model, which simulated hydrodynamics, phytoplankton processes and nutrients cycling in Delft3D. The nitrification and denitrification processes were explicitly considered as the functions of water temperature and oxygen conditions in the model. The validated model was able to capture the thermal differences in vertical direction, reproduce the characteristics of nutrients cycles and primary productions across years with the forcing functions from the area-specific meteorological conditions, discharges and input loads. The modelled nitrification and denitrification process rates were verified by the lab process-oriented measurements. The validated model preformed as a monitor, supplying the knowledge that sediment played an important role in nitrogen cycling, producing twice of the total external nitrogen load to water column. The water column bioactive nitrogen was controlled dominantly by phytoplankton assimilation, which had a nitrogen uptake rate of fifteen fold the external nitrogen loads. The bioactive nitrogen turnover rate by algal growth in this tropical water system was lower than the conditions in the other eutrophic lakes. Fifty-eight percent of the total external nitrogen load was retained via denitrification and burial processes in the Upper Peirce Reservoir. The discovery of the systematic nitrogen transformations in tropical freshwater systems is proposed to be incorporated into future conceptual models of global nitrogen cycles. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Fraser, DJ; Coon, T; Prince, MR; Dion, R; Bernatchez, L				Fraser, Dylan J.; Coon, Thomas; Prince, Michael R.; Dion, Rene; Bernatchez, Louis			Integrating traditional and evolutionary knowledge in biodiversity conservation: a population level case study	ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY												Despite their dual importance in the assessment of endangered/threatened species, there have been few attempts to integrate traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) and evolutionary biology knowledge (EBK) at the population level. We contrasted long-term aboriginal TEK with previously obtained EBK in the context of seasonal migratory habits and population biology of a salmonid fish, brook charr, (Salvelinus fontinalis) inhabiting a large, remote postglacial lake. Compilation of TEK spanning four decades involved analytical workshops, semidirective interviews, and collaborative fieldwork with local aboriginal informants and fishing guides. We found that TEK complemented EBK of brook charr by providing concordant and additional information about (1) population viability; (2) breeding areas and migration patterns of divergent populations; and (3) the behavioral ecology of populations within feeding areas; all of which may ultimately affect the maintenance of population diversity. Aboriginal concerns related to human pressures on this species, not revealed by EBK, also help to focus future conservation initiatives for divergent populations and to encourage restoration of traditional fishing practices. However, relative to EBK, the relevance of TEK to salmonid biodiversity conservation was evident mainly at a smaller spatial scale, for example, that of individual rivers occupied by populations or certain lake sectors. Nevertheless, EBK was only collected over a 4-yr period, so TEK provided an essential long-term temporal window to evaluate population differences and persistence. We concluded that, despite different conceptual underpinnings, spatially and temporally varying TEK and EBK both contribute to the knowledge base required to achieve sustainability and effective biodiversity conservation planning for a given species. Such integration may be particularly relevant in many isolated regions, where intraspecific diversity can go unrecognized due to sparse scientific knowledge or undocumented TEK, and where governmental agencies and local communities increasingly seek to find common ground on which to address biodiversity issues.

The dataset (Aichner et al., 2021; https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.935633) is derived from water samples collected at (a) lake shores (sampled in March and July 2020), (b) buoys which were temporarily installed in deep parts of the lake (sampled monthly from March to October 2020), (c) multiple spatially distributed spots in four selected lakes (in September 2020), and (d) the outflow of Muggelsee (sampled biweekly from March 2020 to January 2021). At shores, water was sampled with a pipette from 40-60 cm below the water surface and directly transferred into a measurement vial, while at buoys a Limnos water sampler was used to obtain samples from 1 m below the surface. Isotope analysis was conducted at IGB Berlin, using a Picarro L2130-i cavity ring-down spectrometer, with a measurement uncertainty of < 0.15 parts per thousand (delta O-18) and < 0.0 parts per thousand (delta H-2). The data give information about the vegetation period and the full seasonal isotope amplitude in the sampled lakes and about spatial isotope variability in different branches of the associated riverine systems.

The catching of these fish species has decreased owing to environmental pollution and habitat loss caused by human impacts. We developed species-specific primer-probe sets to detect and quantify environmental DNA (eDNA) in these fish species. The primer-probe sets were specific to each target species with the detection limits of two (H. nipponensis) and one (S. microdon) copies per reaction, sufficient for eDNA analysis in the field. Using these assays, the eDNA was detected with a high probability (100% and 86% for H. nipponensis and S. microdon, respectively) at the sites where each fish species was captured by a cast net survey in the Hirata-Funagawa River (one of the inflowing rivers of Lake Shinji, Shimane Prefecture, Japan), where it was frequently detected without cast net capture. The eDNA was detected in S. microdon a little earlier than in H. nipponensis, and the eDNA concentrations of both species gradually decreased after peaking in July and reached negligible levels by October. The utility of the assays for estimating the seasonal appearances/disappearances of both species in this river was demonstrated. The species-specific primer-probe sets of the eDNA-based method represent a potentially useful monitoring tool that requires minimal labor and time and could be useful for managing H. nipponensis and S. microdon fisheries in the future.

Sedimentary cladoceran assemblages and their functional attributes record late Holocene climate variability in southern Finland	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												We examined long-term relationships between Cladocera and limnogeological and climate variables in a late Holocene lake sediment sequence to assess cladoceran responses to climate change and reconstruct past climate variations in southern Finland, near the Baltic Sea coast. Elemental composition, organic matter, and inferred water quality variables were used to constrain paleoenvironmental (until 4500 cal BP) conditions and human impact. Fossil Cladocera assemblages, ephippia, and body size trends were utilized to estimate mean July air temperature (T (Jul)) variability, open-water season length, and water-temperature regimes. Results revealed stable cladoceran communities, dominated by Eubosmina, until 500 cal BP, followed by major assemblage changes including increases in Chydorus cf. sphaericus, Alonella spp., and Bosmina longirostris. Pb and Cu concentrations were associated temporally with increasing human impact and warming climate during the past few centuries, and were the most significant factors in explaining cladoceran community changes, based on redundancy analysis. A Cladocera-based T (Jul) reconstruction estimated elevated temperatures for the end of the Holocene Thermal Maximum, a cooler period during similar to 3000-2000 cal BP, slightly increased temperatures during 1200-800 cal BP corresponding to the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), and lower temperatures during the Little Ice Age (LIA), 800-200 cal BP. The reconstruction also suggests that significant climate warming took place during the twentieth century. Cladocerans mostly associated with warm periods included B. longirostris and Pleuroxus uncinatus, whereas Alona affinis, A. quadrangularis, and C. cf. sphaericus were associated with colder climate. Compared to a reference Chironomidae-inferred T (Jul) reconstruction from the same region, discrepancies were apparent in amplitude of temperature change, as the temperature variability in the cladoceran-based record was muted until similar to 200 cal BP. During the LIA, increased ephippia and body size agreed with the temperature reconstruction, but suggested a severely shorter open-water season and reduced water temperatures compared to the preceding late Holocene episodes, even though the cladoceran T (Jul) showed quite similar temperatures for these periods. Our results suggest that fossil cladoceran assemblages, ephippia, and morphological attributes respond sensitively to long-term climate fluctuations and this record reflects well the major climate events of the late Holocene and provides realistic paleoclimatic estimates for maritime southern Finland.					; Rantala, Marttiina/GWV-8049-2022	Luoto, Tomi/0000-0001-6925-3688; Nevalainen, Liisa/0000-0001-6837-8753; Rantala, Marttiina/0000-0002-3231-5926													0921-2728	1573-0417				OCT	2015	54	2-3					239	252		10.1007/s10933-015-9849-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-015-9849-z													WOS:000361059100005

Effects of climate change on late-season growth and survival of native and non-native species of watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spp.): Implications for invasive potential and ecosystem change	AQUATIC BOTANY												The combined effects of global climate change and invasive species can lead to shifts in ecosystem structure and function. We assessed how a rise in water temperature influenced the late-season growth, survival, and invasive potential of an invasive aquatic plant, Eurasian watermilfoil, (Myriophyllum spicatum Linnaeus) in comparison to a co-occurring native species northern watermilfoil (Myriophyllum sibericum Komarov). We examined the interrelationship between water temperature, watermilfoil species, and the aquatic ecosystem including periphyton growth and zooplankton abundance. The study was conducted using replicated mesocosms (37851), with water heaters used to provide a range of temperatures. Late-season shoot survival of M. sibiricum was lower than that of M. spicatum across all temperature treatments with a mean survival rate of 24% and 96% respectively. M. sibiricum also showed significantly slower rates of plant growth (mean growth of 3.3 cm over the duration of the field season compared to 7.6 cm for M. spicatum) and reduced vigor compared to M. spicatum, with an average of less than half the number of growing meristems. Zooplankton densities averaged over 20 times higher in mesocosms with M. sibiricum compared to those with M. spicatum. Periphyton biomass was best explained by water temperature with an increase in growth in warmer water. Our study suggests that warming water as a result of climate change will extend the growing season for M. spicatum, but not for M. sibiricum. This could provide the former species with a competitive advantage over the latter. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Nevertheless, it is essential to constrain the signification of the pollen signal in such still under-exploited sediments. This article introduces a study carried out on the shelf of the Gulf of Lions. It aims at (1) highlighting the transport of pollen grains and the signification of the record in that area as well as at (2) discussing the pollen transport in various sedimentary contexts. The present study was carried out on surface water of the Rhone River, sea water and surface sediments of the shelf of the Gulf of Lions. The pollen content of the Rhone River and of its plume is in agreement with the season of sampling. On the contrary, the other samples of sea water did not contain any pollen grain. The samples from the surface sediments of the shelf are very rich in pollen grains and evidence the absence of sorting by currents except for Pinus. Indeed, its relative abundance increases when the fluvial impact decreases. The pollen signal (except Pinus) records the phytogeographic changes linked to the different drainage basins. The riparian woodland is over-represented at the Rhone River mouth. In front of the Pyreneo-languedocian rivers, Mediterranean xerophytes pollen grains are more abundant. From these results and from others taken in the literature, a model of pollen transport is built: all thin terrigenous sediments contain pollen grains essentially transported by rivers while autochthonous sediments (i.e., found in closed lakes or marine pelagic sediments) contain pollen grains brought by wind. Small closed lakes (or peat bogs) pollen spectra document local floras while those from pelagic marine sediments document floras from several hundred square kilometres. (c) 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Accordingly, nematode communities inhabiting periphyton were investigated at gradual water depths (50, 150 and 250 cm) in three Swedish lakes showing graded trophic states. It was hypothesized that: (1) nematode density correlates positively with increasing nutrient availability and negatively with increasing depth; (2) increasing nutrient availability favors species and feeding type richness; (3) increasing depth favors deposit-feeders; and (4) differences in the algal composition of the periphyton affect the diet of algal-feeders. Our results showed that the biomass of periphytic algae increased with nutrient availability and decreased with increasing depth. Nematode density also increased with increasing trophic state. Species richness decreased with increasing depth in the investigated oligotrophic lake, while the opposite pattern was determined in the other two lakes. Lake trophic state significantly affected the trophic structure of the nematode community, with more algal-feeders occurring in the eutrophic lake whereas chewers were found only in the meso- and eutrophic lakes. Water depth was also shown to influence nematode feeding type structure, as in all lakes the abundance of deposit-feeders was greater at increasing depth. While diatoms dominated the periphytic algal community at all lakes and depths, analyses of the gut pigment content of nematodes showed that their diet shifted toward green algae in the oligotrophic lake and in shallow zones of the mesotrophic lake.

Mercury biomagnification in the food web of a neotropical stream	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Anthropogenic and natural mercury (Hg) contamination have been a major concern in South America since the early 1900s, but it remains unclear whether Hg levels pose a hazard to human health in regions that lack point sources. We studied Hg biomagnification patterns in the food web of Rio Las Marias, an Andean piedmont stream in northern Venezuela, which supports a major subsistence fishery. Mercury concentrations and trophic positions in the food web (based on stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon) were characterized for 24 fish species representing seven trophic guilds (piscivore, generalized carnivore, omnivore, invertivore, algivore, terrestrial herbivore, detritivore). Mercury showed significant biomagnification through the food web, but vertical trophic position explained little of the variation. Muscle Hg concentrations also increased with body mass across the food web. Trophic guild assignments offered a useful alternative to explicit analysis of vertical trophic position; piscivores showed the highest Hg concentrations and terrestrial herbivores had the lowest. There were no consistent seasonal differences in Hg concentrations within the 5 species sampled during both the wet and dry seasons, suggesting that bioavailability is unaffected by strong seasonal variation in rainfall. From a human health perspective, many medium- to large-bodied species that are commonly eaten had Hg concentrations that exceeded International Marketing Limit (IML) (0.5 mu g/g) and World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines (0.2 mu g/g) for consumption. We conclude that Hg concentrations may pose a health concern for local subsistence fishermen and their families. Our results suggest a need to perform risk assessment and better understand contaminant levels in subsistence and commercial fisheries even in areas that lack known Hg point sources.

Nevertheless, the driving factors of the carbon dioxide budget remain disputed, and the impact of freeze-thaw process on carbon release is still unclear due to the harsh climate and lack of monitoring data. To clarify the primary factors affecting the alpine meadow ecosystems and to examine the impact of freeze-thaw on carbon release, we employed the LI-8150 automated continuous measurement system. This system, in conjunction with eddy covariance meteorological data, The Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) model, and multiple stepwise regression analysis, were used to analyze the seasonal variations in carbon flux (e.g., net ecosystem carbon exchange [NEE], gross primary productivity [GPP], and ecosystem respiration [R-eco]). We also investigate the carbon sources and sinks in the alpine meadow ecosystem, as well as the predominant factor of carbon flux. Our findings include: (1) the carbon sources and sinks in the alpine meadow ecosystem shift seasonally on monthly and daily scales. On a monthly scale, the ecosystem functions as a moderate carbon sink in June, July, August, and September and as a weak carbon source from October through May. (2) Overall, the alpine meadow ecosystem, located in the northeastern Qinghai Lake basin, serves as a weak carbon sink (-58.53 g C m(-2) year(-1)). (3) Soil temperature is the primary factor driving most variations observed in NEE, Reco, and GPP, contributing 48.05 %, 78.61 %, and 65.05 %, respectively. Soil temperature, soil water dynamics influenced by freeze and thaw processes, and their interaction with plant growth collectively play a crucial role in regulating the carbon sources and sinks in ecosystems. We provide first-hand observational data for monitoring the carbon sources and sinks in the alpine meadow ecosystem of the Tibet Plateau, as well as offer future guidance for studying the carbon budget of the Tibet Plateau.					; , Haitao/JMQ-3106-2023	wang, pei/0000-0002-8647-253X; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				DEC 1	2023	156								111116	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.111116	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.111116		OCT 2023											WOS:001095908700001
J	Gascón, S; Boix, D; Sala, J				Gascon, S.; Boix, D.; Sala, J.			Are different biodiversity metrics related to the same factors? A case study from Mediterranean wetlands	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Conservation biology is mainly interested in prioritizing sites on the basis of their high biodiversity. Although species richness is a commonly used criterion, it does not take other crucial aspects of identifying conservation priority sites into account, such as rarity or taxonomic distinctness. Additionally, management efforts are usually focused on the conservation of a small number of species, mainly vertebrates. However, the biodiversity patterns of these faunal groups and the main factors which determine them cannot be generalized to other faunal groups (e.g. aquatic invertebrates). Therefore. the objectives of the present study are: (1) to compare the response of 11 biodiversity metrics in order to know which ones are redundant, (2) to identify key environmental factors for biodiversity, and (3) to find out whether sites with high biodiversity values also have a good habitat condition and high protection status. The study was done at assemblage level (crustaceans and insects) in 91 wetlands in the NE Iberian Peninsula. Regression tree models were used to identify the key factors influencing biodiversity, including water, wetland and landscape characteristics as explanatory variables. Generalized Linear models were used to establish the relationship between biodiversity metrics and protection status and habitat condition. The results obtained by the two sampled seasons were compared. Conductivity was the main factor influencing biodiversity metrics. Positive significant relationships were found between some biodiversity metrics and wetland habitat condition, whereas there were none for protection status, indicating the inadequacy of conservation policies to protect wetland aquatic invertebrate biodiversity.

This study reinterpreted sedimentary processes in Changshou Lake of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area in China by combining a rainfall erosivity index with multiple tracing proxies, and the impacts of natural and anthropogenic drivers on sediment production were also explored. Erosive rainfalls with low frequency and large magnitude in the rainy season contribute to a substantial proportion of annual total rainfall, which thus can be used to infer erosion and sediment yield events. The sedimentary chronology was determined by comparing rainfall erosivity index with depth distribution of Cs-137 and absolute particle size, which revealed annual sedimentation rates ranging from 1.1 to 2.3 cm a(-1). The multi-proxy dating index and variation of sedimentation rate divided the sediment profile into three major periods. The reference period (1956-1982) displays low variability of TOC, TN, trace metal concentrations, and mean sedimentation rate. In the stressed period (1982-1998), industrial and sewerage discharge led to input and deposition of TOC, TN, and trace metals (e.g., Cd, Co, Cu, Cr, and Ni). The highest annual sediment accumulation rate of 2.3 cm a(-1) may be ascribed to the 1982 big flood event. In the present period (1998-2013), increased TOC, TN and decreased trace metals in the top layers of the sediment core indicated changes in lake ecology. Fish farming promoted algal growth and primary productivity which caused eutrophication until 2004-2005. The reduced mean sedimentation rate of 1.7 cm a(-1) between 1998 and 2004, and thereafter, may be attributed to soil and water conservation and reforestation policies implemented in the Longxi catchment. Human activities such as deforestation, cultural and industrial revolution, and lake eutrophication associated with fish farming since 1989, therefore led to appreciable limnological variations. Overall, the dated sedimentary profile from Changshou Lake displays high consistency with archived historical events and reflects the impact of both natural and anthropogenic controls on sediment production.					shi, zhonglin/LNQ-3370-2024; Anjum, Raheel/J-1857-2017; Collins, Adrian/V-5938-2018	Anjum, Raheel/0000-0003-0752-0415; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2018	25	18					17620	17633		10.1007/s11356-018-1916-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-1916-3								29667055					WOS:000436879200036

Bacillariophyta, especially benthic pennales (corresponding to the functional group TB), were dominant in most of the study area. Cyanobacteria (specifically indicated by the functional groups M and S1), which are typically found in lake environments, were also found in the main stream of the River Treene. Furthermore, Euglenophyta (represented by the functional groups W1 and W2) showed a higher percentage in the headwaters. A redundancy analysis indicates that the land-use pattern and physiochemical condition co-contributed to the phytoplankton community variance. The total explained variance (68.4 %) of phytoplankton data was partitioned into three parts: purely physiochemical factors contributed to 24.1 % of the explanation, followed by land-use characteristics (15.6 %), and their shared effects (28.7 %). The functional groups W1 and W2 exhibited a strong positive correlation to the percentage of agricultural land use. The percentages of urban land use and phosphate concentration in the stream were interrelated with the functional groups Lo and M, which indicates mesotrophic to eutrophic water conditions. The unexplained variance (31.6 %) may result from hydrological regimes, which will be taken into account in subsequent studies.					; Fohrer, Dr., Nicola Fohrer/C-6313-2011; Fohrer, Dr., Nicola/C-6313-2011; Tao, Cheng-an/H-4232-2014	Wu, Naicheng/0000-0002-5652-3631; Qu, Yueming/0000-0002-3742-8233; Fohrer, Dr., Nicola/0000-0002-7456-6301; 													1863-9135					JUN	2018	191	3					175	187		10.1127/fal/2018/1125	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/fal/2018/1125													WOS:000437048300001

Groundwater exchanges near a channelized versus unmodified stream mouth discharging to a subalpine lake	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The terminus of a stream flowing into a larger river, pond, lake, or reservoir is referred to as the stream-mouth reach or simply the stream mouth. The terminus is often characterized by rapidly changing thermal and hydraulic conditions that result in abrupt shifts in surface water/groundwater (sw/gw) exchange patterns, creating the potential for unique biogeochemical processes and ecosystems. Worldwide shoreline development is changing stream-lake interfaces through channelization of stream mouths, i.e., channel straightening and bank stabilization to prevent natural meandering at the shoreline. In the central Sierra Nevada (USA), Lake Tahoe's shoreline has an abundance of both unmodified (i.e., not engineered though potentially impacted by broader watershed engineering) and channelized stream mouths. Two representative stream mouths along the lake's north shore, one channelized and one unmodified, were selected to compare and contrast water and heat exchanges. Hydraulic and thermal properties were monitored during separate campaigns in September 2012 and 2013 and sw/gw exchanges were estimated within the stream mouth-shoreline continuum. Heat-flow and water-flow patterns indicated clear differences in the channelized versus the unmodified stream mouth. For the channelized stream mouth, relatively modulated, cool-temperature, low-velocity longitudinal streambed flows discharged offshore beneath warmer buoyant lakeshore water. In contrast, a seasonal barrier bar formed across the unmodified stream mouth, creating higher-velocity subsurface flow paths and higher diurnal temperature variations relative to shoreline water. As a consequence, channelization altered sw/gw exchanges potentially altering biogeochemical processing and ecological systems in and near the stream mouth.

Generally, this type of forest develops in semihumid habitats where lacustrine basins are scarce, preventing documentation of the vegetation history and forest dynamics using a paleoecological approach. Here, we present a palynological record from the Santa Maria del Oro crater lake, located within the distribution area of the STDF and the adjacent dry oak forest which gives insight into the changes in diversity and human impact at this tropical site. Pollen data, in combination with geochemical analysis and microcharcoal data from a lacustrine sequence, are used to discuss vegetation change and diversity in the plant assemblages related to drought or anthropogenic activity over the last 5000 years. Our results show three distinct periods of drought in the basin, from 4200 to 3850, 3100 to 2300, 1570 to 1100 and 300 cal year BP, with changes in vegetation composition mainly related to a decrease in taxa diversity during these periods. Based on the presence of maize pollen, two periods of human activity (3790-2160 and 280 cal year BP to present) were detected with an increase in herbaceous pollen used as a surrogate for deforestation. These two disturbance periods, pre-Columbian and postcolonial, occurred during wet conditions in the basin. Our results highlight the correlation between El Nino events, drought and fire with changes in the composition and diversity of STDF.					; Tellez-Valdes, Oswaldo/ACA-8618-2022; Rangel, Blanca/B-6858-2008; Metcalfe, Sarah/H-9484-2013	Noren, Anders/0000-0002-5604-1085; Lozano-Garcia, Socorro/0000-0002-3579-175X; Ortega-Guerrero, Beatriz/0000-0002-3823-1926; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				MAY	2021	31	5					802	813	0959683620988054	10.1177/0959683620988054	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683620988054		JAN 2021											WOS:000637127600001

Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii is a planktonic heterocystous filamentous cyanobacterium initially assigned to the tropics but currently being found in more temperate regions such as Portugal, the southernmost record for this species in Europe. Cylindrospermopsin originally isolated from C. raciborskii is a cytotoxic alkaloid that affects the liver, kidney, and other organs. It has a great environmental impact associated with cattle mortality and human morbidity. Aiming in monitoring this cyanobacterium and its related toxin, a shallow pond located in the littoral center of Portugal, Vela Lake, used for agriculture and recreational purposes was monitored for a 2-year period. To accomplish this, we used the real-time PCR methodology in field samples to quantify the variation of specific genetic markers with primers previously described characterizing total cyanobacteria (16S rRNA), C. raciborskii (rpoC1), and cylindrospermopsin synthetase gene (pks). The results report the high abundance of both cyanobacteria and C. raciborskii in Vela Lake, with C. raciborskii representing 0.4% to 58% of the total cyanobacteria population. Cylindrospermopsin synthetase gene was detected in one of the samples. We believe that with the approach developed in this study, it will be possible to monitor C. raciborskii population dynamics and seasonal variation, as well as the potential toxin production in other aquatic environments.					; Vasconcelos, Vitor/A-8933-2008; Moreira, Cristiana/AAG-6828-2020; Martins, António/JRY-6309-2023; Freitas, Marisa/AAL-1421-2021; azevedo, joana/AAE-4868-2020	Antunes, Agostinho/0000-0002-1328-1732; Vasconcelos, Vitor/0000-0003-3585-2417; Moreira, Cristiana/0000-0001-9305-390X; Azevedo, Joana/0000-0002-3757-8143; Moreira, Cristiana/0000-0003-0860-2949; Vale, Micaela/0000-0002-4163-1170; Freitas, Marisa/0000-0003-1886-4942; Regueiras, Ana/0000-0001-8445-3004													0175-7598	1432-0614				OCT	2011	92	1					189	197		10.1007/s00253-011-3360-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-011-3360-x								21655982					WOS:000294821200018

The impacts of temperature on metabolism of phytoplankton such as nutrient uptake, death rate, and nutrient releasing from particulate nutrient are investigated. The ecological reproductive index is formulated to present a threshold criteria and to characterize the dynamics of phytoplankton. The positive invariance, dis-sipativity, and the existence and stability of boundary and positive periodic solution are established. The analyses rely on the comparison principle, the coincidence degree theory and Lyapunov direct method. The effect of seasonal temperature and daily temperature on phytoplankton biomass are simulated numerically. Numerical simulation shows that the phytoplankton biomass is very robust to the variation of water temperature. The dynamics of the model and model predictions agree with the experimental data. Our model and analysis provide a possible explanation of triggering mechanism of phytoplankton blooms.

For identification, we use variation in cumulative exposure for siblings from the same mother in subsequent pregnancies, which can be substantial due to the large seasonal and annual variations in the valley. Controlling for other air pollutants and individual confounders, we find strong evidence of reduced gestational age and increased probability of preterm birth resulting from PM2.5 exposure and estimate that the marginal effects are larger as cumulative exposure increases. We find weak evidence of an increased marginal effect of intensive exposure vs. total exposure. As cumulative exposure plays a larger role than intensive exposure, this indicates that policies which decrease average pollution levels can be more effective than policies targeted at peak pollution from a pregnancy perspective.																			1873-9318	1873-9326				MAR	2017	10	2					129	137		10.1007/s11869-016-0415-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11869-016-0415-2													WOS:000394285800002

Ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase, glutathion S-transferase, glutathion reductase, superoxide dismutase, catalase and carboxylesterase activities have been evaluated in liver of Cyprinus carpio. The level of OCPs were determined by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. No pesticide residue was determined in the water samples and residues in the sediments were higher than in the fish. In the wet season, the level of pesticides were higher than in the dry season. The concentrations of OCPs were highest in the Akyazi and Bozova areas. Enzyme analysis results showed that the activities were different from region to region and generally higher in Akyazi and Bozova than the other areas. This study is the first study that determines the levels of OCPs of sediment, water and fish in Ataturk Dam Lake and presents pesticide residue levels in the fish samples were above the maximum residue limits so could be a threat to the human health. The presence of OCPs indicates the need for continuous monitoring of the Lake fish population to safeguard the health of the consumers.

Optical and radar Earth observation data for upscaling methane emissionslinked to permafrost degradation in sub-Arctic peatlands in northern Sweden	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Permafrost thaw in Arctic regions is increasing methane (CH4) emissions into the atmosphere, but quantification of such emissions is difficult given the large and remote areas impacted. Hence, Earth observation (EO) data are critical for assessing permafrost thaw, associated ecosystem change and increased CH4 emissions. Often extrapolation from field measurements using EO is the approach employed. However, there are key challenges to consider. Landscape CH4 emissions result from a complex local-scale mixture of micro-topographies and vegetation types that support widely differing CH4 emissions, and it is difficult to detect the initial stages of permafrost degradation before vegetation transitions have occurred. This study considers the use of a combination of ultra-high-resolution unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) data and Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data to extrapolate field measurements of CH4 emissions from a set of vegetation types which capture the local variation in vegetation on degrading palsa wetlands. We show that the ultra-high-resolution UAV data can map spatial variation in vegetation relevant to variation in CH4 emissions and extrapolate these across the wider landscape. We further show how this can be integrated with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. By way of a soft classification and simple correction of misclassification bias of a hard classification, the output vegetation mapping and subsequent extrapolation of CH4 emissions closely matched the results generated using the UAV data. Interferometric synthetic-aperture radar (InSAR) assessment of subsidence together with the vegetation classification suggested that high subsidence rates of palsa wetland can be used to quantify areas at risk of increased CH4 emissions. The transition of a 50 ha area currently experiencing subsidence to fen vegetation is estimated to increase emissions from 116 kg CH4 per season to emissions as high as 6500 to 13 000 kg CH4 per season. The key outcome from this study is that a combination of high- and low-resolution EO data of different types provides the ability to estimate CH4 emissions from large geographies covered by a fine mixture of vegetation types which are vulnerable to transitioning to CH4 emitters in the near future. This points to an opportunity to measure and monitor CH4 emissions from the Arctic over space and time with confidence.

J	Cockayne, B				Cockayne, Bernie			Climate change effects on waterhole persistence in rivers of the Lake Eyre Basin, Australia	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												The episodic, seasonal hydrology of Lake Eyre Basin (LEB) rivers produce a series of waterholes which provide critical aquatic refugia and essential water supply during predominantly dry periods. This study used direct measures of water loss, regional meteorological data, and waterhole bathymetry to develop calibrated waterhole persistence models in a range of waterhole types throughout the Queensland portion of the LEB. Evaporation was a major driver of waterhole persistence, whereas the influence of other water balance parameters (e.g. groundwater discharge, seepage, vegetation utilisation) varied between waterholes and years. Estimates of waterhole persistence were extrapolated to the regional scale using a modelled time-series of waterhole level data and Landsat satellite imagery (1988-2019). Strong relationships were calculated between waterhole level and waterhole area (r(2) = 0.88) and waterhole level and number of waterholes (r(2) = 0.79) for all regional waterhole zones. Using these relationships and predicted evaporation rates under three possible future greenhouse gas scenarios, modelling showed that, by 2070, the number of persistent waterholes could reduce by up to 67% over 12 month period without flow. Similarly, reductions in waterhole area of up to 72% are possible under drier climate scenarios. These results potentially represent a significant risk to the aquatic ecosystems and other waterhole-dependent users for an already limited resource.																			0140-1963	1095-922X				APR	2021	187								104428	10.1016/j.jaridenv.2020.104428	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2020.104428		JAN 2021											WOS:000617998900006

Here, distribution and speciation of Hg in waters of a subalpine wetland (Dajiuhu) in China were investigated, and an initial model of the Hg geochemical cycle in the wetland was established based on Hg mass balance calculations. Concentrations of both total Hg (THg, 9.52 +/- 6.61 ng L-1) and total methyl mercury (TMeHg, 0.34 +/- 0.44 ng L-1) in the waters during the wet season were higher than in the dry season. The majority of THg was in dissolved form whereas most TMeHg was in particle form. The geochemical models suggested that, due to the wet deposition and surface runoff, the input of THg and TMeHg into the wetland in the wet season (222 and 2.74 g year(-1), respectively) was higher than that in the dry season (57.9 and 1.15 g year(-1), respectively). The output of THg and TMeHg from the wetland underground runoff in the wet season was estimated to be 154 and 2.51 g year(-1), respectively, and in the dry season was 15.9 and 0.43 g year(-1), respectively. Other losses of Hg were due to volatilization of Hg-0 from the sediment water (30.5 and 12.5 g year(-1) in the wet and dry seasons, respectively). The flux of the settling of particulate Hg in the wet season was higher than that in the dry season. The fluxes of Hg diffusion from the porewater were relatively low in comparison to the fluxes of inflows and wet deposition. The flux of oxidation was higher than reduction, while the flux of methylation was higher than demethylation. These results indicated that the elevated levels of THg and MeHg in the Dajiuhu wetland are a consequence of rainfall and surface runoff inputs.					; Yang, Shaochen/MZR-8226-2025; Huang, Xianyu/KZU-7738-2024	Liu, Jinling/0000-0002-9989-6550; 													0147-6513	1090-2414				JAN 15	2021	208								111507	10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111507	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111507								33120270					WOS:000604140900001

In this study, we surveyed sub-fossil chironomid assemblages in the surface sediments of 65 lakes and permanent pools in southwestern Uganda (including the Rwenzori Mountains) and central and southern Kenya (including Mount Kenya) to document the modern distribution of African chironomid communities along the regional temperature gradient covered by lakes situated between 489 and 4,575 m above sea level (a.s.l). We then combined these faunal data with linked Surface-Water Temperature (SWTemp: range 2.1-28.1 degrees C) and Mean Annual Air Temperature (MATemp: range 1.1-24.9 degrees C) data to develop inference models for quantitative paleotemperature reconstruction. Here we compare and discuss the performance of models based on different numerical techniques [weighted-averaging (WA), weighted-averaging partial-least-squares (WA-PLS) and a weighted modern analogue technique (WMAT)], and on subsets of lakes with varying gradient lengths of temperature and other environmental variables. All inference models calibrated against MATemp have a high coefficient of determination (r(jack)(2) = 0.81-0.97), low maximum bias (0.84-2.59 degrees C), and low root-mean-squared error of prediction (RMSEP = 0.61-1.50 degrees C). The statistical power of SWTemp models is generally weaker (r(jack)(2) = 0.77-0.95; maximum bias 1.55-3.73 degrees C; RMSEP = 1.39-1.98 degrees C), likely because the surface-water temperature data are spot measurements failing to catch significant daily and seasonal variation. Models based on calibration over the full temperature gradient suffer slightly from the limited number of study sites at intermediate elevation (2,000-3,000 m), and from the presence of morphologically indistinguishable but ecologically distinct taxa. Calibration confined to high-elevation sites (>3,000 m) has poorer error statistics, but is less susceptible to biogeographical and taxonomic complexities. Our results compare favourably with chironomid-based temperature inferences in temperate regions, indicating that chironomid-based temperature reconstruction in tropical Africa can be achieved.					; Heiri, Oliver/JCE-4598-2023; Vuille, Mathias/S-3906-2019	Heiri, Oliver/0000-0002-3957-5835; Vuille, Mathias/0000-0002-9736-4518; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				MAR	2010	43	3					413	435		10.1007/s10933-009-9339-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-009-9339-2													WOS:000275415900001

The bacterioneuston underlies extreme conditions at the air-water boundary, which may influence its dynamics in a different way compared with the bacterioplankton. In this study, we assessed quantitative changes in major bacterial groups of the surface microlayer (SML) (upper 900 mu m) and the underlying water (ULW) (0.2-0.5 m depth) of an alpine lake during two consecutive ice-free seasons. Analysis of the bacterial community composition was done using catalyzed reporter deposition FISH with oligonucleotide probes. In addition, several physicochemical parameters were measured to characterize these two water layers. Dissolved organic carbon was consistently enriched in the SML and the dissolved organic matter pool presented clear signals of photodegradation and photobleaching. The water temperature was generally colder in the SML than in the subsurface. The bacterial community of the SML and the ULW was dominated by Betaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria. The bacterial community composition was associated with different combinations of physicochemical factors in these two layers, but temporal changes showed similar trends in both layers over the two seasons. Our results identify the SML of alpine lakes as a microhabitat where specific bacterial members such as of Betaproteobacteria seem to be efficient colonizers.

J	Geerts, S; Raes, D; Garcia, M; Del Castillo, C; Buytaert, W				Geerts, Sam; Raes, Dirk; Garcia, Magali; Del Castillo, Carmen; Buytaert, Wouter			Agro-climatic suitability mapping for crop production in the Bolivian Altiplano: A case study for quinoa	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												An agro-climatic suitability library for crop production was generated by using climatic data sets from 20 to 33 years for 41 meteorological stations in the Bolivian Altiplano. Four agro-climatic indicators for the region were obtained by validated calculation procedures. The reference evapotranspiration, the length of the rainy season, the severity of intra-seasonal dry spells and the monthly frost risks were determined for each of the stations. To get a geographical coverage, the point data were subsequently entered in a GIS environment and interpolated using ordinary kriging, with or without incorporating anisotropy. The presented case study focuses on quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.), an important crop in the region that is cultivated during the short and irregular rainfall season and that is well adapted to the frequent occurrence of drought and frost. The GIS library was used to mark zones where deficit irrigation could improve quinoa production. With a data query, zones were delimited where the irrigation can be useful to stretch the length of the growing season beyond the limits of the rainy season and/or to mitigate intra-seasonal dry spells. Determined net irrigation requirements were used to assess the vulnerability of the delineated zones. Two regions with a high vulnerability, a severe drought risk and an acceptable frost risk are the eastern region of the Altiplano and the inter-salt depression region in the south. Together, they account for around one-third of the Altiplano area. In 1 year out of 2, irrigation in these regions can strongly improve crop production. The use of irrigation in other regions of the Altiplano will be less beneficial either because the irrigation requirements are low (region around Lake Titicaca), or because the frost risk is too high (the dry west, the south-west, and the region in between Lake Poopo and the Uyuni salt depression). Apart from the presented application, a general view on the climatic system of the Altiplano could be deduced from the library. The proposed routine in this study yielded a straightforward method to deal with large sets of detailed climatic information and to link them with practical agricultural advice. By redefining query limits and incorporating other data, the GIS library can be used for impact assessments of other agricultural practices and for studying the effects of climate change and of the El Nino Southern Oscillation on quinoa production in the delineated zones.

J	Barbiero, RP; Tuchman, ML				Barbiero, RP; Tuchman, ML			Changes in the crustacean communities of Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Erie following the invasion of the predatory cladoceran Bythotrephes longimanus	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The crustacean zooplankton communities in Lakes Michigan and Huron and the central and eastern basins of Lake Erie have shown substantial, persistent changes since the invasion of the predatory cladoceran Bythotrephes in the mid-1980s. A number of cladoceran species have declined dramatically since the invasion, including Eubosmina coregoni, Holopedium gibberum, Daphnia retrocurva, Daphnia pulicaria, and Leptodora kindti, and overall species richness has decreased as a result. Copepods have been relatively unaffected, with the notable exception of Meso cyclops edax, which has virtually disappeared from the lakes. These species shifts have for the most part been consistent and equally pronounced across all three lakes. Responses of crustacean species to the Bythotrephes invasion do not appear to be solely a consequence of size, and it is likely that other factors, e.g., morphology, vertical distribution, or escape responses, are important determinants of vulnerability to predation. Our results indicate that invertebrate predators in general, and invasive ones in particular, can have pronounced, lasting effects on zooplankton community structure.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				NOV	2004	61	11					2111	2125		10.1139/f04-149	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f04-149													WOS:000227073300007
J	Kitada, S				Kitada, Shuichi			Long-term translocation explains population genetic structure of a recreationally fished iconic species in Japan: Combining current knowledge with reanalysis	AQUACULTURE, FISH AND FISHERIES												Ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis) is an important freshwater fisheries resource and popular recreational fishing species in Japan that lives for only 1 year, with a single breeding season. To supplement increased recreational fishing demand for this species, more than 13 million wild-born landlocked juveniles are translocated every year from Lake Biwa into Japanese rivers, and more than 52 million hatchery-reared juveniles born from captive-reared parents have been extensively released. The translocation of landlocked juveniles and hatchery release has continued for more than 100 and 30 generations, respectively. Previous studies have reported that landlocked and amphidromous forms of Ayu easily hybridise, leading to concerns that the fitness of hybrid progeny would be reduced in the wild. However, limited information exists regarding the reproductive success of landlocked Ayu in translocated rivers, and to date no studies have evaluated the effects of translocation on population structure. Demonstrating that hybridisation occurs between the two forms is central to future management and conservation of this species. To address this, a literature search to summarise biological knowledge of Ayu and population genetic data screening was undertaken, and published genetic data sets covering a distribution range in Japan were reanalysed. Analyses provide strong evidence for very high gene flow between sampling locations. Genetic diversity is homogeneous in amphidromous samples. Bayesian admixture analysis infers widespread hybridisation in Japanese rivers (24 +/- 8%). Maximum likelihood admixture graphs detect two migration events from Lake Biwa to rivers in the northern Sea of Japan and Hokkaido. Analyses consistently indicate that hybridisation between translocated landlocked juveniles and native amphidromous Ayu occurs throughout Japanese rivers. These results are discussed in relation to the management of this species.

Their functional traits involving in defense and food utilization provides insights into the functional diversity and assembly of their communities. Tropical urban reservoirs are commonly subjected to intense fish culture and strong eutrophication, and rotifers become the dominant component of the zooplankton communities and play an important role in ecosystem functioning. Knowledge about the functional diversity and functional redundancy of rotifers is therefore of relevance for effective ecosystem management. In tropical reservoirs, we hypothesized that functional diversity and redundancy of rotifer communities are synergistically affected by top-down and bottom-up effects, and that they strongly change seasonally with environmental conditions at local scale as well as with connectivity between reservoirs at regional scale. To test these hypotheses, we investigated the seasonal dynamics of taxonomic and functional diversities in twenty-five tropical urban reservoirs. Traits of rotifers mainly associated with body size, feeding behavior, and defensive strategies were used to explore the drivers of functional diversity and functional redundancy. We found that, at the local scale, both taxonomic alpha and functional alpha diversities of rotifers increased from the wet to the dry season, whereas the functional alpha redundancy showed no significant change. Crustacean abundance (top-down effect) and phytoplankton biomass (bottom-up effect) were the dominant variables explaining the variation of taxonomic and functional alpha diversities. At the regional scale, both the taxonomic and the functional beta diversities of rotifer communities decreased from the wet to the dry season. However, functional beta redundancy increased, accompanied by a reduction in environmental distance, i.e., biological and physicochemical distance. Thus, weakened environmental heterogeneity and strengthened homogenization of biological selection resulted in a more similar functional trait composition than a more similar taxonomic composition between reservoirs.

At the scale of the exploitation territories of the Maya cities, the temporal variations of hydrological and sedimentary dynamics in response to anthropogenic and climate drivers are still poorly known. This constrains diachronic analyses of socio-ecosystems and, more particularly, of water and soil resources in the hinterlands. This manuscript analyses and presents a regional comparison of the dynamics of one of the most transformed hydrosystems and morpho-sedimentary systems by the societies of the Southern Maya Lowlands (SMLs), during the second half of the Holocene. It focuses on the lake basin of the polje named El Infierno bajo and its watershed, which was the main water storage area for the Maya city of Naachtun a large regional capital between 150 and 950 CE-, and which contains many remains of hydraulic and agrarian structures. This integrated palaeolimnological, geoarchaeological and hydrological approach, based on the analyses of morpho-sedimentary archives, LiDAR altimetry data and hydrological data, resulted in the construction of hydro-sedimentary baselines (pre- syn-and post-ancient Maya anthropogenic impacts). Currently, the intermittent lake (civale) of this bajo responds to strong seasonal and interannual hydrological variabilities, under climate control. During the past 5500 years, hydro sedimentary fluctuations were marked by the alternation of seven main hydrological periods (HP), characterised by high and low lake levels (alternately perennial, intermittent and dry lake) and six main erosion and sediment transfer periods (ESTP), marked by strong and low alluvial and colluvial detrital inputs in the lowlands. Anthropogenic and climate forcings have independently or jointly controlled the hydrologic and sedimentary budgets of the lake basin. Lithofacies, depositional processes, accumulation rates and drivers of the anthropogenic detrital inputs the so-called "Maya clays"-, are analysed and quantified from-1500 BCE to-1150 CE. It thus reveals one of the longest periods of occupation and exploitation of natural resources of the SMLs, for over 2500 years during the Preclassic, Classic and Post classic Maya periods. The hydro-sedimentary dynamics in the bajos of the SMLs Elevated Interior Region (EIR), such as El Infierno, enabled the long-term exploitation of water and soil resources for agrarian purposes, thanks to the construction of hydraulic and agrarian palimpsest landscapes shaped by the socio-ecosystems.

Results showed significant morphological and genetic differences among P. flavescens from the four locations. The magnitudes of differences were unrelated to geographic distance, demonstrating spatially heterogeneous levels of genetic divergence. These results linked morphometric and genetic variation, showing a discontinuity of scale between currently defined management units and population structure of P. flavescens in Lake Erie, and support that P. flavescens might exist as one or more metapopulations.

Evaluation of Contamination Status and Health Risk Assessment of Essential and Toxic Metals in Cyprinus carpio from Mangla Lake, Pakistan	BIOLOGICAL TRACE ELEMENT RESEARCH												Although fish as a diet has many health benefits, metal accumulation in fish has been an increasing public health concerns across the world. The Cyprinus carpio samples were collected from Mangla Lake, Mirpur, Azad Kashmir, Pakistan, and analyzed for 18 essential and toxic trace metals. In edible muscles of the fish, average concentration (mu g/g) of K (3002) was the highest, followed by Na (648), Ca (435), Mg (227), and Zn (161). Relatively lower levels (mu g/g) were noted for Fe (16.9), Pb (6.05), Sr (4.01), Se (3.49), Co (2.90), Ni (2.37), Mn (2.29), As (1.48), and Cu (1.37), while least levels (mu g/g) were found for Cr (0.61), Cd (0.52), Hg (0.15), and Li (0.09) in muscles. Majority of the metals revealed higher accumulation in gills compared with those in scales and muscles. Mean levels of Zn, Mn, Co, Pb, As, and Cd in Cyprinus carpio muscles were found to be exceeding most of the international permissible limits in muscles for safe human consumption. Estimated daily/weekly intakes and hazard quotients/index suggested a high risk related to the intake of Cyprinus carpio from Mangla Lake due to heavy metal contamination. Likewise, target cancer risk (TCR) also indicated significant lifetime carcinogenic health risks to the consumers.

J	Ates, A; Demirel, H; Mergul, N				Ates, Asude; Demirel, Hulya; Mergul, Nihan			Risk Assessment and Chemical Fractionation of Heavy Metals by BCR Sequential Extraction in Soil of the Sapanca Lake Basin, Turkey	POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES												Sapanca Lake is an important drinking water source located by D-100 highway in the north and E-80 (TEM Anatolian Highway) and a railway line in the south. Heavy metal concentrations in roadside soils result from vehicle exhausts and the corroding metal parts of vehicles. Due to the difficulty of removing heavy metals from the soil, a significant pollution problem arises and this pollution also affects the water resources by means of rain. Although there are several industries, the highway located near the lake is the most important pollutant source for Sapanca Basin. Therefore, this study evaluated heavy metal concentrations, the chemical fractions of the metals and ecological risks (by using C-f, RAC and PERI) in the soil samples collected seasonally between 2015 and 2017 in Sapanca Lake Basin. Al and Fe were determined at very high amounts in all stations and the relationship between mean concentrations of other metals was determined to be Zn>Ba>As>Ni>Cr>Pb>Cu>Co>Cd. However, Zn, Ba, As, Ni, Cr, Pb, Cu, Co and Cd mean concentrations were determined as 87.63 mg/kg, Ba 86.87 mg/kg, 80.40 mg/kg, 58.62 mg/kg, 50.42 mg/kg, 41.90 mg/kg, 38.16 mg/kg, 13.98 mg/kg, 2.89 mg/kg respectively. Al, Fe, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn are mainly found in residual fractions in soil. According to the environmental risk assessment on the basis of soil stations, the 7th station has the highest GC(f) value, which means that the soil sample presents the highest environmental risk according to the contamination factors. On the other hand, Cd has serious potential ecological risk and As has considerable potential ecological risk in all stations.					; Ates, Asude/GYD-6823-2022; DEMIREL, Hulya/KHD-3760-2024	ATES, ASUDE/0000-0003-0934-0135; DEMIREL, HULYA/0000-0002-8128-3043; 													1230-1485	2083-5906					2020	29	2					1523	1533		10.15244/pjoes/101609	http://dx.doi.org/10.15244/pjoes/101609													WOS:000513486600002
J	Barasa, B; Wanyama, J				Barasa, Bernard; Wanyama, Joshua			Freshwater lake inundation monitoring using Sentinel-1 SAR imagery in Eastern Uganda	ANNALS OF GIS												In flood hazard assessment, little attention has been given to the seasonal observation of freshwater inundation using Sentinel-1 Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) images in the tropics. To assess these spatial variations, this study examined the inundation magnitudes and reflectance of riparian flora in the raining seasons (February-April and September-November) and dry-periods (May-August and December-January). The inundation areas were determined using an object-oriented classification algorithm, whilst the merits concerning the lake, riparian vegetation and shoreline were well-defined using backscatter-coefficient values. Findings indicated that the SAR images are practical to monitor inundation coverages and discern lake basin specific features such as highland areas, shoreline, water and riparian-vegetation. Seasonally, inundated sizes were comparatively higher in February (902 sq. km) and October (700 sq.km). Backscatter values of inundated parts varied from -16 dB to -19 dB, whereas those of riparian vegetation were higher in the months of May and August. This study hence displays a clear-cut correlation between riparian-vegetation, hydrology and climate variables.					barasa, bernard/AAC-2431-2019														1947-5683	1947-5691					2020	26	2					191	200		10.1080/19475683.2020.1743754	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19475683.2020.1743754													WOS:000540094800007
J	Dijkstra, ML; Auer, MT; Kuczynski, A; Lambert, R				Dijkstra, Marcel L.; Auer, Martin T.; Kuczynski, Anika; Lambert, Renn			Determination of bioavailable phosphorus in water samples using bioassay methods	METHODSX												The total phosphorus analyte (TP) has a long history of use in monitoring and regulatory applications relating to management of cultural eutrophication in freshwaters. It has become apparent, however, that the fraction of the TP analyte ultimately available to support algal growth varies significantly spatially (within a system), seasonally, and among systems. The algal bioassay methods described here provide an approach for determining the bioavailable fraction of the three operationally defined components of TP: soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP), and particulate phosphorus (PP) in effluents and tributaries discharging to lakes and reservoirs. Application of the technique facilitates a quantitative ranking and targeting of bioavailable phosphorus sources for management. One congruent method to fractionate particulate and soluble phosphorus (found in aquatic samples) into bioavailable and unavailable fractions was developed based on compilation, adaptation and expansion of two methods from the late 1970s and early 1980s. Detailed descriptions for culturing phosphorus-starved algae, sub-sampling schedules, kinetics determination, and data presentation are provided Reproducibility is demonstrated by replication and closure of a mass balance on phosphorus.

Additionally, detailed studies of the ciliate vertical distribution and feeding activity measured upon fluorescently labelled APP (picocyanobacteria) were carried out. The results were compared with those from a neighbour freshwater crater lake La Preciosa and with a meromictic karstic lake La Cruz (Cuenca, Spain). The ciliate vertical distribution within the water column was very well defined: During the first decade, the benthic population was frequently found throughout a developing stratification of the lake. The established stratification of the lake turned the conditions favourable for the formation of an oxycline / hypolimnion population, typically, several meters below the deep chlorophyll maximum (formed basically by diatoms); the population preferred the layers without detectable dissolved oxygen. However, an observed gradient of light (PAR) could support both oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis. Late stratification after deepening of the thermocline reduced the layers with S. teres population to a minimum apparently due to the drastic change in physicochemical conditions within a metalimnion, coupled with an oxycline, and limited to 1 to 2 meters; microstratification was found. Last years, the very bottom population disappeared or it was reduced and the late stratification S. teres peaks were smaller or did not appeared. Generally, S. teres oxycline / anoxic hypolimnion population was observed from June through November. Optimum picoplankton numbers in conditions that supported the ciliate growth were found: The ciliate was peaking at APP of 0.6 to 1 x 10(5) cells mL(-1); the optimum of HPP was observed round 1.4 x 10(6) cells mL(-1). S. teres was efficiently feeding upon picocyanobacteria in numbers of 10(5) cells mL(-1) reaching the clearance rate of 2000 nL cell(-1)h(-1), which represented in average 130 to 210 cells cell(-1)h(-1) ingested. Feeding upon purple sulphur bacteria was observed but only during the end of the lake stable stratification when the ciliate population was already dropping. On the other hand, the volume specific clearance of S. teres upon picocyanobacteria (10(3) h(-1)) did not support the hypothesis that they could serve as a sole prey. Feeding upon eukaryote phytoplankton (chlorophytes Monoraphidium minutum, diatoms Cyclotella choctawhatcheeana) could be of higher importance that previously supposed. Additionally, a use of ingested and retained photosynthetic prokaryotes is hypothesized.

Long-term impacts of mid-Holocene drier climatic conditions on Bolivian tropical dry forests	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												The Bolivian Chiquitano dry forest is the largest block of intact seasonally dry tropical forest in South America and is a priority ecoregion for conservation due to its high threat status. However, the long-term impacts of drier climatic conditions on tropical dry forests are not well understood, despite climate models predicting increased droughts over Bolivia in the coming century. In this paper, we assess the impacts of drier climatic conditions during the mid-Holocene on the Bolivian Chiquitano tropical dry forest using fossilised pollen, phytoliths, macro-charcoal, and geochemical proxies from a sediment core from a large lake (Laguna Mandiore) on the Bolivia-Brazil border. Our results show that drier climatic conditions during the mid-Holocene caused a local-scale, ecotonal expansion of upland savannah at the expense of dry forest. Interaction between drier climatic conditions and fire regime likely exerted a stronger control over the position of the dry forest-savannah ecotone than edaphic factors. However, the majority of the dry forest within the lake catchment maintained a closed canopy throughout the drier conditions of the mid-Holocene, despite floristic turnover towards more drought-tolerant taxa. These findings imply overall resilience of the Chiquitano dry forest biome to future drought, albeit with floristic changes and upland savannah encroachment at ecotones.																			0033-5894	1096-0287				JAN	2020	93	1					204	224	PII S0033589419000553	10.1017/qua.2019.55	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/qua.2019.55													WOS:000506951900012

However, bimodal nighttime vertical distributions have been observed in various taxa. Mysid shrimp populations also display this pattern with one group concentrated in the pelagia and the other near the bottom. This may indicate alternative migratory strategies, resembling the seasonal partial migrations seen in birds, fishes and amphibians, where only a subset of the population migrates. To assess the persistence of these alternative strategies, we analyzed the nitrogen and carbon stable isotope signatures (as proxies for diet), biochemical indices (as proxies for growth condition), and genetic population divergence in the Baltic mysid Mysis salemaai collected at night in the pelagia and close to the bottom. Stable isotope signatures were significantly different between migrants (pelagic samples) and residents (benthic samples), indicating persistent diet differences, with pelagic mysids having a more uniform and carnivorous diet. Sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome subunit I (COI) gene showed genetic differentiation attributable to geographic location but not between benthic and pelagic groups. Divergent migration strategies were however supported by significantly lower gene flow between benthic populations indicating that these groups have a lower predisposition for horizontal migrations compared to pelagic ones. Different migration strategies did not convey measurable growth benefits as pelagic and benthic mysids had similar growth condition indices. Thus, the combination of ecological, biochemical and genetic markers indicate that this partial migration may be a plastic behavioral trait that yields equal growth benefits.					; Gorokhova, Elena/E-7105-2018	Ogonowski, Martin/0000-0002-7082-0990; Gorokhova, Elena/0000-0002-4192-6956													1932-6203					MAR 1	2013	8	3							e57210	10.1371/journal.pone.0057210	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0057210								23469185					WOS:000315897100015

Analytical results show that levels of chlorpyrifos residues were influenced by climate-induced rainfall pattern with higher levels reported during period of heavy precipitation with significant decrease during low rainfall. On average, the levels ranged between 14.8 and 32.8 ng g(-1) in sediment during rainy season compared to a range of 8.5-16.6 ng g(-1) in the dry season. Additionally, the mean concentration of chlorpyrifos in water ranged between 8.61 and 22.4 mu g L-1 during rainy season and below detection limit (bdl) -13.6 mu g L-1 in dry season as quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Meanwhile, independent t test analysis indicated that there was significant difference in concentration at p a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 0.05 between the seasons with respect to sediment and water samples. This demonstrated that climate-induced variations had considerable influence on contamination. While diazinon and carbofuran were equally applied intensively, their levels were below the detection limit in the all the samples analyzed. ELISA results were validated by the capillary-HPLC photodiode-array detector instrument analysis, and statistical comparison showed no significant difference between them. It was evident that chlorpyrifos residues determination in water and sediment by ELISA can be a useful strategy in environmental management and monitoring program, and a complimentary analytical tool to high performance liquid chromatography. Levels of chlorpyrifos detected in sediment and water were found to exceed recommended criteria for protection of aquatic life and preservation of water quality and may be hazardous if not regularly monitored.

J	Gawlik, DE				Gawlik, DE			The effects of prey availability on the numerical response of wading birds	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Reduced prey availability has emerged as a primary hypothesis to explain population constraints on wading birds in numerous wetlands around the world. However, there is almost no understanding of which component of prey availability (i.e., prey density or vulnerability of prey to capture) is affecting populations and whether the relative effects of each component differ among species. In this study, I manipulated prey density and water depth (i.e., prey availability) in 12 0.2-ha ponds to determine their relative effects on the numeric response of eight species of free-ranging wading birds (White Ibis, Eudocimus albus; Wood Stork, Mycteria americana; Snowy Egret, Egretta thula; Glossy Ibis, Plegadis falcinellus; Great Egret, Ardea alba; Tricolored Heron, Egretta tricolor; Great Blue Heron, Ardea herodias; and Little Blue Heron, Egretta caerulea). The experiment was conducted in a constructed wetland adjacent to, and west of, the northern tip of the remnant Everglades, in Palm Beach County, Florida, USA. Each pond was set to a water depth of 10 cm, 19 cm, or 28 cm, and was stocked with golden shiners (Notemigonus crysoleucas) at a density of either 3 fish/m(2) or 10 fish/m(2). Total bird use (all treatments pooled) increased from day 1 (day after stocking) to day 6, stabilized for several days at similar to280 birds, and then decreased until day 16, when bird use nearly ceased. Fish were depleted most rapidly in the shallow treatment and least rapidly in the deep treatment. The giving-up-density (GUD) of prey increased with increasing water depth. There was no significant difference among species in the slope of that relationship; however, a visual inspection of the data showed that differences in GUDs were becoming more apparent in the deepest treatment. At that depth, the White Ibis, Wood Stork, and Snowy Egret had higher GUDs than did the Glossy Ibis, Great Egret, Tricolored Heron, Great Blue Heron, and Little Blue Heron. Also, the first three species were affected significantly by both prey density and water depth, whereas the latter five species showed a decidedly weaker response to one or the other component of prey availability. The first three species were more abundant in the shallow treatments and the high prey density treatments, and they abandoned the study site before other species reached their maximum density. The feeding strategy of the first group appeared to be one of searching for new high-quality food patches rather than staying and exploiting food patches that were declining in quality. Species that employed a searching strategy also have shown the most severe population declines, suggesting that factors affecting bird density at feeding sites may also have affected population size.

The macrobenthic communities were dominated by small-bodied polychaetes (Paraonidae, Capitellidae and Cirratulidae) characterized by continuous year-round breeding, short life-spans, and fast turnover rates, which in turn regulated the standing stock in the communities. Principal component analysis and multiple-regression analysis demonstrate the distribution of macrobenthic communities in the study area to be mainly controlled by few local environmental conditions. Macrofaunal densities, diversity and feeding modes were significantly correlated with the total organic carbon (TOC; R-2 = 0.74; P < 0.001) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a; R-2 = 0.55; P < 0.05) content in the sediments. This study also suggests that feeding modes and NBSS can be used to detect and follow possible changes caused by natural perturbations such as glacial lake outburst floods or anthropogenic stressors associated with ecological impacts generated by the construction and operation of hydroelectric power stations in the Baker River.

At the Weddell Sea side, benthic communities are influenced by cold deep-water formation and seasonal sea-ice conditions, whereas the Drake Passage side experiences milder oceanic conditions and strong dynamics of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. This resulted in different surface primary productivity, which contrasted with observed benthic pigment patterns and varied according to the area studied: chlorophyll a concentrations (as a proxy for primary production) were high in the Weddell Sea sediments, but low in the surface waters above; this pattern was reversed in the Drake Passage. Differences between areas were largely mirrored by the nematode communities: nematode densities peaked in Weddell stations and showed deeper vertical occurrence in the sediment, associated with deeper penetration of chlorophyll a and indicative of a strong benthopelagic coupling. Generic composition showed some similarities across both areas, though differences in the relative contribution of certain genera were noted, together with distinct community shifts with depth in the sediment at all locations.

A total of 1,077 environmental sequences retrieved from the seven lakes were grouped into seven picocyanobacterial clusters, with two clusters newly described here. Each of the lakes was dominated by only one or two clusters, while different lakes could have disparate communities, suggesting low alpha diversity but high beta diversity of picocyanobacteria in these high-altitude freshwater and saline lakes. Several globally distributed clusters were found in these Tibetan lakes, such as subalpine cluster I and the Cyanobium gracile cluster. Although other clusters likely exhibit geographic restriction to the plateau temporally, reflecting endemicity, they can indeed be distributed widely on the plateau. Lakes with similar salinities may have similar genetic populations despite a large geographic distance. Canonical correspondence analysis identified salinity as the only environmental factor that may in part explain the diversity variations among lakes. Mantel tests suggested that the community similarities among lakes are independent of geographic distance. A portion of the picocyanobacterial clusters appear to be restricted to a narrow salinity range, while others are likely adapted to a broad range. A seasonal survey of Lake Namucuo across 3 years did not show season-related variations in diversity, and depth-related population partitioning was observed along a vertical profile of the lake. Our study emphasizes the high dispersive potential of picocyanobacteria and suggests that the regional distribution may result from adaptation to specified environments.					liu, yongqin/LFF-8837-2024; Hu, Anyi/E-6836-2018; Chen, Feng/P-3088-2014	Hu, Anyi/0000-0001-6226-2741; 													0099-2240	1098-5336				DEC	2014	80	24					7640	7650		10.1128/AEM.02611-14	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02611-14								25281375					WOS:000345223500021

A reconstruction of the thawing of the permafrost during the last 170 years on the Taimyr Peninsula (East Siberia, Russia)	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Reconstructing the temporal and spatial changes in climate on a seasonal basis during the past few centuries may help us better understand the modern-day interplay between natural and anthropogenic climate variability. The objective of this paper is to reconstruct the thawing of the permafrost at 71 degrees N in Arctic Siberia during the termination of the Little Ice Age and the subsequent Recent Warming period. Sediment samples from two lakes on the Taimyr Peninsula were analysed by high-resolution X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy at a scan resolution of 1 mm, and pollen analyses were conducted. The depth-age models of the cores were constructed using 210Pb and 137Cs activity according to the constant rate of supply (CRS) model. The lake sediment cover of these lakes began to form ca. 1840. We defined three periods of increased permafrost thawing during the last 170 years. The first maximum of permafrost melting occurred from 1870 to 1880, the second episode was from 1900 to 1930 and the third began between 1960 and 1965. During these periods, the maxima of permafrost melting occurred with a specific time lag following. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Deposition of Mo, Re and U under contrasting redox conditions; assessment of the [Re/Mo]sw redox proxy	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												We have analyzed concentrations of Mo, Re and U in the suspended particles, water column, underlying carbonate-dominated sediments and pore waters of two contrasting marine lakes situated on the Adriatic Coast of Croatia. Our data are the first for Re in these lakes. Rogoznica Lake is mainly euxinic, but subject to occasional oxygenation events, whereas Mljet Island's Malo Jezero is currently oxic year around but historically was seasonally euxinic. These characteristics make the lakes useful testing grounds for redox proxies. We devote particular attention to Re/Mo ratios, which have great promise as redox proxies. In marine sediments, the range of log[Reauth/Moauth] exceeds 2, and typical analytical uncertainty is +/- 0.05, providing resolving power similar to delta 98Mo. Authigenic [Res/Mos] ratios in sediments depend on varying supplies of three components: FeMo,Re)S4 coprecipitates, Fe(III) oxyhydroxides (plus Mn(III,IV) oxyhydroxides in some cases) and a still-uncharacterized Re-rich, Mo-poor component possibly of biological origin. Removal of the latter component explains a 50% depletion of Reaq without Moaq from Rogoznica's oxic waters. Water column concentrations of Moaq and Reaq, as well as [Res/Mos] ratios in Rogoznica's suspended particles are predicted successfully by a model that attributes these elements' removal from sulfidic seawater solely to coprecipitation in Fe(Mo,Re)S4, assuming a partition coefficient of 0.6. However, to predict sediment compositions, additional authigenic Mo supplied by mainly Fe (III) oxyhydroxides during sporadic oxygenation events must be considered. In Malo Jezero, sulfide concentra-tions are too low even in pore waters for precipitation of Fe(Mo,Re)S4. Consistent with earlier work, Uaq profiles are best explained by eddy diffusive transport to the sediment rather than capture by a precipitate in the water column. In Rogoznica pore waters, Moaq extracted through 0.45 mu m pore size filters exceeds by 50-fold con-centrations predicted by the model and measured previously with 0.15 mu m filters. This observation implies presence of ferrothiomolybdate colloids, which could be important, overlooked participants in the sedimentary geochemistry of Mo.					; Živković, Igor/L-3763-2016; Knezevic, Lucija/KYR-2580-2024	Knezevic, Lucija/0000-0002-2476-8570; Zivkovic, Igor/0000-0003-1774-1203; 													0016-7037	1872-9533				OCT 15	2023	359						176	190		10.1016/j.gca.2023.08.020	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2023.08.020		OCT 2023											WOS:001088440300001
