Effects of seasonal fluctuations of surface heat flux and wind stress on mixing and vertical diffusivity of water column in deep lakes	ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES												Accurate vertical diffusivity estimates at different stratification conditions are essential to correctly model vertical mixing of discharges into lakes. This study presents calculated variations in vertical mixing at different depths in Boulder Basin, Lake Mead, a deep reservoir over a four-year period using hourly weather data and 6-hourly measured temperature, conductivity, and DO profiles. Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE) and mixing intensities within Boulder Basin, calculated based on surface heat flux and wind speed were compared to water column stability and diffusivity over the study period. Analysis of surface heat fluxes showed that evaporation and longwave radiation were the main heat loss mechanisms in summer and winter, respectively. The lake showed strong summer stratification with stability numbers N-2 > 10(-4) s(-2), followed by increased water column instability during fall and eventually winter overturn, resulting in gradient Richardson numbers < 0.25 in the water column's top 50 m. The average calculated Wedderburn number was 45 during summer stratification, indicating that local winds were not sufficiently strong to generate upwelling. Burger numbers (S < 1) show that the Coriolis force significantly affects vertical mixing in Boulder Basin over the entire annual cycle. Diffusivities seasonally varied by 1 to 1.5 orders of magnitude (typically 5 x 10(-5) to 10(-3) m(2) s(-1)) in the upper water column, and typically varied by about 1.5 orders of magnitude (typically 3 x 10(-6) to 10(-4) m(2) s(-1)) in the deeper layers. Increases in winter diffusivities caused deep water dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations to increase from 6.0 to 8.5 mg L-1. Analysis of DO profiles and chloride and sulfate concentrations in the epilimnion and deep hypolimnion showed marked differences between epilimnetic and hypolimnetic concentrations during stratification. Similar epilimnetic and hypolimnetic concentrations during January and February confirm increased vertical mixing during these months. Use of hourly-based computed TKEs, and water column vertical diffusivity estimates in stratified and unstratified conditions over the entire annual cycle can help modelers to more accurately predict vertical mixing in large lakes.					; Saber, Ali/J-1066-2019	Saber, Ali/0000-0002-4618-5042; James, David Earl/0000-0002-4189-9855; 													0309-1708	1872-9657				SEP	2018	119						150	163		10.1016/j.advwatres.2018.07.006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2018.07.006													WOS:000441872800012

Total daily productivity and the relative importance of each autotrophic process varied and seasonal changes in vertical mixing, light availability and the biomass of phototrophs. Daily productivity was highest (2830 mg C .cntdot. m-2) and was dominated by OP in winter when the mixolimnion was isothermal, the biomass of phytoplankton was high, and the biomass of purple sulfur bacteria was low. During the summer-fall period of thermal stratification, phytoplankton biomass decreased, a plate of purple sulfur bacteria formed below the oxycline, and daily rates of dark CO2 assimilation (CP = 390-680 mg C .cntdot. m-2) exceeded phototrophic productivity (OP + AP = 200-370 mg C .cntdot. m-2). Total annual productivity was .apprx. 500 g C .cntdot. m-2, of which 60% was produced by phytoplankton (mostly in winter), 30% by chemoautotrophs (nitrifying and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria) and only 10% by photosynthetic bacteria.

Comparison of the supercooling points of questing Dermacentor variabilis adults in two populations on the Canadian prairies and implications for overwinter survival	EXPERIMENTAL AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY												A comparison was made of the supercooling points (SCPs) of questing Dermacentor variabilis adults from two populations located ca. 800 km apart on the Canadian prairies. This is also the first study to examine whether there are seasonal fluctuations in the SCP of questing D. variabilis adults. The SCPs of adult ticks from Lizard Lake Community Pasture, a recently established population in west-central Saskatchewan, varied over spring and summer, with the median SCP warming over time. In addition, the SCPs of ticks from Lizard Lake Community Pasture were significantly higher than those of adult ticks collected from Sandy Hook in Manitoba, a population that has been established for decades. The off-host survival of adults from Sandy Hook between summer and spring has been shown previously to be significantly greater than that of adults from Lizard Lake Community Pasture. The findings of the present study suggest that there may be geographical variation in the SCPs of D. variabilis adults which may be associated with differences in overwinter survival. The relatively low SCPs of questing D. variabilis adults, and the ability of some adults to survive off-host during winter, may be factors contributing to the range expansion of this tick species in Canada.

J	Ford, PW; Boon, PI; Lee, K				Ford, PW; Boon, PI; Lee, K			Methane and oxygen dynamics in a shallow floodplain lake: the significance of periodic stratification	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Temperature, dissolved oxygen and dissolved methane profiles were measured during autumn and summer, in a shallow floodplain lake in south-eastern Australia to determine the effects of water-column stability on methane and oxygen dynamics. The water column was well mixed in autumn. Strong thermal stratification developed in the late afternoon in summer, with top-to-bottom temperature differences of up to similar to6 degreesC. Methane concentrations in surface waters varied over a daily cycle by an 18-fold range in summer, but only by a 2-fold range in autumn. The implication of short-term temporal variation is that static chambers deployed on the water surface for short times (less than a day) in summer will significantly underestimate the diffusive component of methane emissions across the water-atmosphere interface. There was a marked diel variation in dissolved oxygen concentrations in summer, with the highest oxygen values (commonly 5-8 mg l(-1)) occurring in the surface waters in late afternoon; the bottom waters were then devoid of oxygen (<0.2 mg l(-1)). Because of high respiratory demands, even the surface water layers could be nearly anoxic by morning in summer. The concentration of dissolved oxygen in the surface waters was always less than the equilibrium value. When the water column became thermally stratified in summer, the dissolved oxygen and methane maxima were spatially separated, and planktonic methanotrophy would be limited to a moving zone, at variable depth, in the water column. In summer the whole-wetland rates of oxygen production and respiration, calculated from long-term (similar to 5 h) shifts in dissolved oxygen concentrations over a diel period, were approximately 6-10 and 3-6 mmol m(-3) h(-1), respectively. These values correspond to net and gross primary production rates of similar to 0.7-1.2 and 1.0-1.9 g C m(-3) day(-1), respectively.

Life histories of four dragonfly species (Odonata: Anisoptera) in northern New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND ENTOMOLOGIST												Life histories of four dragonfly species were investigated in the littoral zone of Lake Heather, a shallow sand dune lake near Kaitaia in the far north of New Zealand. All four species are self-introduced to New Zealand. Collections of larvae made in seven months from February 2011 to February 2012 were used to infer larval development. Aeshna brevistyla (Aeshnidae), the most abundant species, was semivoltine, Tramea loewii (Libellulidae) and Hemicordulia australiae (Corduliidae) were univoltine and, although difficult to interpret, our data suggest Diplacodes bipunctata (Libellulidae) was bivoltine with autumn and winter-spring generations. Adults of all four species were seen in December and February, T. loewii was also on the wing in late March, A. brevistyla in October and D. bipunctata in November.																			0077-9962						2013	36	1					8	14		10.1080/00779962.2012.752225	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00779962.2012.752225													WOS:000319568500002
J	Öden, MK; Bagdatli, MC				Oden, Muhammed Kamil; Bagdatli, M. Cuneyt			Spatial Evaluation and GIS based Mapping of Heavy Metal Pollution in Beşgöz Lake of Turkiye	ROCZNIK OCHRONA SRODOWISKA												In this research, Be & scedil;g & ouml;z Lake in Saray & ouml;n & uuml; district of Konya province, located in the Central Anatolia Region of Turkiye, was chosen as the study area. The changes in heavy metal concentrations in Be & scedil;g & ouml;z Lake in different periods were examined spatially. To determine the heavy metal concentrations of Be & scedil;g & ouml;z Lake, water samples were taken from eight different points representing the lake in four different periods (spring, summer, autumn, and winter). Al, Cr, Fe, Cu, Ni, and Zn concentrations were examined seasonally in Be & scedil;g & ouml;z Lake water. Heavy metal concentrations in the samples were determined on the ICP-MS device. The obtained concentration values were spatially modeled using spline interpolation techniques with ArcGIS 10.3.1, one of the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software. As a result of the research, the average of all periods was Al: 0.004 +/- 0.0012 mg/l, Cr: 0.023 +/- 0.0083 mg/l, Fe: 0.269 +/- 0.0286 mg/l, Cu: 0.115 +/- 0.0198 mg/l, Ni: 0.071 +/- 0.0099 mg/l, and Zn: 0.035 +/- 0.0085 mg/l. It was determined that the Fe, Cu and Ni concentrations in the lake water were higher than the upper permitted limit values. It is thought that the spatial modeling obtained from the study will significantly contribute to evaluating surface water resources and serve as an example for similar studies.

Pallas, 1766; Brachionus dorcas Gosse, 1851, Brachionus elevatus Michaloudi et al., 2018, and Brachionus fernandoi Michaloudi et al., 2018 based on the results of both morphological and molecular investigations. We applied this systematic approach to B. "calyciflorus" collected from lakes and ponds in various parts of Japan to examine spatial and temporal distributions of these species. We found that all four species indeed distributed in Japan. Among the species, B. fernandoi exhibited a somewhat different occurrence pattern and morphology. Generally, B. fernandoi appeared to occur in the winter-spring, while the other three species seemed to occur in the early summer-late autumn. A seasonal succession from B. fernandoi-dominant community to other species-dominant communities was observed in the same lakes/ponds. A statistical analysis showed that B. fernandoi-dominant species composition was also related to low temperatures. It was also found that the body of B. fernandoi was more elongated compared to those of other species. These results suggest that B. fernandoi is a distinct species in terms of morphology and phenology. Among the other three species, we observed a variation in the length of posterolateral spines. However, it was not clear if this variation is a trait that distinguish these species morphologically. In addition, some of these species co-occurred in the same lakes and ponds. The mechanism by which they coexist is a topic for future study.					; Makino, Wataru/GLS-2518-2022; Otake, Yurie/O-9348-2019; Urabe, Jotaro/ACO-1029-2022	Otake, Yurie/0000-0002-7607-4132; 													1439-8621	1439-863X				JAN	2025	26	1					153	167		10.1007/s10201-024-00768-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-024-00768-3		OCT 2024											WOS:001337353700001
J	Karlsson, J; Ask, J; Jansson, M				Karlsson, Jan; Ask, Jenny; Jansson, Mats			Winter respiration of allochthonous and autochthonous organic carbon in a subarctic clear-water lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We studied a small subarctic lake to assess the magnitude of winter respiration and the organic carbon ( OC) source for this respiration. The concentration and stable isotopic composition ( delta C-13) of dissolved inorganic carbon ( DIC) accumulating in the lake water under ice was analyzed over one winter (7 months). The DIC concentration increased and the delta C-13 of DIC decreased over time, with the greatest changes at the lake bottom. Winter respiration was 26% of annual respiration in the lake. Keeling plot analysis demonstrated that the delta C-13 of respired DIC varied spatially, high delta C-13 values occurring at shallow ( 2.5 m, -21.7%) compared with intermediate ( 4 m, -25.1%) and deep ( 6 m, -27.8%) locations in the lake. The variation in the delta C-13 of respired DIC was related to the variation in the delta C-13 of the sediments between locations, suggesting that sediment OC supported much of the winter respiration and that the dominant OC source for respiration was OC from benthic algae at shallow locations and settled OC, of predominately terrestrial origin, at deep locations. The respiration of OC from benthic algae constituted 55% of the winter respiration, equaling 54% of the primary production by benthic algae the previous summer. The study indicates the importance of temporal and spatial variation in respiration for the metabolism and net DIC production in unproductive high-latitude lakes; both allochthonous and autochthonous carbon can contribute to winter DIC accumulation and, consequently, to spring CO2 emissions from lakes.

Climate change and water in the UK - past changes and future prospects	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT												Climate change is expected to modify rainfall, temperature and catchment hydrological responses across the world, and adapting to these water-related changes is a pressing challenge. This paper reviews the impact of anthropogenic climate change on water in the UK and looks at projections of future change. The natural variability of the UK climate makes change hard to detect; only historical increases in air temperature can be attributed to anthropogenic climate forcing, but over the last 50 years more winter rainfall has been falling in intense events. Future changes in rainfall and evapotranspiration could lead to changed flow regimes and impacts on water quality, aquatic ecosystems and water availability. Summer flows may decrease on average, but floods may become larger and more frequent. River and lake water quality may decline as a result of higher water temperatures, lower river flows and increased algal blooms in summer, and because of higher flows in the winter. In communicating this important work, researchers should pay particular attention to explaining confidence and uncertainty clearly. Much of the relevant research is either global or highly localized: decision-makers would benefit from more studies that address water and climate change at a spatial and temporal scale appropriate for the decisions they make.					whitehead, paul/K-8689-2012; Bloomfield, John/ABE-7911-2020; Monteith, Donald/C-1534-2008; Daccache, Andre/M-8219-2019; Hannaford, Jamie/I-6095-2012; Kay, Alison/D-1981-2012; Ormerod, Stephen J/A-4326-2010; Knox, Jerry/A-4793-2010; Elliott, James/I-6862-2012; Hess, Tim/B-4482-2010; Weatherhead, Edward Keith/A-7593-2008; Hannah, David/B-9221-2015; Watts, Glenn/H-1255-2011; Stuart, Marianne/K-4233-2012; Ormerod, Steve/A-4326-2010; Durance, Isabelle/F-4487-2010; Weatherhead, Edward/A-7593-2008	Bloomfield, John/0000-0002-5730-1723; Kay, Alison/0000-0002-5526-1756; Watts, Glenn/0009-0005-6789-8550; Ormerod, Stephen J/0000-0002-8174-302X; Knox, Jerry/0000-0002-0473-6440; Wilby, Robert/0000-0002-4662-9344; Hess, Tim/0000-0001-5834-4269; Weatherhead, Edward Keith/0000-0002-8255-0078; Hannah, David/0000-0003-1714-1240; Daccache, Andre/0000-0002-4093-2182; Jackson, Christopher/0000-0003-2373-2098; Durance, Isabelle/0000-0002-4138-3349; Crossman, Jill/0000-0003-2679-5991; Hannaford, Jamie/0000-0002-5256-3310; 													0309-1333	1477-0296				FEB	2015	39	1			SI		6	28		10.1177/0309133314542957	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0309133314542957													WOS:000349285500002

In both years, the peak in abundance, due to intense asexual reproduction, fell at the end of winter, and was followed by mature individuals. The species was not collected during summer. Temperature was the main factor regulating the population through both sexual and asexual reproduction. In the second year, density was lower and correlated with a lower water level and a reduced vegetation development. Individuals were randomly distributed in periods of high abundance and contagious when density was low. Generation time was 15 days.

During stratification, C. phaseolus formed a layer with abundances up to 105 cells ml-1 at the metalimnion, where oxygen and sulfide were present simultaneously at low concentrations. Light at this depth was between 1 and 20% of surface incident radiation. Loss factors were studied during 2 years. Outwash was negligible most of the year, but could reach 30% of total losses during certain short periods in winter. Cryptomonas phaseolus was found to sink with speeds up to 55 cm d-1, which in accord with velocities calculated with Stokes'' law. There was a single sedimentation peak in spring accounting for 40-60% of total losses. Decomposition was the important loss factor for most of the year. Cryptomonas phaseolus cells were always actively growing, but losses balanced production for most of the study period. Average cell volume increased during mixing and decreased during stratification. Doubling times were minimal (7 d) in March at the onset of stratification and slowly increased through spring and summer, reaching a maximum just before mixing (around 50 d) and decreasing again through winter until the next March minimum.					; Gasol, Josep M/B-1709-2008; Pedrós-Alió, Carlos/H-1222-2011; Pedros-Alio, Carlos/H-1222-2011; Gasol, Josep/B-1709-2008	Guerrero, Ricardo/0000-0001-5019-9933; Gasol, Josep M/0000-0001-5238-2387; Pedros-Alio, Carlos/0000-0003-1009-4277; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	1987	32	2					285	298		10.4319/lo.1987.32.2.0285	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1987.32.2.0285													WOS:A1987H188200002

The absolute contribution rates of the inner sources to water temperature, pH, electrical conductance, total nitrogen, chlorophyll a and algal density were the largest in Caohai, while offshore sources are pH, electrical conductance, permanganate index, total phosphorus and chlorophyll a in Waihai. The eutrophication level is relatively high near the Xiyuan Suidao section, and the comprehensive trophic level indexes are 61.14, 64.45 and 64.45 in spring, summer and autumn, respectively, which all reach the state of moderate eutrophication; the comprehensive trophic level index is 55.72 in winter, which reaches the state of light eutrophication. The algal density near the Xiyuan Suidao and Luojiaying sections exhibited high levels, reaching a state of moderate algal bloom in summer. Spatial autocorrelation analyses highlighted significant positive and negative spatial autocorrelation for comprehensive Trophic Level Index and algal density, respectively, in Dianchi Lake. The High-High aggregation of the comprehensive Trophic Level Index and algal density was mainly concentrated in the Caohai, while the Low-Low aggregation of the comprehensive Trophic Level Index was primarily observed in the Waihai. Consequently, the risk of eutrophication and algal bloom outbreak in Caohai surpassed that in Waihai. Therefore, it is imperative to propose appropriate treatment measures based on the varying eutrophication level and algal bloom outbreak during different time periods and in distinct regions of the aquatic ecological environment in Dianchi Lake.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				DEC	2024	196	12							1217	10.1007/s10661-024-13425-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-024-13425-0								39560798					WOS:001360378600008

To contribute to this understanding, we analyzed the variability of soil moisture and its relationship to regional climate features. In this study we focused on the Poyang Lalce basin, which is located on the southern bank of the Yangtze River at the junction of its middle and lower reaches in Jiangxi Province. Using in situ soil moisture observations from Nankang and Hukou stations for the period from 1998 to 2012, we tested the regional applicability of the high-resolution long-term Essential Climate Variable (ECV) soil moisture (SM) dataset (1978-2013) by means of trend and correlation analyses. We only used the ECV SM product here that is based on passive microwave technology. Both observed and ECV SM data show the same variations on monthly and inter annual time scales including identical trend direction and strong correlations. To investigate the relationship between soil moisture conditions in the Poyang Lake basin and the Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH), correlation coefficients were calculated between the ECV SM data, the strength index (Is), and the northern limit index (IN) of the WPSH. The Is of the last autumn and winter shows a strong positive correlation with soil moisture during the subsequent rainy season. A strong WPSH in the preceding autumn and winter could result in more humid climate conditions in the Poyang lake basin during the following rainy season.

The results show that there was no significant variation in the euphotic depth (Z(eu)) across the four seasons, and no significant correlations between Z(eu) and potential influencing factors in seasons other than summer, suggesting that the water itself may be a major factor regulating the Z(eu) in general. Nevertheless, significant differences in Z(et), between the north region (NR) and the south region (SR) were observed in all seasonal tests except spring. This finding relates to a higher abundance of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the NR due to runoff, especially in the rainy seasons (summer and autumn). CDOM and its terrigenous component had an important impact on Z(eu) in summer, with the highest precipitation, and impacts from suspended solids and non-algal particles were also found in the NR in summer. The Secchi disk depth in the lake decreased clearly over the years, with significantly negative correlations with the increasing permanganate index and air temperature, implying that organic contaminants (CDOM and/or phytoplankton) are important regulators of water transparency. We estimate that the combined effects of climate warming and changes in land use and land cover are also indirect regulating factors. These findings should be considered in the protection of Lake Fuxian, owing to the importance of light penetration in aquatic ecosystems.

J	PIERSMA, T				PIERSMA, T			MORPHOLOGICAL VARIATION IN A EUROPEAN POPULATION OF GREAT CRESTED GREBES PODICEPS-CRISTATUS IN RELATION TO AGE, SEX AND SEASON	JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												A sample of 1450 Great Crested Grebes from the non-breeding season (August-March) which had accidentially drowned in fishing nets in Lakes Ijsselmeer, The Netherlands, was examined for age and sex differences in linear measurements, body mass, plumage, leg colour and gonad condition. During skinning and drying, wings of non-moulting birds decreased 2.41 mm in length, and wings of wing-moulting birds significantly more: 4.72 mm. The shrinkage is due to changes in the feather follicles and wing elements and not to changes in the actual feather length. Measurements of body, wing, bill, tarsus and keel lengths showed that males are larger than females. The sexual dimorphism is most pronounced in bill length (11% difference). Differences between juvenile (first winter)and adult birds are small or non-existent. A discriminant function incorporating wing and bill length (age groups lumped), correctly classified the sex of 89% of the original sample, and 85% of an independent sample of starved beached birds. The presence (in juveniles) or absence (in adults) of brown lesser upper wing-coverts is a reliable ageing criterion during the whole non-breeding season: only 2% juvenile females are misidentified. The striped head plumage of juveniles disappears during winter, but there is a large variation between individuals. Adults tend to have one or more greater upper wing-coverts with white inner vanes. Adults often have a wider white strip between eye and crest than juveniles. Adult males in summer plumage have longer crests and tippets than females. The colour and barring patterns of the inner tarsi vary greatly. Adult generally have a higher density of black bars than juveniles. Adult males appear to have two peaks in testis size: one in spring and a second one in autumn. The grebes weigh least during the wing moult period in August-September. Average body masses of all age an sex groups increase from September to November and then remain essentially stable until April. This pattern is very different from the peaked body mass pattern, described for dabbling ducks and waders wintering at the same latitudes, but resembles the body mass patterns of two sawbill species which also feed on fish in Lake Ijsselmeer.					; Piersma, Theunis/D-1871-2012	Piersma, Theunis/0000-0001-9668-466X; 													2193-7192	2193-7206				JUL	1988	129	3					299	316		10.1007/BF01643372	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01643372													WOS:A1988P734800003

High-turbidity events in Western Lake Erie during ice-free cycles: Contributions of river-loaded vs. resuspended sediments	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												High-turbidity events (HTEs) are common phenomena in shallow-water environments that can alter ecological interactions. The relative contributions of river input (external loading) vs. resuspension (internal loading) to the occurrence, duration, and influenced areas of HTEs are not fully understood in most systems, owing to the lack of long-term, source-specified sediment maps. Using a Finite Volume Community Ocean Model-based wave-current forced sediment model, we investigated sediment dynamics in the shallow, river-dominated Western Lake Erie during ice-free cycles (April-November) of 2002-2012. Results indicated that wind waves predominated sediment dynamics in the offshore areas, with river discharges causing substantial inshore to offshore gradients. Owing to varying wind waves and river discharges, both the mean and extreme sediment dynamics had distinctive seasonal variations. The basin was turbid during spring and fall, with frequent (> 15%), broad (O [10(2)-10(3) km(2)]), and more persistent (means of 3.2/4.4 d during spring/fall) HTEs caused mainly by resuspension events. During summer, the basin was clearer with occasional (< 1%), small (O [1-10(2) km(2)]), and short (mean of 1.5 d) HTEs near the mouths generated by pulsing river loadings. Although river loading rarely induced basin-wide HTEs, they were important during floods, enlarging the high-turbidity areas by 11.3%. Overall, by delineating the drivers of HTEs in Western Lake Erie, this study furthered the understanding of sediment dynamics in shallow ecosystems and provides a basis for investigating the ecological impact of sediments from different sources in river- and wave-energetic systems.

Fish dominated the annual diet, being found in 91.9% of seats. Insects, molluscs, crustaceans, and waterfowl were also substantial prey. Less agile, abundant shallow-water fish, such as a catostomid and various cyprinids, were the most common prey. Coregonine fish dominated the diet during their autumn spawning, were rarely eaten in summer when in the hypolimnion, but appeared to be preferred prey. In winter, with virtually no open water, the diet was less diverse and was dominated by cyprinid and gasterosteid fish. Such a fish fauna exists in small lakes, bog ponds, and beaver impoundments. We hypothesize that in winter, otters select water bodies, and consequently available prey, on the basis of shoreline substrate and morphology and relative ease of passage from air to water. Otter seats contained 14 of 18 fish species known to be in the study area. However, the contents of seats overestimated the diversity of fish species inhabiting individual lakes. Beavers were occasionally eaten by otters, but were a minor component of the diet.																			0008-4301					JUL	1994	72	7					1306	1313		10.1139/z94-174	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z94-174													WOS:A1994PT90000018

Contamination of Mercury during the Wintering Period Influences Concentrations at Breeding Sites in Two Migratory Piscivorous Birds	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Many aquatic fish-eating birds migrate long distances and are exposed to different mercury concentrations ([Hg]) during their annual cycle. Here we examined the importance of migration on [Hg] in two colonial migratory fish-eating bird species. We determined temporal trends of [Hg] and stable isotopes of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) during the annual cycle in Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) and Caspian Terns (Hydroprogne caspia) breeding in Lake Ontario by a repeated sampling of breast feathers and blood from recaptured individuals. We found an effect of previous winter [Hg], species, sex, and location to explain variations of Hg at breeding sites. This suggests Hg carryover from winter to summer periods and that variations of [Hg] in the summer are partially explained by [Hg] in the winter. Carryover of Hg among seasons and slow changes in [Hg] over time were found especially for individuals in high winter exposure groups, suggesting a slow depuration rate and a fast uptake rate for both species. In contrast, stable isotope values rapidly switched to reach equilibrium at a similar midpoint regardless of winter habitat or diet suggesting minimal carryover of isotopic signatures. The potential of Hg carryover from wintering sites indicates that Hg concentrations in birds at a given time may be influenced by previous exposure from distant locations.					; Campbell, Linda/C-1257-2009; Lavoie, Raphael/B-4039-2011	Lavoie, Raphael A./0000-0003-3381-3254; Kyser, Kurt/0000-0001-9667-4103; /0000-0002-0735-7227; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				DEC 2	2014	48	23					13694	13702		10.1021/es502746z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es502746z								25380025					WOS:000345803800017

When a habitat freezes solid: microorganisms over-winter within the ice column of a coastal Antarctic lake	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												A major impediment to understanding the biology of microorganisms inhabiting Antarctic environments is the logistical constraint of conducting field work primarily during the summer season. However, organisms that persist throughout the year encounter severe environmental changes between seasons. In an attempt to bridge this gap, we collected ice core samples from Pony Lake in early November 2004 when the lake was frozen solid to its base, providing an archive for the biological and chemical processes that occurred during winter freezeup. The ice contained bacteria and virus-like particles, while flagellated algae and ciliates over-wintered in the form of inactive cysts and spores. Both bacteria and algae were metabolically active in the ice core melt water. Bacterial production ranged from 1.8 to 37.9 mu g C L-1 day-1. Upon encountering favorable growth conditions in the melt water, primary production ranged from 51 to 931 mu g C L-1 day-1. Because of the strong H2S odor and the presence of closely related anaerobic organisms assigned to Pony Lake bacterial 16S rRNA gene clones, we hypothesize that the microbial assemblage was strongly affected by oxygen gradients, which ultimately restricted the majority of phylotypes to distinct strata within the ice column. This study provides evidence that the microbial community over-winters in the ice column of Pony Lake and returns to a highly active metabolic state when spring melt is initiated.					; Cory, Rose/C-4198-2016	Cory, Rose/0000-0001-9867-7084; MCKNIGHT, DIANE/0000-0002-4171-1533; Foreman, Christine/0000-0003-0230-4692; Dieser, Markus/0000-0001-8539-6646													0168-6496	1574-6941				JUN	2011	76	3					401	412		10.1111/j.1574-6941.2011.01061.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.2011.01061.x								21276026					WOS:000290314900001
J	WINNELL, MH; JUDE, DJ				WINNELL, MH; JUDE, DJ			NORTHERN LARGE-RIVER BENTHIC AND LARVAL FISH DRIFT - ST MARYS RIVER, USA CANADA	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Seasonal (summer, winter), diel (day, night), water column (surface, mid-depth, bottom), proximity to shore, weather (calm, windy), and among-transect differences in benthic and larval fish drift were measured during 1985 using 355-mu-m-mesh nets at three transects in the St. Marys River, the connecting channel between Lake Superior and Lake Huron. Overall, there were 65 benthic (xBAR density = 562/1,000 m3) and 5 larval fish (xBAR density = 383/1,000 m3) taxa collected. Occurrence of significantly higher densities of larval rainbow smelt at the middle transect, Lake Nicolet, indicates that areas above are important spawning sites for this species. Because densities declined at the downstream-most transect, Point aux Frenes, we concluded that rainbow smelt must be utilizing the Lake Munuscong area as a nursery area. Larval fish densities in summer were greater in the channel than nearshore, were greater at night than during the day, and higher in the upper half of the water column than near bottom. Densities of benthos and larval fish were greater in summer than winter. Chironomidae (52-82% of total) was the winter dominant, while Hydra (60%) dominated summer drift. Drift was greater at night than during the day for benthos and fish at two of the three transects, with benthic abundances greater at the bottom than at other depth strata. In summer, benthic drift was highest at shoreline stations and lowest in the channel; in winter there were minimal onshore/offshore differences. Current appeared to be the major factor causing elevated benthic drift rates in winter, while in summer, high winds with concomitant high waves and currents were the main factors producing significantly higher drift densities. High wind conditions produced a reversal of the usually observed diel trend of higher night benthic drift rates at one of the transects, and underscores the importance of wind in modulating drift rates in large river systems such as the St. Marys River. Overall, the multiple regression factors utilized were much more predictive of the drift of benthos than of larval fish.																			0380-1330						1991	17	2					168	182		10.1016/S0380-1330(91)71354-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(91)71354-3													WOS:A1991FZ32800004

Photosynthetic algae were maintained in a stable water column throughout winter darkness. The algal taxa overwintered in different ways in a species-specific manner. Typical vegetative cells were the most abundant form for all species found in the water column. Populations of one chlorophyte, Stichococcus sp., were observed in winter, but the species was absent in both summers. Two cryptophyte species were more abundant in winter than in summer. We interpret the increase in algal population size as evidence of heterotrophic growth in winter and of mixotrophic behavior throughout the year. For two chlorophyte species, some portion of the population had a distinctive morphology, for example, many Chlamydomonas subcaudata Wille. formed akinetes, whereas many Chlorella sp. contained a large amount of starch or other storage material. During winter, vegetative cells of the most abundant cyanobacterial species, Phormidium angustissimum West et West, occurred at the depth of the summer maximum and at depths below the oxycline. The presence of P. angustissimum below the oxycline may have resulted from the accumulation of settling cells at a depth with a greater density. In contrast to the settling of P. angustissimum, the general absence of the other algal species below the oxycline in winter indicated that these species were not influenced by overwinter settling.

Sightings and recoveries obtained from 1488 color-marked males during 1973-1975 and 3789 banded males and females during 1973-1977 suggested 2 principal migration corridors: one extending eastward from Pools 7 and 8 to the eastern Great Lakes and southeast to the Mid-Atlantic Region and another southward from Pools 7 and 8 to the lower Mississippi Valley, Gulf Coast and east Texas regions. These discrete populations stage concurrently on Pools 7 and 8 during the fall, but winter in different areas of the Atlantic, Mississippi and Central flyways. Populations staging on Pool 19 were not discrete from those staging on Pools 7 and 8. A continual turnover of birds passing through these staging areas was indicated. Canvasbacks wintering in the Mississippi and Central flyways were widely dispersed among a variety of habitats, canvasbacks wintering in the Atlantic Flyway were concentrated in a few traditional habitats. Canvasbacks exhibited strong fidelity to wintering areas. Distribution patterns and population attributes of canvasbacks during fall and winter may be explained by the predictability of natural foods and their ability to exploit these foods.																			0022-541X	1937-2817					1983	47	3					741	753		10.2307/3808609	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3808609													WOS:A1983QZ57700015

Over the past decade (2013-2022), amid economic development and environmental changes, the water environment of Poyang Lake has encountered complex challenges. This study evaluated the water quality of Poyang Lake in a recent 10-year span by the water quality index (WQI), trophic level index (TLI) and a newly constructed comprehensive evaluation index, and it analyzed the trend of water quality change under extreme events. Meanwhile, the main factors affecting the water quality of Poyang Lake were analyzed by partial least squares (PLS), a multivariate statistical method that accounts for multicollinearity. The results indicate that: (1) The water quality of Poyang Lake in summer and autumn is slightly worse than that in spring and winter. Each water quality index reflects the distinct states of the water environment in Poyang Lake. (2) Each water quality evaluation index responds differently to influencing factors. (3) Extreme flood and drought events have markedly different impacts on the water environment of Poyang Lake, exhibiting significant spatial heterogeneity. Domestic sewage discharge and total water resources have a relatively great impact on the water environment of Poyang Lake. The results of this study provide important insights for water quality management and policy formulation in Poyang Lake, supporting sustainable regional development.

J	Imfeld, N; Hufkens, K; Broennimann, S				Imfeld, Noemi; Hufkens, Koen; Broennimann, Stefan			Extreme springs in Switzerland since 1763 in climate and phenological indices	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Historical sources report manifold on hazardous past climate and weather events that had considerable impacts on society. Studying changes in the occurrence or mechanisms behind such events is, however, hampered by a lack of spatially and temporally complete weather data. In particular, the spring season has received less attention in comparison to summer and winter but is nevertheless relevant, since weather conditions in spring can delay vegetation and create substantial damage due to late-frost events. For Switzerland, we created a daily high-resolution (1 x 1 km 2 ) reconstruction of temperature and precipitation fields from 1763 to 1960 that forms, together with present-day meteorological fields, a 258-year-long gridded data set. With this data set, we study changes in long-term climate and historical weather events based on climate and phenological indices focusing on the spring season.Climate and phenological indices show few changes in the mean during the first 200 years compared to the most recent period from 1991 to 2020, where climate change signals clearly emerged in many indices. We evaluate the climate and phenological indices for three cases of extreme spring weather conditions: an unusually warm spring, two late-frost events, and three cold springs. Warm springs are much more frequent in the 21st century, but a very warm and early spring also occurred in 1862. Spring temperatures, however, do not agree on how anomalously warm the spring was when comparing the Swiss temperature reconstruction with reanalyses that extend back to 1868. The three springs of 1785, 1837, and 1853 were particularly cold, with historical sources reporting, for example, prolonged lake freezing and abundant snowfall. Whereas the springs of 1837 and 1853 were characterized by cold and wet conditions, in the spring of 1785 wet days were below average, and frost days reached an all-time maximum, in particular in the Swiss Plateau, indicating inversion conditions. Such conditions are in line with a high occurrence of northeasterly and high-pressure weather types and historical sources describing Bise conditions, a regional wind in the Alpine area related to inversions. Studying such historical events is valuable, since similar atmospheric conditions can lead to cold springs affecting vegetation growth and agricultural production.

Earlier data on species composition and species richness were confirmed, with a few new species reported from either further field collections or the hatching of dried lake muds. A summer filling as against almost regular previous autumn-winter fillings made only a minor difference in faunas, though insects and phyllopods, for different reasons, were less prevalent in the drier years. The fauna of these inland saline lakes is not only biogeographically different from those in southern Australia, but is adapted to a more extreme and irregular environment.																			0018-8158						1998	381						31	42		10.1023/A:1003267221960	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003267221960													WOS:000078946900006

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of sex on the locomotor activity rhythm of this species. Locomotor activity rhythm of males and females of this species was recorded during each season under light-dark cycle (nLD) at a constant temperature of 18 +/- 0.5 degrees C. Results showed that both males and females of H. reaumurii exhibited a day activity in late winter and in spring and a crepuscular activity during the other seasons. Results showed also that the locomotor rhythms of males and females were controlled by an endogenous component with circadian period. Furthermore, locomotor rhythm was more stable and better defined in males than in females during spring under constant darkness. The most important locomotor activity time (alpha) was recorded in winter and spring whatever the sex. However, our finding demonstrated that males were more active than females in late winter. On the other hand, females were more active than males during spring. The variation of activity patterns according to the sexes and seasons is discussed.

J	Jin, X; Rong, N; Zhang, WQ; Meng, X; Shan, BQ				Jin, Xin; Rong, Nan; Zhang, Wenqiang; Meng, Xin; Shan, Baoqing			Bioavailability of organic phosphorus in an eutrophic lake: Insights from an in-situ experiment	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The bioavailability of organic phosphorus (Porg) in surface sediments of an eutrophic lake was studied in an in-situ experiment. On the temporal scale, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) in the surface water showed an initial decrease and then increased in western and middle parts of the lake. In contrast, the SRP remained about 0.22 mg L-1 throughout the year in the eastern area of the lake. Four Porg compounds, phosphonate, orthophosphate monoesters, phospholipids and deoxyribonucleic acid phosphorus, were detected using solution P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Orthophosphate monoesters were the dominant Porg in the sediment extracts, higher than the orthophosphate diesters deoxyribonucleic acid phosphorus and phospholipids. The SRP and Porg showed obvious seasonal variations in different lake regions. The surface water SRP had a negative relationship with sedimentary Porg in the western and middle lake regions. From spring to autumn, SRP in the water column decreased while Porg in the surface sediment increased; from autumn to winter, SRP in the water column increased and Porg in the surface sediment decreased. According to aquatic metabolism, we inferred that excessive external phosphorus input was the "trigger" and the aquatic plants were the "pump" for Porg biogeochemical cycling in the shallow lake. Therefore, appropriate human intervention, such as the harvest of aquatic plants, is vital for eutrophication control in freshwater ecosystems.					jin, xin/KWU-0198-2024														1470-160X	1872-7034				DEC	2019	107								105622	10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105622	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105622													WOS:000490757500081

Surveillance of avian influenza especially in migratory birds, therefore, has been conducted to provide information on the viruses brought by them to Hokkaido, Japan, from their nesting lakes in Siberia in autumn. During 2008-2009, 62 influenza viruses of 21 different combinations of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) subtypes were isolated. Up to September 2010, no HPAIV has been found, indicating that H5N1 HPAIV has not perpetuated at least dominantly in the lakes where ducks nest in summer in Siberia. The PB2 genes of 54 influenza viruses out of 283 influenza viruses isolated in Hokkaido in 2000-2009 were phylogenetically analysed. None of the genes showed close relation to those of H5N1 HPAIVs that were detected in wild birds found dead in Eurasia on the way back to their northern territory in spring.

L. niloticus showed a single annual breeding cycle from mid-July to Dec., and was most abundant in Oct. in the lake, and in early Nov. in the river. T. nilotica showed 2 distinct annual seasons of abundance: summer (April-June) and autumn (Nov.-Oct.). Spawning activity was highest in summer (April-June) and autumn(late July-Sept.). The sex-ratio varied inversely with age (size); males were predominant in populations of older fish, perhaps because of their greater endurance to adverse conditions, as evidenced by their better survival in hypoxic water.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1984	110	MAR					287	294		10.1007/BF00025800	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00025800													WOS:A1984SN32200032

Measurements made with a submersed sensor demonstrated that one-meter ice transmits light in a quantity sufficient for oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis. As in the summer season, in the community of phototrophic bacteria found in Lake Shira, the purple sulfur bacteria Amoebobacter purpureus dominated, whereas, in Lake Shunet, the green sulfur bacteria Pelodictyon luteolum were predominant. Photosynthetic production, measured using the radioisotopic method, was several times lower than that in summer. The rates of sulfate reduction and production and oxidation of methane in the water column and bottom sediments were also lower than those recorded in summer. The process of anaerobic methane oxidation in the sediments was an exception, being more intense in winter than in summer. The data from radioisotopic measurements of the rates of microbial processes correlate well with the results of determination of the isotopic composition of organic and mineral carbon (delta C-13) and hydrogen sulfide and sulfate (delta S-34) and suggest considerable seasonal variations in the activity of the microbial community in the water bodies investigated.

J	Jiann, KT; Presley, BJ				Jiann, KT; Presley, BJ			Variations in trace metal concentrations in American oysters (Crassostrea virginica) collected from Galveston Bay, Texas	ESTUARIES												Nearly one thousand oysters (Crassostrea virginica) were collected at 15 sites on four sampling trips to Galveston Bay during 1992-1993. Iron, silver, arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc were determined in the whole soft part of the individual oysters. Trace metal concentrations were found to vary among individuals within a site on a given trip, and spatially and temporally around the Galveston Bay estuarine system. Differences in metal concentrations from site to site were a factor of 5 or more for some metals, and similar differences were found from time to time at a given site. Zinc was found in anomalously high concentrations at several sites, mainly along the west side of Galveston Bay. Isolated high values of other metals were found scattered throughout the bay; however, only one site (GBSL, near Swan Lake in lower Galveston Bay) was found to have significantly higher than average concentrations for several metals (Ag, Cu, Ph, and Zn). One obvious trend found in this study was that metal concentrations, except for As, were highest in the summer, followed by the fall, and lowest in the winter and spring. The temporal changes in metal concentrations in oysters cannot be explained by changes in body weight in different seasons, and are apparently caused by changes in environmental conditions (e.g., metal input, salinity) or biological activity (e.g., metabolism, depuration).																			0160-8347					DEC	1997	20	4					710	724		10.2307/1352246	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1352246													WOS:000071147300005

The "Melosira years" of Lake Baikal: Winter environmental conditions at ice onset predict under-ice algal blooms in spring	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Winter primary production in seasonally ice-covered lakes historically has not been well studied, but it is increasingly recognized as an important component of lake metabolism. Lake Baikal in Siberia is not only the World's oldest, deepest, and most biologically diverse lake, but also where large under-ice blooms of the diatom Aulacoseira baicalensis (formerly Melosira) occur in some years. The phenomenon of Melosira years is noteworthy both for the intensity of the diatom blooms, in which total under-ice production can be a majority of total annual production, and for the enigmatic regularity of their occurrence every 3-4 yr. The degree to which these episodic blooms might be controlled by external forcing and endogenous lake processes has been debated for decades. We used a 50-yr time series of phytoplankton observations to statistically model the occurrence of Aulacoseira blooms as a function of meteorological and climatological predictor variables. The results support the hypothesis that a confluence of meteorological conditions in the preceding fall season, which favor clear ice formation with minimal snow cover, also favor Aulacoseira blooms in the following spring. Further, we observe that this confluence of factors is related to relatively strong states of the Siberian High which, while not strictly periodic, do explain a significant fraction of the interannual bloom pattern. Finally, our analyses show that the timing of the peak abundance of A. baicalensis shifted 1.6 months later across the 50-yr time series, corresponding with the delay in ice-on timing that has been associated with climate change.					; Silow, Eugene/C-2958-2011; Shimaraeva, Svetlana/ABC-7160-2021; Katz, Stephen/KGL-4557-2024	Hampton, Stephanie/0000-0003-2389-4249; Silow, Eugene/0000-0002-7039-3220; Shchapov, Kirill/0000-0001-6823-0927; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2015	60	6					1950	1964		10.1002/lno.10143	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10143													WOS:000363888400007

DS causes a significant impact on human health, climate, the environment and many associated socioeconomic factors. The main goal of this study is to assess the sources of DS in the State of Kuwait. The present study investigates DS over Kuwait using the backward trajectories' simulation with MODIS satellite observations at various latitudes (1000, 3000, 5000 m) during the four seasons; winter, spring, summer, and fall. The trajectories' simulation was modeled using the HYSPLIT model to create the seasonal climatologic of air parcel trajectories. The meteorological data (e.g., visibility, wind speed, wind direction, temperature, and humidity) were collected during a 12-year period from 2000 to 2012. Daily trajectories were computed backward for five days from a central origin at several altitudes above the ground surface. The variability of the DS was analyzed daily, monthly, seasonally and annually. A case study on 25 March 2011 and two cases from each season were selected for analysis. The results showed that the HYSPLIT model was consistent with the MODIS satellite images. The sources of DS were identified from both the Sahara Desert and the Arabian Desert. Furthermore, there is a significant influence of the atmospheric conditions on the DS sources. The most influential parameter was visibility, from the west and the northwest direction. The present work provides evidence and suggestions for the origins of DS and is expected to help in establishing guidelines for public protection against dust particles and provides significant information to the concerned officials to take proper actions.

J	ROBERTSON, PA				ROBERTSON, PA			FACTORS AFFECTING TREE GROWTH ON 3 LOWLAND SITES IN SOUTHERN ILLINOIS	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												This article reports a three year study (1985-1987) assessing environmental factors controlling seasonal and historical tree growth on floodplain forested sites in southern Illinois. Radial growth increment was related to temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, depth to water table and solar radiation during each growing season. Growth ceased early during dry and later during wet years. During the wettest year, growth was negatively correlated with water table depth but during the driest year (1987), precipitation was positively correlated with growth. High water tables that occurred in the winter and early spring did not negatively affect tree growth. Historical tree growth was measured using standard dendrochronological techniques to analyze increment core data from individuals of eight Quercus species growing in three floodplain sites along the Big Muddy, Mississippi and Cache rivers in southern Illinois. Growth indices were negatively correlated with June temperature for most species on each site. Late spring or summer (May, June or July) precipitation was positively correlated with growth in many species-site groups. Tree species adapted to wet floodplain sites were not significantly related to precipitation but did respond significantly to summer temperature. Tree growth was positively correlated with river discharge on two sites; this relationship is likely due to the increased moisture available to the trees at high discharge. The lack of significant relationships at Horseshoe Lake may be the result of the hydrological control on the Mississippi River or because the river discharge is not strongly related to local precipitation.																			0003-0031					OCT	1992	128	2					218	236		10.2307/2426456	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2426456													WOS:A1992JW28300002
J	Senga, Y; Okumura, M; Seike, Y				Senga, Yukiko; Okumura, Minoru; Seike, Yasushi			Seasonal and Spatial Variation in the Denitrifying Activity in Estuarine and Lagoonal Sediments	JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY												We have elucidated the seasonal and spatial variation in the potential denitrifying activity in estuarine and coastal lagoonal sediments in Lakes Shinji and Nakaumi, Japan. The denitrifying activity increased from summer through autumn and was positively correlated with the temperature of the overlying water at all sites except one, where the bottom was always more reductive than at the other sites and there was no NO(3)(-) as a substrate for denitrification from spring to autumn. Moreover, the relationship between the denitrifying activity and the distance from the sea showed different trends in estuarine and lagoonal sediments. These spatial differences indicate that different factors regulate the denitrification in estuarine and lagoonal sediments. Denitrifying activity in estuarine sediment was regulated by the discharge of freshwater containing NO(3)(-) or organic matter, while in the lagoonal sediments the occurrence of nitrification via the intrusion of oxic seawater into the reductive sediment appears to be a key requirement for the process of denitrification. Therefore, the denitrifying activity in the lagoonal sediment appears to be greater near the sea. Water intrusion is one of the key factors controlling denitrification in coastal marine ecosystems by affecting the supply of substrate available for denitrification.																			0916-8370					FEB	2010	66	1					155	160		10.1007/s10872-010-0013-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10872-010-0013-0													WOS:000273207400013

Helminth parasites were recorded in 166 individuals (92.2%). Ten helminth species were found: trematodes - metacercariae of Posthodiplostomum cuticola, Diplostomum chromatophorum and D. spathaceum; monogeneans - Dactylogyrus difformis, D. difformoides and Diplozoon scardinii; cestodes - metacestodes of Paradilepis scolecina; nematodes - larvae of Spiroxys contortus and Rhabdochona denudata and adults of Schulmanela petruschewskii. Significant seasonal differences in the mean abundance were recorded for D. difformis, D. difformoides and D. scardinii. Significant seasonal differences in prevalence were recorded for P. cuticola, D. difformis, D. difformoides and D. scardinii. Dominant species in the component communities were P. cuticola, D. difformis and D. difformoides. The species composition of the component community essentially differs from that in the adjacent Danube River; a possible reason is the specific hydrobiological situation of the lake, characterized by a low density of benthic molluscs and crustaceans.

The main results are (1) the attainment of a precise chronology by microscopic varve counting, (2) the identification of detrital layers representing flood-triggered fluxes of catchment material into the lake, and (3) the recognition of the seasonality of these flood layers from their microstratigraphic position within a varve. Tracing flood layers in a proximal and a distal core and correlating them by application of the precise chronology provided information on the depositional processes. Comparing the seasonal flood layer record with daily runoff data of the inflowing River Ammer for the period from 1926 to 1999 allowed the definition of an approximate threshold in flood magnitude above which the formation of flood layers becomes very likely. Moreover, it was possible for the first time to estimate the "completeness" of the flood layer time series and to recognize that mainly floods in spring and summer, representing the main flood seasons in this region, are well preserved in the sediment archive. Their frequency distribution over the entire 450 year time series is not stationary but reveals maxima for colder periods of the Little Ice Age when solar activity was reduced. The observed spring-summer flood layer frequency further shows trends similar to those of the occurrence of flood-prone weather regimes since A. D. 1881, probably suggesting a causal link between solar variability and changes in midlatitude atmospheric circulation patterns.					von Grafenstein, Ulrich/F-6991-2010	von Grafenstein, Ulrich/0000-0002-3338-5627; Czymzik, Markus/0000-0003-1599-7643; Schroder, Birgit/0000-0003-4807-6357; Brauer, Achim/0000-0002-6655-9451													0043-1397	1944-7973				NOV 17	2010	46								W11528	10.1029/2009WR008360	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2009WR008360													WOS:000284489600001

Winter in two phases: Long-term study of a shallow reservoir in winter	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Climate-driven decreases in ice-cover duration have the potential to impact lake ecosystems, yet we have only partial understanding of the effects of winter conditions on physical, chemical, and biological properties of lakes. We used 39 years of monitoring data to examine under-ice changes in nutrients, oxygen, and phytoplankton in a shallow drinking-water reservoir. Two phases of winter were identified. Early winter was characterized by declining oxygen. In this phase, there were increases in specific conductance and concentrations of ammonium (NH4+-N) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP). In the month prior to ice off these trends reversed themselves and phytoplankton began to increase. Specific conductance declined as meltwater entered the lake. Nutrients (SRP and NH4+-N) declined, concurrent with increases in chlorophyll a and oxygen during late winter. This work demonstrates that chemical and biotic changes through winter are highly time dependent and differ between early and late winter phases. The late winter phase is often unstudied because of unsafe ice conditions, but here, the "spring" bloom commonly occurs in late winter under ice. The phases of winter, which are likely driven by changes in light, must be considered as we work to understand how diverse lakes will respond to declining periods of ice cover, and what drives differences in the spring ecology of diverse ice-covered lakes.					; Baulch, Helen/I-9529-2012	Cavaliere, Emily/0000-0001-7456-6750; Baulch, Helen/0000-0001-9018-4998													0024-3590	1939-5590				APR	2021	66	4					1335	1352		10.1002/lno.11687	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11687		DEC 2020											WOS:000602669900001

J	Al-Taani, AA				Al-Taani, Ahmed A.			Trend analysis in water quality of Al-Wehda Dam, north of Jordan	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Temporal status and trends in water quality of Al-Wehda Dam, Jordan, from 2006 to 2012 indicate that the dam is subject to a combination of impacts from rainstorm and agricultural runoffs. It also revealed that mineral dissolution, sediment load, rainfall events, evaporation, and water-level fluctuation are the major contributors to variations in water quality. The water chemistry of the impounded Al-Wehda Reservoir showed that Na, Ca, Mg, HCO3, and Cl are the principal ions, reflecting the dominance of carbonate weathering, with some contribution of silicates. The pH values showed a cyclic pattern with highest values observed in the spring seasons. Total dissolved solids (TDS), Ca, Mg, and HCO3 are primarily related to leaching and evaporation, with elevated levels that occurred in the rainy winter months. In contrast, seasonal patterns in Na, K, Cl, and NH4-N contents showed decreased values in winter. Peaks in NO3-N observed in winter are strongly associated with agricultural runoff. Fluctuations in chlorophyll-a level were coincided with low ratio of total nitrogen (TN) to total phosphorus (TP). Seasonal variations in organic matter content were also apparent, with peaks that generally occurred in spring through early fall corresponding with high algal growth. On an annual basis, the vast majority of water quality data have generally declined, particularly, in 2011. However, it is not clear whether these decreases are related to change in management practices within the Yarmouk basin, or protective measures have been implemented. Comparison of in-lake and post-dam water quality from 2009 to 2011 showed variation in concentrations, where Ca, HCO3, NO3-N, Mg, and TDS showed relatively greater post-dam values than in-lake water, whereas pH, Na, Cl, K, COD, BOD5, and chlorophyll-a were consistently lower in post-dam water. This comparison emphasizes the importance of self-purification capacity of Al-Wehda Dam in reducing some contaminants.

Thecamoebian communities as proxies of seasonality in Lake Sadatal in the Ganga-Yamuna Plains of North India	PALAEONTOLOGIA ELECTRONICA												Thecamoebians are testate protists that occur in a variety of freshwater habitats and brackish environments. They have been successfully used as proxies for a variety of environmental and climatic parameters in limnological and paleolimnological studies. The perennial Lake Sadatal is situated near the small town of Mallanwan (Latitude 27 degrees 3' 0 '' North and Longitude 80 degrees 9' 0 '' East) in the Ganga-Yamuna Plains of North India. Lake Sadatal is a shallow remnant of a past oxbow lake left by the meandering Ganga River and its tributaries (maximum depth similar to 1.5 m during summer and similar to 3.0 m during July-August monsoon season). The soil around this region is saline, sodium rich, and the maximum soil alkalinity is pH 10. This region shows strong seasonality, and average atmospheric temperatures during winter (December-March) range between 7-20 degrees C and during summer (April-June) range between 21-45 degrees C (2005-2007). Taxonomically diverse and mixed thecamoebians were recovered from Lake Sadatal showing distinct summer and winter communities for three years. Centropyxids and Arcellenids dominate the low humidity, low precipitation cooler months (October-March) whereas Amphitrema spp. and Difflugia oblonga "triangularis" dominate summer and the high precipitation, high humidity monsoon months (April-September). Dominance of Amphitrema spp. is related to abundance of aquatic weed Lemna detritus at the lake bottom during summer. Total concentrations of thecamoebians were higher during summer monsoon months than winter.					; Swindles, Graeme/AAU-4321-2020	Swindles, Graeme/0000-0001-8039-1790; 													1935-3952	1094-8074					2012	15	1							3A															WOS:000300061500004

In comparison, the concentrations of N2O in the reservoir were 32.94T 1732 nmol L-1 in summer and 23.73 +/- 5.60 nmol L-1 in winter. The longitudinal distribution of N2O along the river exhibited different patterns with surface N2O decreasing downstream towards the dam in summer but increasing in winter. Vertical profiles of N2O concentrations in the reservoir showed an increase with depth in summer but were almost vertically uniform in winter. In winter, N2O that had accumulated in the bottom water in summer was transported to the surface by vertical mixing and released into the atmosphere. Dissolved oxygen (DO), water temperature, and in situ biological production were the main factors affecting the distribution of N2O. The mean emissions rates of N-20 from the surface waters were 13.7 +/- 8.8 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) in summer and 132 +/- 7.6 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) in winter. Approximately 1.31 x 10(6) mol N2O was released from the reservoir surface in 2017, which represents 0.12% of the annual N2O emissions from global reservoirs. The construction of dams increased N2O emission from the lower reaches of the river by 4.53 x 10(5) mol and 122 x 10(5) mol due to the discharge of the bottom water and the water and sediment regulation, respectively. This study demonstrates that the construction of dams and reservoir operation practices have made the Xiaolangdi Reservoir a key area for N2O emissions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The two species occurred in a wide range of salinities and temperatures, although detection was restricted seasonally from spring through to autumn, except for one incidence in the shallow waters of Wairewa/Lake Forsyth, Canterbury, in the winter of 2003. The DNA sequencing data indicated that P. shumwayae may encompass a suite of genetically closely related species. The presence of Pfiesteria in New Zealand is not considered an immediate risk to fish or human health given the current low-to-moderate nutrient concentrations in New Zealand's estuaries and brackish lakes. However, increases in nutrient loadings could pose a risk, as has occurred in eastern United States estuaries.																			0028-8330	1175-8805				MAR	2006	40	1					211	220		10.1080/00288330.2006.9517414	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.2006.9517414													WOS:000237691000016

Carbon dynamics in highly heterotrophic subarctic thaw ponds	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Global warming has accelerated the formation of permafrost thaw ponds in several subarctic and arctic regions. These ponds are net heterotrophic as evidenced by their greenhouse gas (GHG) supersaturation levels (CO2 and CH4), and generally receive large terrestrial carbon inputs from the thawing and eroding permafrost. We measured seasonal and vertical variations in the concentration and type of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in five subarctic thaw (thermokarst) ponds in northern Quebec, and explored how environmental gradients influenced heterotrophic and phototrophic biomass and productivity. Late winter DOM had low aromaticity indicating reduced inputs of terrestrial carbon, while the high concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) suggests that some production of nonchromophoric dissolved compounds by the microbial food web took place under the ice cover. Summer DOM had a strong terrestrial signature, but was also characterized with significant inputs of algal-derived carbon, especially at the pond surface. During late winter, bacterial production was low (maximum of 0.8 mg C m(-3) d(-1)) and was largely based on free-living bacterioplankton (58 %). Bacterial production in summer was high (up to 58 mg C m(-3) d(-1)), dominated by particle-attached bacteria (67 %), and strongly correlated with the amount of terrestrial carbon. Primary production was restricted to summer surface waters due to strong light limitation deeper in the water column or in winter. The phototrophic biomass was equal to the heterotrophic biomass, but as the algae were mostly composed of mixotrophic species, most probably they used bacteria rather than solar energy in such shaded ponds. Our results point to a strong heterotrophic energy pathway in these thaw pond ecosystems, where bacterioplankton dominates the production of new carbon biomass in both summer and winter.																			1726-4170	1726-4189					2015	12	23					7223	7237		10.5194/bg-12-7223-2015	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-12-7223-2015													WOS:000372085100006

In the analysis, the use was made of monthly air temperatures recorded at fifteen meteorological stations, water temperatures of twelve lakes, and Hurrell's winter NAO indices. Over the study period (1971-2010), there was a marked increase in the temperatures of both, air and lake waters. Depending on the NAO phase, water temperatures were observed to depart from mean values, being markedly higher than average (even by 1 degrees C) in the positive winter NAO phase. The differences in water temperatures were statistically significant in the winter-spring season. In turn, in the negative NAO(DJFM) phase lake water temperatures in winter and spring were markedly lower than average (in March even by 1.0 degrees C). The unique response of some lakes depends on their morphometric parameters, including their mean depth.					; Ptak, Mariusz/O-3217-2015; Wrzesiński, Dariusz/I-5765-2019	Choinski, Adam/0000-0001-9006-0952; Ptak, Mariusz/0000-0003-1225-1686; Wrzesinski, Dariusz/0000-0001-5025-1447														1895-7455				JUN	2015	63	3					863	883		10.1515/acgeo-2015-0001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/acgeo-2015-0001													WOS:000356813200014

From spring to early winter chloride cells (responsible for ion uptake) were numerous, and during summer gill epithelia were highly hypertrophic resulting in a thick blood-to-water barrier This gill morphology is typical for fish from soft water habitats and reflects osmoregulatory responses. In mid-winter, however, both chloride cell numbers and epithelia thickness were reduced and comparable to the situation in freshwater with high ionic contents. This pattern correlated with seasonal fluctuations of water chemistry. The most significant correlation was found with CO(2) which accumulated under the ice cover, reaching a tenfold oversatturation. The concentration of Ca, Na, and Cl varied only by a factor of two or less and the correlation with the epithelial thickness was much weaker.																			1015-1621						2000	62	4					297	307		10.1007/PL00001336	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/PL00001336													WOS:000166273800001

Sulfate-rich spring seeps and seasonal formation of terraced, crystalline mirabilite mounds along the shores of Great Salt Lake, Utah: Hydrologic and chemical expression during declining lake elevation	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												As Great Salt Lake (GSL) elevation declined below similar to 1278.6 m (4195 ft) beginning in the fall of 2019, crystalline mounds formed on the southeastern shore, near Great Salt Lake State Park, Utah. Soon after, several more mound complexes were discovered on nearby Antelope Island. Recent historic low lake levels permitted sulfate-saturated spring brines to emerge on the exposed shoreline. When the spring waters encountered cold winter air, sodium sulfate precipitated in the form of the mineral mirabilite (Na2SO4 center dot 10H(2)O). Mirabilite-saturated spring waters pool in shallow sediment-collapse depressions or, with sufficient hydraulic head, precipitate subaerial crystalline spring terraced mounds. The mounds are composed of clear, bladed, and tabular mirabilite crystals (1 to 10 cm in length; 1 to 5 cm in width) that form mini pools and rimstone dams due to cascading spring water flow. The waters have elavated mu M concentrations of sulfide, an oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) of 250 mV, pH of 7, densities of 1.103-1.1169 g/cm(3), and temperatures of 10 degrees -15 degrees C, as compared to nearby lake waters that had undetectable sulfide, an ORP of 12 mV, pH of 8.2, density of 1.0872 g/cm(3), and temperatures of 0 degrees-3 degrees C. Green algae and probable sulfide oxidizing bacteria thrive in the spring waters and some are occluded within the mirabilite matrix and fluid inclusions. Sulfur delta S-34 and oxygen delta O-18 isotopes of brine and mirabilite sulfate are enriched +18.8-20.41% and + 12.2-14.5%, respectively, indicating groundwater and mirabilite are in equilibrium for oxygen. Brine sulfide is heavily fractionated (delta S-34 of similar to 30 %) relative to sulfate, indicating active sulfate reduction in subsurface aquifers that feed the spring seeps and which is consistent with higher HS concentrations relative to adjacent lake waters. The recognition of such biosignatures retained in mirabilite provides further insights for the preservation potential of biological material in extraterrestrial sulfate minerals. Today, Gilbert Bay (south arm of GSL) is undersaturated with respect to mirabilite. However, pre-earthen causeway historical reports (prior to 1959) indicate mirabilite precipitated in the south arm during the winter and through wave action accumulated along the leeward southeastern oolitic shore (similar to current processes occurring in the hypersaline Gunnison Bay, the north arm of GSL). Upon solar irradiance in the spring, the shoreline mirabilite dissolved and reprecipitated in the shallow subsurface (<1 m) as an ooid cement. We hypothesize that this subsurface layer of mirabilite is the source for active lake margin sodium sulfate-saturated spring brines. The emergence and surface exposure of the brines and associated chemical sediments are an additional contributing solute source that may increase GSL salinity during lake level decline more than evaporation alone.

Frequency, composition and stability of associations among individual largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) at diel, daily and seasonal scales	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												A whole-lake acoustic telemetry observatory situated in eastern Ontario was used to continuously monitor the three-dimensional position of 20 largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) over a 120-h period during the winter and a separate 120-h period during the early spring. These data were used to evaluate the frequency and stability of associations among fish to provide an understanding of seasonal aggregations and the sociobiology of largemouth bass. The temporal and spatial proximity of each fish relative to the other 19 individuals was assessed and, based on our definition of spatial/temporal proximity (i.e., two fish having an average hourly position <2 m apart), associations were shown to vary among fish, as well as diurnally, daily and seasonally. Associations during the winter were found to be more stable and involved fewer fish than associations during the spring. Of those fish that formed pair aggregations during the winter and spring study periods, male-female pairs occurred more often than male-male and female-female pairs. Our analysis also demonstrated that associations occurred primarily during daylight hours, suggesting that fish may use visual cues to form these aggregations.					; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010; Hasler, Caleb/H-6066-2019	Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; Suski, Cory/0000-0001-8280-873X; 													0906-6691	1600-0633				SEP	2007	16	3					417	424		10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00239.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00239.x													WOS:000249096500015

During surveys carried out in 2007-2013, autumn populations were observed in November 2009 (C. diaphantts) and in October 2012 (B. oriental is). Autumn specimens were smaller compared to those caught in spring. Although the two species were found in the same area, their habitats were spatially separated: B. orientalis was recorded only in the soda lake Rusanda, while C. diaphanus was found only in small ephemeral ponds placed over the surrounding meadows. Appearance of autumn populations point to the ecologically tolerant character of these species, and suggests they are able to tolerate lower temperatures during growth.

J	Grimm, NB; Petrone, KC				Grimm, NB; Petrone, KC			Nitrogen fixation in a desert stream ecosystem	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Few measurements of nitrogen fixation exist for streams. Desert streams are warm, well lighted, and often support abundant cyanobacterial populations; thus N-2 fixation may be significant in these N-poor ecosystems. N-2 fixation was measured in situ by acetylene reduction for two patch types (Anabaena mat and an epilithic assemblage). Patch-specific rates were high compared with published values (maximum 775 mu g N-2 [83 mu mol C2H4] mg chl a(-1) h(-1) or 51 mg N-2 [5.4 mmol C2H4] m(-2) h(-1)). Daytime fixation was higher than nighttime fixation, and temperature, light and inorganic N concentration explained 52% of variance in hourly rates over all dates. Diel input-output budgets were constructed on five dates when cyanobacteria were present in the stream. Diel N-2 fixation rates were measured for comparison with reach-scale diel nitrogen retention, to assess the importance of this vector to N economy of the stream. Fixation accounted for up to 85% of net N flux to the benthos, but its importance varied seasonally. Finally, we applied biomass-specific fixation rates to 1992 and 1993 biomass data to obtain seasonal and annual N-2 fixation estimates. Cyanobacteria were absent or rare during winter and spring, thus most of the annual N-2 fixation occurred during summer and autumn. Annual rates of nitrogen fixation for 1992 and 1993 (8.0 g/m(2) and 12.5 g/m(2)) were very high compared to other streams, and moderately high compared to other ecosystems. Like other phenomena in this disturbance-prone ecosystem, nitrogen fixation is strongly influenced by the number and temporal distribution of flood events.

J	SUTER, W				SUTER, W			ARE CORMORANTS PHALACROCORAX-CARBO WINTERING IN SWITZERLAND APPROACHING CARRYING-CAPACITY - AN ANALYSIS OF INCREASE PATTERNS AND HABITAT CHOICE	ARDEA												The increase rate of Cormorant numbers overwintering in Switzerland between 1970 and 1990 was the same as in the strongly growing breeding population. From 1930 to 1970, however, wintering Cormorants increased while the breeding population remained stable. The reasons are believed to be a better food supply as cyprinid and percid fish biomass increased due to eutrophication of Swiss lakes. Conversely, the increase rate of overwintering birds in Switzerland recently began to slow down while numbers during autumn passage are still following the growth of the breeding population. The resulting sigmoid pattern suggests that Cormorant numbers in Switzerland in winter are approaching carrying capacity. Cormorant density on lakes is strongly correlated with density of Perch and cyprinid fish, especially Roach, which shows signs of decrease as the input rate of nutrients into lakes is being reduced. The stepwise process of filling up different types of water bodies partly supports the Fretwell-Lucas model of habitat occupancy although behavioural responses to reduced persecution may also be involved in habitat choice. Even if increased winter survival were partly responsible for the current strong population increase (which is in fact unknown), the inland waters of western and central Europe hold a too small part of the north-central European Cormorant population (estimated at 300 000 birds in spring 1992) compared to coastal areas, as to play an important role in such a process.																			0373-2266	2213-1175					1995	83	1					255	266																WOS:A1995RM43100027

The synergistic effect of elevated CO2 and phosphorus on reservoir eutrophication. Lake Reserve Manage. 32:373-385. Increased delivery of carbon (C) and phosphorus (P) as a result of climate change is predicted to significantly increase algal biomass and alter algal nutrient content. We conducted a 2-phased experiment to determine the following: (1) whether carbon dioxide partial pressure (PCO2) in the water column of reservoirs dropped low enough to limit algal biomass, (2) whether increasing the PCO2 in the water column could alleviate C limitation and increase algal biomass, and (3) whether the simultaneous increase in PCO2 and P alter algal nutrient content. In the first phase we reconstructed PCO2 in the water column of several northwest Arkansas reservoirs on timescales ranging from days to decades. During fall, winter, and spring, PCO2 was greater than atmospheric levels, suggesting the reservoirs were sources of C released to the atmosphere. During summer, PCO2 was less than atmospheric levels, suggesting that reservoir PCO2 fell low enough to potentially limit algal biomass. In the second phase, we conducted an enrichment experiment along a PCO2 gradient representative of preindustrial (250 mu atm), current (400 mu atm), and 2050 projected levels from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (550 mu atm) along a P gradient. Our results showed that relative to preindustrial and current levels, elevated PCO2 had no significant effect on algal biomass and nutrient content. Instead, biomass increased significantly with increasing levels of P, supporting predictions that even under elevated PCO2 and global climate change scenarios, P might still be the major nutrient limiting algal growth in these reservoirs.					; Scott, Thad/AAF-7151-2020	Scott, Thad/0000-0002-9487-9698; pollock, erik/0000-0002-2834-4935													1040-2381	2151-5530					2016	32	4					373	385		10.1080/10402381.2016.1231247	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2016.1231247													WOS:000388610500006

Using band recovery data and reported sightings of patagially marked gulls, we constructed location maps for fledglings, one to two-year-old gulls, and breeding-age adult gulls during five time periods: spring migration, breeding season, early and late fall migration, and winter. Using repeated observations, we also produced a location map with directional vector plots. Gulls followed a triangular pattern of movements. At the conclusion of breeding, gulfs migrated west and northwest to the Pacific coast, distributing themselves mainly between San Francisco and British Columbia. During winter, gulls moved south along the Pacific coast and by spring were concentrated in southern California and northern Mexico. The range size was largest among fledglings which provided the northernmost and southernmost observations for the population. Few subadult gulls migrated to the breeding colony. During the breeding season, a substantial portion of breeding-aged adults remained on the Pacific coast and throughout the intermountain west but were not observed at other California gull colonies. While fledglings moved directly toward the Pacific coast at the end of the breeding season, many adults lingered near the colony site and at aquatic habitats south of the colony. We suggest that adults remain longer in the area to feed and to rejuvenate before attempting migration.																			1524-4695	1938-5390					1999	22	1					29	36		10.2307/1521990	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1521990													WOS:000083508100004

A total of 73 species were recorded, of which only 20 were occasionally abundant, and only 5 became dominant (>50% of total biomass) at least once (Microcystis aeruginosa, Oocystis lacustris, Aulacoseira (= Melosira) granulata, Cyclotella meneghiniana, Carteria cordiformis). The earlier years of the study (1982-1986) were drought years characterized by low water levels (10-15 m below the level at full supply), excess supply of nutrients at all times of the year, and overwhelming dominance of Microcystis aeruginosa. This K-selected species proved to be well adapted to withstand the range of environmental conditions throughout summer, fall and winter but it declined in spring each year when a fast successional episode followed. Several small-celled chlorophytes, diatoms and cryptophytes appeared and disappeared until Oocystis lacrustris became dominant for a few weeks, to be replaced by M. aeruginosa early in the summer. During the following rainy years (late 1986 to 1988), the lake re-filled. Major washout losses, concomitant with a considerable decline in surface water phosphorus concentrations and elevated TN/TP ratios, apparently led to the reduction in the abundance of M. aeruginosa. Its bloom extended over a smaller portion of the year in 1986 and 1987, and disappeared in May 1988, permitting the development of a more diverse phytoplankton community subject to control by 2ooplankton grazing. This long-term phytoplankton record from Hartbeespoort Dam demonstrates the key role of a dominant species in controlling community composition and diversity in hypertrophic lakes. Stable environments lead to low-diversity and high-biomass phytoplankton assemblages dominated by K-strategists, while disruptions of suitable strength and frequency allow for the development and maintenance of higher species diversity.

Flyway structure, breeding, migration and wintering distributions of the globally threatened Swan Goose Anser cygnoides in East Asia	WILDFOWL												Telemetry data, wintering waterbird surveys and expert knowledge are used here to describe the links between the summer and winter distributions of the Swan Goose Anser cygnoides in East Asia, and to determine the status of the species. Updated information suggests the existence of at least two discrete migratory flyways in the region: an "Inland flyway" and a "Coastal flyway". The Inland flyway consists of birds that summer in Mongolia, the Durian steppe and northeast China, extending east to Khanka Lake in far eastern Russia. These geese winter in the Yangtze River floodplain in China, congregating at Poyang and Shengjin Lakes. Total wintering numbers for this group of birds were estimated at c. 54,400 in recent years, a decline from c. 78,000 in the early 2000s. Birds of the Coastal flyway seem discrete from those following the Inland flyway and occur further east, spending the summer at Udyl Lake and northern Sakhalin Island in Far East Russia. They migrate to winter mainly on the Minjiang River estuary (Fujian Province, China), with a few remaining to winter in South Korea. About 400 Swan Geese have been counted in the Coastal flyway population in recent years, and, following declines from 800 in the early 2000s, it is thought that they currently face extinction. Our results highlight that urgent and effective conservation efforts are needed to protect this declining population of a globally threatened species, especially those wintering in Korea and the Minjiang Estuary. New data provide a scientific basis for the conservation of this species in the region, but also highlight the need for improved monitoring and management of the declining numbers wintering in China.

ENVI - met is considered to be the best fluid mechanics simulation software of the outdoor thermal environment, which is mainly in the application of high latitude and cold regions. Based on the research of subtropical country park outside environment thermal comfort, this paper analyzed three seasons of climate data through the experimental research of the east gate entrance area of Guangdong Tianlu Lake Country Park for spring, summer, autumn; and combined with simulation software ENVI-met to build the model, respectively for spring, summer, autumn three season of simulation experiment, then the authors work out the comparative study of the measured and simulated data, and analyzed the change rule to find out the following four conclusions:(1) with the actual measurement of meteorological data as boundary conditions, ENVI-met can simulate microclimate condition of the subtropical hot and humid region country parks outdoor environment; the change trend of simulated data and measured data is identical within the scope of the instrument error.(2) compared with the simulated data and the measured data, it can more reflect the general trend of change, and is not affected by the measured specific emergency on that day.(3) the variations in the data of simulation generally less than the measured data.(4) the hard ground and artificial facilities compared natural tree shade field simulated results is more close to the actual measurement results. Thus this paper could confirm that the simulation software ENVI-met, which began in the high latitudes, is also could be used in the simulative study of subtropical hot and humid area of outdoor thermal environment, and as a aided designing tool; the authors preliminarily found a certain rule for the background parameter setting in the simulation experiment to set up a foundation for further research in the future.

The method which uses mobile phone positioning coordinates in space-time movement studies in Estonia is called the social positioning method. The dataset allowed analysis of the distribution of foreigners' country of origin in Estonia with the precision of network cells of mobile operators. Privacy of mobile phone holders was guaranteed according to EU regulation. It was concluded that seasonality produces very different and sometimes even opposite tourists' space consumption patterns in Estonia. Coastal areas are popular for summer tourism and not so popular in winter; continental inland areas were used more for winter tourism. The popular summer tourism areas along the Baltic Sea beaches are dominated by one nationality: the Finnish in western Estonia, and the Russians in eastern Estonia. Latvians made up a higher percentage in Saaremaa and Parnu during summer and in Otepaa and Lake Peipsi in winter. The mobile positioning data have great potential for tourism studies and monitoring, but is a sensitive issue due to the fear of surveillance. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

FROM LAKE MIEDWIE, POLAND	ECOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY AND ENGINEERING A-CHEMIA I INZYNIERIA EKOLOGICZNA A												The study material comprised perch obtained from commercial catches conducted in May and November 2009 in Lake Miedwie. Catches were made using gill nets with a mesh size ranging from 40 to 45 mm. Fifty perch (25 from each of the catches) were obtained for the study. The fish were weighed [g], and then total length [mm] and maximum body height [mm] were measured. The dependencies between total length and weight, total length and body height, and weight and body height were calculated. The condition of the perch was determined with Fulton's condition coefficient (KF). Twelve fish were chosen at random from among the study material collected in spring and autumn to determine body chemical composition. The mean weight of these individuals was 220.51 +/- 18.68 g and mean length was 264.33 +/- 6.86 mm in spring and 91.08 +/- 17.20 g and 189.17 +/- 7.52 mm in autumn, respectively. The stomachs were excised from the fish and their contents were identified. Gutted and deheaded fish were homogenized, and the percentage share of the following were determined according to Polish norms: protein, lipids, dry matter, and ash. Qualitative analysis of the fatty acid content of the fish was performed with the PN-EN ISO 5509: 2001 chromotagraphic method. The results of the analyses indicate that the perch caught in May 2009 have greater body weights, lengths, and heights and higher quantities of lipid in comparison with the perch caught in autumn of 2009. The values of these parameters for spring and autumn, respectively, are as follows: body weight -156.86 +/- 15.98 and 86.46 +/- 8.98 g; total length -233.68 +/- 7.37 and 189.08 +/- 4.49 mm; body height -52.66 +/- 1.97 and 44.39 +/- 1.59 mm; body lipid content -1.32 +/- 0.03 and 0.24 +/- 0.01 %. However, the fish caught in November 2009 had higher KF, and contained more EPA and DHA fatty acids in comparison with fish caught in spring 2009, as follows (for spring and autumn, respectively): KF -1.128 +/- 0.02 and 1.203 +/- 0.02; EPA content 7.025 +/- 0.005 and 8.725 +/- 0.015 %; DHA content -16.890 +/- 0.030 and 18.575 +/- 0.005 %.

J	Brzezinski, T; Dawidowicz, P; von Elert, E				Brzezinski, Tomasz; Dawidowicz, Piotr; von Elert, Eric			The role of food quality in clonal succession in Daphnia: an experimental test	OECOLOGIA												A high genetic variation and recurrent changes in the genetic structure have been found in many pelagic populations. However, evidence that directly links these changes to differences in the ecological performance of particular genotypes is scarce. We hypothesized that within Daphnia, the specialization of clones occurring in a particular season to the food quality specific for that time of the year is responsible for the observed changes in the genetic structure of a population. This hypothesis was tested by comparing the fitness of spring and summer clones of the Daphnia longispina group, given food of biochemical quality relevant to these seasons. We identified significant intraspecific differences between clones of Daphnia that are specific for particular seasons, but there was no evidence that clones are adapted to the food quality available at the respective times of year. Summer clones reproduce at smaller size, and have a lower juvenile specific growth rate as compared to spring clones, irrespective of food quality. Spring clones invest more energy in somatic growth at the cost of reproduction, whereas summer clones invest more energy in reproduction at the cost of somatic growth. On the basis of the observed differences between spring and summer clones in their patterns of energy allocation, we suggest that other factors, most likely predation, are the major forces driving phenotypic and genetic diversity in the investigated Daphnia population of a large lake.

Machine learning approaches, which excel at detecting potential complex nonlinear relationships, provide opportunities to estimate Chla accurately for optically complex waters. However, the uncertainties in atmospheric correction (AC) may be amplified in different Chla algorithms. Here, we aim to select one state-of-the-art algorithm or establish a new algorithm based on machine learning approaches that less sensitive to AC uncertainties. Firstly, nine state-of-the-art empirical, semianalytical, and optical water types (OWT) classification-based Chla algorithms were imple-mented. These existing algorithms showed good performance by using in situ database, however, failed in actual OLCI applications due to their sensitivity to AC uncertainties. Thus, four popular machine learning approaches (random forest regression (RFR), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), deep neural network (DNN), and support vector regression (SVR)) were then employed. Among them, the "RFR-Chla" model performed the best and showed less sensitivity to AC uncertainties. Finally, the Chla spatiotemporal variations in 163 major lakes across eastern China were mapped from OLCI between May 2016 and April 2020 using the proposed RFR-Chla model. Generally, the lakes in eastern China are severely eutrophic, with an average Chla concentration of 33.39 +/- 6.95 mu g/L. Spatially, Chla in the south of eastern China was significantly higher than those in northern lakes. Seasonally, Chla was high in the summer and autumn and low in the spring and winter. This study provides a reference for water quality monitoring in turbid inland waters suffering certain AC uncertainties and supports aquatic management and SDG 6 reporting.

J	Liu, LX; Xu, M; Li, RQ				Liu, Lixiang; Xu, Ming; Li, Renqiang			Modeling temporal patterns of methane effluxes using multiple regression and random forest in Poyang Lake, China	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												In this study, we used two statistical models to predict daily CH4 effluxes and compared the prediction accuracy of two models in Poyang Lake. Statistical models included linear model and Random forest model (RF) which can handle high dimensional non-linear relationships, categorical and continuous predictors, and highly collinear predictor variables. Seven climatic factors and water level data, together with the field CH4 efflux at monthly intervals from 2011 to 2014 were used for model development and cross-validation. We found that the RF model provided the best prediction accuracy for daily CH4 effluxes, whereas the linear model gave low prediction accuracy for CH4 effluxes. The coefficient of determination was 0.93 and 0.63 for the "best" RF and linear models with the same climatic variables, respectively. The "best" linear model had the highest model-performance errors including the mean absolute error, root mean-square error, and the normalized root-mean-square error, followed by the "best" RF models. In addition, cross-validation results for the two "best" models also showed that the RF model was the best model for estimating CH4 effluxes. We applied the optimum RF model to simulate daily CH4 effluxes from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2014, and then estimated the seasonal and annual CH4 emissions in Poyang Lake. The mean CH4 efflux in the summer was notably higher than that in the other seasons, with values of 0.097, 0.28, 0.11, and 0.045 mmol m(-2) day(-1) in the spring, in the summer, in the autumn, and in the winter over a 4-year period, respectively. The mean annual emission was 3.13 g m(-2) year(-1), which was considerately lower than the mean global annual emission in lakes and that in the other subtropical lakes of the world. We found that the RF model may be used to estimate CH4 effluxes and emissions in other lakes in the world.

J	Ingri, J; Torssander, P; Andersson, PS; Morth, CM; Kusakabe, M				Ingri, J; Torssander, P; Andersson, PS; Morth, CM; Kusakabe, M			Hydrogeochemistry of sulfur isotopes in the Kalix River catchment, northern Sweden	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												The S-34-to-S-32 ratio in dissolved SO4 has been studied in the Kalix River, Northern Sweden, and its catchment. Weekly sampling over 17 months revealed temporal variations from + 5.3 parts per thousand up to + 7.4 parts per thousand in the delta(34)S values in the river. Snow and rain samples showed lower delta(34)S values (average + 5.6 parts per thousand and + 5.0 parts per thousand, respectively). The atmosphere is the major source for S in surface waters in the catchment, and the heavier delta(34)S values in the river are a result of SO4 reduction within the catchment. Most of the temporal variations in the delta(34)S value in the river are caused by a mixing of water from the mountain areas (relatively light delta(34)S) and the woodland. The delta(34)S value is relatively heavy in the woodland tributaries because of bacterial SO4 reduction in peatland areas influenced by groundwater. The highest delta(34)S values were measured during the spring flood, in June and in November. These heavy delta(34)S values are related to different types of water with diverse origins. The heavy delta(34)S values coinciding with the early spring flood originate from peatland areas in the woodland. Relatively heavy delta(34)S values (up to + 14.4 parts per thousand) were registered in mire water. Smaller variations of the delta(34)S value during summer and early autumn most likely were caused by the input of ground-mire water during heavy rains. A correlation between increased TOC concentrations and increased delta(34)S values was observed. The heavy delta(34)S values in June and November probably originate from SO4 reduction in bottom water and sediments in lakes within the catchment. Bottom water, enriched in S-34-SO4, was transported in the river during the spring and autumn overturn. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Changes in phenology are increasingly linked to global climate change. However, current evidence of phenological responses to recent climate change is subjected to substantial regional and seasonal biases. Most available evidence on climate-driven phenological changes comes from Northern Hemisphere (NH) ecosystems and typically involves increases in spring and summer temperatures, which translate into earlier onsets of spring population developments. In the Argentine Pampa region, warming has occurred at a much slower pace than in the NH, and trends are mostly restricted to increases in the minimum temperatures. We used zooplankton abundance data from Lake Chascomus (recorded every two weeks from 2005 to 2015) to evaluate potential changes in phenology. We adopted a sequential screening approach to identify taxa displaying phenological trends and evaluated whether such trends could be associated to observe long-term changes in water temperature. Two zooplankton species displayed significant later shifts in phenology metrics (end date of Brachionus havanaensis seasonal distribution: 31 day/decade, onset and end dates of Keratella americana seasonal distribution: 59 day/decade and 82 day/decade, respectively). The timing of the observed shift in B.havanaensis phenology was coincident with a warming trend in the May lake water temperature (4.7 degrees C per decade). Analysis of abundance versus temperature patterns from six additional shallow Pampean lakes, and evaluation of previous experimental results, provided further evidence that the lake water warming trend in May was responsible for the delayed decline of B. havanaensis populations in autumn. This study is the first report of freshwater zooplankton phenology changes in the Southern Hemisphere (SH).					; Grosman, Fabian/AAV-4182-2020; Rojas Molina, Florencia/MTD-2133-2025	Diovisalvi, Nadia/0000-0002-1054-8323; Zagarese, Horacio/0000-0001-6588-5960; Grosman, Fabian/0000-0002-9564-9691; Fontanarrosa, Maria Soledad/0000-0002-1071-4942; Garcia de Souza, Javier/0000-0002-0200-0552													1354-1013	1365-2486				NOV	2018	24	11					5137	5148		10.1111/gcb.14423	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14423								30112780					WOS:000447760300012
J	Zhan, MJ; Xia, LJ; Zhan, LF; Wang, YH				Zhan, Ming-jin; Xia, Lingjun; Zhan, Longfei; Wang, Yuanhao			Evaluation and Analysis of Soil Temperature Data over Poyang Lake Basin, China	ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY												Soil temperature reflects the impact of local factors, such as the vegetation, soil, and atmosphere of a region. Therefore, it is important to understand the regional variation of soil temperature. However, given the lack of observations with adequate spatial and/or temporal coverage, it is often difficult to use observational data to study the regional variation. Based on the observational data from Nanchang and Ganzhou stations and ERA-Interim/Land reanalysis data, this study analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of soil temperature over Poyang Lake Basin. Four soil depths were examined, 0-7, 7-28, 28-100, and 100-289 cm, recorded as ST1, ST2, ST3, and ST4, respectively. The results showed close correlations between observation data and reanalysis data at different depths. Reanalysis data could reproduce the main spatiotemporal distributions of soil temperature over the Poyang Lake Basin but generally underestimated their magnitudes. Temporally, there was a clear warming trend in the basin. Seasonally, the temperature increase was the most rapid in spring and the slowest in summer, except for ST4, which increased the fastest in spring and the slowest in winter. The temperature increase was faster for ST1 than the other depths. The warming trend was almost the same for ST2, ST3, and ST4. An abrupt change of annual soil temperature at all depths occurred in 1997, and annual soil temperatures at all depths were abnormally low in 1984. Spatially, annual soil temperature decreased with latitude, except for the summer ST1. Because of the high temperature and precipitation in summer, the ST1 values were higher around the lake and the river. The climatic trend of soil temperature generally increased from south to north, which was opposite to the distribution of soil temperature. These findings provide a basis for understanding and assessing the variation of soil temperature in the Poyang Lake Basin.

J	Bouvet, C; Beauregard, PB; Guéguen, C				Bouvet, Corentin; Beauregard, Pascale B.; Gueguen, Celine			Low-temperature biodegradation of freshwater dissolved organic matter during winter-to-spring transition	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												The composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) directly affects the biological degradation processes and its persistence in aquatic systems. Spring floods export large amounts of DOM from land into aquatic systems, yet its lability remains largely unknown. This study uniquely investigates the biodegradation of DOM during the critical winter-to-spring transition in seasonally ice-covered marsh and lake environments. We employed a four-bacteria strain inoculum (Arthrobacter phenanthrenivorans, Bacillus licheniformis, Exiguobacterium sibiricum, and Paracoccus denitrificans) to degrade DOM collected during this period. Using advanced optical and molecular characteristics techniques, we demonstrated significant DOM bioalteration at low temperatures (4 degrees C), which are naturally associated with early spring in cold temperate lakes and wetlands. Despite limited degradation of colored and fluorescent DOM (CDOM and FDOM, respectively), 84% of the mass-to-charge (m/z) peaks detected using positive ion mass spectrometry were lost in winter DOM after 28-day incubation. Biodegradation ranged from 74% to 77% during the spring freshet, with the lowest microbial alteration observed in DOM collected downstream of a marsh at the end of the spring melt season, likely due to increased primary production. These findings highlight the critical role of microbial processes in DOM transformation during periods of rapid hydrological change, providing insights into carbon cycling and ecosystem dynamics in cold aquatic environments.

In order to elucidate the response mechanism of metazooplankton to the changes in water environment after the removal of aquaculture facilities, we collected metazooplankton samples and investigated the water environment in the Huayanghe Lakes from the summer of 2018 to the spring of 2019. Aquatic plants recovered quickly, and water eutrophication was relieved, especially in Lake Huangda, followed by Lake Bo. During our study, the highest regional (gamma) diversity was 71 in summer, while the lowest was 32 in winter. Species turnover in space (beta diversity) varied between 10.01 and 56.52, which was highest in summer. Based on redundancy analysis, environmental factors such as transparency, Chl alpha, water temperature and water depth, had greatly effects on the metazooplankton community structure. The results showed that the restoration of aquatic plants increased species diversity and metazooplankton density. This study provides a data basis for lakes restoration and a scientific basis for the management and protection of lakes water ecosystem.																			1932-6203					MAY 26	2021	16	5							e0252100	10.1371/journal.pone.0252100	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252100								34038464					WOS:000664633500049
J	Garcia-Ruiz, R; Pattinson, SN; Whitton, BA				Garcia-Ruiz, R; Pattinson, SN; Whitton, BA			Denitrification and nitrous oxide production in sediments of the Wiske, a lowland eutrophic river	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Denitrification rate and nitrous oxide production were investigated in sediments of the River Wiske, a lowland, nutrient-rich calcareous tributary of the River Swale, NE England. Slurries from samples taken on two occasions at the most downstream site were used to compare potential denitrifying activity at various depths; this activity decreased by about 40% between the 0-1 and 1-2 cm layers. Minimum and maximum values for 5-cm depth cores sampled at the same site from visually different sediments differed by a factor of four. Denitrification rate in cores measured monthly during 1996 showed the lowest values in winter, a peak in late spring and a subsequent decrease through summer and autumn. Nitrous oxide production showed a similar trend and accounted for 0-100% of total nitrogen gases produced by nitrate reduction, with an average value of 42%. Denitrification rate typically ranged over one order of magnitude on passing down the river. The relative importance of various environmental factors on denitrification rate was assessed by laboratory experimental studies, using previous data for nitrate and new studies on temperature and organic carbon. Temperature showed a different effect according to whether assays were carried out with cores or slurries; denitrification rate showed an increase up to 30 degrees C, irrespective of the season of sampling.

Samples were obtained from different sea and lake areas. Autumn- and spring-caught fish were analyzed separately. The vitamin E of all species consisted almost entirely of .alpha.-tocopherol. Muscle and roe contained relatively high levels of .alpha.-tocopherol. High- and medium-fat fish contained 2 mg and low-fat fish 1 mg/100 g on average. In high-fat fish the tocopherol:fat ratio was lower than in low-fat fish. Between-species differences in tocopherol content were observed, as were between-sample differences within the same species. Fish caught in the spring, the spawning season of most species, had a higher tocopherol content (and a lower fat content) than those caught in the autumn. Marine fish had a higher tocopherol (and fat) content than lake fish of the same species.						piironen, vieno/0000-0003-2831-3503													0003-021X	1558-9331					1985	62	8					1245	1248		10.1007/BF02541835	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02541835													WOS:A1985APE9000008

Carcasses were analyzed for lipids, moisture and dry weight content. Males were heavier than females in the same age class, and matures were heavier than juveniles in the same sex class, but differences were not always significant within a particular month. Carcass weights varied seasonally; the heaviest weights were recorded in Jan. and May and the lightest birds were found in April and late summer. During the summer, adult females steadily lost weight from the time they arrived on the breeding grounds in early June until the eggs hatched in early Aug. During the winter and spring, changes in the carcass weight and the component fractions varied together in the different age and sex classes. Trends in the lipid and dry weight fractions were similar to those exhibited in carcass weights, but the moisture fraction generally varied opposite to lipids and dry weight. Most seasonal variability in carcass weight could be accounted for by changes in the lipid fraction.																			0043-5643						1979	91	2					288	300																WOS:A1979HF69400010

A perennial brook is gauged at its spring at 2450 m a.s.l. where low water temperatures (0-4 degrees C) and very low discharge values (0.005-0.27 1 s(-1)) prevail. Another brook is gauged at 2500 m a.s.l. below a small cascade, where water temperature and discharge vary between 0 degrees C and 20 degrees C, and 0 and 91 s(-1), respectively. This brook freezes during winter. The predominant ions calcium, sulphate and bicarbonate rise in the perennial brook at baseflow during winter, decline sharply during snowmelt but remain rather constant during summer rains. Whereas nitrate remains low (< 30 mu eg l(-1)) in the perennial brook throughout the year nitrate concentrations in the ephemeral brook decrease from about 50 mu eq l(-1) during snowmelt to 25 mu eq l(-1) at the end of summer.

Establishing spatial and temporal patterns in Microcystis sediment seed stock viability and their relationship to subsequent bloom development in Western Lake Erie	PLOS ONE												This study assessed the distribution, abundance, and viability of pre- and post-overwintering Microcystis sediment seed stocks in Western Lake Erie and how these variables are potentially related to past and subsequent bloom formation. We conducted a two-year spatiotemporal survey of vegetative seed stocks in Western Lake Erie, the region where annual algal blooms generally develop. Sediment was collected from 16 sites covering an area of 375 km(2) and water column depths ranging from 3-9 meters. Sample collection occurred in November 2014, April 2015, November 2015, and April 2016. The abundance of total and potentially-toxic Microcystis cell equivalents were determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. A series of laboratory experiments using lake sediment were conducted to assess the viability of Microcystis vegetative seed stocks. Across all sampling periods, the abundance of total Microcystis in the sediment ranged from 6.6 x 10(4) to 1.7 x 10(9) cell equivalents g(-1), and potentially-toxic Microcystis ranged from 1.4 x 10(3) to 4.7 x 10(6) cell equivalents g(-1). The percent potentially-toxic Microcystis in the sediment ranged from <1% to 68% across all samples. Total Microcystis abundance diminished significantly over winter with densities in spring nearly 10 times less than the previous fall. However, despite cell loss from fall to spring, lab experiments demonstrated that remaining non-toxic and potentially-toxic cells were viable after the overwintering period. Further, lab grow-out experiments indicate that potentially-toxic strains recruited at a slightly higher rate than non-toxic strains, and may in part, contribute to the pattern of higher relative toxicity during early stages of the blooms. The abundance and distribution of overwintering cells did not correlate strongly to areas in the lake where subsequent summer blooms were most persistent. However, numerical analysis suggests that recruitment of benthic overwintering populations could help explain a portion of the initial rapid increase in bloom biomass and the spatial extent of this bloom initiation, particularly when recruitment is paired with subsequent growth in appropriate water column conditions.

J	BACK, C; HARPER, PP				BACK, C; HARPER, PP			SEASONAL SUCCESSION, EMERGENCE, VOLTINISM AND DISTRIBUTION OF BLACKFLIES (DIPTERA-SIMULIIDAE) IN LAURENTIDES	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												A study of the distribution and the emergence of blackflies in 33 stations in streams at the Saint Hippolyte Biology Station [Montreal, Canada] gives the following dynamic picture. The main emergence starts in May with the appearance of the univoltine species that have grown through the winter, followed by the 1st generation of spring-growing or summer-growing polyvoltine species. The predominance of the eurytopic univoltine species, mainly Prosimulium fuscum and Cnephia mutata, explains the presence of blackflies in nearly all the stations. In July the 2nd generation of the polyvoltine species appears: Simulium decorum, S. vittatum, S. aureum, S. verecundum, S. croxtoni and S. vernum. These species tend to be more stenotopic, which restricts emergence mainly to stations near lake outlets; the other stations harbor only small populations of S. tuberosum. The same distribution is evident in late Aug. and early Sept. when the 3rd generation of the polyvoltine species matures, particularly S. tuberosum, S. aureum and S. verecundum. A wet and cool summer tends to favor the development of large populations of blackflies.																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1979	57	3					627	639		10.1139/z79-074	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z79-074													WOS:A1979GR71900017

Mn/Ca ratios of Ammonia tepida as a proxy for seasonal coastal hypoxia	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Climate variability has major implications for marine geochemical cycles and biogenic carbonate production. Therefore, past climate-driven changes in marine environments are often inferred from geochemical data of the marine carbonate archive. Proxy calibration studies are essential for the reconstruction of such past environmental changes. Here, we use the geochemical composition of living specimens of the benthic foraminifer Ammonia tepida at three sites in a seasonally hypoxic (oxygen concentration < 63 mu mol/L) marine coastal system (Lake Grevelingen, the Netherlands) to explore the use of Mn/Ca as a proxy for coastal hypoxia. The study is based on samples from three stations along a depth transect, that show contrasts in the seasonal cycle of Mn2+ concentrations in the pore water of the surface sediment. In general, the sediment and pore water geochemistry of the three stations in Lake Grevelingen show increased Mn2+ concentrations in late winter/spring, combined with increased Mn refluxing in summer, which are due to cable bacteria activity and bottom water hypoxia/anoxia, respectively. Laser Ablation-ICP-MS (LA-ICP-MS) allowed a comparison of Mn/Ca ratios of different parts of the benthic foraminiferal test. Our results show that higher Mn/Ca ratios are registered at the deepest station, which experiences the longest and most severe seasonal periods of hypoxia/anoxia. Additionally, the signal preserved in the central part of the benthic foraminiferal tests, which is thought to reflect the entire calcification history of the analysed specimen, appears to be driven by high pore water Mn2+ concentrations due to cable bacteria activity in late winter/spring. Conversely, high Mn/Ca ratios in the last chambers reflect increased Mn refluxing in the surface sediment due to summer hypoxia/anoxia. Thus, Mn/Ca ratios of A. tepida give insight into the complex spatial and temporal variability of pore water manganese.					; Jorissen, Frans/D-2392-2009; Slomp, Caroline/A-9406-2012; Meysman, Filip/C-9585-2009	LA, Carole/0000-0003-1081-1897; MOURET, Aurelia/0000-0002-2258-7696; Petersen, Jassin/0000-0002-3591-9717; Meysman, Filip/0000-0001-5334-7655													0009-2541	1872-6836				JUL 20	2019	518						55	66		10.1016/j.chemgeo.2019.04.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2019.04.002													WOS:000468423200006

Monthly variations in cyst abundance and germination were tracked, and the effects of environmental factors (water temperature, pH, light and nutrients) on cyst germination were measured in the laboratory under ambient field conditions. During the bloom period, the cyst abundance of P. bipes in sediment samples fluctuated from 4 to 427 cells g(-1) (wet weight), and did not show season-dependent variation. During the same period, the number of vegetative cells of P. bipes in water samples varied from 0 to 9.79 x 10(2) ml(-1). Laboratory experiments revealed a maximum germination rate at 15.6 degrees C, and effective germination was observed at the naturally occurring pH values of 6 to 8, but not at pH 9. Cysts obtained from samples collected at higher temperatures (over 15 degrees C) germinated more quickly than those seeded at lower temperatures, while cysts collected in fall and early winter had a higher cumulative excystment rate than those collected in spring and summer, suggesting that cysts deposited at higher temperatures may act as a seed population for the winter blooms. These findings collectively indicate that germination of R bipes was mainly affected by water temperature and light intensity, and not nutrient levels and pH, and further show that the bloom of P. bipes observed in Juam Reservoir was likely promoted by the presence of sufficient nutrients, relatively high excystment rates and active growth occurring under low temperature conditions.

Describing historical habitat use of a native fish-cisco (Coregonus artedi)-in Lake Michigan between 1930 and 1932	PLOS ONE												With the global-scale loss of biodiversity, current restoration programs have been often required as part of conservation plans for species richness and ecosystem integrity. The restoration of pelagic-oriented cisco (Coregonus artedi) has been an interest of Lake Michigan managers because it may increase the diversity and resilience of the fish assemblages and conserve the integrity of the ecosystems in a changing environment. To inform restoration, we described historical habitat use of cisco by analyzing a unique fishery-independent dataset collected in 1930-1932 by the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries' first research vessel Fulmar and a commercial catch dataset reported by the State of Michigan in the same period, both based on gear fished on the bottom. Our results confirmed that the two major embayments, Green Bay and Grand Traverse Bay, were important habitats for cisco and suggest that the Bays were capable of supporting cisco to complete its entire life cycle in the early 20th century as there was no lack of summer feeding and fall spawning habitats. Seasonally, our results showed that cisco stayed in nearshore waters in spring, migrated to offshore waters in summer, and then migrated back to nearshore waters in fall. The results also suggest that in summer, most ciscoes were in waters with bottom depths of 20-70 m, but the highest cisco density occurred in waters with a bottom depth around 40 m. We highlight the importance of embayment habitats to cisco restoration and the seasonal migration pattern of cisco identified in this study, which suggests that a restored cisco population can diversify the food web by occupying different habitats from the exotic fishes that now dominate the pelagic waters of Lake Michigan.

The results show that the warming rate of the annual mean LSWT ranges from 0.14 degrees C per decade to 0.69 degrees C per decade with an average value of 0.44 degrees C per decade. The annual maximum LSWT presented the strongest warming trend, with the warming rate varying between 0.26 degrees C per decade and 1.06 degrees C per decade (average value of 0.65 degrees C per decade). Warming rates were observed in all seasons but with different intensities, with warming rates increasing from spring to autumn and then to summer. The warming rate of the summer LSWT varied between 0.29 degrees C per decade and 0.87 degrees C per decade with an average value of 0.56 degrees C per decade. Conversely, winter and annual minimum LSWTs did not present clear increasing trends. The increase in the annual maximum, annual average, and seasonal LSWTs correlated well with the inter-annual variability in air temperature. To understand the relationship between LSWT and air temperature, the non-linear regression model (S-curve) was used in this study. The results indicate that the non-linear regression model can help to present the relationship between LSWT and air temperature in the studied lakes (the average values of the root mean squared error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) are 1.68 degrees C, 1.28 degrees C, and 0.95, respectively). The warming trends of LSWTs observed for the studied lakes in Poland are coherent and in some cases larger than the data from other lakes worldwide, and should be seriously considered by policy makers.					; Dong, Wentao/S-5821-2019; Sojka, Mariusz/AFN-8790-2022; Ptak, Mariusz/O-3217-2015	Zhu, Senlin/0000-0003-2803-5419; Sojka, Mariusz/0000-0002-1453-0374; Ptak, Mariusz/0000-0003-1225-1686														2073-4433				FEB	2025	16	2							120	10.3390/atmos16020120	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos16020120													WOS:001429787200001
J	Lau, DCP; Goedkoop, W; Vrede, T				Lau, Danny C. P.; Goedkoop, Willem; Vrede, Tobias			Cross-ecosystem differences in lipid composition and growth limitation of a benthic generalist consumer	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												In a field study, we analyzed the fatty acid (FA) composition of the benthic generalist Asellus aquaticus collected from boreal lakes, ponds, and streams across gradients in ambient nutrient levels. In laboratory feeding experiments, we tested the diet-quality and seasonal effects on somatic growth and FAs of spring-and autumn-collected Asellus that were fed four different diets containing increasing concentrations of polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA): conditioned leaf litter, algal flakes, mixed litter and algal flakes (Mixed), or Mixed plus fish-food flakes. Ambient nutrients were strong determinants of FA variation of field Asellus, explaining > 44% in total. The ratios of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) to total FAs, EPA: omega 3, and omega 3 : omega 6 of Asellus increased up to four times with increasing trophic state and decreasing humic matter content, likely because dietary omega 3 FAs were more prevalent in benthic habitats of eutrophic than of oligotrophic systems. In the feeding trials, growth of Asellus collected in both seasons was markedly lower on leaf litter than on higher PUFA diets. However, autumn-collected Asellus fed a Mixed or Mixed+fish-food diet grew 3-10 times faster, but retained < 50% EPA and PUFA than spring counterparts. Asellus optimized PUFA accumulation in spring but somatic growth in autumn. Our field survey suggests ambient nutrient concentrations modify dietary PUFA supply from basal resources, while laboratory studies show that growth response and PUFA accumulation of Asellus differ between seasons, likely due to its season-specific physiological status and diet quality. An increase in nutrients will release benthic consumers from growth limitation and favor more efficient trophic transfer.

Its hydrological regime is poised to undergo dramatic changes in the near future due to hydropower development and climate change. The basin contains the second-largest lake in South America, and part of a major icefield. This study documents the natural baseline of the Baker River basin, discusses the main hydrological modes and analyses the potential for sustainable management. Annual precipitation varies several-fold from the eastern Patagonian steppes to the North Patagonian Icefield. The westernmost sub-basins are strongly governed by glacier melt with a peak discharge in the austral summer (January-March). The easternmost sub-basins have a much more seasonal response governed by quicker snowmelt in spring (November-December), while they exhibit low flows typical for semi-arid regions during summer and autumn. Topography, vegetation and wetlands may also influence streamflow. The strong spatio-temporal gradients and variability highlight the need for further monitoring, particularly in the headwaters, especially given the severe changes these basins are expected to undergo. The great diversity of hydrological controls and climate change pose significant challenges for hydrological prediction and management.

This study investigated the intraseasonal evolution and climatic characteristics of precipitation during the rainy season in the Poyang Lake Basin under the background of climate change. On the basis of the precipitation pattern, the rainy season was divided into three stages: the spring rainy season, Meiyu season, and summer rainy season. Generally, total precipitation and precipitation hours showed no significant trends of change, whereas precipitation intensity had an obvious trend of increase. In the spring rainy season, the trend of total precipitation was downward but not significant; however, owing to substantial reduction in precipitation duration, precipitation intensity was enhanced significantly. In the Meiyu season (summer rainy season), total precipitation increased significantly because of increased precipitation duration (precipitation intensity). The spatial distributions of total precipitation in the spring rainy season and Meiyu season were similar, i.e., precipitation occurred mostly in the east and less in the west; however, the spatial distributions of the change trends were opposite. In the summer rainy season, precipitation was concentrated primarily in the surrounding mountainous areas.

We used radiotelemetry to investigate the seasonal movements and habitat use by subadult bull trout (i.e., fish that emigrated from natal streams to the river system) tracked for varying durations from 1999 to 2002 in the upper Flathead River system in northwestern Montana. Telemetry data revealed migratory (N = 32 fish) and nonmigratory (N = 35 fish) behavior, indicating variable movement patterns in the subadult phase of bull trout life history. Most migrating subadults (84%) made rapid or incremental downriver movements (mean distance, 33 km; range, 6-129 km) to lower portions of the river system and to Flathead Lake during high spring flows and as temperatures declined in the fall and winter. Bull trout subadults used complex daytime habitat throughout the upper river system, including deep runs that contained unembedded boulder and cobble substrates, pools with large woody debris, and deep lake-influenced areas of the lower river system. Our results elucidate the importance of maintaining natural connections and a diversity of complex habitats over a large spatial scale to conserve the full expression of life history traits and processes influencing the natural dispersal of bull trout populations. Managers should seek to restore and enhance critical river corridor habitat and remove migration barriers, where possible, for recovery and management programs.																			0275-5947					AUG	2005	25	3					797	810		10.1577/M04-045.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M04-045.1													WOS:000231336800006

Salangen is a coastal, low altitude, subarctic lake system located in northern Norway. Climate data, including water temperature, air temperature, ice-cover and precipitation, were available for most of the 67 year period. Water temperatures in May and June had a significant effect on otolith growth during the second growth year, while no relationship between otolith growth and climate variables was found for the first, third and fourth years of otolith growth. Otolith increment size during the third and fourth growth year was autocorrelated with growth during the previous year. Spring snow fall and timing of ice break-up had an indirect effect on growth, as these variables were highly correlated with spring water temperatures. High variation in otolith growth within years and among individuals suggests that individual and age-specific variations in spatial habitat use may confound the direct effects of changing air temperatures and time of ice break-up.					; Svenning, Martin/JGT-7784-2023	Stien, Audun/0000-0001-8046-7337; Godiksen, Jane Aanestad/0000-0001-5491-2433; Kohler, Jack/0000-0003-1963-054X													0378-1909	1573-5133				NOV	2012	95	3					309	321		10.1007/s10641-012-9998-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-012-9998-0													WOS:000309581800002

The objectives of this study were to determine how bacterial community composition responded to hydrological fragmentation in summer, and to evaluate whether the seasonal shifts in community composition predominate over the effects of episodic habitat fragmentation. The bacterial community was assessed along the intermittent stream Fuirosos (Spain), at different levels of phylogenetic resolution by in situ hybridization, fingerprinting, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The hydrological fragmentation of the stream network strongly altered the biogeochemical conditions with the depletion of oxidized solutes and caused changes in dissolved organic carbon characteristics. In the isolated ponds, beta-Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria increased their abundance with a gradual reduction of the alpha-diversity as pond isolation time increased. Moreover, fingerprinting analysis clearly showed a shift in community composition between summer and autumn. In the context of a seasonal shift, the temporary stream fragmentation simultaneously reduced the microbial dispersion and affected local environmental conditions (shift in redox regime and quality of the dissolved organic matter) tightly shaping the bacterioplankton community composition.

The horizontal distribution of TC, TN, and TP reflects spatial and temporal differences in sedimentary organic production. The chemical sequential extraction of heavy metals was carried out by seven-step fractionation scheme (Leleyter and Probst in Int J Environ Chem 73:109-128, 1999). The significant concentrations of Ni and Cd were associated with "water soluble (Eua)" fraction in the monsoon and winter, respectively, while "exchangeable (Exch)" and "carbonate-bound (Carb)" fractions for Ni and Cd were abundant in winter and summer. The Cd, Cu, and Pb associated with "Exch" fraction in the summer season support their availability on exchange sites due to oxidized nature of surface sediments. Enrichment of Co, Fe, Mn, and Zn in "AFeO" fraction showed poor bioavailability, while Cd, Cu, and Mn in the monsoon, Co in the winter and summer, and Zn in the winter season showed significant "organically bound (Org)" fraction. The ANOVA was significant for chemical fractions of trace elements except "Carb" fraction of Pb and Zn and "CFeO" fraction of Pb. Factor analysis revealed that the "Eua", "Exch", and "Carb" fractions together control the metal enrichment of "MnO", "AFeO", and "CFeO" fractions in the summer season.

Range Creek Canyon was the home to Fremont maize farmers between roughly 1200 and 800 cal BP (AD 750-1150). Stable carbon isotope analysis of core sediments from Billy Slope Meadow indicate the Billy Slope Meadow site was used as a field for maize agriculture during that time. Some scholars have suggested the florescence of the Fremont culture may have been driven by increased summer precipitation, which improved the economic profitability of dry farming maize. But analysis of pollen, macroscopic charcoal and sediment geochemistry from Billy Slope Meadow, and a comparison with a local tree-ring chronology indicate the Fremont period in Range Creek Canyon was probably marked by reduced summer precipitation, and not an invigorated monsoon. The Fremont maize farmers of Range Creek Canyon therefore likely used winter snowpack-derived water from Range Creek for maize agriculture. This observation has significant implications, as using creek water rather than direct precipitation and runoff necessitates the construction of dams irrigation infrastructure, limited evidence for which has been reported by archaeologists working in the Fremont region.

The abundance of ciliated protozoa, rotifers and crustaceans was monitored simultaneously. Water samples were taken from March to November 1995. The dynamics of autotrophic picoplankton (APP) was characterised by three abundance maxima. The first and highest maximum was recorded in March, the second maximum appeared in August, whereas the third maximum was observed in October. The average APP number was 1.4 x 10(6) cells ml(-)1, while average biomass was 1.1 mg l(-1). APP was dominated by cyanobacteria and accounted for 1-85% of total phytoplankton biomass (34% on average). The biomass of phytoplankton larger than 2 mu m was often dominated by chrysophytes, dinoflagellates and green algae and was usually higher than APP biomass (except on four days). Dominance of one size group of phytoplankton was observed whenever total phytoplankton biomass was high: APP in early spring, nanophytoplankton in late spring and microphytoplankton in summer. When phytoplankton biomass was low, which was observed in late summer and autumn, the proportion of the size groups was more or less the same. The highest values of APP biomass did not coincide with the maximum of the larger phytoplankton and a significant decrease in APP biomass coincided with an increase in ciliate abundance.

We instrumented a Typic Durorthod with zero-tension lysimeters to capture water leaving the O, E, and B horizons and with sensors to determine volumetric water contents with depth. We also occasionally measured snowpack depths and determined snow water equivalents. These field data were used to validate a hydrologic model that was run for the site using nearby National Weather Service (NWS) data. Good agreement between the modeled output and field data from the site enabled us to apply 1961 to 2013 NWS data from three additional stations along a transect that spans the range of podzolization strength in Michigan as inputs to the model. Soils remain dry throughout the summer and slowly wet up in fall. The more strongly developed soils in the north are slightly wetter in fall, facilitating breakdown of fresh litter and enhancing production of soluble organic materials. Their translocation into the mineral soil is presumably deepest and most pronounced during snowmelt, facilitated by a strong "pulse" of cold snowmelt water. This pulse comprises well over half of the annual flux of water at 100-cm depth, even though its timespan is short. Snowmelt fluxes are larger and of shorter duration in the north, where podzolization is strongest. By storing precipitation in a thick snowpack, the pedogenic system compresses inputs of water, creating deeper, more concentrated pulses of percolation when soluble organic materials are readily available; this is the essence of podzolization in this region.																			0361-5995	1435-0661				JAN-FEB	2015	79	1					117	131		10.2136/sssaj2014.06.0239	http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2014.06.0239													WOS:000351640800013

This paper presents an analysis of data from 2000 to 2005 demonstrating UK experiences of algae at water treatment works. Cell populations are lower than those reported in the 1970s and 1980s, but reach levels that adversely affect treatment processes. Diatoms and cyanobacteria dominate in spring and autumn respectively. A treatment works including pre-oxidation, coagulation, flotation and filtration removes on average 96% of influent cells, while rapid gravity filters alone remove 63-75%. Cells present in the filtrate are typically either unicellular, micro-algae, or flagellated algae. filter blockages in the spring and autumn are caused by large cells of complex morphology, including the diatoms Melosira and Asterionella. Overall, since the 1980s the key issue with respect to algae treatment has changed from one of treatability to that of process optimisation and economics.

This paper studies the spatial and temporal distributions of matrix-bound phosphine (MBP) and gaseous phosphine in the offshore area of the Southwest Yellow Sea, East Asia. The results show that MBP concentrations in marine surface sediments range from 0.69 +/- 0.06 ng/kg (dry) to 179 +/- 29 ng/kg (dry). Higher seasonal MBP concentrations in sediments are found in fall than in spring or winter in most sites. High MBP contents are observed in two fish-breeding areas. MBP concentrations decrease with distance to the coast, except in the southeast of the sampling area. MBP levels in marine sediments are found to be higher than those at several other places: freshwater sediments and soil, except eutrophic lakes. Gaseous phosphine contents in fall range from 0.14 +/- 0.00 ng/m(3) to 9.83 +/- 0.97 ng/m(3). No correlation is observed between MBP and gaseous phosphine. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J	Vincent, AG; Font, WF				Vincent, AG; Font, WF			Seasonal and yearly population dynamics of two exotic helminths, Camallanus cotti (nematoda) and Bothriocephalus acheilognathi (cestoda), parasitizing exotic fishes in Waianu Stream, O'ahu, Hawaii	JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY												Exotic poeciliid fishes introduced into Hawaiian freshwaters are responsible for the introduction of several exotic parasites, of which the most important are Camallanus cotti and Bothriocephalus acheilognathi in terms of potential disease threat to native stream fishes. This roundworm and tapeworm are the most prevalent and abundant freshwater fish helminths in Hawaiian streams. This study examined the seasonal and yearly population structure of C cotti and B. acheilognathi to determine if the tropical Hawaiian environment characterized by low climatic variability permits continuous opportunities for parasite transmission regardless of time of year. Camallanus cotti displayed seasonal differences in prevalence and mean abundance, whereas B. acheilognathi did not. Camallanus cotti prevalence and mean abundance were higher in the Hawaiian summer (47.7%, 0.79) than in winter (25.8%, 0.36). A seasonal relationship of C. cotti levels is likely explained by extensive rains associated with the Hawaiian winter season, which may act to decrease parasite transmission by flushing infected poeciliid hosts, intermediate copepod hosts, and possibly free-living infective worm stages downstream. Bothriocephalus acheilognathi displayed low prevalence and mean abundance in both summer (4.0%, 0.06) and winter (6.5%, 0.07), and it may be difficult to detect seasonal changes due to these low levels. Camallanus cotti prevalence and mean abundance remained relatively constant from the summer of 1995 to the summer of 1999, indicating that levels of this roundworm are stable in Waianu Stream. Whereas B. acheilognathi prevalence and mean abundance were low during the summer of 1995 and the summer of 1997, a dramatic peak in prevalence and mean abundance was observed in the summer of 1998 (41.2%, 1.06), with levels decreasing sharply in the summer of 1999 (4.4%, 0.07). It appears that B. acheilognathi also is present in stable populations at low levels, even though levels rose sharply during a single year.																			0022-3395					AUG	2003	89	4					756	760		10.1645/GE-90R	http://dx.doi.org/10.1645/GE-90R								14533687					WOS:000185368800023
J	Kauppinen, J; Väänänen, VM				Kauppinen, J; Väänänen, VM			Factors affecting changes in waterfowl populations in eutrophic wetlands in the Finnish lake district	WILDLIFE BIOLOGY												From the 1970s to the 1990s, changes in breeding waterfowl populations were monitored at 26 well-vegetated lakes in southern Finland. Extreme total population levels were found to differ by 40%, but between successive years fluctuations did not exceed 20%, the most unstable populations being garganey Anas querquedula, tufted duck Aythya fuligula, coot Fulica atra and pochard Aythya ferina. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the effects of weather factors during wintering, spring and brood seasons on the variation in breeding waterfowl populations. The following weather factors were statistically significant in explaining fluctuations observed in four species; in garganey: spring temperature; in pintail Anas acuta: brood season temperature, winter severity in France and spring temperature; in goldeneye Bucephala clangula: winter severity in the Baltic and spring temperature; and in mallard Anas platyrhynchos: brood season temperature of the previous year. Mallard, teal Anas crecca, wigeon Anas penelope and goldeneye were shot in larger numbers than would be expected considering their respective proportions of the breeding waterfowl community. Hunting pressure on mallard, tufted duck and goldeneye was clearly higher in our study area than in other parts of Finland. Our results indicate that the level of hunting pressure in our study area may affect population densities of mallard.																			0909-6396	1903-220X				JUN	1999	5	2					73	81																WOS:000080973800002
J	DRUMMOND, CN; PATTERSON, WP; WALKER, JCG				DRUMMOND, CN; PATTERSON, WP; WALKER, JCG			CLIMATIC FORCING OF CARBON-OXYGEN ISOTOPIC COVARIANCE IN TEMPERATE-REGION MARL LAKES	GEOLOGY												Carbon and oxygen stable isotopic compositions of lacustrine carbonate from a southeastern Michigan marl lake display linear covariance over a range of 4.0 parts per thousand Peedee belemnite (PDB) in oxygen and 3.9 parts per thousand (PDB) in carbon. Mechanisms of delta(13)C-delta(18)O coupling conventionally attributed to lake closure in arid-region basins are inapplicable to hydrologically open lake systems. Thus, an alternative explanation of isotopic covariance in temperate region dimictic marl lakes is required. We propose that isotopic covariance is a direct record of change in regional climate. In short-residence-time temperate-region lake basins, summer meteoric precipitation is enriched in O-18 relative to winter values, and summer organic productivity enriches epilimnic dissolved inorganic carbon in C-13. Thus, climate change toward longer summers and/or shorter winters could result in greater proportions of warm-month meteoric precipitation, longer durations of warm-month productivity, and net long-term enrichment in carbonate O-18 and C-13. Isotopic covariance observed in the Michigan marl lake cores is interpreted to reflect postglacial warming from 10 to 3 ka followed by cooler mean annual temperature, a shift toward greater proportions of seasonal summer precipitation, a shortening of the winter season, or some combination of these three factors.					; Patterson, William/J-6473-2012	Patterson, William/0000-0003-3387-708X; 													0091-7613					NOV	1995	23	11					1031	1034		10.1130/0091-7613(1995)023<1031:CFOCOI>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0091-7613(1995)023<1031:CFOCOI>2.3.CO;2								11539129					WOS:A1995TD51800018

These data were compared with limited historical data from the Bois Brule River and nearby streams along the lake''s north shore in Minnesota. Within the Lake Superior basin, steelhead exhibited significant variation of fecundity among spawning runs in different rivers and among years but not between spring and fall (autumn) runs in the Bois Brule River in 1985. Steelhead that spawned in Wisconsin tributaries to Lake Superior during 1985-1987 were significant more fecund at a given size than were steelhead collected from tributaries along the north shore in Minnesota 20-25 years ago. Steelhead from Wisconsin tributaries produced egg numbers (3,000-6,900/female) similar to numbers (1,200-6,900) produced by Pacific Ocean steelhead in the same size range. Both length and weight of steelhead were strongly correlated with egg number and egg size. Age was not a good predictor of egg number. A common slope of 2.02 adequately fit all available Lake Superior data of length-fecundity relationships. The fecundity of steelhead for Wisconsin tributaries to Lake Superior can be estimated from the average equation for recent data from the two Wisconsin streams, log10y = -1.46 + 1.851log10x (y = egg number; x = total length in millimeters).																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAY	1989	118	3					311	316		10.1577/1548-8659(1989)118<0311:FOSAFS>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1989)118<0311:FOSAFS>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1989DC50300009

Seasonal variation in the size structure of the planktonic crustacean community was studied using three different multidimensional analyses: intermediate linkage clustering, principal coordinate analysis, and chronological clustering. The results of these analyses showed the existence of distinct patterns in the size distribution of planktonic crustaceans during the annual cycle. During winter, the community was dominated by intermediate-sized organisms (0.51-0.60 mmm), and by a few of larger size (0.96 mm). In springtime, nauplii appeared, and the larger size classes were reduced, giving the size spectra a characteristic shape. Small organisms (0.06-0.22 mm) dominated the population throughout the summer. The fall season was characterized by the opposite observation:small organisms slowly decreased in number while the intermediate classes (0.51-0.60 mm) increased in number to reach their peak in winter. These size-frequency patterns may be related to varying food levels and composition throughout the year.

Results indicated that multiple regression models were appropriate with precipitation, potential evapotranspiration of the current month, and precipitation of the last month as explanatory variables. The NASH coefficient for the Australia Water Balance Model was larger than 0.842, indicating satisfactory simulation of streamflow of the Poyang Lake basin. Comparison indicated that the sensitivity method could not exclude the benchmark-period human influence, and the human influence on streamflow changes was overestimated. Generally, contributions of human activities and climate change to streamflow changes were 73.2% and 26.8% respectively. However, human-induced and climate-induced influences on streamflow were different in different river basins. Specifically, climate change was found to be the major driving factor for the increase of streamflow within the Rao, Xin, and Gan River basins; however, human activity was the principal driving factor for the increase of streamflow of the Xiu River basin and also for the decrease of streamflow of the Fu River basin. Meanwhile, impacts of human activities and climate change on streamflow variations were distinctly different at different temporal scales. At the annual time scale, the increase of streamflow was largely because of climate change and human activities during the 1970s-1990s and the decrease of streamflow during the 2000s. At the seasonal scale, climate change was the main factor behind the increase of streamflow in the spring and summer season. Human activities increase the streamflow in autumn and winter, but decrease the streamflow in spring. At the monthly scale, different influences of climate change and human activities were detected. Climate change was the main factor behind the decrease of streamflow during May to June and human activities behind the decrease of streamflow during February to May. Results of this study can provide a theoretical basis for basin-scale water resources management under the influence of climate change and human activities.

J	WARD, DM; BROCK, TD				WARD, DM; BROCK, TD			ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS INFLUENCING RATE OF HYDROCARBON OXIDATION IN TEMPERATE LAKES	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Rates of hydrocarbon biodegradation were estimated by following O2 uptake during mineral oil oxidation or oxidation of [1-14C]hexadecane to 14CO2, when these substrates were added to natural water samples from Wisconsin [USA] lakes. A lag phase preceded hydrocarbon oxidation, the length of which depended on population density or on factors influencing growth rate and on the presence of nonhydrocarbon organic compounds. Hydrocarbon oxidation was coincident with growth and presumably represented the development of indigenous hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms in response to hydrocarbon additions. In detailed studies in Lake Mendota, despite the continued presence of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms in water samples, seasonal variations in the rates of mineral oil and hexadecane oxidation occurred which correlated with seasonal changes in temperature and dissolved inorganic N and P. The temperature optimum for oil biodegradation remained at 20-25.degree. C throughout the year, so that temperature was the main limiting factor during winter, spring and fall. During summer, when temperatures were optimal, nutrient deficiencies limited oil biodegradation, and higher rates could be obtained by addition of N and P. The rates of hydrocarbon biodegradation were thus high only for about 1 mo. of the ice-free period, when temperature and nutrient supply were optimal. Nutrient limitation of oil biodegradation was also demonstrated in 25 nutrient-poor lakes of northern Wisconsin, although in almost every case oil-degrading bacteria were detected. Knowledge of temperature and nutrient limitations thus will help in predicting the fate of hydrocarbon pollutants in freshwater.																			0099-2240	1098-5336					1976	31	5					764	772		10.1128/AEM.31.5.764-772.1976	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.31.5.764-772.1976								1275495					WOS:A1976BT66700026

Both services must be demonstrated for bioinfiltration to be considered green infrastructure, because most urban centers in cold desert climates in the western United States (e.g.,Salt Lake City, Utah; Boise, Idaho; and Denver, Colorado) must import water from the Colorado River for landscape irrigation, radically changing local and regional hydrology. To verify that storm-water runoff can sustain properly selected plants, we installed soil moisture sensors in a bioinfiltration garden in a cold desert climate with a contributing impervious area to garden area ratio of 1:1 and monitored soil water for one summer. In spite of the small contributing impervious area, we found that the minimum soil water potential () observed was -2.5mPa. Plants native to cold desert climates often do not show signs of water stress until drops below -5mPa, indicating the selected plants did not experience water stress in this study. We conclude that with proper site design and plant selection, plants in bioinfiltration gardens can be sustained solely by runoff. If the bioinfiltration gardens are constructed in fall, winter, or spring, no irrigation will likely be needed for establishment.																			0733-9437	1943-4774				FEB 1	2014	140	2							06013004	10.1061/(ASCE)IR.1943-4774.0000663	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)IR.1943-4774.0000663													WOS:000333446200002
J	BIGRAS, SC				BIGRAS, SC			HYDROLOGICAL REGIME OF LAKES IN THE MACKENZIE DELTA, NORTHWEST TERRITORIES, CANADA	ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												This paper consolidates and interprets the information collected from 1981 to 1985 on the hydrological regime of various lakes located in three regions along the eastern section of the Mackenzie River Delta, Northwest Territories. Information is presented on the frequency, duration, and spatial pattern of spring flooding, as well as on the hydrologic processes and mechanisms which control lake levels from break-up to freeze-up. This information is used to interpret the hydrological regime of three lake types found in the delta with respect to spring flood recharge, rapid spring drainage, and summer lake evaporation. Two characteristics are shared by all the lakes: the spring flood is the dominant hydrologic event, and evaporation is greater than summer precipitation and is similar to or greater in amount to annual precipitation. Each lake type also has its own particular combination of processes and mechanisms which controls the water level. Some lakes, however, are more sensitive to summer evaporation losses than others, causing them to have a negative annual water balance until flooding occurs.																			0004-0851					MAY	1990	22	2					163	174		10.2307/1551301	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1551301													WOS:A1990DJ77500004

The study was conducted at 6 stations at monthly intervals between May 2003 and April 2004. It was observed that the abundance and biovolume of phytoplankton were low in winter, though higher values were recorded in late spring and summer. Among the values noted, the spring peak was 534.38 x 10(5) ind. L-1 and 7384.8 mm(3) L-1 belonging to Peridinium sp. The most common diatom, Cyclostephanos dubius, was favoured by low discharge at stations 1 and 2 in the early summer (214.29 x 10(5) in L-1 and 9.84 x 10(5) in L-1), respectively. Chlorophyll-a concentrations were between 0.86 and 64.2 mu g L-1. A total of 135 taxa belonging to Cyanophyta, Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta, Dinophyta, Euglenophyta, Heterokontophyta, Streptophyta, and Xanthophyta were identified. The total biomass of the stations 1 and 2 was mainly characterised by Dinophyta and at other stations by Bacillariophyta. Five major genera (Peridinium, Ceratium, Phacus, Cyclostephanos, and Melosira) accounted for over 70% of the total phytoplankton abundance. Phytoplankton abundance was significant and positively correlated with Chl-a and temperature (r = 0.57 and r = 0.78, respectively P < 0.05). Species richness and diversity indices increased gradually throughout the course of the river.

Comparisons were made between metal concentrations in water and sediment with those in muscle, gill, and liver of these fish species. In all samples, concentrations of most metals were high. Water samples contained high levels of Cu in winter and Fe in summer, whereas those of Co were low during both seasons. Sediment samples contained high Fe amounts in winter and summer, but those of Cd and Pb were low in summer and that of Co and Cu in winter. Moreover, there was more metal accumulation in the muscle of Cyprinus carpio and Carassius carassius than in the liver or gills. The pollution in this area likely originates from agricultural and domestic waste discharges.

J	SONDERGAARD, M				SONDERGAARD, M			PORE WATER DYNAMICS IN THE SEDIMENT OF A SHALLOW AND HYPERTROPHIC LAKE	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Seasonal variations in pore water with main stress on pH and phosphate were investigated in the sediment of the shallow and hypertrophic Lake Sobygaard, Denmark. The purpose was to evaluate factors affecting the internal phosphorus loading. Pore water was obtained by in situ incubation of ceramic cups, sampled anaerobically from a fixed position in the sediment. The method is evaluated. During summer, pH and phosphate concentrations increased in the upper 8-10 cm of the sediment. Increased pH was most pronounced in the upper 5 cm, where pH increased to between 9 and 10. This is believed to be caused by the photosynthetically elevated pH in the above lake water. Phosphate concentrations increased with depth, from 0-2 mg P l-1 in the upper 5 cm to 3-6 mg P l-1 in 6-10 cm depth. Average phosphate gradient in the upper 6-8 cm was 1.0 mg p l-1 cm-1 in the summer decreasing to 0.2 mg P l-1 cm-1 in the autumn/winter. In spite of low redox potential, Fe(II) was not present in the upper 20 cm. The seasonal variation in pore water phosphate is believed mainly to be due to the variations in pore water pH inducing a substitution of phosphate ions with hydroxyl ions on ironhydroxides during summer. A considerable sedimentation of organic bound phosphorus and decomposition in the sediment is also considered important. Phosphorus release from the sediment is facilitated by bio- and gas turbation and by the frequent occurrence of resuspension caused by wind action. Net release rate is highly variable during the season. The summer average is 40 mg P m-2 d-1.

Spawning occurred at a limited number of locations in these systems. Newly-emerged coho fry moved both upstream and downstream from spawning areas in the Misty Lake system towards Misty Lake. The capture of fry in Long Lake and its outlet stream, where spawning was not observed, indicated upstream dispersion of fry from the Keogh River. The lakes provided both summer rearing and over-wintering habitat for juvenile coho salmon, but their use varied between years. The mainstem Keogh River was used in primarily for rearing during summer. Coho fry generally grew fastest in the lakes and their outlet streams. Cohorts of large fry (mean FL > 80 mm) did not show over-winter growth, but the mean sizes of cohorts of small fry (mean FL < 70 mm) increased over winter, suggesting size-differential mortality. The utilization of small tributary lakes and streams as both summer rearing and over-wintering habitat by juvenile coho salmon suggests that more emphasis should be placed on the preservation and management of such areas. Because use of these habitats may be temporally variable, their importance is easily underestimated.

Spring-summer diet of lake trout on Six Fathom Bank and Yankee Reef in Lake Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We examined the stomach contents of 1,045 lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) caught on Six Fathom Batik and Yankee Reef two offshore reef complexes in Lake Huron, during late spring and early summer 1998-2003. Lake trout ranged it? total length from 213 to 858 nun, and in age from 2 to 14 years. In total, 742 stomachs contained food. On a wet-weight basis, alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) dominated the spring-summer diet of lake trout on both of these offshore reef complexes. Alewives accounted for 75 to 90% of lake trout diet, depending on the lake trout size category. Size of alewives found in lake trout stomachs increased with increasing lake trout size. Faster growth of juvenile lake trout on Six Fathom Bank and Yankee Reef than on Sheboygan Reef in Lake Michigan was attributed to greater availability of small alewives on the offshore reefs in Lake Huron. Our findings indicated that alewives inhabited Six Fathom Batik and Yankee Reef during spring and summer months. Thus, our study provided support for the contention that alewives may have interfered with natural reproduction by lake trout on these offshore reef complexes in Lake Huron.																			0380-1330						2006	32	2					200	208		10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[200:SDOLTO]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[200:SDOLTO]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000239185200002

Changes in the timing of snowmelt and the seasonality of nutrient loading: can models simulate the impacts on freshwater trophic status?	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES					Eastern Snow Conference (ESC)	JUN 05-07, 2012	Clayville, NY					The New York City water supply region, located in the Catskill Mountains in upstate New York, has always had a historically variable snow cover, with consequent effects on the magnitude of spring runoff and the relative importance of winter versus spring periods on annual hydrologic and nutrient budgets. Simulations show that under present conditions (1966-2005), on average 38% (12%-70%) of the annual total dissolved phosphorus load occurs during winter (Nov-Feb), while future predictions (2046-2065 and 2081-2100) show winter nutrient loads may account for an average of 46% (18%-73%) of the annual load. It is expected that changes in the importance of winter nutrient loading will lead to some increase in phytoplankton growth under isothermal conditions prior to the onset of thermal stratification, a reduced bloom coinciding with the onset of thermal stratification, and on an annual basis somewhat lower levels of biomass. However, future climate simulations using two different one-dimensional reservoir water quality models show no strong relationship between changes in algal biomass and the proportion of winter nutrient loading. The lack of a winter response calls into question model assumptions concerning the growth potential of phytoplankton under deeply mixed low light conditions, as well as factors influencing the bioavailability of nutrients input during the winter period. This illustrates the pitfalls of simulating future climate conditions, when the seasonality of model drivers has changed, and processes regulating winter conditions are not strongly represented.

The objective was to evaluate phytoplankton responses to pH manipulation and nutrient addition. Increasing the pH from below 4.5 to over 6.3 resulted in great declines in phytoplankton biovolume. There was also a succession from dinoflagellates (Peridinium inconspicuum to small chlorophytes. The trend was more rapid where phosphorus (P) additions were made along with pH enhancement. During summer, P limitation was indicated, while nitrogen (N) appeared to limit production in autumn. In both seasons, nutrient additions greatly altered the phytoplankton composition in high pH treatments, but had no discernable effects at (the natural) low pH. A low pH, P addition treatment in autumn was the single exception. When N was subsequently added, phytoplankton composition changed dramatically probably because the preceeding P additions caused severe secondary N-limitation. In general, however, the results supported the view that phytoplankton compositional responses to nutrient additions are suppressed in low pH, relative to high pH lake water.																			0018-8158					OCT 14	1994	291	2					93	103																WOS:A1994PR74500002

During an annual cycle in German Bight surface waters, the percentages of bacteria visualized by polyFISH (annual mean, 77% of total counts) were significantly higher than those detected by oligoFISH (53%). The fraction of total bacteria visualized by oligoFISH declined during winter, whereas cell numbers determined by polyFISH remained constant throughout the year. Depth profiles from Monterey Bay showed large differences in the fraction of bacterial cells visualized by polyFISH and oligoFISH in the deeper water layers irrespective of the season. Image-analyzed microscopy indicated that the superior detection of cells by polyFISH with fluorescein-labeled probes in bacterioplankton samples was less a consequence of higher absolute fluorescence intensities but was rather related to quasi-linear bleaching dynamics and to a higher signal-to-background ratio. The relative abundances of archaea in North Sea and Monterey Bay spring samples as determined by oligoFISH were on average higher than those determined by polyFISH. However, simultaneous hybridizations with oligonucleotide probes for bacteria and archaea suggested that the oligoFISH probe ARCH915 unspecifically stained a population of bacteria. Using either FISH technique, blooms of archaea were observed in North Sea surface waters during the spring and summer months. Marine group 11 archaea (Euryarchaeota) reached >30% of total picoplankton abundances, as determined by polyFISH. We suggest that studies of pelagic microbial community structure using oligoFISH with monolabeled probes should focus on environments that yield detections greater than or equal to70% of total cell counts, e.g., coastal surface waters during spring and summer.

J	Cleven, EJ; Weisse, T				Cleven, EJ; Weisse, T			Seasonal succession and taxon-specific bacterial grazing rates of heterotrophic nanoflagellates in Lake Constance	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												We investigated the taxonomic composition of the heterotrophic nanoflagellate (HNF) assemblage and its taxon-specific bacterial grazing rates in Lake Constance (Germany) over the course of 1 yr. Bacterial grazing rates were measured using natural fluorescently labelled bacteria (FLB) and compared to bacterial production estimated by the uptake of C-14-leucine incorporation. Glutaraldehyde-fixed, DAPI-stained flagellates were counted using epifluorescence microscopy. Based on annual averages, small species such as Spumella sp. (2 to 6 mum) were the most numerous HNF and the dominant bacterivores. Larger flagellates such as Kathablepharis sp, contributed significantly to total HNF biomass, in particular during spring, but were relatively unimportant as bacterial grazers. The HNF community structure changed during the transition from the phytoplankton spring bloom to the clearwater phase, with small flagellates such as heterokonts, kinetoplastids and choanoflagellates becoming increasingly abundant. The flagellate community composition was more diverse during summer and autumn than in spring. Per capita ingestion rates ranged from 0 to 31 bacteria HNF-1 h(-1) and changed seasonally up to 10-fold within a given taxon. Mixotrophic species contributed little to total bacterivory. We provide evidence that the relative significance of bacterial ingestion by a given flagellate taxon may change seasonally. Based upon our experimental results, we discuss potential shortcomings inherent in the FLB technique.

Spatial and seasonal characterization of the waterbird assemblage of The Strobel Plateau, Patagonia, Argentina	ORNITOLOGIA NEOTROPICAL												Wetlands are key ecosystems due to their role as biodiversity reservoirs, and are particularly important in arid environments. We studied the waterbird assemblage structure of the Strobel Plateau, an important bird conservation area in southern Patagonia. The effects of spatial and seasonal variation on species composition, abundance, richness, and diversity were analyzed based on 243 counts in 102 shallow lakes during spring, summer, and autumn. Habitat utilization was assessed based on a previous classification which defined 4 different types of lakes: large non-vegetated (GNV), large vegetated (GV), small vegetated (PV), and turbid (TB). We recorded 18 waterbird species comprising five families and 12 genera. Maximum waterbird abundance was observed in spring in the GV lakes, while highest diversity appeared in summer at the TB lakes. Ducks and swans (family Anatidae) dominated the assemblages in all kind of lakes and during all evaluated seasons, both in abundance and frequency of occurrence. The threatened species (Hooded Grebe, Podiceps gallardoi; Chilean Flamingo, Phoenicopterus chilensis) and the only Neartic migrant (Wilsons's Phalarope, Phalaropus tricolor) recorded were an important part of the assemblage. This study shows the importance of habitat characteristics in determining the structure of waterbird assemblages and their temporal dynamics in Lake Strobel Plateau. The plateau lakes are a dynamic mosaic showing marked seasonal variation in number and limnological characteristics. In this context, aquatic birds may depend more on the network of lakes than on individual lakes. Thus, conservation management actions need to take into account the lake system as a whole and its temporal patterns of variation.																			1075-4377						2016	27						77	87																WOS:000385627300010

C01010	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Moored observations of winds, currents, and temperature made off the southeastern Lake Michigan shore during 1998 to 2000 winter-spring periods are studied to describe the mean winter circulation and episodic circulation during northerly storms in Lake Michigan. Late winter-spring sediment plumes in southeastern Lake Michigan were attributed to these episodic circulation features. The winter-spring currents in southeastern Lake Michigan are quite depth independent, and the mean currents flow predominantly alongshore and toward the north. The observed currents show the signature of a forced two-gyre circulation in the southeastern basin. The interannual variability of mean and fluctuating currents is mainly due to the variability of prevailing wind-forcing. The intermittent episodic circulation influenced by northerly storms causes significant asymmetry to the mean circulation. During northerly storm episodes, the mean current speeds increased significantly, and the currents within 10 km of shore followed the surface wind stress, while farther offshore the circulation was oppositely directed. During these episodes it is also observed that the combination of directly wind-forced currents and northward propagating vorticity wave generates significant offshore transport in this region.

Projected changes in future climate over the Midwest and Great Lakes region using downscaled CMIP5 ensembles	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Despite an increasing body of evidence from observed data that climate change is having a significant impact on different types of biogeophysical systems in the Midwest and Great Lakes region, there still remain critical questions of how quickly and how much climate will be altered over this region in the future. For this evaluation, we make use of 31 global climate model (GCM) projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 5 (CMIP5). Based on changes in temperature (T) and precipitation (P) over the Midwest, we selected ten GCM scenarios which (1) simulate historical climate well and (2) successfully capture the range of future climate from the entire CMIP5 ensemble. We then downscaled T and P projections to 1/16 degrees gridded data sets for two different emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for three 30-year future periods using the Hybrid Delta (HD) statistical downscaling approach which was proven to be applicable for daily-scale application by a validation work using historical data. T is projected to increase across all seasons, with ensemble mean changes up to 6.5 degrees C by 2100 for the RCP8.5 scenarios. P increases up to 30% in spring and winter with decreasing snowfall to precipitation ratio, while summer P decreases moderately (-15%) by the 2080s. Changes in daily extreme events show similar seasonal patterns including increasing daily extreme P events in winter and decreasing P in summer. Growing season P may actually increase, however, despite projected P reductions in the warmest summer months. Regional warming results in decreased heating degree days (-1639 degrees C days, -32%) and increasing cooling degree days (+318 degrees C days, +957%) by 2080s, with overall net reductions in energy demand.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the levels of some heavy metals (Cu, Fe, Zn and Mn) in three different tissues (muscle, liver and gill) of pikeperch (Sander lucioperca L., 1758) and crucian carp (Carassius carassius L., 1758) from Kovada Lake by atomic absorption spectrometry. One-way ANOVA and Duncan's Multiple Comparison Test were used to compare the data among seasons (level of 0.05). Cu concentrations in muscle and gill as well as Mn in muscle and liver of both species were below detection limits. Mean concentrations in muscle, liver and gill of pikeperch followed the sequences Fe > Zn; Fe > Zn > Cu; Fe > Zn > Mn, respectively, while in muscle, liver and gill of crucian carp, the distribution followed the orders Zn > Fe; Fe > Zn > Cu; Zn > Fe > Mn;, respectively. The metal accumulations in liver and gill of S. lucioperca and C carassius were found to be quite high, in comparison with the muscle. The effect of the seasons on heavy metal accumulation in tissues and organs of S. lucioperca and C carassius were also determined. In general, the concentrations of the tested metals were observed to be higher in spring and summer, but lower in autumn and winter. The analysed metals (Cu, Fe, Zn and Mn) were found in the fish muscle at mean concentrations under the permissible FAO limits.					; TEKİN-ÖZAN, SELDA/AHE-1909-2022	Kir, Ismail/0000-0002-8700-1174; 													1018-4619						2007	16	8					904	909																WOS:000249228400009

A strong significant correlate relationship between the in situ TSM data and the atmospherically corrected MODIS-Aqua remote sensing reflectance at the 645 nm band (R-rs(645)) was found (R-2 = 0.70, p < 0.001, n = 150). From these data, a local TSM model was developed for Lake Taihu. Long-term TSM distribution maps retrieved from the MODIS-Aqua data demonstrated marked temporal and spatial variations. Temporally, significant lower TSM was found in summer and autumn than in winter and spring (p < 0.005, t-test). The significant seasonal variability could be attributed to sediment resuspension due to changes in the wind speed between different seasons. Lake Taihu also experiences large inter-annual variations that are primarily caused by changes in wind force over the region. In particular, the TSM in Lake Taihu from 2006 to 2008 was relatively lower than in other years, which could be explained by the lower mean wind speed during these years compared to the other years. Spatially, the TSM in the Open area, especially in the southern part of this region, was consistently higher than in other sub-regions of Lake Taihu. The coverage of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) generally characterized East Lake Taihu as a region with a relatively lower TSM. Lake topographic conditions, SAV, and runoff discharge jointly contributed to the spatial variations in TSM. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The influence of soil contamination on the concentrations of PCBs in milk in Siberia	CHEMOSPHERE					24th International Symposium on Halogenated Environmental Organic Pollutants and POPs	SEP, 2004	Tech Univ Berlin, Berlin, GERMANY	German Fed Environm Minist, Japanese Minist Environm, Japanese Ctr Environm Informat Sci, US Natl Inst Environm Hlth Sci	Tech Univ Berlin			Although atmospheric deposition is generally the dominant pathway of PCBs into agricultural food chains, soil ingestion by livestock can be important in some cases. The relationship between PCB levels in cow's milk and in pasture soil was studied in the Irkutsk region in Siberia where an historical atmospheric source(s) of PCBs has led to widespread contamination of soil. Milk samples were collected in spring and again in autumn from 18 different farms and analyzed for PCBs. Pasture soil samples were also collected and analyzed. The PCB concentrations in both milk and soil ranged over more than an order of magnitude between the farms. A good correlation was obtained between PCB levels in autumn milk and in soil. This together with a range of other evidence suggested that ingestion of pasture soil was the dominant source of the PCB contamination in the milk. The average soil ingestion rate was estimated to be 1700 g/d, which is at the upper end of values reported in the literature. This may be due to the and summer climate or the animal husbandry practices in Siberia. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	MUNAWAR, M; MUNAWAR, IF; SPRULES, WG				MUNAWAR, M; MUNAWAR, IF; SPRULES, WG			THE PLANKTON ECOLOGY OF LAKE ST-CLAIR, 1984	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lake St. Clair phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance and composition was analyzed during the period of May to September 1984. In addition, size-fractionated primary productivity and other limnological parameters were measured. Highest phytoplankton biomass was observed during spring (May) with high values for the southern and southeastern regions of the lake. Seasonally, the mean phytoplankton biomass ranged between 0.17 and 1.18 g m-3 with high values recorded during spring (May, June) compared to summer. In the spring the phytoplankton was dominated by Diatomeae followed by Chrysophyceae and Cryptophyceae. During the summer the diatoms showed a decreasing trend due to the relative prevalence of Chrysophyceae, Cryptophyceae, and Chlorophyta. The species composition was oligotrophic-mesotrophic with mixed occurrence of some eutrophic species. The phytoplankton size composition indicated dominance of microplankton/netplankton (> 20-mu-m) and ultraplankton (< 20-mu-m) during spring and summer respectively. On an overall basis ultraplankton contributed overwhelmingly to primary productivity, as much as 75 percent in the summer. The mean zooplankton biomass ranged from 173.0 to 1306.0 mg l-1 dominated by Cladocerans (bosminids) in contrast to the other Great Lakes. Statistical evaluation of the phytoplankton - nutrient-contaminant interactions revealed positive correlations with heavy metals, suggestive of a physiological adaptation to contamination from the chemical valley. Based on low biomass, high Production/Biomass ratio, dominance of ultraplankton, characteristic species composition and plankton spectra, the lake appears to be an oligotrophic-mesotrophic perturbed ecosystem.																			0018-8158					JUL 26	1991	219						203	227		10.1007/BF00024756	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00024756													WOS:A1991GK03100014
J	ELLIOTT, JM				ELLIOTT, JM			SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION AND BEHAVIORAL MOVEMENTS OF MIGRATORY TROUT SALMO-TRUTTA IN A LAKE DISTRICT STREAM	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												(1) As the sample variance to mean relationship for 18 year-classes (1967-84) of migratory trout, Salmo trutta L., followed Taylor''s Power Law, their spatial distribution was density-dependent. As expected, there were significant changes in the relative level of clumping at different stages in the life cycle. (2) The first spatial change, a decrease in relative clumping soon after the end of the alevin stage in April, was related to the behavioural movements of the fry emerging from the nest, usually at night. About 81% of fry in field experiments rarely fed, soon lost weight after their yolk was exhausted, drifted downstream chiefly at night and died. The others started to feed and either remained near their birthplace or migrated, usually upstream. The proportion migrating was density-dependent, increasing from < 1% to c. 12% as the number of fry per nest increased. Few fry emigrated out of the stream and therefore population losses in spring were chiefly due to mortality. (3) The second spatial change, an increase in relative clumping in the first winter of the life cycle, was related to the behavioural movements of first-year trout when they migrated to deeper pools in the stream. A few first-year trout emigrated out of the stream in winter, but population losses in the first summer and winter of the life cycle were chiefly due to mortality, usually within the stream, rather than migration. (4) There were no major spatial changes for second-year trout in the second spring, summer and winter of the life cycle. The third spatial change, a slight increase in the relative clumping of third-year trout, was related to their increased mobility just before they emigrated from the stream as smolts. Few second and third-year trout died in the stream and most moribund fish moved out of the stream. (5) The implications of this investigation are discussed and it is concluded that the parameters of the Power Law are not only species-specific but also life-stage specific. The present investigation has shown that such parameter changes can be used to detect major spatial changes that can be related to behavioural movements.																			0021-8790	1365-2656				OCT	1986	55	3					907	922		10.2307/4424	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4424													WOS:A1986E617900011

The abundance and species composition of the phytoplankton of Grasmere were monitored over a 12 year period following the commissioning of a small sewage treatment works, upstream of the lake. 2. Although Grasmere has been subject to increased phosphorus-loading and has quickly developed many features associated with eutrophication, the composition of its plankton has retained the characteristics of a mesotrophic, soft-water lake: a vernal diatom maximum, generally dominated by Asterionella, is followed by summer growths of nanoplanktonic species, of various colonial Chlorophyceae, before a substantial return to Asterionella-dominance in the autumn. In cooler summers there have been episodes of renewed diatom growth, followed by truncated recapitulations of the essential summer sequence. Anabaena solitaria was relatively common in drier summers when dissolved inorganic nitrogen fell to low concentrations, although many of the ''larger'' algal species associated with stratified eutrophic lakes (Aphanizomenon Microcystis, Ceratium spp.) have failed to become abundant in Grasmere. 3. Mean biomass levels (as indicated by chlorophyll concentration) have increased in response to the enrichment, though they do not conform well with most chlorophyll/phosphorus regression-models. 4. The key factor resisting a more complete transition to a typical eutrophic plankton appears to be the efficiency of episodic flushing of the lake during periods of high fluvial discharge sustained by heavy rainfall over the extensive, mountainous catchment. The probabilities that these limnological conditions might fail to deter the development of ''nuisance'' blooms are briefly assessed.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				JUN	1988	19	3					379	404		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1988.tb00359.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1988.tb00359.x													WOS:A1988N849600009

This study was conducted in summer, spring and autumn (2010-2011) in the deep-water zone of the polymictic, strongly eutrophic Vistula Lagoon. Its objective was to test whether temporal changes in density of the larvae affect their horizontal microdistribution and burrowing depth. Horizontal distribution, as inferred from indices of dispersion and patchiness, was density-dependent. The larvae spread more regularly with increasing density. The decreased density was associated with an increase in clustered distribution. The larvae burrowed into sediments up to a depth of 25 cm. The maximum burrowing depth positively correlated with total density, but also depended on the size of the larvae. The smallest individuals (<10 mm) did not occur deeper than 5 cm. Larger larvae were encountered throughout the sediment profile. The largest larvae did not always burrow the deepest. In spring before pupation, the larvae gathered below the sediment surface.

Food Habits of Stunted and Non-Stunted White Perch (Morone americana)	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												We studied food habits of white perch (Morone americana) from two populations with different stable states (stunted [Branched Oak Lake, Nebraska] and non-stunted [Pawnee Lake, Nebraska]) to determine if change in food habits of white perch is likely to occur in situations where a stunted white perch population is altered to a non-stunted state and vice versa. Three approaches were used to quantitatively describe seasonal (spring = March-May, summer = June-August, autumn = September-November) diets of white perch - 1) frequency of occurrence, 2) percentage of composition by volume, and 3) mean stomach fullness. White perch diets were dominated by cladocerans and dipterans in both reservoirs during all seasons. Fish egg predation was similar between reservoirs, and white perch rarely consumed fishes in either the stunted or the non-stunted population. Shifting a white perch population between stunted and non-stunted states will likely cause little or no change in food habits; fish in both states will primarily consume invertebrates.					; Pope, Kevin/D-8096-2011	Gosch, Nathan/0000-0002-4993-642X; Pope, Kevin/0000-0003-1876-1687													0270-5060					MAR	2010	25	1					31	39		10.1080/02705060.2010.9664354	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2010.9664354													WOS:000275293500004

Phytoplankton trends in the Great Lakes, 2001-2011	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We describe recent trends in phytoplankton composition and abundance in the Laurentian Great Lakes using synoptic spring (April) and summer (August) sampling events from 2001 through 2011, a period of rapid shifts in pelagic food webs and water quality. Data analysis identified qualitative and quantitative changes in algal densities, biovolume, and taxonomic composition of assemblages. Since 2001, Lake Superior has changed subtly with an increase in small-celled blue-green algae in spring and a recent decline in summer centric diatoms, possibly a result of lake warming and changes in water quality. Spring phytoplankton declines mainly attributed to diatoms occurred in Lakes Huron and Michigan, a probable result of invasions by non-native dreissenids that have reduced pelagic nutrients and selectively consumed certain taxa. The decline in Lake Huron's spring phytoplankton biovolume was earlier and more severe than that in Lake Michigan, despite a faster and more abundant dreissenid invasion in Lake Michigan. Lake Erie's central basin had a notable increase in spring centric diatoms (largely Aulacoseira), while the whole of Lake Erie shows a summer increase in cyanobacteria, complementing that found in coastal regions. The composition of Lake Ontario's species assemblage shifted, but little overall change in algal abundance was observed with the exception of higher summer densities of cyanophytes. Additional mechanisms for shifts in the pelagic primary producers are described or hypothesized in the context of concurrent shifts in water quality and invertebrate populations. Tracking these trends and explaining driving factors will be critical to the management of lake conditions. (C) 2014 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	SERGEANT, DE; HOEK, W				SERGEANT, DE; HOEK, W			AN UPDATE OF THE STATUS OF WHITE WHALES DELPHINAPTERUS-LEUCAS IN THE SAINT-LAWRENCE ESTUARY, CANADA	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												The population of white whales Delphinapterus leucas Pallas in the Saint Lawrence estuary declined rapidly between the 1930s and the 1970s, probably due successively to commercial hunting followed by sport hunting; pollutant chemicals, the most likely candidates being polychlorinated biphenyls or their impurities such as dioxins, may have prevented subsequent increases. A population, apparently stable between 1973 and 1985 at about 500 animals, inhabits a historically reduced range in spring, summer and autumn of about 100 linear km (2000 km2). (In winter the range extends seaward.) Estimated gross reproductive rate is about 0.055 per annum, or less than half that estimated for white whales in the Arctic, giving an annual production of about 27 animals, and there is probably negligible immigration from outside the Saint Lawrence. There are on average about 12 carcasses found each year during the ice-free period, or about 16 calculated per annum, and a few animals lost by a one-way emigration southward, suggesting that about one-third of deaths are not reported. The population has been legally protected from hunting since 1979. All islands in the middle Saint Lawrence estuary had become sanctuaries by 1986, giving coastal habitat protection and slowing down increase of boat traffic in the area inhabited by white whale mothers and calves. While only experimental work can elucidate the precise pollutants, reduction of input of all organochlorines to the Great Lakes-Saint Lawrence system seems essential if the population''s reproductive rate is to recover.																			0006-3207	1873-2917					1988	45	4					287	302		10.1016/0006-3207(88)90060-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0006-3207(88)90060-2													WOS:A1988P839500005

In order to explore the mechanism of how Microcystis forms colonies, the zeta potentials of Microcystis cells from the laboratory and the field were studied, and the hydrophobicity of Microcystis colonies in different sizes was investigated in Lake Taihu. The incubation experiment indicated that the zeta potentials of Microcystis cells were affected by growth phase and species. The absolute values in exponential phase were lower than those in stationary phase, suggesting that the cells with rapid growth easily formed colonies due to more instability on the cell surface. The values of Microcystis aeruginosa were higher than those of Microcystis flos-aquae, which confirmed that M. aeruginosa prevailed in waters for a longer time and at a larger size compared with M. flos-aquae. In another aspect, the absolute zeta potentials of Microcystis spp. at pH 7.0 decreased from spring to autumn in the field; the values in spring were higher than those in summer, suggesting that a large-sized Microcystis colony would more easily form in summer. Additionally, differences in hydrophobicity exist among Microcystis colonies of various sizes. The surface hydrophobicity of colonies in the <20 mu m size class was higher than that of larger colonies. This characteristic allowed small colonies to easily form large colonies to survive better. These results would be helpful to understand the mechanism of the bloom formation, especially the colony formation, in Microcystis.

Reduced tuber banks of fennel pondweed due to summer grazing by waterfowl	AQUATIC BOTANY												In this study we investigated the effect of summer bird herbivory on the belowground tuber formation of fennel pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus L). Cumulative grazing pressure of four waterfowl species (mute swans, mallards, gadwalls and coots) in the summer was calculated based on timing of grazing and body mass of the grazers. The resulting grazing pressures were significantly negatively correlated with mean autumn tuber biomass in three of the four years of study. Moreover, summer grazing pressures explained more of the variance in tuber densities than water depth, sediment particle size distribution or any interactions of these variables did in the same three years. We propose that herbivory early in the summer has the most substantial impact on the clonal reproduction of macrophytes. Herbivores with a large body mass and early congregation for moulting may be the key waterfowl species in diminishing propagule biomass. Hence, they may present pre-emptive, time-staggered competition to consumers of the belowground biomass in autumn, such as migratory swans and diving ducks. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The longest amplitude appeared in summer, the shortest was in winter. the values of water vapor fluxes in the daytime were also increased from January to June. The water vapor flux in the cloudy days also showed the above characters, but it was less obvious than in sunny days. The daily variations of vapor fluxes showed mussy and daily mean values apparently reduced in rainy days. After the rain was over, water vapor fluxes at the next day also recovered the normal single peak law. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that the daily variations of alpine wetland ecosystem water vapor fluxes were mainly influenced by air temperature(Ta), total solar radiation (SR), soil temperature (Ts) and soil volume content in 0 similar to 5 cm depth (SWC) in sunny days. In the cloudy days, the main effect factors were VPD, Ts, RH, SR and SWC. In rainy days, they were SR, RH, SWC and VPD. In the next days after the rain, they were SR, VPD, RH, Ta and SWC.

Documenting how behaviors vary at fringes in comparison to core habitats is key to understanding the impact of environmental variation and the evolution of local adaptations. Here, we studied the behavior of Wels catfish (Silurus glanis) in Lake M & ouml;ckeln, Sweden, which represent a European northern fringe population. Adult individuals (101-195 cm, N = 55) were caught and externally marked with data storage tags (DSTs). Fifteen DSTs were recovered a year after tagging, of which 11 tags contained long-term high-resolution behavioral data on the use of vertical (depth) and thermal habitats. This showed that the catfish already became active in late winter (<5 degrees C) and displayed nocturnal activity primarily during summer and late autumn. The latter included a transition from the bottom to the surface layer at dusk, continuous and high activity close to the surface during the night, and then descent back to deeper water at dawn. During the daytime, the catfish were mainly inactive in the bottom layer. These behaviors contrast with what is documented in conspecifics from the core distribution area, perhaps reflecting adaptive strategies to cope with lower temperatures and shorter summers.

Moreover, there is a scarcity of data regarding the occurrence of herbicide residues in lakes predominantly surrounded by non-agricultural land. This study aimed to monitor and assess seasonal variations in four commonly used herbicides (i.e., acetochlor, pretilachlor, butachlor, and atrazine) in the surface waters of the Hulun Lake Basin in China. The results indicated that the target herbicides were widely distributed throughout the study area. The residues of the four herbicides in surface water ranged from non-detectable levels to 1,978.60 ng L- 1. Among the herbicides, atrazine had the highest detection rate (90.48 %). When considering the temporal factor, the median concentration of the selected herbicides in the lake was significantly higher during summer (102.68 ng L- 1) than that during spring (97.59 ng L- 1) and autumn (6.78 ng L- 1). Furthermore, there were spatial variations in the surface waters of the Hulun Lake Basin. The residual levels in the lake exceeded those found in the inlet river, and the concentrations of herbicides in the estuary of the Kerulen River and central area of Hulun Lake were higher. The environmental risk assessment results indicated that the selected herbicides posed acceptable risks to fish in the aquatic environment of Hulun Lake. However, the risk quotient (RQ) values for acetochlor and atrazine in relation to algae exceeded 0.10. Similarly, the RQ values for butachlor in relation to algae and crustaceans exceeded 0.10 during the summer and autumn seasons and even surpassed 1.00 in certain samples. This can potentially endanger the survival of aquatic organisms. The findings of this study offer valuable insights to support efforts in pollution control, environmental safety assessments, and decision-making regarding water resource management in the Hulun Lake Basin.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				JUN	2024	163								112099	10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.112099	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.112099		MAY 2024											WOS:001289758300001

Complementary population dynamics of exotic and native Daphnia in North American reservoir communities	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												During its invasion of North America, the exotic Daphnia lumholtzi has rapidly colonized numerous reservoirs, natural lakes, and large rivers. In the current study, we examine the overlap between D. lumholtzi and native Daphnia species through analysis of two data sets: co-occurrence in reservoirs of the south-central United States and population dynamics in one reservoir. In 171 reservoirs and oxbow lakes, D. lumholtzi was among the most prevalent species and its distribution was independent of other Daphnia species. Over a 28-month period in Stockton Lake, Missouri, D. lumholtzi was abundant only in late summer, a period when the epilimnion was warm (25-30 degrees C) and cyanobacteria were common. Native Daphnia (D. mendotae, D. parvula, and D. retrocurva) complemented this pattern, being generally rare in summer and most abundant during winter and spring. Peak densities and average fecundities of native Daphnia during the cooler months were typically greater than densities and fecundities of D. lumholtzi in summer. The complementary population dynamics between native and exotic species may be significant for the food webs in warm reservoirs, with D. lumholtzi providing another food resource when the abundance of large zooplankton is ordinarily low.

Seasonality in lake pelagic δ15N values:: patterns, possible explanations, and implications for food web baselines	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												We studied the seasonal delta N-15 patterns in particulate organic matter (POM < 48 mu m) and crustacean zooplankton collectect from a moderately eutrophic lake. Time series of POM and zooplankton showed consistent differences in delta N-15 Values between POM and different zooplankton taxa, but simular trends of steadily increasing delta N-15 values through summer with peak values in autumn. The observed annual range in delta(15) N was over 25 parts per thousand in POM and almost 17 parts per thousand in cladocera. We relate these marked seasonal changes in delta N-15 values to temporal variation in inorganic nitrogen source for pelagic primary production. Ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-) showed distinct delta N-15 values, ammonium being considerably N-15-enriched (delta N-15 values similar to 20-30 parts per thousand) compared to nitrate (< 10 parts per thousand). The peak delta N-15 values in POM and zooplankton call hence be explained by I shift front nitrate uptake to ammonium uptake by phytoplankton, as ammonium concentrations in the Jyvasjarvi epilimnion increase after lake turnover in autumn.. However, such elevated delta N-15 Values were not observed during the high NH4+ concentrations after spring lake turnover, suggesting that the phytoplankton spring bloom was primarily Supported by nitrate. These apparent seasonal differences in nitrogen utilisation reflect variation in species composition of the phytoplankton community. We conclude that seasonal changes in nitrogen Source for phytoplankton can produce considerable differences in their delta N-15 values, which are transmitted up the food chain to crustacean zooplankton. This has important implications for many food web studies using nitrogen stable isotopes, especially when delta N-15 values have to be assigned to a trophic baseline.					; Jones, Roger/C-7703-2011	Tiirola, Marja/0000-0001-5589-3748; Jones, Roger/0000-0002-0835-8264													1863-9135						2008	172	3					255	262		10.1127/1863-9135/2008/0172-0255	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1863-9135/2008/0172-0255													WOS:000259370000007
J	Hines, NA; Brezonik, PL; Engstrom, DR				Hines, NA; Brezonik, PL; Engstrom, DR			Sediment and porewater profiles and fluxes of mercury and methylmercury in a small seepage lake in northern Minnesota	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Mercury (Hg-T) and methylmercury (MeHg) were measured at 1-2 cm resolution in sediment porewater and sediment cores from Spring Lake in the Marcell Experimental Forest of northern Minnesota. Recent sediment accumulation of Hg-T was 21.4 mug m(-2) yr(-1) (1990-2000), 2 orders of magnitude greater than the accumulation of MeHg (0.20 mug m(-2) yr(-1)). The highest solid phase concentrations of MeHg were observed persistently at the sediment surface and declined sharply with depth. Porewater profiles showed a small diffusive flux of MeHg from sediment to water (5 ng m(-2) month(-1)). Springtime porewater concentrations of MeHg were relatively low (similar to0.5 ng L-1) and increased by late summer to early fall (1.5-2.2 ng L-1), showing distinct peaks roughly correlated with maxima in sulfate reducing activity at 5 and 15 cm. Advective transport carrying MeHg deeper into the sediment was evident in summer and fall. The percent of HgT present as MeHg was highest in the water column above the sediment (10%) and decreased with sediment depth in both the solid and porewater phases. Sediments at this study site are a net sink for MeHg, although diagenetic processes of demethylation and methylation are evident within the lake-sediment environment.					; Brezonik, Patrick/ISV-2988-2023	Engstrom, Daniel/0000-0002-8066-029X; 													0013-936X					DEC 15	2004	38	24					6610	6617		10.1021/es0496672	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es0496672								15669319					WOS:000225761800028

COMMUNITY-LEVEL RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE: SHIFTS IN ANURAN CALLING PHENOLOGY	HERPETOLOGICAL CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY												We explored how climate change affects reproductive phenology in a community of amphibians. We examined temporal trends in spring and summer temperatures in the Lake Simcoe watershed, Ontario, Canada. As we were interested in quantifying how temperature was related to amphibian reproductive behavior, we explored relationships between spring and summer temperatures and peak calling date for seven common amphibian species in the watershed. Spring temperatures increased over the course of the 14 year study. We detected interspecific variation in peak calling trends during the period 1995 to 2008 in response to spring temperatures, demonstrating a link between increasing temperatures and advancing phenology of spring breeding amphibians. Early spring-breeding anurans such as Wood Frog (Lithobates sylvaticus), Spring Peeper (Pseudacris crucifer), and Northern Leopard Frog (L. pipiens) called earlier in the season over time, as temperature increased, whereas later breeding anurans such as Green Frog (L. clamitans) showed no change in peak calling date. We combined our empirical results with a Coupled Global Climate Model, which showed that under assumptions of the A2 scenario we could see an advance in peak calling of nearly 11 days by the year 2100 and a 30% increase in the breadth of the breeding season in this community of anurans. Our results illustrate the asymmetric impacts of climate change among species and suggest how these impacts may affect reproductive processes within a community.

The implementation of urban blue and green infrastructures can help regulate urban temperatures. However, quantitative estimations of the combined effects of urban blue infrastructures and neighbouring green spaces on air temperature (T) and humidity (RH) are still unclear. In this study, the effect of the spatiotemporal pattern of urban lakes and neighbouring green spaces on daytime T and RH within a 500 m radius, and their seasonal variations, were investigated using a land-use regression (LUR) approach. LUR models containing ten lakes and adjacent green spaces (LG) were successfully developed to calculate annual and seasonal air T and RH averages. Correlation analysis revealed that locations with large lakes that are more complex in shape, supported by large neighbouring green spaces characterised by greater aggregation and lower patch density, affect daytime T-RH most in all seasons. The significantly positive effect of lakes and neighbouring greenery on air T-RH extended up to 300 m in spring, summer and autumn, and up to 200 m in winter. Moreover, the effects of the extent, intensity and efficiency of lakes and greenery on air T-RH could be influenced by season and time intervals. The effect intensity in T of 0.3-1.0 degrees C occurred within a radius of 200-300 m with an effi-ciency of 1.5-3.3 degrees C/km between seasons, and the effect intensity in RH of 1.4-4.0% occurred within a radius of 200-300 m with an efficiency of 6.0-13.3%/km between seasons.					; Li, Tingting/ABB-7219-2021; An, Wenyu/HNJ-1708-2023; Zhang, Bingjie/H-4902-2018	zhu, chunyang/0000-0001-7896-7498; Liu, Han/0000-0003-4670-6677; Zhang, Bingjie/0000-0003-0704-7891; 													2210-6707	2210-6715				APR	2023	91								104438	10.1016/j.scs.2023.104438	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2023.104438		FEB 2023											WOS:000965047100001

Results demonstrate that moisture sources from diverse air masses with different isotopic signals are the main parameter in controlling the precipitation's isotope characteristics. The air mass from polar continental (Pc) region contributes the precipitation with high deuterium excess values (up to 23%.) and relatively enriched isotope compositions (e.g., -3.2 parts per thousand for delta O-18) during the winter with prevailing northeasterly monsoon. By contrast, air masses from equatorial maritime (Em) and tropical maritime (Tm) supply the precipitation with low deuterium excess values (as low as about 7 parts per thousand) and more depleted isotope values (e.g., -8.9 parts per thousand and -6.0 parts per thousand for delta O-18 of Tm and Em, respectively) during the summer with prevailing southwesterly monsoon. Thus seasonal differences in terms of delta O-18, delta D, and deuterium excess values are primarily influenced by the interactions among various precipitation sources. While these various air masses travel through Taiwan, secondary evaporation effects further modify the isotope characteristics of the inland precipitation, such as raindrop evaporation (reduces the deuterium excess of winter precipitation) and Moisture recycling (increases the deuterium excess of summer precipitation). The semi-quantitative estimations in terms of evaluation for changes in the deuterium excess suggest that the raindrop evaporation fractions for winter precipitation range 7% to 15% and the proportions of recycling moisture in summer precipitation are less than 5%. Additionally, the isotopic altitude gradient in terms of delta O-18 for summer precipitation is -0.22 parts per thousand/100 m, greater than -0.17 parts per thousand/100 m of winter precipitation. The greater isotopic gradient in summer can be attributed to a higher temperature vs. altitude gradient relative to winter. The observed spatial and seasonal stable isotopic characteristics in Taiwan's precipitation not only contribute valuable information for regional monsoon research crossing the continent-ocean interface of East Asia, but also can serve as very useful database for local water resources management.

Phytoplankton dynamics in the Salton Sea, California, 1997-1999	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												The dynamics of phytoplankton populations in the Salton Sea were studied over the 3-year period 1997-1999. Dinoflagellates were important components, often contributing over 80% of the total biovolume of cells larger than 5 mu m. Gyrodinium uncatenum along with a similar, but rarer species Gyrodinium instriatum, was the most dominant taxon, present year-round, and became especially abundant in spring and summer. Diversity of dinoflagellates was high with three or four species often co-occurring with similar densities. The largest dinoflagellate, Gonyaulax grindleyi (= Protoceratium reticulatum), increased greatly in abundance during 1997-1999. Diatoms co-dominated year round with the colonial araphid Thalassionema sp. also becoming especially abundant in 1999. During the winter mixing period, diatom populations often were dominated by pennate species usually considered benthic, such as Pleurosigma ambrosianum, Ceratoneis closterium and Tryblionella punctata. Cryptomonads, represented by several species, were usually numerous and, although relatively small, constituted as much as 20-30% of total phytoplankton biovolume. A raphidophyte, Chattonella marina, reported to be ichthyotoxic in other locales, was abundant in summer, comprising about a third of total phytoplankton biovolume then and reaching mid-lake densities of nearly 1,500 cells ml(-1). Two colonial non-motile green algae were usually present; one of these, Crucigenia rectangularis, increased greatly in density in 1999. A euglenoid, Eutreptia lanowii, was highest in density in summer when it contributed about 5-10% of total biovolume at times after other species were reduced by sulfide events. Filamentous planktonic cyanobacteria were very rare. The increase in large species of phytoplankton over the three-year period coincided with a dramatic decrease in abundance of a planktivorous fish, the Mozambique mouthbrooder (Oreochromis mossambicus x O. urolepis honorum), which likely was responsible for these changes in phytoplankton composition. Phytoplankton biovolume densities and chlorophyll a concentrations each year were highest, 6-16 mm(3) l(-1) and 30-40 mu g l(-1) respectively, in the spring. In summer and early fall, occasional windstorms mixed the water column causing sulfide-laden bottom waters to upwell and strip surface waters of oxygen. Sharp drops in abundance of most phytoplankton species occurred during these events presumably due to poisoning by hydrogen sulfide. Satellite images confirm the presence of large patches of high albedo surface waters at these times, lasting days to over a week, produced by backscattering from abundant crystals of gypsum produced following oxidation of hydrogen sulfide to sulfate.

J	Budinoff, CR; Hollibaugh, JT				Budinoff, Charles R.; Hollibaugh, James T.			Ecophysiology of a mono lake picocyanobacterium	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We isolated an unusual picocyanobacterium (strain MLCB) from alkaline, hypersaline Mono Lake, California. The organism blooms (similar to 5.0 x 10(7) cells L-1) in late summer. It has very low population densities in the photic zone through spring and summer (< 10(5) cells L-1) but maintains a significant population (10(7)-10(8) cells L-1) in anoxic, sulfidic waters below 25 m year-round during meromictic periods. Complete turnover of the lake resulted in a significant (> 90%) loss of the deep-water population that could not be attributed to simple dilution. The deep-water population returned to its previous concentration by the following autumn. The organism is phycoerythrin rich, does not contain phycourobilin, and is not capable of complementary chromatic adaptation. Phylogenetically, our isolate groups with marine Synechococcus, Prochlorococcus, and Cyanobium genera. Salinity tolerance of our strain was compared to select members of the Cyanobium and showed that strain MLCB was the most halotolerant, capable of growing at 10% salinity, compared to limits of 0-6% for the other strains tested.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2007	52	6					2484	2495		10.4319/lo.2007.52.6.2484	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2007.52.6.2484													WOS:000251129700015
J	Golfinopoulos, SK				Golfinopoulos, SK			The occurrence of trihalomethanes in the drinking water in Greece	CHEMOSPHERE												This paper summarizes and completes an investigation into the occurrence of trihalomethanes (THMs) in public water supplies in Greece. The investigation was conducted in three cities of Greece, Athens, Mytilene and Chalkida, from 1993 to 1998. Samples were collected from three treatment plants of Athens (Galatsi Treatment Plant - GTP, Menidi Treatment Plant - MTP, Kiourka Treatment Plant - KTP) and from the distribution systems of Athens, Mytilene and Chalkida. The sources for these systems are lakes, boreholes and wells. The concentrations of THMs ranged from 5 to 106 mu g/l, from 4 to 27 mu g/l and from 5 to 96 mu g/l, in the distribution systems of Athens, Mytilene, Chalkida, respectively. The wide ranges of concentrations in three cities should be attributed to the organics concentration of raw water. In ail the cases the THMs concentrations were higher during the summer and fall than in spring and winter. In GTP and in the distribution system receives water by GTP, from April 1993 to January 1995, Mytilene and Chalkida, brominated THMs dominated and existed at the highest concentration levels, whereas chloroform was the least prevalent compound, while in all the other cases the opposite was observed. In all samples the concentrations were lower than the maximum level of 100 mu g/l for total trihalomethanes (TTHMs) set by European Community (EC). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Also, the relationship between total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) content, a measure of propagule vigor, and propagule success was detailed. Colonization success in terms of growth and mortality was best during late summer in shallow water on rich organic sediments. Light availability, temperature and sediment nutrient levels were high during this period. The poorest colonization conditions occurred during early autumn. During this period mortality was highest in deep water in calcareous nutrient poor sediments. Also, naturally produced vegetative fragments grew better than artificially abscised meristems and had higher TNC concentrations. Low TNC levels increased mortality, but they had no effect on subsequent growth, suggesting that naturally produced fragments are more likely to survive the winter than artificial fragments.																			0304-3770	1879-1522					1982	14	3					295	307		10.1016/0304-3770(82)90104-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(82)90104-8													WOS:A1982PN97200005

Sensitivity of physical lake processes to climate change within a large Precambrian Shield catchment	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Potential future changes in lake physical processes (e.g. stratification and freezing) can be assessed through exploring their sensitivity to climate change, and assessing the current vulnerability of different lake types to plausible changes in meteorological drivers. This study quantifies the impacts of climate change and sensitivity of lake physical processes within a large (5100km(2)) Precambrian Shield catchment in south-central Ontario. Historic regional relationships are established between climate drivers, lake morphology, and lake physical changes through generalized linear modelling (GLM), and are used to quantify likely changes in timing of ice phenology and lake stratification across 72 lakes under a range of future climate models and scenarios. In response to projections of increased temperature (ensemble mean of +3.3 degrees C), both earlier ice-off and onset of summer stratification were projected, with later ice-on and fall turnover compared to the baseline. Process sensitivity to climate change varied by lake type; shallower lakes with a smaller volume (less than 15m deep and less than 0.05km(3)) were more sensitive to processes associated with lake heating (stratification onset and ice-off), and deeper lakes with a larger surface area (greater than 30m deep and greater than 1000ha) were more sensitive to processes associated with lake cooling (fall turnover and ice-on). These results indicate that whereas small lakes are vulnerable to climate warming because of changes that occur in spring and summer, larger lakes are particularly sensitive during the fall. The findings suggest that lake morphology and associated sensitivity should be considered in the development of sustainable lake management strategies. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Their growth was studied based on specimens collected by fisheries during the period from June 1992 to February 1998. The growth parameters of von Bertalanffy, Gompertz, and Logistic models and their modified models in which the growth rate changes with one or two cycles per year were calculated by the non-linear weighted least squares method. On the basis of the AIC (Akaike's Information Criterion) values, the modified models in which the growth rate changes with two cycles per year were selected as the best-fitting models for both forms. These formulae represent biological characteristics of the pond smelt in Lake Kasumigaura, i.e. the growth is superior in spring and autumn but inferior in summer and winter. The growth patterns of both forms were similar, but the large form showed a more superior growth rate than the small form from June to July. As for the relationship between the growth and water temperature, until the middle of September the growth was inferior as the cumulative water temperature increased, after which the small form grew to about 82 mm and the large form grew to about 108 mm without any influence from water temperature.

Groundwater is a major source of surface-water recharge and plays an important role in maintaining the integrity of ecosystems, especially within wetlands in semi-arid regions. The Ordos Desert Plateau of Inner Mongolia (China) is a vulnerable ecosystem that suffers from an extreme lack of water. The hydraulic exchange between groundwater and lake water in Dakebo Lake (the largest of hundreds of lakes on the Ordos Desert Plateau) was evaluated using multiple environmental methods. Continuous monitoring of the groundwater and lake-water levels indicated that the lake was recharged vertically by groundwater. Application of hydrodynamic and temperature tracing methods to the western side of the lake indicated that the rate of groundwater discharge to the lake was about 2 x 10(-6) to 3 x 10(-6) m/s in spring, summer, and autumn, but that there was no recharge in winter because the hypolentic zone (HZ) was frozen. Mixing ratios of groundwater and lake water in the HZ, estimated from the O-18 and H-2 ratios, showed that there were spatial variations in the hydrodynamic exchange between groundwater and lake water within the HZ.					; Du, Shanghai/K-8691-2012	Cui, Geng/0000-0001-9683-2730; 													1431-2174	1435-0157				NOV	2016	24	7					1707	1722		10.1007/s10040-016-1439-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-016-1439-2													WOS:000386340700007
J	CARL, LM				CARL, LM			SONIC TRACKING OF BURBOT IN LAKE OPEONGO, ONTARIO	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The diel movements of seven adult burbot Lota lota, 55-67 cm in total length, were seasonally monitored with sonic tags in Lake Opeongo during 1989 and 1991 to determine patterns of activity and habitat use. Burbot were inactive during daylight hours, began moving near dusk, and moved throughout each night until dawn. In the summer, burbot moved more slowly and occupied deeper water than in the spring. Swimming speed appeared to increase in the fall. Burbot occupied the same local areas within seasons and between years. Burbot were sometimes active in 20 degrees C water for extended periods at night but moved to cooler water during the day. Burbot seemed to use an area-restricted searching pattern. None of the burbot were located in water less than 2 m deep.																			0002-8487					JAN	1995	124	1					77	83		10.1577/1548-8659(1995)124<0077:STOBIL>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1995)124<0077:STOBIL>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1995RB06900007

Seasonal sampling (summer 2023 to spring 2024) across 16 stations revealed distinct seasonal and spatial dynamics governed by environmental factors with monsoon-driven freshwater inputs exerting a significant influence. Notable spatial partitioning was observed between the inner bay (IB) and outer bay (OB). The IB was dominated by euryhaline copepods (e.g., Paracalanus parvus), whereas the OB supported higher diversity of zooplanktons. The IB/OB abundance ratio exhibited significant seasonal variation, with the highest ratios observed in spring (macro-zooplankton: 1.04; meso-zooplankton: 0.25) and the lowest in winter (macro-zooplankton: 0.02; meso-zooplankton: 0.01). Seawater salinity, seawater temperature and pH were highlighted as key environmental factors influencing zooplankton distribution patterns. These findings underscore the vulnerability sensitivity of tropical estuarine ecosystems to monsoonal variability and establish an essential baseline for forecasting ecological responses to climate change.																			0272-7714	1096-0015				NOV	2025	326								109553	10.1016/j.ecss.2025.109553	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2025.109553													WOS:001592533100001

A reduction in spring mixing due to road salt runoff entering Mirror Lake (Lake Placid, NY)	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Wiltse B, Yerger EC, Laxson CL. 2019. A reduction in spring mixing due to road salt runoff entering Mirror Lake (Lake Placid, NY). Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XXX-XXX. Road salt has resulted in the salinization of surface waters across temperate North America. Increasingly, road salt is recognized as a significant regional pollutant in the Adirondack Park. Here we analyze biweekly limnological data from Mirror Lake (Lake Placid, NY) to understand the role of road salt runoff in an apparent lack of spring mixing in 2017. Water column profile data show notable spatial and temporal variability in chloride concentrations within the lake. Concentrations are highest at the lake bottom during the winter, with increases associated with the onset of road salt application to the watershed. High chloride concentrations in the hypolimnion persisted through the summer of 2017 due to a lack of complete spring mixing as the result of road salt induced density differences within the water column. Water density calculations and Schmidt stability point to an increase in water column stability due to the accumulation of salt at the lake bottom. The incomplete spring mixing resulted in greater spatial and temporal extent of anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion, reducing habitat availability for lake trout. Restoration of lake mixing would occur rapidly upon significant reduction of road salt application to the watershed and improvements in stormwater management.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				APR 2	2020	36	2					109	121		10.1080/10402381.2019.1675826	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2019.1675826		NOV 2019											WOS:000501430500001
J	SANDLUND, OT				SANDLUND, OT			THE DRIFT OF ZOOPLANKTON AND MICROZOOBENTHOS IN THE RIVER STRANDAELVA, WESTERN NORWAY	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The drift of zooplankton (rotifers, cladocerans and cyclopoid copepods) and microscopic zoobenthos (mainly bdelloid rotifers and small chironomid larvae) was investigated by filtering samples of river water. The number of drifting rotifers varied between 1000 and 6000 m-3 in the lake inlet, and between 30 and 500 m-3 in the lake outlet, without any seasonal trend. The number of drifting insect larvae was approximately equal in the lake inlet and outlet, with a maximum in summer (250-300 m-3) and minimum in winter (.apprx. 10 m-3). Increasing water flow resulted in an increasing number of drifting zoobenthos. Downstrean from the lake, the number of drifting benthic rotifers was increasing from .apprx. 300 m-3 in the outlet to 6500 m-3 3.4 km downstream, while the number of insect larvae was .apprx. 100 m-3 in the outlet and leveled off at .apprx. 300 m-3 after 200 m. The number of drifting zooplankton in the lake outlet varied between 20 and 2000 m-3 for crustaceans, and between 300 and 20,000 m-3 for rotifers, both with a maximum in late summer/autumn and a minimum in winter. The number of drifting zooplankton decreased by some 45% in the first 200 m from the lake outlet, but some zooplankton was still found in the drift 3.4 km downstream. The largest species was removed first from the drift. The diurnal variation in the number of drifting zooplankton in lake outlets appear to be related to be vertical migration in the lake, i.e., the largest number drifting when most animals are in the upper water layers.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1982	94	1					33	48		10.1007/BF00008632	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008632													WOS:A1982PK31200004

(Tony)			Waterbirds at the Theewaterskloof Dam, Western Cape, South Africa, 1993-2005	OSTRICH												With a perimeter of 82km, the Theewaterskloof Dam is the largest dam in the Western Cape. This paper, based on midsummer and mid-winter surveys between 1993 and 2005, assesses the importance of the dam for waterbirds. The median numbers of waterbirds in summer and winter were 3 086 and 1 321, respectively. Fifty-eight species were recorded, 35 of them on at least half of the summer or winter surveys. The proportion of Egyptian Geese Alopochen aegyptiaca in summer increased from 47% in the first four years to 88% in the final four years, and reached 94% in summer 2005. Numbers of most colonially-nesting waterbirds decreased over the period assessed; this is attributed to the ongoing decay of trees that were left standing when the dam was constructed. In 2005, 25 years after completion, Theewaterskloof Dam is considered not to have reached the 'mature lake' phase, because species composition patterns remain unstable. Despite its size, the dam is of minor conservation importance to waterbirds in the Western Cape.					; Harebottle, Doug/HJI-6193-2023	Underhill, Les/0000-0002-8758-1527; Harebottle, Douglas/0000-0001-5551-1623													0030-6525	1727-947X				NOV	2006	77	3-4					170	174		10.2989/00306520609485529	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/00306520609485529													WOS:000243211100010

Combining biological proxies, element composition and stable isotope ratios of two lakeshore sequences at excavation site 13 II, we demonstrate repeated variations in climate, hydrology and catchment vegetation cover. New ostracod-based quantitative mean summer and winter air temperature reconstructions with the Mutual Ostracod Temperature Range (MOTR) method provide the first detailed information about the temperature evolution. The interglacial temperature maximum, probably corresponding to Marine Isotope Stage 9e, is followed by a first dry phase and, during the younger part of the Reinsdorf sequence, by a second dry period. Both were marked by lower precipitation/evaporation ratios, reduced vegetation cover in the catchment and increased surface inflows from springs. Temperature reconstructions of these two steppe (open woodland) phases yield very narrow ranges for mean January (-4-0 degrees C) and July (+17-19 or +17-21 degrees C) air temperatures, demonstrating that, while summers were similar to those of today, winters were at least 1 degrees C colder, hinting at a more pronounced continental climate. Precise temperature estimates for the interjacent woodland and steppe (woodland) phase are hindered by generally wider ranges produced by the MOTR method (January mean -4-3 degrees C, July mean +15-21 degrees C). The development of a more extensive vegetation cover, reducing surface runoff and erosion in favour of increased river and groundwater discharge, as indicated by a shift in microfossil and stable isotope records, suggests generally more humid climates with higher precipitation/evaporation ratios as well as reduced seasonal temperature variations. Biological proxy analyses, element composition, and stable isotope ratios at the Lower Palaeolithic locality of Sch & ouml;ningen provide evidence for repeated variations in climate, hydrology and catchment vegetation cover during MIS 9. Quantitative temperature reconstructions with the Mutual Ostracod Temperature Range method show colder winter temperatures during the steppe (open woodland) phases succeeding the interglacial maximum, while summers were similar to those of today. image					Koutsodendris, Andreas/G-8966-2013	Koutsodendris, Andreas/0000-0003-4236-7508; Krahn, Kim/0000-0002-1646-7612													0300-9483	1502-3885				OCT	2024	53	4			SI		504	524		10.1111/bor.12670	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bor.12670		JUL 2024											WOS:001265375300001

Information-theory diversity, evenness and richness were significantly higher in deep assemblages than in shallow assemblages, with the boundary falling between 5 ands 10 m in winter and fall, 10 and 20 m in spring and 20 and 31 m in summer. Planktonic taxa are abundant on benthic substrates in the deep zone, primarily as dead fallout. In shallow water, large numbers of living planktonic taxa overwinter beneath the ice on benthic substrates. Cluster analysis of samples was used to identify and define diatom assemblages from deep, mid-depth and shallow water. The deep-water assemblage contains motile and nonmoitle benthic species that have been reported from alpine and boreal oligotrophic lakes. The mid-depth assemblage is rich in epipsammic taxa. The shallow-water assemblages contain cosmopolitan taxa that are collected often in nearshore plankton samples. These shallow assemblages do not persist throughout the year as do the deep and mid-depth assemblages. Cluster analysis of taxa provides further definition of species associations and the degree of correlation among species. Correlations among benthic taxa are strengthened when planktonic taxa are removed from the analysis, indicating that plankton fallout represents an addition of information which is poorly related to distribution of the benthic species. The most stable and diverse community is found at the deepest sampling depths where environmental conditions are most stable, the mid-depth community exists in fluctuating but predictable conditions, and the shallow assemblages occur in the zone of maximum physical fluctuation or natural stress. Substrate types are correlated with the species assemblages, but the high diversity of substrate types in shallow water does not support the most diverse assemblage. The discrete species assemblages seen in an oligotrophic area of this large dimictic lake apparently respond sensitively to temporally and spatially dynamic environmental parameters.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1983	64	6					1566	1580		10.2307/1937511	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1937511													WOS:A1983RU21500024

Variability in Ice Cover Does Not Affect Annual Metabolism Estimates in a Small Eutrophic Reservoir	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Temperate reservoirs and lakes worldwide are experiencing decreases in ice cover, which will likely alter the net balance of gross primary production (GPP) and respiration (R) in these ecosystems. However, most metabolism studies to date have focused on summer dynamics, thereby excluding winter dynamics from annual metabolism budgets. To address this gap, we analyzed 6 years of year-round high-frequency dissolved oxygen data to estimate daily rates of net ecosystem production (NEP), GPP, and R in a eutrophic, dimictic reservoir that has intermittent ice cover. Over 6 years, the reservoir exhibited slight heterotrophy during both summer and winter. We found winter and summer metabolism rates to be similar: summer NEP had a median rate of -0.06 mg O2 L-1 day-1 (range: -15.86 to 3.20 mg O2 L-1 day-1), while median winter NEP was -0.02 mg O2 L-1 day-1 (range: -8.19 to 0.53 mg O2 L-1 day-1). Despite large differences in the duration of ice cover among years, there were minimal differences in NEP among winters. Overall, the inclusion of winter data had a limited effect on annual metabolism estimates in a eutrophic reservoir, likely due to short winter periods in this reservoir (ice durations 0-35 days), relative to higher-latitude lakes. Our work reveals a smaller difference between winter and summer NEP than in lakes with continuous ice cover. Ultimately, our work underscores the importance of studying full-year metabolism dynamics in a range of aquatic ecosystems to help anticipate the effects of declining ice cover across lakes worldwide. Lakes and reservoirs around the world are experiencing decreases in ice cover duration, with many waterbodies starting to experience non-continuous ice cover throughout the winter. These changes in ice duration have the potential to influence carbon cycling, but to date few long-term studies have included winter data. We analyzed 6 years of minute-resolution oxygen data from a small reservoir that experiences non-continuous ice cover to estimate whether the surface water was a source or sink of carbon at daily, seasonal, and annual scales. We found that the reservoir was often a source of carbon to the atmosphere, regardless of whether data from winter were included. Our results differed from previous studies conducted in higher-latitude lakes that experience continuous ice cover throughout the winter, potentially due to the already-short duration of ice cover in this reservoir. As the duration of ice cover continues to decrease across lakes and reservoirs worldwide, our work highlights the need for studying how changing winter conditions-especially non-continuous ice cover-affects year-round carbon cycling. Winter data have rarely been included in lake metabolism studies, limiting our understanding of how ice affects metabolism estimates Annual metabolism estimates were similar across 6 years with widely varying ice cover Water chemistry explained variability in daily gross primary production, but not respiration or net ecosystem production, over 6 years					Lewis, Abby/GLT-1176-2022; Carey, Cayelan/D-4874-2016; Olsson, Freya/MGV-1025-2025	Lewis, Abigail/0000-0001-9933-4542; Olsson, Freya/0000-0002-0483-4489; Richardson, David/0000-0001-9374-9624; Howard, Dexter/0000-0002-6118-2149													2169-8953	2169-8961				JUL	2024	129	7							e2024JG008057	10.1029/2024JG008057	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024JG008057													WOS:001269188100001

The present study examined environmental variables and used the Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) model to determine the most preferred seasonal habitat and optimal environmental range of Caspian shad (Alosa spp). The fish preferred deep waters with low levels of total organic matter and sea level anomaly in winter and productive areas with a high concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chla) and relatively high benthos biomass in spring. The number per unit area (NPUA)-based HSI model determined that the geometric mean model (GMM) was the optimal model for defining a suitable habitat in winter. For spring, the arithmetic mean model (or GMM) in the NPUA-based HSI model most accurately predicted preferred habitat for Caspian shad. The average NPUA in both seasons increased with the HSI; areas with an HSI of between 0.4 and 0.6 in spring and between 0.6 and 0.8 in winter had a high percentage of total catch. Areas with an HSI of more than 0.5 had over 91% and 63% of the total catch in spring and winter, respectively, demonstrating the reliability of the NPUA-based HSI model in predicting Caspian shad habitat. The present study shows that remotely sensed data plus depth are the most critical environmental variables in Caspian shad habitats and that Chla and SLA are the most critical remotely sensed parameters for near real-time prediction of Caspian shad habitat.

The summer and winter samples were analyzed using gas chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry for Dechlorane Plus (DP). Decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) was also analyzed for the samples from Kanazawa and Beijing. DP was detected in all samples. The mean total DP (I DP) pound concentration was highest (6.7 pg/m(3)) and lowest (0.87 pg/m(3)) in the winter samples from Sagamihara and Busan, respectively. The seasonal variation of DP concentrations varied by sampling site in this study. BDE-209 was detected in all the analyzed samples except for one of the Kanazawa winter samples. BDE-209 concentration was considerably higher in Beijing than in Kanazawa. Significant correlations were found between the concentrations of I DP pound and BDE-209 in the winter samples from Kanazawa and in both summer and winter samples from Beijing. This similarity in the atmospheric behavior of DP and BDE-209, especially in winter, is assumed to reflect a common end usage and release mechanism.					; TORIBA, Akira/D-8415-2015; Kakimoto, Kensaku/E-1561-2015; Toriba, Akira/D-8415-2015	Akutsu, Kazuhiko/0000-0001-7576-3182; Kakimoto, Kensaku/0000-0002-0592-3280; Toriba, Akira/0000-0002-6411-4088													0944-1344	1614-7499				OCT	2015	22	19					14600	14605		10.1007/s11356-014-2861-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-2861-4								24737022					WOS:000362329300022

Bivalves take up nutrients in the form of phytoplankton and detritus. Winter-migrating diving ducks feed on these bivalves during the cold season. In Lake Nakaumi, diving ducks chiefly consumed the biofouling mussel Musculista senhousia. The biomass of M. senhousia decreased markedly at most sampling points during duck wintering, averaging 1126 g m(-2) (wet weight) at 42 sampling points in November 1996 and 24 g m(-2) in March 1997. The amount of nitrogen in M. senhousia eaten by ducks during winter was estimated at 52 t and phosphorus at 3.8 t. In the absence of ducks, M. senhousia death in summer would add equivalent nitrogen and phosphorus loads to the lagoon. The decomposition of M. senhousia in summer when water mixing is weak would also accelerate oxygen depletion at the lagoon bottom. Mussel predation by wintering ducks would therefore decrease unfavorable effects of biofouling mussel decomposition in summer when nuisance phytoplankton blooms and anoxia occur easily.

OCP concentrations ranged from 69.95 to 223.08 ng L-1 in winter and from 80.95 to 376.03 ng L-1 in summer, while PAHs ranged from 45.40 to 232.74 ng L-1 in winter and 49.53 to 197.72 ng L-1 in summer. Such physicochemical and biological parameters as the larger amounts of pollutants taken up by phytoplankton, the increased atmospheric wet deposition, the discharge of wastewater, and the resuspension of polluted sediments in summer time were responsible for the higher residues of both OCPs and PAHs than in winter. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) between phytoplankton biomass and micropollutants indicated high affinity of OCPs to Bacillariophyta and Cryptophyta and PAHs to Cyanophyta and Chlorophyta, documenting the ecological effects of phytoplankton on the biogeochemical processes of OCPs and PAHs and thus should be further investigated especially in hyper-eutrophic lakes.

This work investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of DOM in Shengzhong Lake in southwest China and the formed DBPs during the chlorine disinfection process. The results showed that lake water in summer had significantly higher dissolved oxygen and dissolved organic carbon than that in winter. In contrast, DOM in winter demonstrated an obviously higher aromaticity and molecular weight than that in summer. Four fluorescence components, i.e., terrestrial humic-like substances (C1), protein-like substances (C2), and microbial humic-like substances (C3 and C4), were identified, and their relative abundance followed in the order of C3 > C4 > C2 > C1 in winter and C4 > C3 > C1 > C2 in summer. The formation potential of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids in winter was higher and lower than that in summer, which was mainly ascribed to the content of aromatic and hydrophobic substances. Compared to the significant seasonal dynamic, the spatial variation of DOM and the formed DBPs was not obvious.

J	Wiklund, AKE; Wiklund, SJ; Axelman, J; Sundelin, B				Wiklund, AKE; Wiklund, SJ; Axelman, J; Sundelin, B			Dynamics of lipids and polychlorinated biphenyls in a baltic amphipod (Monoporeia affinis):: A field study	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Processes such as accumulation and elimination, which control tissue concentration of polychlorinated biphenyls(PCBs), were examined over time in an in situ study of the amphipod Monoporeia affinis. These processes were studied with respect to individual PCB congeners, percentage lipid and composition, and body weight. A secondary objective was to examine the impact of seasonal variability in percentage lipids and lipid composition on PCB concentration in two coexisting Baltic amphipods, M. affinis and Pontoporeia femorata. Polychlorinated biphenyl concentrations tended to be higher in P. femorata than in M. affinis, possibly because of P. femorata's lower respiration rate and larger size. The net accumulation of PCBs was congener dependent and negatively correlated to lipid concentration. The relation between the net concentration change rate of 16 PCB congeners over time and log K., was not significant during the spring and summer months, a time when lipid accumulation and strong growth occur. In contrast. the net concentration change rate of the corresponding PCB congeners over time during autumn and early winter, that is. from the period before gonad maturation to the period after mating and early embryogenesis, showed a significant relation to log K-ow (r(2) = 0.62, p < 0.001, n = 16). During the latter period, amphipod lipid weight was reduced while the PCB body burden increased. Results strongly indicate that elimination rather than accumulation is the main process controlling amphipod body burden. This pattern results in a transfer of PCBs from the female to the developing embryos, which is reflected in high PCB body burden in newly released offspring.																			0730-7268					OCT	2003	22	10					2499	2507		10.1897/02-454	http://dx.doi.org/10.1897/02-454								14552016					WOS:000185639700038

Water from the spring issues along a karst conduit. During the rainstorms in summer, it was found that the pH and temperature of Landiantang spring increased while its specific conductivity decreased. As HCO3-, Ca2+ and Mg2+ are the dominant ions, linear relationships between concentrations of those ions and specific conductivity were developed. According to the ion concentrations from the linear relationships, the saturation indexes of calcite (SIC), the saturation indexes of dolomite (SID) and CO2 partial pressure (LogP(CO2)) of the spring were calculated. Results indicated that the LogP(CO2) of the spring during the rainstorms was lower than that without rain, and its SIC and SID was also lower. Combined with the characteristics of the epikarst zone, it was inferred that the above results were caused by the dilution of rainwater, because overland flow with high pH (due to neutralization of carbonate rock dusts in the air to rainwater) and low specific conductivity traveling through the conduit rapidly during rainstorms, showed greater influences on the hydrochemical variations of the epikarst spring.

J	Joly, K				Joly, Kyle			Sea Ice Crossing by Migrating Caribou, Rangifer tarandus, in Northwestern Alaska	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												Joly, Kyle. 2012. Sea ice crossing by migrating Caribou, Rangifer tarandus, in northwestern Alaska. Canadian Field-Naturalist 126(3): 217-220. Long movements across sea ice by Caribou (Rang(er tarandus) in Alaska are relatively uncommon and are not well documented. With rapidly diminishing sea ice cover in arctic waters, these movements may cease altogether. On 26 May 2012, a Caribou crossed a long span (57 km) of sea ice off the coast of Alaska. The cow successfully crossed after traveling 66 km on the sea ice and eventually reached the calving grounds. The highly dynamic nature of sea ice, which is driven by oceanic currents and wind during spring break-up, presents inherent hazards different from lake ice. Based on three years of Global Positioning System (GPS) radio-collar data, Caribou routinely crossed long expanses (30 km) of ice covering the brackish Selawik Lake and shorter stretches (< 13 km) on Inland Lake during their spring migration north. There was also a single crossing on the ice covering Selawik Lake during the fall migration south to the wintering grounds that took place in early November 2010. Five GPS-collared Caribou crossed the short frozen span (14 km) of Kotzebue Sound between Cape Krusenstern National Monument and the Baldwin Peninsula in the fall of 2011.																			0008-3550					JUL-SEP	2012	126	3					217	220																WOS:000314383600005

This study aims to analyze the influential factors of CTSI-based eutrophication by using Pearson correlation analysis and principal component analysis with long-term data from 2008 to 2019 on 21 drinking water reservoirs in Taiwan. The trophic state index (TSI) deviation indicates that most drinking water reservoirs, around 45.5% of statistical data fall within non-algal turbidity with surplus phosphorus, especially in the spring and winter season. Besides, about 78% of total collected data show that TSI chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is less than TSI Secchi depth (SD) due to the small particulate predominance. On the other hand, three TSI variables (SD, total phosphorus (TP) and Chl-a) of CTSI exhibits insignificant correlation to each other in most cases. Under such conditions, the probability of eutrophication (TSI > 50) based on TSI (SD) is 63%, while it is low as 20% based on TSI (TP) and TSI (Chl-a). The influencing factors of eutrophication variables by suspended solids (SS) composition and turbidity have shown that the SD is strongly influenced by non-algal SS. The deviations of three TSI have shown that the highest algae-induced eutrophication potential occurs in summer season. In addition, the TP is the most significant loading factor of algae-induced eutrophication for drinking water reservoirs. It is concluded that the CTSI has limited applicability to identify the trophic state of drinking water reservoirs in Taiwan in the presence of sustainable non-algal turbidity comparative Chl-a that specifically represents the potential of algal growth.

J	KENNEDY, CR; BURROUGH, RJ				KENNEDY, CR; BURROUGH, RJ			THE ESTABLISHMENT AND SUBSEQUENT HISTORY OF A POPULATION OF LIGULA-INTESTINALIS IN ROACH RUTILIS-RUTILIS (L)	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The introduction, establishment and subsequent history of a population of L. intestinalis in roach, R. rutilus, of a small lake was studied over a period of 7 yr. The introduction is believed to be a natural, chance colonization achieved by the return of great crested grebes as permanent residents. Within 2 yr the parasite infected 33% of the roaches between 60-120 mm in size. It exhibited a pronounced seasonal cycle in infection. Fish were often infected when only a few months old in autumn and young fish and parasites over-wintered together. Parasite growth resumed in the following summer, when some further infections occurred. The majority of infected fish died in or before their 2nd winter, possibly as a result of selective predation, but a small proportion survived into a 3rd yr. Dispersion of the parasite was close to random for most of the time. Multiple infections and slight over-dispersion occurred only in summer months. Infections were scarcer in large fish, due partly to selective mortality of infected fish and partly to a change in the host diet. The pattern of seasonal infection compared favorably with other localities but prevalence and intensity of infection were consistently lower, parasite dispersion closer to random and multiple infections much scarcer than elsewhere. Infection levels and parasite growth rates varied from year to year but these annual fluctuations were irregular and showed no consistent pattern. The Ligula population exhibited both regulatory and destabilizing features and there was no definite evidence that it was stable. Possibly, Ligula is an opportunist species. It is endemic in some sites but in others, especially small lakes, the populations are unregulated and unstable and so persist for short periods only in a non-equilibrium state.																			0022-1112	1095-8649					1981	19	1					105	126		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1981.tb05815.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1981.tb05815.x													WOS:A1981LW57100010

However, the physical mechanisms behind this winter climate sensitivity and the influence of catchment type on the varve formation are not fully investigated. Here, we present a winter climate record inferred from the clastic laminae of three lakes located on the region of fine-grained tills in Eastern Finland spanning from AD 1890 to 1990. The minerogenic varve data are compared with instrumental meteorological and hydrological time series in order to investigate the physical link between winter and spring climate and minerogenic matter accumulation. Our analyses reveal that the climate-catchment mechanisms operating in the region of fine-grained tills differ crucially from previously described climate catchment interactions on sand moraine-dominated catchments in Finland, where the maximum river discharge in spring controls the clastic lamina formation. However, in contrast to earlier boreal varve records from Central Finland, the clastic lamina formation in the studied region correlates negatively with spring temperatures and winter precipitation. This could be an artefact of varying catchment dynamics but also related to the regional climate. The lakes surrounded by catchments characterized by fine-grained tills are more sensitive to cold and dry winters. The differences in the sensitivity of varve characteristics to climate, highlights the importance of understanding the catchment dynamics in detail in order to better understand climatic forcing.

Watershed Land Use Controls on Chemical Inputs to Lake Ontario Embayments	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												There is considerable interest in understanding the role of land use in controlling surface water quality. This study was conducted to assess the role of land cover in regulating temporal and spatial patterns in nutrients and major solutes in rivers that drain into Lake Ontario. Water samples were collected monthly from 22 river sites in subwatersheds of eight embayments along the New York coast of Lake Ontario over the period 2001-2003. Samples were analyzed for nutrients and major solutes. The land cover of the subwatersheds was varied, but largely a mixture of forest and agricultural lands. Rivers draining largely agricultural lands exhibited distinct seasonal patterns, particularly for nutrients. Nitrate and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations were generally low during the Summer growing season, increased markedly during fall and decreased during winter and spring. Total phosphorus (TP), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and most ion (Na+, K+, Ca+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO42-) concentrations varied with seasonal discharge patterns. Distinct spatial patterns were observed in river solute concentrations chat closely corresponded with land use. Solute concentrations increased markedly with increases in the percentage of the watershed Occurring as agricultural lands. Such a pattern has been commonly observed for nutrients (e.g., TP, TN, NO3-) but this relationship was also evident for most non-nutrient solutes (e.g., DOC, Ca2+, F-, SO42-), a pattern which has not previously been reported. These observations Suggest that agricultural activities mobilize most major elements, enhancing transport across the temperate landscape and impacting downstream water resources, including embayments and the Lake Ontario ecosystem.

Atmospheric stilling and warming air temperatures drive long-term changes in lake stratification in a large oligotrophic lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Lake surface temperatures are warming in many regions and have the potential to alter seasonal thermal stratification. However, the effects of climate change on thermal stratification can be difficult to characterize because trends in thermal stratification can be regulated by changes in multiple climate variables and other characteristics, such as water clarity. Here, we use long-term (1993-2017) data from near-pristine Crater Lake (Oregon) to understand long-term changes in the depth and strength of summer stratification, measured by the center of buoyancy and Schmidt Stability, respectively. The depth of stratification has shoaled significantly (2.4 m decade(-1)), while stratification strength exhibited no long-term trend. Empirical observations and modeling scenarios demonstrate that atmospheric stilling at Crater Lake is associated with the 25-year shoaling trend as spring wind speeds declined over the observation period. While summer lake surface water and air temperatures warmed during the study period, spring air temperatures were variable and correlated with summer Schmidt Stability. Our results indicate that warmer spring air temperature resulted in earlier onset of stratification and stronger summer stratification. The observed shoaling of stratification depth at Crater Lake may have important ecological consequences, especially for non-motile primary producers who can become constrained within a thinner epilimnion and exposed to higher solar radiation and reduced upwelling of nutrients. Driven by climate changes, many large lakes may be experiencing similar trends in seasonal stratification.

Steudel) and narrow-leaved cattail (Typha angustifolia L.) in Eğirdir Lake (Turkey) and the possibility of using for phytoremediation of these macrophytes	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												This study which was carried out between July 2019 and April 2020 aimed to determine the seasonal changes of heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Se, and Zn) in plant organs of Phragmites australis and Typha angustifolia grown in Egirdir Lake and to research the usability of the these plants for phytoremediation with the calculation of bioaccumulation factor (BF). Plant samples were brought to the laboratory, and then washed, cleaned with distilled water, dried in an oven at 70(degrees)C and acidified with 10 ml HNO3. The samples were heated at 120(degrees)C on a hot plate until completely mineralized. After mineralization, heavy metal concentrations were determined by using ICP-AES (Vista model). Only Mo was the highest in leaf, while other metals were highest in root in P. australis. In T. angustifolia, Mn and Mo were highest in the leaf, the accumulation of other metals was observed to be higher in the plant's roots than the other organs. It was discovered that the metal concentrations in root, in stem, and in leaf for both macrophytes generally increased in summer and decreased in root in autumn and winter and in stem and in leaf in spring for P. australis and in all organs in spring for T. angustifolia. Bioaccumulation factor (BF) values were calculated to determine the phytoremediation potential of P. australis and T. angustifolia. Both macrophytes are not excluder for all metals. Plants revealed potential for phytoremediation for the removal of heavy metals especially Mo and Zn. As a result of our study, it was determined that both macrophytes had accumulation abilities especially for Mo and Zn. It should be taken into consideration that these macrophytes can be used for improving the current situation of Egirdir Lake due to their advantages such as being economical and not causing any harm to the environment.

Winter ecology of striped bass (Morone saxatilis) near its northern limit of distribution in the Saint John River, New Brunswick	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Winter habitat selection by Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis) has been described as opportunistic, but due to the length and severity of winter at its northern range, winter habitats in the north are predicted to be restricted in distribution and carefully selected. Here we describe the locations and environmental conditions supporting winter aggregations of adult Striped Bass including periods under ice cover in the Saint John River, New Brunswick using acoustic telemetry. Striped Bass of both Saint John River (72%) and other ancestry (28%) were observed to overwinter within the river's four mainstem lakes and embayments to which the individuals returned each fall. Most non-Saint John River ancestry Striped Bass were observed in habitats nearest the river mouth in winter. Striped Bass travelled to winter habitats from fall feeding locations from October to November, and only four tagged individuals departed the river at this time. Temperature, dissolved oxygen, and salinity conditions best described the winter habitats. By demonstrating the non-random distribution of Striped Bass during winter and identifying a gradient of habitat use by Saint John River ancestry Striped Bass in this northern river system, it is apparent that protection of these locations is critical for the long term conservation of Striped Bass populations in Canada.

While physics-based hydrodynamic modeling is a fundamental approach, improving the forecast accuracy remains critical. In recent years, machine learning (ML) has quickly emerged in geoscience applications, but its application to the Great Lakes hydrodynamic prediction is still in its early stages. This work is the first one to explore a deep learning approach to predicting spatiotemporal distributions of the lake surface temperature (LST) in the Great Lakes. Our study shows that the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, trained with the limited data from hypothetical monitoring networks, can provide consistent and robust performance. The LSTM prediction captured the LST spatiotemporal variabilities across the five Great Lakes well, suggesting an effective and efficient way for monitoring network design in assisting the ML-based forecast. Furthermore, we employed an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technique named SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to uncover how the features impact the LSTM prediction. Our XAI analysis shows air temperature is the most influential feature for predicting LST in the trained LSTM. The relatively large bias in the LSTM prediction during the spring and fall was associated with substantial heterogeneity of air temperature during the two seasons. In contrast, the physics-based hydrodynamic model performed better in spring and fall yet exhibited relatively large biases during the summer stratification period. Finally, we developed a statistical integration of the hydrodynamic modeling and deep learning results based on the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE). The integration further enhanced prediction accuracy, suggesting its potential for next-generation Great Lakes forecast systems.

Effect of Season and Habitat on PCB Bioaccumulation by Caged Bluegill Sunfish Deployed in a Great Lakes Area of Concern	BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												Bluegill sunfish were caged in the Detroit River, Ontario, Canada, for 64 days to determine bioaccumulation rates of PCBs. Deployments involved placing fish in cages suspended in the water (suspended cages) compared to cages partially buried in sediments. Deployments were performed in the summer and winter months. During summer, fish exhibited significant increases in body weight and lipid content (sediment associated cages only), whereas in winter, body weights did not change. Lipid normalized PCB concentrations and PCB mass in fish increased significantly with time in summer deployments, but not in winter. Fish continued to accumulate PCBs over the 64 days caging duration except for PCBs 33, 49, and 52 in sediment associated cages. There were no significant differences in the bioaccumulation of PCBs between cage types. This study confirms that biomonitoring studies using caged fish should ensure chemical toxicokinetics are consistent when comparing bioaccumulation results among sites and/or time points.																			0007-4861	1432-0800				JUL	2014	93	1					1	6		10.1007/s00128-014-1280-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-014-1280-z								24744127					WOS:000337028500001

Lake Ontario's nearshore zooplankton: Community composition changes and comparisons to the offshore	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												In large lake systems the nearshore habitat is an intermediate zone between the shoreline and offshore, is an important nursery for larval fish, and is highlighted as an area in need of research in the Laurentian Great Lakes. In this study, we used two long-term monitoring programs to characterize the nearshore zooplankton community composition using seasonal data (May - October) and to compare the nearshore and offshore zooplankton community composition changes over time (1998 - 2019) to determine if the changes were synchronized. In the nearshore, we found the highest zooplankton biomass during the late summer/early fall (August 27th - Oct 6th), compared to mid-summer (July 1st - Aug 26th) and late spring (May 20th - June 30th). In the summer, the nearshore zooplankton community was dominated by cladocerans while copepods dominated the offshore community. From 1998 to 2019, both nearshore and offshore copepods shifted from a cyclopoid to a calanoid-dominated state, but the details of this change were different. For example, taxon-specific analysis revealed that despite reduced cyclopoids in both habitats, Mesocyclops edax increased in the nearshore. Additionally, taxon-specific analysis suggested the changes occurred an average of three years earlier in the nearshore. Using Analysis of Similarity, the nearshore and offshore summer zooplankton community compositions became increasingly distinct over time. Results from this study highlight the uniqueness of the nearshore in large lake systems, the importance of seasonal and long-term monitoring, and the potential of the nearshore as an early indicator of offshore changes.Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of International Association for Great Lakes Research.																			0380-1330					JUN	2023	49	3					698	712		10.1016/j.jglr.2023.02.013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2023.02.013		MAY 2023											WOS:001002079600001
J	Stanford, KM; King, RB; Wynn, D				Stanford, Kristin M.; King, Richard B.; Wynn, Doug			Summer and Winter Spatial Habitat Use by the Lake Erie Watersnake	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												In an effort to provide information to guide habitat management for the Lake Erie watersnake Nerodia sipedon insularum, a federally threatened and Ohio state endangered species, we used radiotelemetry to obtain spatial habitat data for adult snakes during the summer active season and during winter hibernation. During the summer active season, terrestrial habitat use was limited to a narrow band of shoreline. Among individuals, maximum distance inland from shore ranged from 1 to 50 m (mean = 8 m) and linear extent of shoreline ranged from 30 to 1,360 m (mean = 261 m). Winter hibernation occurred at varying distances inland with individual hibernation sites ranging from 1 to 580 m (mean = 29 m) from shore. Habitat use did not differ between males and females. Existing U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service habitat management guidelines suggest that ground-disturbing activities within potential hibernation areas (defined as terrestrial habitat within 161 m of shore) should be avoided in winter to prevent harm to hibernating snakes. They suggest further that excavation and removal of shrubs, standing or downed trees, root masses, animal burrows, piled rocks, cliffs, or bedrock within 21 m of shore should be avoided in summer to prevent harm to active snakes. Given that Lake Erie watersnakes have recovered to the point where delisting is being proposed, these habitat guidelines appear to be sufficient. However, maintaining voluntary compliance with habitat guidelines and meeting the need for continued public outreach will be vital to ensure long-term persistence.																			1944-687X					NOV	2010	1	2					122	130		10.3996/052010-JFWM-013	http://dx.doi.org/10.3996/052010-JFWM-013													WOS:000208546600008

Intraspecific variation in a predator affects community structure and cascading trophic interactions	ECOLOGY												Intraspecific phenotypic variation in ecologically important traits is widespread and important for evolutionary processes, but its effects on community and ecosystem processes are poorly understood. We use life history differences among populations of alewives, Alosa pseudoharengus, to test the effects of intraspecific phenotypic variation in a predator on pelagic zooplankton community structure and the strength of cascading trophic interactions. We focus on the effects of differences in (1) the duration of residence in fresh water (either seasonal or year-round) and (2) differences in foraging morphology, both of which may strongly influence interactions between alewives and their prey. We measured zooplankton community structure, algal biomass, and spring total phosphorus in lakes that contained landlocked, anadromous, or no alewives. Both the duration of residence and the intraspecific variation in foraging morphology strongly influenced zooplankton community structure. Lakes with landlocked alewives had small-bodied zooplankton year-round, and lakes with no alewives had large-bodied zooplankton year-round. In contrast, zooplankton communities in lakes with anadromous alewives cycled between large-bodied zooplankton in the winter and spring and small-bodied zooplankton in the summer. In summer, differences in feeding morphology of alewives caused zooplankton biomass to be lower and body size to be smaller in lakes with anadromous alewives than in lakes with landlocked alewives. Furthermore, intraspecific variation altered the strength of the trophic cascade caused by alewives. Our results demonstrate that intraspecific phenotypic variation of predators can regulate community structure and ecosystem processes by modifying the form and strength of complex trophic interactions.

Scaly-sided Mergansers (n = 4) were tagged with Platform Transmitter Terminals at Dailing in the southeastern Lesser Xingan Mountains of China during the late breeding seasons of 2010 and 2011. Two Scaly-sided Mergansers completed their autumn migration across the Yellow Sea, lasting 58 and 26 days, respectively, arriving on their wintering grounds at Yuanjiang River in Hunan Province and Xiushui River in Jiangxi Province of China. Both of the Scaly-sided Mergansers stopped at four sites and travelled 2,600 km from their breeding to wintering grounds. After a stay of 120 days, one of the marked individuals departed its wintering ground and returned to Dailing on 19 April 2012 and used a similar route as that in autumn migration and stopped at two sites. Wetlands at Ryonghung Gang estuary in North Korea, Yunshui River and Chidong Lake in Hubei Province of China, and Songjiang River in Jilin Province of China were used as major stopover sites. The determination of previously unknown wintering grounds and stopover sites in China and North Korea provides opportunity to discover more populations of the Scaly-sided Merganser outside its breeding areas.

We tested if the accumulation of PUFAs in a seston size fraction containing different consumers and in Daphnia as a separate consumer is subject to seasonal changes in a large deep lake due to changes in the dietary PUFA supply and specific demands of different consumers. We found that the accumulation of arachidonic acid (ARA) in Daphnia increased from early summer to late summer and autumn. However, ARA requirements of Daphnia appeared to be constant throughout the year, because the accumulation of ARA increased when the dietary ARA supply decreased. In the size fraction 140 m, we found an increased accumulation of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) during late summer and autumn. These seasonal changes in DHA accumulation were linked to changes in the proportion of copepods in this size fraction, which may have increasingly accumulated DHA for active overwintering. We show that consumer-specific PUFA demands can result in seasonal changes in PUFA accumulation, which may influence the trophic transfer of PUFAs within the food web.

With the assistance of the 6S radiative transfer model, we simulated apparent reflectancein relation to AOD in each Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) waveband in this study. The closeness of the relationship was used to identify the most and least sensitive MODIS wavebands. These two bands were then used to construct three aerosol indices (difference, ratio, and normalized difference) for estimating AOD quickly and effectively. The three indices were correlated, respectively, with in situ measured AOD at the Aerosol Robotic NETwork (AERONET) Lake Taihu, Beijing, and Xianghe stations. It is found that apparent reflectance of the blue waveband (band 3) is the most sensitive to AOD while the mid-infrared wavelength (band 7) is the least sensitive. The difference aerosol index is the most accurate in indicating aerosol-induced atmospheric pollution with a correlation coefficient of 0.585, 0.860, 0.685, and 0.333 at the Lake Taihu station, 0.721, 0.839, 0.795, and 0.629 at the Beijing station, and 0.778, 0.782, 0.837, and 0.643 at the Xianghe station in spring, summer, autumn and winter, respectively. It is concluded that the newly proposed difference aerosol index can be used effectively to study the level of aerosol-induced air pollution from MODIS satellite imagery with relative ease.					; Zhang, Jiahua/KFS-4615-2024	Zhang, Jiahua/0000-0002-2894-9627; 													2072-4292					FEB	2014	6	2					1587	1604		10.3390/rs6021587	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs6021587													WOS:000336092100032

Impacts of Climate Change on Groundwater Availability and Spring Flows: Observations from the Highly Productive Medicine Lake Highlands/Fall River Springs Aquifer System	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Medicine Lake Highlands/Fall River Springs Aquifer System, located in northeastern California, is home to some of the largest first-order springs in the United States. This work assesses the likely effects of projected climate change on spring flow. Four anticipated climate futures (GFDL A2, GFDL B1, CCSM4 rcp 8.5, CNRM rcp 8.5) for California, which predict a range of conditions (generally warming and transitioning from snow to rain with variable amounts of total precipitation), are postulated to affect groundwater recharge primarily by changing evapotranspiration. The linkages between climate variables and spring flow are evaluated using a water balance model that represents the physics of evapotranspiration and recharge, the Basin Characterization Model. Three of the four climate scenarios (GFDL A2, GFDL B1, CCSM4 rcp 8.5) project that by the year 2100, groundwater recharge (and consequently decreased spring flow) will decrease by 27%, 21%, and 9%, respectively. The fourth scenario (CNRM rcp 8.5) showed an increase in recharge of 32% due to a significant increase in precipitation (27%). Evapotranspiration increases due to a shift in the type of precipitation and a longer growing season. While the likelihood of each scenario is outside the scope of this work, unless total precipitation increases dramatically in the future, increased temperatures and decreasing precipitation will likely result in reduced spring flows, along with warmer water temperatures in downstream habitats.

The level of oil and grease decreased significantly when moving downstream. The level of oil and grease along the river was lower in summer than in winter and spring.

Early studies pre-2005 of the river system's eight hydro dams identified that only Lakes Ohakuri and Arapuni thermally stratified in summer, and it was hypothesised that thermal stratification could enhance phytoplankton productivity through increased retention time. During. a more recent study (2013-2014), Lake Karapiro was also found to be thermally stratified with the thermocline around the depth of the power station intake. In this study we found that thermal stratification enhanced phytoplankton growth by confining them to the well-lit epilimnion. However, growth was limited as the nutrient supply became depleted and zooplankton grazing was found to adversely impact phytoplankton biomass, with highest grazing pressure in spring and lowest in late summer to autumn, consistent with an increase in chlorophyll a concentration. We found that wind stress along the lake axis can induce an internal seiche, which causes a substantial stepwise change in water quality downstream as the thermocline sweeps up and down across the power station intake.

However, understanding the assembly of microeukaryotic communities and their functional composition in freshwater lake ecosystems across diverse environmental gradients remains limited. Here, we utilized amplicon sequencing of 18S rRNA gene and multivariate statistical analyses to examine the spatiotemporal and biogeographical patterns of microeukaryotes in water columns (at depths of 0.5, 5, and 10 m) within a subtropical lake in eastern China, covering a 40 km distance during spring and autumn of 2022. Our results revealed that complex and diverse microeukaryotic communities were dominated by Chlorophyta (mainly Chlorophyceae), Fungi, Alveolata, Stramenopiles, and Cryptophyta lineages. Species richness was higher in autumn than in spring, forming significant hump-shaped relationships with chlorophyll a concentration (Chl-a, an indicator of phytoplankton biomass). Microeukaryotic communities exhibited significant seasonality and distance-decay patterns. By contrast, the effect of vertical depth was negligible. Stochastic processes mainly influenced the assembly of microeukaryotic communities, explaining 63, 67, and 55% of community variation for spring, autumn, and both seasons combined, respectively. Trait-based functional analysis revealed the prevalence of heterotrophic and phototrophic microeukaryotic plankton with a trade-off along N:P ratio, Chl-a, and dissolved oxygen (DO) gradients. Similarly, the mixotrophic proportions were significantly and positively correlated with Chl-a and DO concentrations. Overall, our findings may provide useful insights into the assembly patterns of microeukaryotes in lake ecosystem and how their functions respond to environmental changes.

Meyer) Simonsen is a freshwater planktonic diatom that undergoes large seasonal changes in cell morphology related to changes in vertical mixing. Short cells (10-20 mu m) with thin walls were formed under the ice of Lake Baikal but cell lengths increased up to 150 mu m by the time mixing depth reached over 100 m in June. These long cells became resting stages that were packed with reserve products and had siliceous walls up to 4 mu m thick. Increase in mixing depth gave access to sufficient silica for completion of resting stages in most years but not in high biomass years, which has long-term implications for the population. Wall thickening reduced the risk of dissolution during dormancy but it also reduced cell volume. Therefore, by increasing length, cells maintained storage space for reserves. Seasonal changes in valve length showed that individual valves did not last more than 6 months, equivalent to 5 to 10 divisions. Separation valves were important in determining the number of cells per filament during spring growth but cell breakage became more important during summer dormancy. Resting stages survived in cool, intermediate depths (50-150 m) during summer stratification and were returned to the surface during autumn overturn.

Seasonal patterns of methylmercury production, release, and degradation in profundal sediment of a hypereutrophic reservoir. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XXX-XXX. Profundal lake sediment is an important site of toxic methylmercury (MeHg) production by anaerobic bacteria. This study tracked sediment MeHg cycling in hypereutrophic Hodges Reservoir, in the United States. Sediment-associated MeHg was most elevated in the early spring during moderately reduced conditions. In the late spring, MeHg and iron were released into hypolimnetic water during the progression from iron-reducing to sulfate-reducing conditions at the sediment-water interface. A decrease in porewater sulfate in the early summer indicated enhanced sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) activity and was associated with sediment buildup of MeHg, likely due to enhanced sorption to iron sulfides. Depletion of sulfate in the sediment during the fall corresponded with a substantial decrease in both sediment and water-column MeHg, suggesting that methanogenic conditions led to enhanced MeHg degradation. Shortly afterward, MeHg increased in the hypolimnion, indicating an upward shift in the zone of SRB methylation. Our study suggests 2 "hot moments" of MeHg entry into the water column, where it is susceptible to uptake into the pelagic food web: a spring window of mildly reduced conditions that promote MeHg release from sediment, and a fall window where MeHg is produced in the upper hypolimnion. These hot moments may potentially be managed to lower mercury bioaccumulation via redox enhancement of the profundal zone with approaches such as bottom water oxygenation, which began operation in Hodges Reservoir in 2020. However, the complexity of biogeochemical responses to such management perturbations in regard to MeHg cycling makes it difficult to predict the ultimate effect of oxygenation on mercury bioaccumulation.

Our results suggest that DOC is an important driver of the seasonal distribution of phytoplankton biomass-high DOC exacerbates light limitation under ice resulting in low phytoplankton biomass, but supports phytoplankton growth during the open-water period when photolytic and biological degradation of organic matter contributes to the pool of available nutrients. Under-ice phytoplankton biomass in a clear, low DOC lake was as high as during the open-water period, suggesting the importance of under-ice processes for lake metabolic balance, also evidenced by persistent oxic conditions in the hypolimnion. Species composition was dynamic, reflecting rapidly changing conditions over the course of the season. Our data suggest that phytoplankton under ice provides seed populations for early spring blooms and that the largest shifts in species composition occur later during the summer, likely as a result of nutrient depletion and intensified grazing pressure. Early spring temperatures in West Greenland have risen rapidly in recent decades, triggering shifts in the timing of lake ice-out and the onset of stratification; therefore, it is important to understand phytoplankton seasonal dynamics to disentangle the effects of climate-driven shifts on aquatic biota.

J	Girjatowicz, JP				Girjatowicz, Jozef Piotr			Effects of the North Atlantic Oscillation on water temperature in southern Baltic coastal lakes	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The effects of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on water temperature (WT) in Lakes Jamno, Gardno, and Lebsko were studied between 1961 and 2000. Both sets of data (NAO and WT) consisted of monthly and seasonal values. Correlation and regression analyses were used and the relationships were tested for statistical significance (Fisher-Snedecor test, coefficients of correlation and determination). Positive and statistically significant (even at alpha = 0.01) relationships were demonstrated for the winter months (December, January, February and March) and in October. The strongest relationships were demonstrated for winter (December-February) in lakes Jamno and Gardno (correlation coefficients of 0.73 and 0.74). Extreme winters, particularly the very mild ones, tended to diminish the strength of the relationships. Very mild winters were characterised by relatively favourable solar (sunshine) conditions as well as high air and water temperatures, while the NAO Index values were relatively low. Relationships for spring (March-May) and summer (June-August) were not significant. In those seasons, the effects of atmospheric circulation (NAO) on WT were thus low, while the influences of solar factors were strong. Asynchronous relationships bear some predictive value, particularly when the predictive variable is the January NAO Index (NAO(Jan)). These relationships were significant at alpha = 0.01, out to April (NAO(Jan) vs. WTApr). Attention is also drawn to local factors (air temperature, geostrophic wind, solar conditions, and sea water intrusions into lakes) which affected the strength of the relationships investigated.																			0003-4088	2100-000X					2011	47	1					73	84		10.1051/limn/2010031	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2010031													WOS:000289009700006

Three helminth species were identified: Ligophorus angustus Euzet & Suriano 1977 (Monogenea) on the gills, and Saccocoelium obesum Looss, 1902 (Digenea) and Neoechinorhynchus agilis (Rudolphi, 1819) (Acanthocephala) in the intestine. Among these species, S. obesum was the most common species, with an overall prevalence and mean intensity of 42.7% and 13.6 +/- 12.5 parasites/fish, respectively. L. angustus was the second most prevalent parasite, with an overall prevalence of 21.3%. The third most prevalent parasite was N. agilis, with an overall prevalence and mean intensity of 12.6% and 3.6 +/- 2.1 parasites/fish, respectively. Regarding the effect of seasonal changes, the prevalence and mean intensity of S. obesum was highest in the summer and spring, respectively. For L. angustus, while the highest prevalence was observed in winter (40.6%), this species was not recorded in summer. The prevalence of N. agilis was rather low (41.6%) in spring, and this species was also not detected in summer. With regard to host size-related incidence, the differences in the abundance of the 3 species among 4 size classes were not significant (P > 0.05). In contrast, there were significant differences in the abundance of N. agilis among the age groups (P = 0.33). As for the infrapopulations of the parasite species depending on the host's sex, significant differences were found in the infrapopulations of L. angustus and S. obesum between the sexes (P < 0.001 and P = 0.007, respectively).

M.			Trapped Under Ice: Spatial and Seasonal Dynamics of Dissolved Organic Matter Composition in Tundra Lakes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Arctic lakes store, modify, and transport large quantities of carbon from terrestrial environments to the atmosphere; however, the spatial and temporal relationships between quantity and composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) have not been well characterized across broad arctic regions. Moreover, most arctic lake DOM compositions have been examined during the ice-free summer, whereas DOM cycling between the ice-covered winter months and summer have not been addressed. To resolve these spatial and seasonal uncertainties in DOM cycling, we sampled a series of arctic lakes from the North Slope of Alaska across a latitudinal gradient in the winter and summer over 3 years. Samples were analyzed for dissolved organic carbon concentration and DOM composition was characterized using optical and fluorescence properties combined with molecular-level analysis using Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. Tundra lake DOM properties including aromaticity and molecular stoichiometries were similar to other northern high-latitude lakes, but optical parameters related to aromaticity and molecular weight were greater in major arctic rivers and in coastal lakes in the North Slope region. DOM composition was highly seasonal, with ice exclusion concentrating microbially processed DOM in the winter water columns, potentially influencing DOM cycling the following summer. However, the greatest variations in DOM composition were related to lake depth and likely other physical features including morphology and bathymetry. As the Arctic warms, we expect changes in hydrology and ice cover to enhance under-ice microbial DOM processing, early summer photodegradation, and ultimately carbon fluxes to the atmosphere after ice-out.

Model calibration and validation were based on samples taken from four long-term water quality stations during the period 2007-2009. Parametric sensitivities in winter and summer were examined using root mean square error (RMSE) and relative entropy. The calibration and validation results show good agreement between model prediction and observed data. The two sensitivity methods confirmed pronounced parametric sensitivity to model state variables in summer compared to winter. Of the 24 parameters examined, dissolved oxygen (DO) and ammonia (NH3-N) are the most influenced variables in summer. Instream kinetic processes including nitrification, nutrient uptake by algae and algae respiration induce a higher sensitivity on DO in summer than in winter. Moreover, in summer, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and chlorophyll-a (Chla) variables are more sensitive to algal processes (nutrient uptake and algae death). In winter however, there exists some degree of sensitivity of algal processes (algae respiration and nutrient uptake) to DO and NH3-N. Results of this study provide information on the state of the river water quality which impacts Lake Diefenbaker and the need for additional continuous monitoring in the river. The results of the sensitivity analysis also provide guidance on most sensitive parameters and kinetic processes that affect eutrophication for preliminary surface water quality modelling studies in cold regions.

However, historic global emissions and long range atmospheric transport has led to elevated Hg in Arctic wildlife and waterways. Continuous atmospheric Hg measurements, spanning 20 years, and increased monitoring sites has allowed a more comprehensive understanding of how Arctic atmospheric mercury is changing over time. Time-series trend analysis of TGM (Total Gaseous Mercury) in air was performed from 10 circumpolar air monitoring stations, comprising of high-Arctic, and sub-Arctic sites. GOM (gaseous oxidised mercury) and PHg (particulate bound mercury) measurements were also available at 2 high-Arctic sites. Seasonal mean TGM for sub-Arctic sites were lowest during fall ranging from 1.1 ng m-3 Hyytiala to 1.3 ng m-3, Little Fox Lake. Mean TGM concentrations at high-Arctic sites showed the greatest variability, with highest daily means in spring ranging between 4.2 ng m-3 at Amderma and 2.4 ng m-3 at Zeppelin, largely driven by local chemistry. Annual TGM trend analysis was negative for 8 of the 10 sites. High-Arctic seasonal TGM trends saw smallest decline during summer. Fall trends ranged from -0.8% to -2.6% yr(-1). Across the sub-Arctic sites spring showed the largest significant decreases, ranging between -7.7% to -0.36% yr(-1), while fall generally had no significant trends. High-Arctic speciation of GOM and PHg at Alert and Zeppelin showed that the timing and composition of atmospheric mercury deposition events are shifting. Alert GOM trends are increasing throughout the year, while PHg trends decreased or not significant. Zeppelin saw the opposite, moving towards increasing PHg and decreasing GOM. Atmospheric mercury trends over the last 20 years indicate that Hg concentrations are decreasing across the Arctic, though not uniformly. This is potentially driven by environmental change, such as plant productivity and sea ice dynamics.

J	Beauvais, S; Pedrotti, ML; Villa, E; Lemée, R				Beauvais, S; Pedrotti, ML; Villa, E; Lemée, R			Transparent exopolymer particle (TEP) dynamics in relation to trophic and hydrological conditions in the NW Mediterranean Sea	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Seasonal abundance, volume, size distribution and carbon content of transparent exopolymeric particles (TEP) were examined in 2 hydrologically distinct sites in the NW Mediterranean (NWM) Sea: a coastal (Point B, Villefranche Bay) and an offshore (DYFAMED, France, JGOFS) site. TEP concentration varied from 0.2 to 2.2 x 10(5) particles ml(-1), and was higher offshore. The TEP pool was low during the winter mesotrophic period and increased after the spring bloom, remaining relatively high throughout summer at both sites. The increase in TEP abundance during the oligotrophic period was relatable to nitrate limitation and a decline in primary production. TEP formation in spring was associated to a nanoflagellate bloom, while the build-up of a large pool of TEP in summer occurred in the presence of a phytoplankton community dominated by picoplankters and during strong thermal stratification, limiting vertical sedimentation. In the NWM Sea, when the TEP carbon pool (TEP-C) is high, it may represent up to 22% of the total organic carbon, and reach down to 1% when it is low, suggesting that the particles play a significant role in the carbon cycle. In the NWM Sea, the trophic status of the system and the composition of primary producers control TEP formation. Hydrological processes appear to be of primary importance in governing seasonal TEP distribution.

In Lake Zurich (Switzerland), P. rubescens emerged as a keystone species with annual mass developments since the 1970s. Its success was partly attributed to effects of lake warming, such as changes in thermal stratification and seasonal deep mixing. However, recent observations based on a biweekly monitoring campaign (2009-2020) revealed two massive breakdowns and striking seasonal oscillations of the population. Here, we disentangle positive from negative consequences of secular lake warming and annual variations in weather conditions on P. rubescens dynamics: (i) despite the high survival rates of overwintering populations (up to 25%) during three consecutive winters (2014-2016) of incomplete deep convective mixing, cyanobacterial regrowth during the following stratified season was moderate and not overshooting a distinct standing stock threshold. Moreover, we recorded a negative trend for annual population maxima and total population size, pointing to a potential nutrient limitation after a series of incomplete winter mixing. Thus, the predication of steadily increasing blooms of P. rubescens could not be confirmed for the last decade. (ii) The seasonal reestablishment of P. rubescens was strongly coupled with a timely formation of a stable metalimnion structure, where the first positive net growth in the following productive summer season was observed. The trigger for the vertical positioning of filaments within the metalimnion was irradiance and not maximal water column stability. Repetitive disruptions of the vernal metalimnion owing to unstable weather conditions, as in spring 2019, went in parallel with a massive breakdown of the standing stock and marginal regrowth during thermal stratification. (iii) Driven by light intensity, P. rubescens was entrained into the turbulent epilimnion in autumn, followed by a second peak in population growth. Thus, the typical bimodal growth pattern was still intact during the last decade. Our long-term study highlights the finely tuned interplay between climate-induced changes and variability of thermal stratification dynamics and physiological traits of P. rubescens, determining its survival in a mesotrophic temperate lake.					; Castro, Bieito/AAM-9763-2021; Knapp, Deborah/MFI-0178-2025	Koester, Oliver/0009-0005-7517-3023; Fernandez Castro, Bieito/0000-0001-7797-854X; Posch, Thomas/0000-0001-5145-3761; 														1664-302X				AUG 25	2021	12								705914	10.3389/fmicb.2021.705914	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.705914								34512582					WOS:000728844200001

Seasonal growth potential of rare lake water bacteria suggest their disproportional contribution to carbon fluxes	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												We studied the seasonal growth potential of opportunistic bacterial populations in Lake Zurich (Switzerland) by a series of grazer-free dilution culture assays. Pronounced shifts in the composition of the bacterial assemblages were observed within one doubling of total cell numbers, from initially abundant Actinobacteria to other fast-growing microbial lineages. Small populations with growth potentials far above community average were detected throughout the year with striking seasonal differences in their respective taxonomic affiliations. Members of Cytophaga-Flavobacteria (CF) were disproportionally proliferating only during phytoplankton blooms in spring and summer, while Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria showed superior growth at all other occasions. Growth rates of Alphaproteobacteria and esp. Sphingomonadaceae were significantly correlated to water temperatures and were far above community average in summer. Within the genus Flavobacterium, two species-like populations showed a tendency for fast growth in most experiments, while four others were exclusively proliferating either during a spring or during a summer phytoplankton bloom. Their high growth potentials but low in situ abundances hint at a tight control by bacterivorous grazers and at a consequently accelerated carbon flux to higher trophic levels.

Comparison of Prokaryotic Diversity in Cold, Oligotrophic Remote Lakes of Chilean Patagonia	CURRENT MICROBIOLOGY												The prokaryotic abundance and diversity in three cold, oligotrophic Patagonian lakes (T,mpanos, Las Torres and Mercedes) in the northern region Ays,n (Chile) were compared in winter and summer using 16S rRNA fluorescence in situ hybridization and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis technique. Prokaryotic abundances, numerically dominated by Bacteria, were quite similar in the three lakes, but higher in sediments than in waters, and they were also higher in summer than in winter. The relative contribution of Archaea was greater in waters than in sediments, and in winter rather than in summer. Despite the phylogenetic analysis indicated that most sequences were affiliated to a few taxonomic groups, mainly referred to Proteobacteria (consisting of Beta-, Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria) and Euryarchaeota (mainly related to uncultured methanogens), their relative abundances differed in each sample, resulting in different bacterial and archaeal assemblages. In winter, the abundance of the dominant bacterial phylotypes were mainly regulated by the increasing levels of total organic carbon in waters. Archaeal abundance and richness appeared mostly influenced by pH in winter and total nitrogen content in summer. The prokaryotic community composition at T,mpanos lake, located most northerly and closer to a glacier, greatly differed in respect to the other two lakes. In this lake was detected the highest bacterial diversity, being Betaproteobacteria the most abundant group, whereas Alphaproteobacteria were distinctive of Mercedes. Archaeal community associated with sediments was mainly represent by members related to the order of Methanosarcinales at Mercedes and Las Torres lakes, and by Crenarchaeota at T,mpanos lake. Our results indicate that the proximity to the glacier and the seasonality shape the composition of the prokaryotic communities in these remote lakes. These results may be used as baseline information to follow the microbial community responses to potential global changes and to anthropogenic impacts.					; Gugliandolo, Concetta/L-6855-2015; Martinez, Miguel/O-4623-2014; Papale, Maria/AAC-6049-2020	Papale, Maria/0000-0002-6013-4436; Gugliandolo, Concetta/0000-0002-9125-3999; Gonzalez Munoz, Paulina/0009-0008-5690-2499; 													0343-8651	1432-0991				MAY	2017	74	5					598	613		10.1007/s00284-017-1209-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-017-1209-y								28265709					WOS:000399036100008

A total of 19 plecopteran species comprising c. 4 500 adults and c. 2 900 larvae were sampled in streams. Of these, Capnia atra, Capnopsis schilleri, Nemurella pictetii and Isoperla difformis were recorded for the first time in the streams of the province Pohjois-Hame (Tb). The plecopteran fauna was richest in the small forest streams and relatively poor in the largest outlet. Both, the character of the stream bed and the quantity and quality of food available seemed to be the most important factors affecting the occurrence of the plecopteran species. In the brooks the emergence of stoneflies had two clear maxima: one in spring and another in late autumn. Vernal species were Taeniopteryx nebulosa, Isoperla difformis, Nemoura avicularis, N. flexuosa and Leuctra hippopus. Dominant species in the autumnal cathes were Leuctra fusca and Leuctra digitata. In the outlet streams the succession of emergence was somewhat different owing to the weak emergency and due to the cold summer with strong floods in 1987. The slit trap method worked well in the catching of stoneflies except during the snow melting seasons and the flood periods.																			0785-8760						1995	6	2-3					99	108		10.33338/ef.83845	http://dx.doi.org/10.33338/ef.83845													WOS:A1995TL91500007

We examined spatial and temporal changes in genetic, demographic, and ecologic characteristics of the eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus; n = 543) within two isolated populations inhabiting playa lake basins in the Texas Panhandle. Spatial autocorrelation and contiguous clustering analyses documented nonrandom dispersion of genotypes within both populations, during each of four consecutive seasons. Considerable seasonal variation in genotypic autocorrelative patterns and size, position, and genotypic composition of significant contiguous clusters also was observed. Genotypic structuring within playa basins was particularly evident during spring, summer, and autumn; greater randomization of genetic distributions occurred in the winter, prereproductive season. Presence of spatial associations of genotypes and changes in their position and composition over seasons were influenced by episodic exchange of individuals from genetically different populations, subsequent random mating and restoration of Hardy-Weinberg genotypic proportions in resulting offspring, and patchy distribution of habitat types within playa basins. Mantel matrix regressions, which were used to test relationships among demographic, habitat, and genotypic variables show that the relative importance of each factor changes seasonally. Differences in habitat use among individuals were significantly correlated with genotypic cluster affiliation during the prereproductive period, whereas age structure became increasingly important in explaining spatial arrangement of genotypes during later periods. Although populations from different playa basins differ in gene frequency, seasonal changes in genetic structure within each population were correlated.																			0022-2372					NOV	1993	74	4					1026	1044		10.2307/1382442	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1382442													WOS:A1993MK17100024

The research reveals pronounced seasonal changes in the lake's water environment index. During winter, nitrate nitrogen and BOD5 interact significantly, jointly becoming the primary factors restricting lake water quality. In summer, the constructed wetlands effectively improve TN levels. Furthermore, water depth plays a regulatory role in Chl-a content, ammonia-nitrogen, and nitrite-nitrogen by influencing light penetration and water temperature.Abstract Urban lakes commonly suffer from nutrient over-enrichment, resulting in water quality deterioration and eutrophication. Constructed wetlands are widely employed for ecological restoration in such lakes but their efficacy in water purification noticeably fluctuates with the seasons. This study takes the constructed wetland of Jinshan Lake as an example. By analyzing the water quality parameters at three depths during both summer and winter, this study explores the influence of the constructed wetland on the water quality of each layer during different seasons and elucidates the potential mechanisms underlying these seasonal effects. The results indicate that the constructed wetland significantly enhances total nitrogen (TN) concentration during summer and exhibits the capacity for nitrate-nitrogen removal in winter. However, its efficacy in removing total phosphorus (TP) is limited, and may even serve as a potential phosphorus (P) source for the lake during winter. Water quality test results of different samples indicated they belong to Class III or IV. Restrictive factors varied across seasons: nitrate-nitrogen and BOD5 jointly affected water quality in winter, whereas TP predominantly constrained water quality in summer. These results could provide a reference for water quality monitoring and management strategies of constructed wetlands in different seasons in Jiangsu Province.					柳, xl/GWV-0198-2022															2079-7737				AUG	2024	13	8							593	10.3390/biology13080593	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology13080593								39194531					WOS:001305164100001

Here, we present changes in surface water temperature and ice-cover duration of Lake Lunz from 1921 to 2015 and evaluate how fast these changes occur over time, in particular with respect to other lakes with similar long-term data series. Since 1921, the surface water temperature of this Austrian subalpine lake has increased by 0.8 degrees C, with the most intense increase recorded during the spring and summer months (similar to 1-2 degrees C) and less during fall (similar to 0.3 degrees C). The duration of full lake ice cover has decreased significantly since 1921. During the 1921-2015 study period, Lake Lunz was ice covered for 92 of 94 winters, with ice-free winters in 2006 and 2013. The interannual decrease of the lake ice cover corresponds to 0.36 days less ice cover per year from 1921 to 2015. Freeze dates now occur 17.4 d/100 yr later, and the ice breakup date change is similar to the freeze date, 17.6 d/100 yr earlier. Although the duration of interannual ice cover varied by only 8.3 days between 1921 and 1930, on 32 days between 2006 and 2015 this interannual variability increased by almost 4 times. Thus, the observed decrease of ice cover is accompanied by increasing interannual variability, during which the lake was fully ice covered. When comparing days of full ice cover to other lakes until 2005, Lake Lunz had a similar decline in ice-cover duration (1.85 d/decade), but a dramatic decrease in full ice cover during 2005 and 2015 indicates that the overall decline in lake ice-cover duration was sensitive to changes in lake ice cover during the past decade. This study emphasizes the importance of continuous and collaborative measurements in other (subalpine) lakes worldwide to test, and also manage, the sensitivity of lakes to ongoing effects of climate change.

J	KIRKBY, JS; MITCHELL, C				KIRKBY, JS; MITCHELL, C			DISTRIBUTION AND STATUS OF WINTERING SHOVELERS ANAS CLYPEATA IN GREAT-BRITAIN	BIRD STUDY												The distribution and status of Shovelers using British wetlands in autumn and winter was examined using ringing recoveries and National Waterfowl Count data. Maximum counts have been around 8500 and suggest a total population of c. 10 000. Some of these birds originate from north-west continental Europe, eastern Scandinavia and the Western former USSR, whilst others originate from British breeding populations. Numbers peaked in October, after which there was a steady emigration from Britain as birds moved to France, the Iberian Peninsula and Mediterranean for the winter. The population fell sharply during the early 1960s and then increased up until 1971/72. Since then there has been a gradual, though slight, decline. The number counted decreased nationally during periods of cold weather, suggesting cold weather emigrations. Wintering Shovelers have increased their usage of reservoirs and mineral workings, and slightly decreased their usage of natural lakes. Patterns of seasonal occurrence varied between regions and habitats. Numbers peaked early in northern Britain and progressively later in regions to the south. An early season peak was evident on natural lakes and reservoirs, but occurred progressively later on gravel pits, on the coast and on floodlands. Shovelers were recorded at 10-20% of the c. 1800 sites visited during the period 1985/86 to 1989/90 and, of these, 84% held fewer than 50 birds. A total of 51 sites supported nationally important numbers (>90) and these held 46-70% of the population. Whilst protection of these sites is a high priority for the conservation of this species, wider countryside policies are needed to maintain the population throughout its range in Britain.																			0006-3657					NOV	1993	40		3				170	180																WOS:A1993MJ19400002

The rates varied seasonally and were higher in summer and fall than in the spring. The optimal pH for sulfate reduction in Reservoir 29 sediments was 5, but samples had increased activity at pH 7 within 24 h after adjusting the pH to this value. In Lake B, the optimal pH for sulfate reduction was the in situ pH (6.2). Sulfate reduction in both lakes was stimulated 2-3-fold by increasing pH2. High concentrations (5 mM) of organic acids inhibited sulfate reduction at pH 3.8, but stimulation was observed at concentrations of 0.1 mM. Acid-volatile sulfides accounted for about 70% of the products of 35SO4 reduction.																			0168-6496	1574-6941				APR	1990	73	3					193	201		10.1016/0378-1097(90)90730-E	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0378-1097(90)90730-E													WOS:A1990CZ40800003

Trophic connections in Lake Superior Part I: The offshore fish community	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Detailed diet linkages within the offshore (>80 m bathymetric depth) food web of Lake Superior are currently not well identified. We used analyses of fish stomach contents to create an empirically based food web model of the Lake Superior offshore fish community. Stomachs were collected seasonally (spring, summer, and fall) from nine offshore locations in 2005, using bottom and midwater trawls. In total, 2643 stomachs representing 12 fish species were examined. The predominant fish species collected were deepwater sculpin (Myoxocephalus thompsonii), siscowet (Salvelinus namaycush siscowet), kiyi (Coregonus kiyi), and cisco (Coregonus artedi). Mysis diluviana was the most common prey item, indicating that changes in Mysis abundance could have a profound impact on the entire offshore food web. Mysis was the primary diet item of deepwater sculpin (>= 53% by mass) and kiyi (>= 96% by mass) regardless of depth or season. The invasive Bythotrephes was an important diet component of the pelagic cisco in summer and fall. Deepwater sculpin were the primary diet item of siscowet (>= 52% by mass), with coregonines appearing in the diet of larger (>400 mm) siscowet. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis indicated that there were no statistically significant seasonal or site-specific differences in diets of deepwater sculpin, cisco, or kiyi. Site was the primary structuring factor in siscowet diets. Generally, in Lake Superior, the diet items of the dominant offshore species did not appear to be in danger from those types of major ecological shifts occurring in the lower Laurentian Great Lakes.

To improve our understanding of the two main geese populations in East Asia-Greater White-fronted (Anser albifrons; GWFG) and Bean Geese (Anser fabalis sensu lato; BEAG), which includes the Tundra A. f. serrirostris (TDBG) and Taiga Bean Geese A. f. middendorffii (TGBG), this study estimated their long- and short-term trends and the migration strategies based on their distribution during the migratory and wintering seasons, using nationwide census data collected over 24 years in South Korea. The TRIM (TRends and Indices for Monitoring data) analysis supported a robust long-term population increase since 1999, recently stabilizing around 150,000 individuals in GWFG and 100,000 in TDBG, respectively. But TGBG stabilized at around 7000 with no significant change of population over time. The shorter-term trends within a season suggested that wintering populations of GWFG and TDBG in China might stop over in Korea in their autumn migration before their sea-crossing, evidenced by the large congregation near the Yellow Sea coast followed by a gradual decrease. In contrast to autumn, there was no similar peak in spring migration, suggesting the potential for elliptical migration of some populations around the Yellow Sea. Our findings indicate a growing East Asian population and imply one of the migration strategies of the Greater White-fronted and Tundra Bean Geese. By collaborating with recent tracking data, long-term monitoring efforts could offer more detailed insights into population trends and migration strategies, thereby contributing to the effective management and conservation of goose species in East Asia.					; Choi, Chang-Yong/Q-9577-2019; LEE, WHO-SEUNG/B-2748-2008; Kim, Eun-jeong/LIC-5154-2024	Kim, Hwa-Jung/0000-0002-7178-926X; 													2053-7166						2024	15								100214	10.1016/j.avrs.2024.100214	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.avrs.2024.100214													WOS:001359094900001

Lake trout were captured in spring and fall 1983-1996, tagged with Floy anchor tags, and recaptured during subsequent agency sampling and by commercial fishers and anglers during 1983-1997. Angler recaptures were used to quantify movements; these recaptures were standardized to 10,000 salmonid angler-hours (giving recaptures per effort [RPE]) to account for the spatial and temporal variation in recapture effort. Movement was inferred from the spatial and temporal differences in the distribution of RPE. The dispersal radius, an index of the area occupied by tagged lake trout, was defined as the area containing 90% of the total RPE. It was estimated by fitting the cumulative proportion of RPE versus distance from the tagging location to an exponential sigmoid model and using inverse prediction, We used linear regression to test for density dependence in movement. Lake trout tagged in spring occupied a larger area than those tagged in fall and increased their range as population density increased. Directional movement differed for spring- and fall-tagged fish. Spring-tagged fish showed no directional tendencies in movement, but fall-tagged fish tended to move more to the south than to the north. There was no significant difference in directional movement between recapture seasons. Our results will be useful for the management and restoration of lake trout in Lake Michigan by providing information that can be incorporated into population models and management decisions about refuges and management zones within the lake.

In this study, we identified the functional groups and driving factors behind short-term succession in phytoplankton communities. We analyzed physical, chemical, and biological factors of the Maixi River in Baihua Reservoir (BHR) from August to September, 2013 (summer, phase I) and March to May, 2014 (late spring and early summer, phase II). The 226 samples collected were divided into 23 functional groups. In phase I, phytoplankton biomass ranged from 4.88 to 30.59 mg(.)L(-1), and the group S1 (Pseudanabaena limnetica) had the greatest biomass. In phase II, phytoplankton biomass ranged from 2.22 to 50.61 mg(.)L(-1), and groups Y (Cryptomonas sp.) and S1 (P. limnetica) had the greatest biomass. Dominant functional groups in the Maixi River changed from S1 + D + Y + Lo in phase I to Y + S1 in summer. Changes in the phytoplankton community varied between 0 and 0.144 day(-1) in phase I and between 0.008 and 0.389 day(-1) in later spring and early summer. This showed a steady-state phytoplankton community during the two phases, in which the functional groups S1 (P. limnetica) and Y (Cryptomonas sp.) were dominant. Pseudanabaena limnetica, Synedra sp., Peridinium sp., and Cryptomonas sp. were dominant during summer, contributing to 70% of the total biomass in the steady-state community, and P. limnetica, Synedra sp., Cryptomonas sp., and Chlamydomonas sp. were dominant during later spring and early summer, contributing to 60% of the total biomass in the community. Groups S1, D, and Y formed easily in the Maixi River, but P. limnetica was the dominant species in the eutrophic conditions of the Maixi River. According to biotic and abiotic factors, we concluded that the Maixi River is hypertrophic, and water resource management should take blooms of P. limnetica occurring in May into account. Temperature and dissolved oxygen were the critical factors affecting the steady-state of the phytoplankton community in late spring and early summer and summer, respectively. Because the Maixi River is an important source in the BHR, its phytoplankton functional groups directly affect the ecological balance of the water environment.

Bacterial population density, biomass, and rates of biomass production in the epilimnion and hypolimnion were examined for their relationship with several environmental parameters. Bacterioplankton density fluctuated between 0.5 and 7 x 10(6) bacteria ml(-1), with highest values in the anoxic hypolimnion. At all depths there was a trend towards a higher density of bacteria from spring to midsummer, followed by a decline in late summer to early autumn. Cocci tended to dominate bacterial cell shapes from winter to midsummer, after which rod-shaped cells became most abundant. Rod-shaped cells contributed the most to bacterioplankton biomass at all depths and times of year. The mean annual biovolume of all bacterioplankton was 0.12 mu m cell(-1). The mean annual areal bacterioplankton biomass was 11-12 mmol C m(-2). The percentage of bacterial to phytoplankton biomass per volume in summertime was 27% in the epilimnion and 11% in the hypolimnion. Average annual and summertime bacterial production estimated using the [H-3]thymidine method was similar to previous estimates of bacterial production measured in Mirror Lake using other methods. The average ratio of bacterial to net phytoplankton production per volume was 0.34 in the epilimnion, and between 0.65 and 1.1, depending on depth, in the hypolimnion during summer. Of several variables considered in regression analyses, only temperature explained >50% of the variance in bacterial production in both the hypolimnion and epilimnion. Above 14 degrees C, however, bacterial production and growth rate in the epilimnion were not clearly related to temperature. During the period of midsummer hypolimnetic anoxia, despite colder temperatures in the hypolimnion, bacterial production was up to 10 times greater than in the epilimnion.

Model predictions were compared to detailed (on a meter scale) observations of mysid vertical distributions using 420 kHz hydroacoustics at two stations during three seasons in Lake Ontario. The model described the spring and summer distributions but failed to predict fall distributions when the thermocline was below 40m depth. Addition of a term representing avoidance of temperature gradients derived independently from the literature improved predictions substantially during fall. We hypothesize that the avoidance of a temperature gradient may be the result of the presence of fish kairomones in the upper surface waters. Overlap between distributions, predicted by the model, including the temperature gradient and observed distributions was over 60 % for most time periods and seasons. This model can be used to calculate likely overlap between mysid and their zooplankton prey and between mysids and their fish predators based on readily measured temperature and light profiles.																			0003-9136					JAN	2004	159	1					1	23		10.1127/0003-9136/2004/0159-0001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2004/0159-0001													WOS:000189143600001

Geochemical and diatom data from sediment trap samples were compared with a broad range of limnological and meteorological parameters to quantify the impact of single parameters on biochemical calcite precipitation and organic matter production. Our goals were to disentangle how carbonaceous varves and their sublaminae form during the annual cycle to better understand the palaeorecords and to detect influences of dissolution, resuspension as well as of global radiation and stratification on lake internal particle formation. Total particle fluxes in both investigated years were highest during spring and summer. Sedimentation was dominated by autochthonous organic matter and biochemically precipitated calcite. Main calcite precipitation occurred between April and July and was preceded and followed by smaller flux peaks caused by resuspension during winter and blooms of the calcified green algae Phacotus lenticularis during summer. In some of the trap intervals during summer up to 100% of the precipitated calcite was dissolved in the hypolimnion. High primary production due to stable insolation conditions in epilimnic waters began with stratification of the water column. Start and development of stratification is closely related to air and water surface temperatures. It is assumed that global radiation influences the onset and stability of water column stratification and thereby determining the intensity of primary production and consequently of timing and amount of calcite precipitation which is triggered by phytoplanktonic CO2 consumption. Sediment fluxes of organic matter and calcite are also related to the winter NAO-Index. Therefore these fluxes will be used as a proxy for ongoing reconstruction of Holocene climate conditions.

Heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) and plastidic nanoflagellates (PNF) were enumerated from different depths, and the seasonal community composition of protists was analyzed from the epilimnion and hypolimnion using 18S rRNA gene clone libraries. In the epilimnion, HNF were dominant during early summer and autumn, whereas PNF, which includes mixotrophs, had a higher contribution during the late summer and winter months. Changes in the abundance of HNF and PNF differed, and their peaks of abundance did not coincide, suggesting that these groups show contrasting responses to changes in environmental conditions. Protistan communities in the epilimnion and hypolimnion were represented mainly by cryptophytes and dinophytes, respectively, whereas cercozoans had a significant contribution in both (i.e. all libraries). We found high diversity and distinct protist communities in the epilimnion and hypo limnion, where the majority of the hypolimnion sequences had low similarity with related sequences in public databases. This indicates that little is known about protistan communities from deep freshwater lakes and that further studies from deep waters are needed to understand the role of these organisms.

J	Catalan, J; Pla, S; García, J; Camarero, L				Catalan, Jordi; Pla, Sergi; Garcia, Joan; Camarero, Lluis			Climate and CO2 saturation in an alpine lake throughout the Holocene	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												This study shows that diatom sediment records can be used to investigate the long-term inorganic carbon dynamics in oligotrophic and poorly acid-buffered lakes. Using a training set of 115 high-mountain lakes in the Pyrenees, we found that both alkalinity and potential hydrogen (pH) independently explained some of the variability in diatom assemblages. Transfer functions for both variables were developed and applied to a Holocene record from Lake Redon and CO2 changes calculated. CO2 saturation broadly followed alkalinity, which in turn was related to summer and autumn air-temperature fluctuations. In general, warmer climate during the ice-free period led to higher supersaturation, due to increased alkalinity, which facilitated retention of CO2 from respiration, and decreased primary production (assessed by diatom fluxes). Only during the early Holocene, there were periods of extreme undersaturation, corresponding to cold periods of low alkalinity (<20 microequivalents per liter [mu eq L-1]), and suggesting carbon limitation of primary production. The winter and spring climate, which determines the ice cover duration, appears to be relevant for CO2 saturation only during periods when the organic-matter content of the sediments was low (<22%). Longer periods of ice cover led to lower lake CO2 saturation, suggesting that the ice cover influence on internal nutrient loading may regulate lake productivity fluctuations under low allocthonous nutrient and organic-matter inputs. Alkalinity similar to 20 mu eq L-1 and sediment organic matter similar to 22% appear as critical thresholds in the way lake CO2 levels respond to climate fluctuations.

THE BLACKBIRD (TURDUS MERULA) AT THE NORTHEASTERN BORDER OF ITS AREA: SPECIFIC FEATURES OF TERRITORIAL RELATIONS AND MIGRATIONS DURING THE FORMATION OF A PERIPHERAL POPULATION IN SOUTHERN KARELIA (A REVIEW)	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												A pattern for the formation of a peripheral population of the blackbird, Turdus m. merula L., at the northeastern border of its area is presented based on the results of long-term (35 years) investigations. The original data published and data from other sources that allow assessing the situation in the adjacent parts of the species area are generalized. The results of the number accounts, trapping, ringing and control of the marked birds are used for the description of the expansion mechanism (391 nests were found, 483 nestlings, 329 adults and 599 young birds were ringed). Most of the data was collected in eastern Ladoga Lake basin (at the "Mayachino" Station, Institute of Biology, Karelian Research Center, Russian Academy of Sciences) in 1978-2007. The blackbird's area extends to the northeast over more than 150 years; this bird has been nested in Karelia since 1975. The development of this region occurred due to spring migration of young birds, which came back here for breeding the next years. The conditions of the spring migratiory period strongly influenced a course of the expansion: the number of birds sharply increased in warm March - April. In different periods, the population was replenished due to immigrants from different parts of Europe: up to the mid-1980s, due to birds wintered in Great Britain; in 1985-2000, in the Mediterranean. The long-term absence of-their fly up caused deep falls in the number of birds and diminished genetic relations with birds of the previous wave. A rise in spring temperatures at the end of the twentieth century promoted the movement of the species toward the northeast. The genetically fixed late terms of moult appear to be one of the obstacles for their fast advance. In most of the birds, the times of shedding of the plumage and autumn migration coincide. The slow displacement of post-juvenile moult to earlier terms indicates a gradual adaptation of the species to the environmental conditions of northern regions.																			0044-5134					FEB	2010	89	2					212	221																WOS:000278518100008
C	Vermeyen, TB		Abt, SR; YoungPezeshk, J; Watson, CC		Vermeyen, TB			First-year selective withdrawal performance of the Shasta Dam temperature control device	WATER RESOURCES ENGINEERING 98, VOLS 1 AND 2					International Water Resources Engineering Conference	AUG 03-07, 1998	MEMPHIS, TN	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Water Resources Engn, US Geol Survey, US EPA, Wetlands Div				Dramatic declines in winter-run chinook salmon populations has resulted in their listing as a protected species, in 1989, under the Federal and California State Endangered Species Acts. One of several factors limiting salmon populations is egg and fry mortality associated with elevated water temperatures in the upper Sacramento River. Since 1987, water temperatures in the upper Sacramento River have been managed to protect endangered salmon species by releasing deeper, colder water from Shasta Lake using the low-level outlet works. However, these releases bypassed the power plant so hydroelectric generation was greatly reduced. For example, bypass releases from 1987 through 1996 have an estimated combined cost of $63 million in replacement power costs. The Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA), passed in 1992, elevated fish and wildlife protection and restoration to equal importance with the original project objectives of flood control, irrigation, navigation, and power production. As part of the CVPIA, Reclamation was ordered to construct and operate a temperature control device (TCD) at Shasta Dam which would control release water temperatures in the upper Sacramento River to minimize Salmon mortality. The TCD was designed to selectively withdraw water from Shasta Lake over a wide range of levels to meet water temperature targets in the upper Sacramento River. Shasta TCD operations will improve the control of river temperature, turbidity, and dissolved oxygen which will significantly improve the spawning and rearing success of the winter, fall, and spring chinook salmon runs. During the first summer of operation, the Shasta TCD allowed project operators to meet water quality standards while continuing to fulfill contractual obligations for water delivery and power generation. This paper will summarize the TCD's selective withdrawal performance during its first year of operation.																					0-7844-0359-7				1998							944	949																WOS:000081713600158

Future changes in the transitions of monthly-to-seasonal precipitation extremes over the Midwest in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 models	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Precipitation extremes present significant risks to Midwest agriculture, water resources, and natural ecosystems. Recently, there is growing attention to the transitions of precipitation extremes, or shifts between heavy precipitation and drought, due to their profound environmental and socio-economic impacts. Changes in Midwest precipitation extremes and transitions between extremes over the past few decades have been documented; however, their future changes are still unknown. In this study, we estimate the projected changes in transitions of precipitation extremes in the Midwest based on 17 CMIP6 models. Two Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) based metrics, intra-annual variability and transitions, are used to quantify the magnitude, duration, and frequency of variability and transitions between wet and dry extremes. Compared with the observation-based precipitation datasets, the multimodel ensemble median of CMIP6 can reasonably represent the spatial patterns of SPI extremes and transitions. Climate projections show significantly intensified wet extremes across the Midwest by the end of the century, with a greater increase over the northern Midwest and the Great Lakes region. The short-term SPI also shows intensified dry extremes over the western half of the Midwest. Consequently, there is a significant increase in the magnitude of intra-annual variability in most areas. Projections also suggest more frequent and rapid transitions between the wet and dry extremes, especially over the Great Lakes region and northern Midwest. Seasonally, more frequent transitions from a wet spring to a dry summer (or from a dry fall to a wet winter/spring) are projected to occur; and generally, the wet and dry conditions between the transitions are projected to be more intense compared to the historical period. Furthermore, the intensified precipitation extremes and accelerated transitions are greatly alleviated under a lower emission scenario, implying that future changes in hydroclimate extremes, and impacts thereof, in the Midwest are sensitive to climate change mitigation.

J	EVANS, ME				EVANS, ME			MOVEMENTS OF BEWICKS SWANS CYGNUS-COLUMBIANUS-BEWICKII MARKED AT SLIMBRIDGE, ENGLAND FROM 1960 TO 1979	ARDEA												Between 1960 and 1979, 962 different Bewick''s Swans were caught at the Wildfowl Trust, Slimbridge, England, mainly in a channel leading from a lake. Most were ringed with engraved plastic rings, readable from 300 m. In 6 winters some swans were also dyed yellow on the tail and wing tips. Away from Slimbridge swans were either identified as individuals (through ring number or bill pattern, which was different on each bird), or observed as Slimbridge-marked (with ring or dye) although not identified. One identification consisted of reports of a swan at a site on 1 or several dates. Swans (62) were identified in West Germany, The Netherlands and Britain before arriving in the same winter at Slimbridge. Two birds were recorded at a site 160 km to the east and at Slimbridge on the same day. In these same countries, 201 swams were identified between 1st arrival at and last departure from Slimbridge in the same winter. After departure from Slimbridge, 458 swans were identified or recovered later in the same winter in Ireland, Britain, The Netherlands, West Germany, Denmark, East Germany, Estonia, USSR, while dyed swans were also seen in Poland and Sweden. One bird departing from Slimbridge was in West Germany on Jan. 1; another was recorded there 1 day after leaving Slimbridge. Swans (528) marked at Slimbridge were identified in Ireland, Britain, The Netherlands, West Germany, Denmark and East Germany during winters when they did not visit Slimbridge, and 32 recovered. A ringed, but unidentified, bird was seen in the Shetland Islands; another in the south of France. Movements of swans between 2 sites, other than Slimbridge, highlighted the importance of West German sites in the spring. Families mostly stayed together on migration, but instances when they split up are detailed. A pair and their offspring, well documented in 3 winters, tended to use the same sites on migration each year. Timings of departure from Slimbridge were much earlier than those from sites as far west, possibly due to supplementary feeding under floodlights. The greater number of identifications in spring than in autumn, and in Britain, The Netherlands and West Germany compared with the rest of the migratory route, is discussed. Other marking methods (neck collars, radio tracking) are examined. The public awareness value of marking birds is stressed.																			0373-2266	2213-1175					1982	70	1					59	75																WOS:A1982MY60300006

We report the first record of A. arndti in the Danube and provide a detailed description of its colony development. Our findings support the theory of moderate endemicity and reveal a new, smaller zooid type in A. arndti. This zooid remains attached to the colony, connected to the stalk myoneme but lacks an aboral ciliary wreath. Unlike microzooids, it is incapable of leaving the colony. It exhibits a less spherical shape and arises from the fourth division of the colony-founder cell. Although its specific function is unknown, it is hypothesized to support the stalk dish. Our results have significant implications for understanding the systematics of vorticellids, suggesting their ancestral nature as colonial organisms characterized by a helically contracting stalk myoneme. Furthermore, the exclusive retention of the stalk myoneme by the parental cell after binary fission may serve as a synapomorphy for the Vorticellidae. We provide a descriptive analysis of the ecological environment and microhabitat of A. arndti in the Danube, revealing its preference for well-developed, detritusrich biofilms during summer, absence in late winter and spring, emergence during peak summer, and subsequent decline until mid-winter.

Ocean color instruments with low spatial resolution have been used to monitor cyanobacterial bloom in large lakes; however, they cannot be applied to small water bodies well. Here, the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2A and -2B and the Operational Landsat Imager (OLI) onboard Landsat-8 were employed to assemble the virtual constellation and to track spatial and seasonal variations in floating algae blooms from 2016 to 2020 in a small eutrophic plateau lake: Lake Xingyun in China. The floating algae index (FAI) was calculated using Rayleigh-corrected reflectance in the red, near-infrared, and short-wave infrared bands. The MSI-derived FAI had a similar pattern to the OLI-derived FAI, with a mean absolute percentage error of 19.98% and unbiased percentage difference of 17.05%. Then, an FAI threshold, 0.0693, was determined using bimodal histograms of FAI images for floating algae extraction. The floating algae had a higher occurrence in the northern region than the southern region in this lake, whilst the occurrence of floating algae in summer and autumn was higher than that in spring and winter. Such a spatial and seasonal pattern was related to the variability in air temperature, wind speed and direction, and nutrients. The climatological annual mean occurrence of floating algae from 2016 to 2020 in Lake Xingyun exhibited a significant decrease, which was related to decreases in nutrients, resulting from efficient ecological restoration by the local government. This research highlighted the application of OLI-MSI virtual constellation on monitoring floating algae in a small lake, providing a practical and theoretical reference to monitor aquatic environments in small water bodies.					; Ling, Hong/E-3729-2010; liu, miao/KGL-7043-2024; Cao, Zhigang/L-5336-2017; Cao, Zhigang/L-5337-2017	Liu, Miao/0000-0002-3888-1849; Cao, Zhigang/0000-0001-5329-2906; 														2072-4292				NOV	2021	13	21							4479	10.3390/rs13214479	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13214479													WOS:000719223700001

Various parameters were measured to determine what effect the seasons had on the water column. It was determined that a seasonal turnover did occur between the fall and the spring sampling; however, the depth of mixing due to turnover could not be established. Trends were observed which suggested that microbial activity was altering the iron speciation at depth, and subsequently masking the extent of mixing. Various trace metals were removed from the surface water by either co-precipitation with schwertmannite or adsorption.																					0-87335-182-7				2000							359	366																WOS:000169875500038

Using long-term, high frequency datasets of weather and lake thermal structure from the west of Ireland (2005 to 2017), we quantified the effects of storms on the physical conditions in a monomictic, deep lake close to the Atlantic Ocean. We analysed a total of 227 storms during the stratified (May to September, n = 51) and non-stratified (November to March, n = 176) periods. In winter, as might be expected, changes were distributed over the entire water column, whereas in summer, when the lake was stratified, storms only impacted the smaller volume above the thermocline. During an average summer (May September) storm, the lake number dropped by an order of magnitude, the thermocline deepened by an average of 2.8 m, water column stability decreased by an average of 60.4 j m(-2) and the epilimnion temperature decreased by a factor of five compared to the average change in winter (0.5 degrees C vs. 0.1 degrees C). Projected increases in summer storm frequency will have important implications for lake physics and biological pathways.					; Jennings, Eleanor/ISU-1018-2023	de Eyto, Elvira/0000-0003-2281-2491; 														2073-4441				FEB	2020	12	2							318	10.3390/w12020318	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12020318													WOS:000519846500010

VARIABILITY OF PHYTOPLANKTON AND ZOOPLANKTON IN RELATION TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES IN TONGA LAKE, ALGERIA (RAMSAR SITE OFTHE SW MEDITERRANEAN)	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The purpose of this study was to assess the biological and physicochemical quality of Tonga Lake, a RAMSAR site situated in Algeria, during the Coronavirus pandemic. Phytoplankton and zooplankton, as well as several physicochemical variables (water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, total suspended particulate, and nutrients), were analyzed monthly at two stations during 2019-2020. The results showed that the physicochemical variables were within the tolerable ranges, except for phosphate, which slightly exceeded the reference threshold. No phytoplankton blooms were encountered; cyanobacteria were the most abundant during the study period and reached their maximum in winter (137888 cells/l), while dinoflagellates and diatoms reached their maxima in autumn and spring, respectively (23809 and 102083 cells/l). while the maximum of all the identified zooplankton groups was recorded in the spring. Dinoflagellates were strongly affected by pH and total suspended particulate. On the other hand, high significant correlations were reported between protozoa and dissolved oxygen, as well as between rotifers and water temperature. Nonetheless, no-significant correlations were detected between the remaining groups (diatoms, cyanobacteria, cladocerans, and copepods) and the investigated environmental variables.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2024	22	5					4877	4895		10.15666/aeer/2205_48774895	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/2205_48774895		JUL 2024											WOS:001326931400001

However, it has been rarely studied in riverine system of farming regions, where small streams have been usually modified by a water gate and flood levee. This study was conducted to investigate dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC, DIC) in artificially modified tributary streams, namely the Desheng and Shuangqiao-Shiba streams, in a farming region of the lower Yangtze River basin. The results showed that the DOC and DIC concentrations had remarkable temporal-spatial variability in the Desheng and Shuangqiao-Shiba streams. The mean DOC concentrations were 5.4 and 6.7 mg L-1 in the Desheng and Shuangqiao-Shiba streams during the period of about 1 year, while the DIC concentrations were 14.0 and 9.6 mg L-1 in both streams, respectively. The DOC and DIC concentrations mainly showed the linear decreasing trends from source through to export in the spring, summer, autumn, and winter. The DOC concentration was almost always lower than the DIC concentration. The DOC concentration was positively correlated with the DIC concentration in the Desheng stream over the four seasons, indicating that the DOC and DIC potentially had similar sources. The DOC and DIC concentrations increased with sewage discharge, which introduced a potential hazard to human health. The water gate and flood levee in the Desheng and Shuangqiao-Shiba streams were constructed for discharging floods and recharging irrigation in the farming region, and their effects on dissolved carbon require further research.					王, WANGZHIPING/IZD-5413-2023; Han, Xingguo/K-7552-2016	Han, Xingguo/0000-0002-1836-975X; Zhang, Ximei/0000-0002-0038-5460														2073-4441				DEC	2022	14	24							4057	10.3390/w14244057	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14244057													WOS:000902818400001

In 2001, the American mink (Mustela vison) was recorded for the first time on Navarino Island, in the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve (55 degrees S) in Chile, representing the southernmost population of mink worldwide. In order to assess its potential impact oil native fauna, we studied its diet on Navarino Island, as part of an integrative management program oil invasive species. Over a three-year period (2005-2007) we collected 512 scats in semi-aquatic habitats: marine coasts, riparian and lake shores. Overall, the main prey was mammals (37% biomass), and birds (36%), followed by fish (24%). Over the spring and Summer, mink consumed significantly more birds, whereas mammals constituted the main prey over the autumn and winter when migratory birds had left the area. Among birds, the mink preyed mainly oil adult Passeriformes, followed by Anseriformes and Pelecaniformes, caught as chicks. Among mammals, the exotic muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) was the most important prey, and together with the native rodent Abrothrix xanthorhinus it accounted for 78% of the biomass intake. For all integrated management of invasive exotic mammal species oil Navarino Island and in the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve it is important to further research interactions established here among the various introduced mammals, and to initiate immediate control of the mink population in its initial stage of invasion.

It releases moisture during the dry spring period before the onset of the monsoon season. Widely used MODIS snow cover products have been available globally since 2002. The understanding of the temporal and spatial distribution of snow cover in a given region calls for a comprehensive data representation method. In this paper a method to visualize both spatial and temporal aspects of snow cover distribution from MODIS 8-day composite data is presented. It is based on RGB display of the snow cover data which is grouped according to season. The RGB syntheses of snow cover distribution (RSD) were generated for the Nam Co Basin in the central part of the Tibetan Plateau during the years of 2002-2009. An alternating pattern of monsoon and autumn snow cover was identified in the western part of the basin which corresponds to the biennial character of the variations of the Indian monsoon. Monsoon snow cover was found in RSD images for the years 2002, 2004 and 2008 whereas in years 2003 and 2009 the autumn snow cover is dominant. The eastern part of the basin does not follow this general pattern since it is affected by the so called. lake effect., which is a snow fall induced by the passing of dry and cold westerlies over the lake surface during the winter months. The years 2002, 2006 and 2007 were identified as years with a particularly strong lake effect from the RSD images. Areas with permanent snow cover and areas that were snow free were both found to be relatively stable. Comparison of the lake effect at Nam Co with nearby Siling Co, where the lake effect is smaller or absent, suggests that the presence of an effective barrier on the opposite side of the lake is a prerequisite for the occurrence of the strong lake effect.					; Kang, Shichang/I-6830-2018	Kropacek, Jan/0000-0002-8275-605X; Kang, Shichang/0000-0003-2115-9005														2072-4292				DEC	2010	2	12					2700	2712		10.3390/rs2122700	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs2122700													WOS:000208402200004

Bacterioplankton productivity in lakes of the Taylor Valley, Antarctica, during the polar night transition	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Research on the lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, is typically conducted during the period of 24 h sunlight (October to January) when logistical support is readily available. As part of the International Polar Year initiative, we obtained logistical support to study microbial dynamics in the permanently ice-covered lakes of the Taylor Valley during the transition from 24 h of sunlight to the complete darkness of the polar night (mid-April). Our study focused on the perennially ice-covered lakes Fryxell (FRX), East Lobe Bonney (ELB), and West Lobe Bonney (WLB), all of which are chemically stratified and have food webs dominated by microorganisms. Depth-integrated bacterioplankton productivity (BP; leucine incorporation [Leu] and thymidine incorporation [TdR]) in the lakes ranged from 1.2 to 3.4 mg C m(-2) d(-1). Overall, summer was characterized by relatively high rates of BP and photoautotrophic primary productivity. Rapid decreases in photosynthetically active radiation marked a subsequent transition period, which was characterized by variable cell counts and decreasing Leu: TdR ratios (ratios >1 signify a physiological shift from growth to maintenance mode). Finally, cell counts decreased and Leu: TdR increased by as much as 280% during the fall, revealing a distinct change in the physiological state of the bacterioplankton as light-mediated primary productivity ceased. Our data reveal that the shift in physiological state may result from a switch from contemporary phytoplankton-excreted carbon to other sources of dissolved organic carbon, which can support the bacterioplankton populations through the winter.

A variety of copepods from Belews Lake, North Carolina, [USA] were individually exposed to 5-10 coracidia of the Asian fish tapeworm, Bothriocephalus acheilognathi. The planktonic cyclopoid species Diacyclops thomasi, Mesocyclops edax, and Tropocyclops prasinus proved susceptible to infection, whereas a sympatric calanoid copepod (Skistodiaptomus pallidus) could not be infected experimentally. In addition, lab experiments revealed that the benthic cyclopods Eucyclops agilis and Paracyclops fimbriatus poppei could also be infected. All cyclopoids appear to be susceptible to infection regardless of developmental stage. Natural infections during the period of fall recruitment of the parasite by the fish hosts were highest among the planktonic T. prasinus. Although no benthic copepods were found infected during summer months in the field, these organisms may be important in transmitting the cestode to the detritivorous fathered minnow (Pimephales promelas) during the spring and fall periods of recruitment.

Changes in intense rainfall events and dry periods across Africa in the twenty-first century	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												A statistical framework for evaluating changes in extreme events is proposed and applied to evaluate a 20-member, regional climate model ensemble simulation with 30-km resolution. The model is found to represent the statistics and distributions of extreme events, including observed wet day characteristics, wet/dry days, and wet/dry spell characteristics, reasonably across Africa. Simulations of the mid-twenty-first and late-twenty-first century project statistically-significant changes in these societally-relevant climate characteristics in three regions. Intensification of rainfall is projected for the Sahel rainy season, including large increases in wet spell frequency, wet spell duration, and wet spell intensity. These changes are statistically significant at mid-twenty-first century and become more spatially robust by the end of the century. A weaker intensified rainfall trend is also projected over East Africa, for northern Ethiopia in boreal summer, Tanzania in boreal winter, and southern Ethiopia, Somalia, and the Lake Victoria region in boreal fall. The changes are significant in scattered regions at mid-twenty-first century, but widespread and highly significant by the end of the century. In contrast, increased dry periods is projected for parts of southern Africa (Angola, Zambia, Malawi), including 50-100% reductions in wet spell frequency annually and increases in dry spell duration in austral spring. The spatial coherence and rigorous statistical analysis of the projected changes combined with their physical consistency with the findings of previous studies support confidence in these results.					; Vizy, Edward/A-1577-2009; Cook, Kerry/B-4998-2011	Cook, Kerry/0000-0001-9270-4395; Vizy, Edward/0000-0002-5019-2819; 													0930-7575	1432-0894				SEP	2019	53	5-6					2757	2777		10.1007/s00382-019-04653-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-019-04653-z													WOS:000483626900017
J	Brown, RD				Brown, Ross D.			Analysis of snow cover variability and change in Quebec, 1948-2005	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES					66th Annual Eastern Snow Conference	JUN 09-11, 2009	Niagara on the Lake, CANADA					The spatial and temporal characteristics of annual maximum snow water equivalent (SWEmax) and fall and spring snow cover duration (SCD) were analysed over Quebec and adjacent area for snow seasons 1948/1949-2004/2005 using reconstructed daily snow depth and SWE. Snow cover variability in Quebec was found to be significantly correlated with most of the major atmospheric circulation patterns affecting the climate of eastern North America but the influence was characterized by strong multidecadal-scale variability. The strongest and most consistent relationship was observed between the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and fall SCD variability over western Quebec. El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was found to have a limited impact on Quebec snow cover. Evidence was found for a shift in circulation over the study region around 1980 associated with an abrupt increase in sea level pressure (SLP) and decreases in winter precipitation, snow depth and SWE over much of southern Quebec, as well as changes in the atmospheric patterns with significant links to snow cover variability. Trend analysis of the reconstructed snow cover over 1948-2005 provided evidence of a clear north-south gradient in SWEmax and spring SCD with significant local decreases over southern Quebec and significant local increases over north-central Quebec. The increase in SWEmax over northern Quebec is consistent with proxy data (lake levels, tree growth forms, permafrost temperatures), with hemispheric-wide trends of increasing precipitation over higher latitudes, and with projections of global climate models (GCMs).

J	Bellier, E; Engen, S; Jensen, TC				Bellier, Edwige; Engen, Steinar; Jensen, Thomas Correll			Seasonal diversity dynamics of a boreal zooplankton community under climate impact	OECOLOGIA												Seasonality and long-term environmental variability affect species diversity through their effects on the dynamics of species. To investigate such effects, we fitted a dynamic and heterogeneous species abundance model generating the lognormal species abundance distribution to an assemblage of freshwater zooplankton sampled five times a year (June-October) during the ice-free period over 28 years (1990-2017) in Lake Atnsjoen (Norway). By applying a multivariate stochastic community dynamics model for describing the fluctuations in abundances, we show that the community dynamics was driven by environmental variability in spring (i.e., June). In contrast, community-level ecological heterogeneity is highest in autumn. The autumn months (i.e., September and October) that rearranged the community are most likely crucial months to monitor long-term changes in community structure. Indeed, noises from early summer are filtered away, making it easier to track long-term changes. The community returned faster towards equilibrium when ecological heterogeneity was the highest (i.e., in September and October). This occurred because of stronger density-regulation in months with highest ecological heterogeneity. The community responded to the long-term warming of water temperature with decreasing species diversity and increasing abundance. Unevenness associated with variabilities in abundances might affect species interactions within the community. These can have consequences for the stability and functioning of the ecosystem.

Trophic connections in Lake Superior Part II: The nearshore fish community	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We use detailed diet analyses of the predominant planktivorous, benthivorous and piscivorous fish species from Lake Superior to create a nearshore (bathymetric depths <80 m) fish community food web. The food web was based on analysis of 5125 fish stomachs collected seasonally (spring, summer, fall) from 9 nearshore sites in 2005. Based on mass of prey items, nearshore diets across all sites and seasons were similarly structured with a dominance of macroinvertebrates (Mysis diluviana and Diporeia spp). Although the piscivorous fishes like lean lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) fed to a lesser extent on Diporeia and Mysis, they were still strongly connected to these macroinvertebrates, which were consumed by their primary prey species (sculpin spp., rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax, and coregonines). The addition of Bythotrephes to summer/fall cisco and lake whitefish diets, and the decrease in rainbow smelt in lean lake trout diets (replaced by coregonines) were the largest observed differences relative to historic Lake Superior diet studies. Although the offshore food web of Lake Superior was simpler than nearshore in terms of number of fish species present, the two areas had remarkably similar food web structures, and both fish communities were primarily supported by Mysis and Diporeia. We conclude that declines in Mysis or Diporeia populations would have a significant impact on energy flow in Lake Superior. The food web information we generated can be used to better identify management strategies for Lake Superior.

Phytobenthos and phytoplankton were sampled three times (spring, summer, and autumn) a year between 2017 and 2019. Samples of the phytoplankton were collected with a water sampler from three depths, and samples of diatoms were obtained as epiphytic in the littoral zone of the lakes. However, if macrophytes were absent, epilithic or epipelic diatoms were sampled in lakes. Also, samples of phytobenthos were preferred as epilithic in rivers. However, if stones were absent, epiphytic or epipelic diatoms were sampled. During the studied period, a total of 895 diatom taxa were determined as planktonic (378 taxa) and benthic (860 taxa) in lakes and rivers of 25 river basins of Turkiye, and a total of 39 new records were identified. The highest diatom taxa were determined in the Firat-Dicle, Konya, Antalya, and Buyuk Menderes basins with 11, 11, 10, and 6 taxa, respectively. On the other hand, new records were not detected in 10 basins.					; Coşkun, Tolga/L-7421-2018; ONGUN SEVİNDİK, Tuğba/JAN-7028-2023; SOMEK, HASIM/GLU-1583-2022; GÜZEL, UĞUR/IQU-0703-2023; Koca, Merve/JFJ-4015-2023; Maraşlıoğlu, Faruk/ABE-2510-2021; Sömek, Haşim/GLU-1583-2022; Demir, Nilsun/H-7762-2012; TUNCA, Hatice/GOP-3221-2022; ÖTERLER, Burak/F-2217-2017; COSKUN, Tolga/L-7421-2018; Solak, Cüneyt/AAK-9848-2020; Çelekli, Abuzer/P-9845-2015; Çetin, Tolga/HLP-9596-2023	Celekli, Abuzer/0000-0002-2448-4957; SOMEK, HASIM/0000-0003-4281-9738; OTERLER, BURAK/0000-0002-9064-1666; Demir, Nilsun/0000-0002-3895-7655; COSKUN, Tolga/0000-0001-5732-7424; Yilmaz, Elif/0000-0001-7939-1814; ONGUN SEVINDIK, Tugba/0000-0001-7682-0142														2619-9149					2023	26	5					991	1004		10.18016/ksutarimdoga.vi.1058856	http://dx.doi.org/10.18016/ksutarimdoga.vi.1058856													WOS:001153474800004
J	Li, Y; Yu, XT; Liu, H; Gong, ZL				Li, Yong; Yu, Xintao; Liu, Huan; Gong, Zhilian			The spatio-temporal distribution of alkaline phosphatase activity and phoD gene abundance and diversity in sediment of Sancha Lake	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The bacterial phoD gene encoding alkaline phosphatase (ALP) plays an important role in the release of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) from organic phosphorus in ecosystems. However, phoD gene diversity and abundance in ecosystems is poorly understood. In the present study, we sampled the surface sediments and the overlying water of Sancha Lake at 9 different sampling sites, a typical eutrophic sub-deep freshwater lake in China, in April 15 (spring) and November 3 (autumn), 2017. High-throughput sequencing and qPCR were performed to analyze the diversity and abundance of the bacterial phoD gene in the sediments. We further discussed the relationships between the diversity and abundance of the phoD gene and environmental factors and ALP activity. A total of 881,717 valid sequences were obtained from 18 samples and were classified into 41 genera, 31 families, 23 orders, 12 classes, and 9 phyla and grouped into 477 OTUs. The dominant phyla were Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. The phylogenetic tree based on the sequences of the phoD gene was plotted and composed of three branches. The genetic sequences were aligned predominantly with genera Pseudomonas, Streptomyces, Cupriavidus, and Paludisphaer. The phoD-harboring bacterial community structure showed a significant difference in spring and autumn, but no apparent spatial heterogeneity. The phoD gene abundances at different sampling points were significantly higher in autumn than in spring. In autumn and spring, the phoD gene abundance was significantly higher in the tail of lake and where cage culture used to be intensive. pH value, dissolved oxygen (DO), total organic carbon (TOC), ALP, and phosphorus were important environmental factors affecting the diversity of the phoD gene and the phoD-harboring bacterial community structure. Changes in phoD-harboring bacterial community structure, phoD gene abundance, and ALP activity were negatively correlated with SRP in overlying water. Our study indicated phoD-harboring bacteria in the sediments of Sancha Lake with the characteristics of high diversity and significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity in abundance and community structure, which played a important role in the release of SRP.																			2045-2322					FEB 22	2023	13	1							3121	10.1038/s41598-023-29983-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-29983-1								36813883					WOS:000973308600020

We collected 63 geese during the winter of 1989-1990 at Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge in Delaware, 158 geese in spring 1989 and 1990 at Lake Saint-Pierre and Cap-Saint-Ignace along the St. Lawrence River in southern Quebec, and 17 geese at the end of the 1990 migration on Bylot Island, N.W.T. In both sexes, protein reserves did not change in winter but fat declined from a peak in December to a low point in early March, just before spring migration. Geese collected 3 weeks later at Lake Saint-Pierre (800 km north) had considerably larger fat reserves (90% larger in females and 40% in males). Geese accumulated large fat reserves at both sites along the St. Lawrence River. Although geese staged for a shorter period at Lake Saint-Pierre (a recently used area), males stored as much fat as those staging at Cap-Saint-Ignace and females only slightly less. A small amount of protein was stored between late winter and the end of staging. Spring conditioning of geese along the St. Lawrence River seems to have improved over the past decade. We found weak evidence that larger females stored more fat. The cost of migrating from the St. Lawrence to Arctic nesting grounds (2900 km) is considerable, as half of the fat reserves accumulated in spring were used for the migration. There is no evidence of fat or protein storage between the St. Lawrence estuary and the Arctic nesting grounds.

Mussel squeeze: dissolved oxygen and temperature can "squeeze" zebra mussels out of invaded reservoirs	MANAGEMENT OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) are an aquatic invasive species that cause extensive economic and ecological impacts and are a management priority in areas outside of their native range. Survivorship and distribution of zebra mussels within a waterbody are thought to be influenced by temperature and dissolved oxygen conditions, but detailed information to confirm the importance of these environmental controls is necessary to inform management efforts. We measured planktonic zebra mussel veliger density and adult survivorship in San Justo Reservoir in central California to determine distribution and timing of spawning in relation to temperature and dissolved oxygen throughout winter, spring, and summer. We found seasonal patterns in adult survivorship, with high mortality late in the summer and higher than expected survivorship during the spring when dissolved oxygen concentrations were approximately 1 mg/L. Veliger abundance peaked several meters above the thermocline from June to August. Dissolved oxygen concentrations limited veliger distribution, with few to no veligers collected in the anoxic hypolimnion. Veliger settlement out of the water column appears to be possible in San Justo Reservoir at any time of year. A better understanding of how veligers, juveniles, and adult mussels respond to fluctuating dissolved oxygen and temperature conditions will further knowledge of timing and duration of water drawdowns or other control methods for managing this harmful invasive species.

We conducted WRF simulations for the TP over 2000-10, and the model showed excellent performance in simulating near-surface air temperature, precipitation, lake surface temperature, and lake-region precipitation when compared to observations. We carried out additional WRF simulations where all the TP lakes were replaced with the nearest land-use types. The differences between these two sets of simulations were analyzed to quantify the effects of the TP lakes on the local climate. Our results indicate that the strongest lake-induced cooling occurred during the spring daytime, while the most significant warming occurred during the fall nighttime. The cooling and warming effects of the lakes further inhibited precipitation during summer afternoons and evenings and motivated it during fall early mornings, respectively. This study lays a solid foundation for further exploration of the role of TP lakes in climate systems at different time scales.

Variation in particulate C:N:P stoichiometry across the Lake Erie watershed from tributaries to its outflow	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Human activities can cause large alterations in biogeochemical cycles of key nutrients such as carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). However, relatively little is known about how these changes alter the proportional fluxes of these elements across ecosystem boundaries from rivers to lakes. Here, we examined environmental factors influencing spatial and temporal variation in particulate C:N:P ratios across the Lake Erie watershed from its tributaries to its outflow. Throughout the study, particulate nutrient ratios ranged widely (C:N 2.0-25.8, C:P 32-530, N:P 3.7-122.9), but mean values were generally lower than previous estimates from different aquatic environments. Particulate C:N ratios varied the least across all environments, but C:P and N:P ratios increased between tributaries and coastal areas and throughout the growing season in coastal environments. These ratios also differed temporally in offshore waters as particulate C:P and N:P were higher in the spring and summer and lower in the fall and winter. Particulate C:P ratios also increased between the western/central and eastern basins indicating differential nutrient processing across the lake. These stoichiometric changes were associated with unique environmental factors among ecosystems as tributary stoichiometry was related to terrestrial land use and land cover, coastal ratios were a product of mixing between riverine and offshore waters, and offshore patterns were influenced by differences in temperature and particulate nutrient loading among basins. Overall, by studying changes in particulate C:N:P ratios across the Lake Erie watershed, our study demonstrates the power of using mass balance principles to study nutrient transformations along the aquatic continuum.

J	Phelps, AR; Peterson, KM; Jeffries, MO				Phelps, AR; Peterson, KM; Jeffries, MO			Methane efflux from high-latitude lakes during spring ice melt	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Ice cores removed from shallow ice-covered tundra lakes near Barrow, Alaska, and taiga lakes near Anchorage, Alaska, exhibit increasing concentrations of methane with depth. Methane concentrations in the ice cores increased from 0 mu M in the top 15 cm sections to a maximum of 23 mu M in the lowest 15 cm sections of tundra lake ice and to a maximum of 147 mu M in taiga lake ice. Methane concentrations in the water beneath the ice reflect a similar pattern, with values near 5 mu M early in the ice-covered season, increasing up to 42 mu M in the tundra lakes, and up to 730 mu M in the taiga lakes. Methane levels increase in the water beneath the ice during the course of the winter due to decreasing water volume, exclusion from growing ice, and continued methane production in thawed sediments. Since the ice layer prohibits gas exchange with the atmosphere, the methane is not oxidized, as it would be during the summer months, allowing the winter accumulation and storage of methane in the ice and lake waters. Efflux measurements, taken with floating chambers on the taiga lakes, indicated a large pulse of methane released during the period of ice melt and spring turnover. The efflux from one lake ranged from 2.07 g CH4 m(-2) in 1995 to 1.49 g CH4 m(-2) in 1996 for the 10 day period immediately after ice melt. Estimation of methane efflux using a boundary layer diffusion model and surface water concentrations during the entire ice-free period in 1996 predicted an efflux of 1.79 g CH4 m(-2) during the same 10 day period, compared with 2.28 g CH4 m(-2) for the remainder of the summer season. This observation suggests that almost as much methane efflux can occur during a brief period immediately after ice melt as occurs during the remainder of the ice-free season. Since measurements of methane efflux from high-latitude-lakes are generally made after this breakup period, the overall contribution to atmospheric methane from high-latitude lakes may be twice that of current estimates.																			2169-897X	2169-8996				NOV 27	1998	103	D22					29029	29036		10.1029/98JD00044	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/98JD00044													WOS:000077196200036

Here, we perform detailed analysis of LCAs and long-chain alkenoates in sediment cores from Lake Daihai in north China. During the late Holocene, alkenoneinferred temperatures and the Group 2i species abundance indicate a long-term warming trend in cold seasons (winter and early spring), possibly driven by regional insolation and by atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Notably, our records indicate cold climate conditions during the period of 4.3-3.0 cal ka BP, possibly linked to the abrupt expansion of Arctic winter sea ice in a given of low insolation and atmospheric CO2 concentration conditions. The abrupt cooling may have led to the collapse of the East Aian Summer Monsoon (EASM) and the deterioration of the ecosystems in northern China during the middle to late Holocene transition, and thus likely accounted for the nearly synchronous Chinese Neolithic cultural collapses.

With Landsat 5/7/8 images and Google Earth Engine (GEE), an improved threshold-based water extraction algorithm and a novel surface water gaps (SWGs) interpolation method based on historical water frequency were applied to build surface water area (SWA, namely SWE without ice) and water body area (WBA. namely SWE with ice) monthly (January 2001-December 2019) and annual (1986-2019) time series in the upper reaches of the Yellow River (UYR). The Mann-Kendall test was used to analyse SWE trends, and the ridge regression was performed to figure out the relative contributions of meteorological factors to SWE dynamics. The pixels with modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) higher than normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) or enhanced vegetation index (EVI) were identified as SWE. The mean relative error (MRE) of the SWGs interpolation results was below 10%. At the annual scale, the average SWA and number of lakes over 1 ha showed significant upward trends of 4.4 km(2) yr(-1) and 7.53 yr(-1), respectively. The monthly WBA increased in summer and autumn while decreased in spring and winter. The maximum freezing and thawing ratios were 53.74% in December and 37.32% in May, respectively. Attribution analysis showed that precipitation and wind speed were the foremost factors dominating the dynamics of annual SWA and monthly WBA, respectively. Our findings confirmed that climatic changes have altered the dynamics of water bodies in the UYR. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Increased winter drownings in ice-covered regions with warmer winters	PLOS ONE												Winter activities on ice are culturally important for many countries, yet they constitute a high safety risk depending upon the stability of the ice. Because consistently cold periods are required to form stable and thick ice, warmer winters could degrade ice conditions and increase the likelihood of falling through the ice. This study provides the first large-scale assessment of winter drowning from 10 Northern Hemisphere countries. We documented over 4000 winter drowning events. Winter drownings increased exponentially in regions with warmer winters when air temperatures neared 0 degrees C. The largest number of drownings occurred when winter air temperatures were between -5 degrees C and 0 degrees C, when ice is less stable, and also in regions where indigenous traditions and livelihood require extended time on ice. Rates of drowning were greatest late in the winter season when ice stability declines. Children and adults up to the age of 39 were at the highest risk of winter drownings. Beyond temperature, differences in cultures, regulations, and human behaviours can be important additional risk factors.

We investigated levels of Al, Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn and Cr elements in muscle, liver and brain of C. gariepinus in different seasons. The fishes used in experiment was obtained in Ceyhan river basin where is situated the south of Turkey. This study was divided as winter group (n=4, female fish) and summer group (n=4, female fish). The organs used in experiment that include muscle, liver and brain tissues were incised. These organs were extracted and were analyzed by AAS (Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometer) for determination of elements. The accumulation of Al element in summer is lower than winter in muscle tissue, but it is higher in the brain (p<0.05). The accumulation of Mn element in summer is higher than winter in brain tissue (p<0.05). The accumulation of Fe element in summer is lower than winter in only muscle tissue (p<0.05). However, the accumulation of Cr element wasn't evaluated statistically due to below the detection limit. According to obtained results from evidences, accumulation of determined trace elements in various tissues were determined statistically differentness as seasonal. As a result, we suggest that trace element levels may be changed in C. gariepinus tissues because of the change of its habitat conditions.

To study the impact of the meltwater discharge on the microbial community of the downstream fjord, we targeted Bacteria, Archaea and Fungi communities during austral autumn and winter. Our results showed a singular microbial community present in cold and low salinity surface waters during autumn, when a thicker meltwater layer was observed. Meltwater bacterial sequences were related to Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteriodetes previously identified in freshwater and cold ecosystems, suggesting the occurrence of microorganisms adapted to live in the extreme conditions of meltwater. For Fungi, representative sequences related to terrestrial and airborne fungal taxa indicated transport of allochthonous Fungi by the meltwater discharge. In contrast, bottom fjord waters from autumn and winter showed representative Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) related to sequences of marine microorganisms, which is consistent with current models of fjord circulation. We conclude that meltwater can significantly modify the structure of microbial communities and support the development of a major fraction of microorganisms in surface waters of Patagonian fjords.

In this study, SIA of C and N was used to investigate the trophic behavior of fish species in a small Mediterranean reservoir, Lake Sos Canales (SC) in Sardinia, Italy, during an annual hydrological cycle. Fish were caught approximately every two months, and baseline isotopic C and N levels in the pelagic and littoral area were analyzed to establish the origin of fish food sources, considering suspended particulate matter, planktonic crustaceans and littoral macroinvertebrates. To assess the relative contribution of the two different sources using SIA, a Dynamic Baseline Mixing Model (DBMM) was applied and the results were compared with the fish gut contents. Our aim was to chart the seasonal trophic behavior of the fish species inhabiting an anthropogenic aquatic environment under considerable stress due to water level fluctuations. Isotopic results showed a seasonal trend with C-13 levels depleted more in autumn-winter and less in spring-summer, while an inverse trend was recorded for N-15, both in the isotopic baseline values and in the fish. Isotopic results and gut content analysis highlighted a year-round strict dependence on littoral food sources only for the brown trout, whereas the mosquitofish changed their trophic behavior seasonally, shifting from littoral (high water level period) to pelagic (low water level period) food sources, mirroring the hydrological conditions of Lake SC.

Spatial distributions of airborne di-carbonyls in urban and rural areas in China	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												Gaseous glyoxal and methylglyoxal concentrations were characterized in nine cities of China during 2010-2011. The average summer (winter) glyoxal and methylglyoxal concentrations were 36.4-178.4 (12.3-241.4) and 67.8-359.4 (28.4-530.0) ng/m(3), respectively. In summer, the highest average glyoxal concentration was in Guangzhou (GZ), while the lowest was in Shanghai (SH). In winter, Xiamen (XM) showed the highest average methylglyoxal concentration and Yantai (YT) reported the lowest. Both di-carbonyls showed distinct seasonal variations. The maximum average methylglyoxal concentration was approximately twice as much as glyoxal, which is consistent with the results of other studies. Glyoxal-to-methylglyoxal ratios showed that there was a consistent direct source of emissions in remote areas such as Qinghai Lake and Lhasa in both seasons (r >= 0.9). Pearson's correlation analysis suggested possible similar sources formation (R >= 0.7) for the two di-carbonyls in winter. Multiple linear regression analyses demonstrated that every 1 degrees C temperature increase could lead to a > 2% increase in the concentration of the di-carbonyls in both seasons. There was a greater percentage gain for glyoxal in winter than in summer for the same temperature increase. The northeast monsoon occurs in winter, and for every 1 ms(-1) increase in wind speed, >20% of the di-carbonyls can be transferred out of China. This study is useful to understand about the secondary organic aerosol formation in the areas, the statistical analysis can provide information about the relationships between these carbonyls in atmosphere.

J	CROME, FHJ; CARPENTER, SM				CROME, FHJ; CARPENTER, SM			PLANKTON COMMUNITY CYCLING AND RECOVERY AFTER DROUGHT - DYNAMICS IN A BASIN ON A FLOOD-PLAIN	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lake Merrimajeel, a shallow swamp, is part of the Murray-Darling [Australia], a flood plain river system with high plankton diversity. It fluctuates drastically in water level and often dries out. The dynamics and seasonality of zooplankton in the face of these fluctuations and the effects of a total drawdown and refilling were monitored between February 1977 and January 1980. During this period thirty species of rotifers, thirty four of microcrustacea and several other species were recorded. Despite erratic fluctuations in water level, temperature and turbidity a community cycle from dominance by rotifers in summer/autumn and crustacea in winter/spring was maintained. The drawdown disturbed this cycle but it was reestablished the following year. Diversity and density reached a maximum just before the drawdown, during hot, turbid conditions. During this drying phase the waters remained relatively fresh and well oxygenated. ''Phyllopods'' were not recorded. The recovery phase was characterised by a group of rare species. It is postulated that these rare, colonising or successional species are dependent on a brief flush of rich organic material produced on flooding. The generally depressive effect of increased turbidity does not hold in this lake and many limnetic species were abundant during periods of high turbidity. It is suggested that turbidity may be tolerated or even be advantageous to some species, depending on the nature of the suspended material. The ability of species to lead a fugitive existence by temporarily colonizing basins after drawdowns and refilling may be an important factor in producing the high diversity of plankton in flood plain river systems such as the Murray-Darling.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL 29	1988	164	3					193	211		10.1007/BF00005940	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00005940													WOS:A1988P543700001

Habitat preferences and movement of adult yellowfishes in the Vaal River, South Africa	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												The yellowfishes of the Vaal River (Labeobarbus kimberleyensis and L. aeneus) are charismatic, socially and economically important fishes, but very little is known about their interspecies habitat preferences and movement. This study is the first behavioural study of yellowfish in the Vaal River using radio transmitters to characterise habitat preferences and movement patterns. A total of 22 adult L. kimberleyensis and 13 adult L. aeneus individuals were tracked for between 1 month and 1 year from 23 September 2006 to 16 May 2010. Radio telemetry revealed that yellowfish established routine daily behavioural patterns through which the habitat preferences and movement of the species could be established. Home ranges of the yellowfish ranged from 1 km to more than 12 km in the Vaal River depending on the species and habitat availability. Habitat preferences varied between species and included deep slow-flowing habitats with associated cover features particularly in winter for L. kimberleyensis and shallow fast-flowing habitats particularly for L. aeneus in spring, summer and autumn. Changes in flows, habitat availability and atmospheric pressure affected the movement of yellowfish. The biology and ecology of the yellowfish in the Vaal River is noticeably more complicated and dynamic than previously documented. We recommend that the behavioural ecology of these and other yellowfish populations in the Vaal River should continue to be characterised, and the use of the movement of yellowfish be developed as an indicator of ecosystem change.

Thermal stratification occurred in the reservoir from May to September. The maximum chlorophyll-a concentrations were measured (using a YSI multi probe) in the fall and the minimum concentrations were recorded in the winter. Differences in the concentrations of chl-a, SRP and NO3-N were significant among seasons (p<0.01), but not among sampling stations (p>0.01). The differences in the Secchi disk transparency were significant both among sampling stations and seasons (p<0.05). The results of this study suggest that high chl-a concentrations resulted from the increase in available light in the spring and deep mixing in the fall which provided nutrients needed for phytoplankton growth.

J	Stout, JE				Stout, JE			Seasonal variations of saltation activity on a high plains saline playa: Yellow Lake, Texas	PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												The Southern High Plains region of West Texas and eastern New Mexico is often described as a flat elevated tableland. Spaced across this vast and otherwise featureless plain are 21 large closed basins containing approximately 40 irregularly shaped saline playas. Yellow Lake, located on the Yellow House Ranch northwest of Lubbock, Texas, is among the largest of the High Plains saline playas. This paper represents the first report of a 4-yr. study of saltation activity at Yellow Lake. From December 30, 1998, to January 1, 2003, a fast-response piezoelectric saltation sensor was used to collect a continuous record of aeolian activity at a point on the playa surface. Since saltation activity is often associated with dust emissions, the saltation record also provides information regarding seasonal patterns of dust emissions from the Yellow House Basin. Results suggest that blowing events can occur at any time of the year when conditions are favorable; however, the necessary conditions are rarely satisfied. As a result, the saltation record is characterized by many hours of inactivity punctuated with brief periods of occasionally intense aeolian activity. From December 30, 1998, to January 1, 2003, saltation activity was detected for only 7% of the hours measured. Although there can be substantial deviations from one year to the next, it was found that saltation activity tends to peak during winter months when winds are moderately strong and precipitation is at a minimum. Hourly saltation activity values occasionally approached unity during intense winter blowing events, indicating nearly continuous sediment transport over a one-hour period. Saltation activity is at a minimum during summer months when winds are often weak and wet conditions prevail. Although winds are typically strongest during the spring season, the playa is relatively stable due to high threshold values produced by significant spring precipitation. This contrasts sharply with the surrounding cropland, which tends to be most active during the spring season.

However, the seagrass ecosystem is currently facing degradation, necessitating effective monitoring. Satellite remote sensing observations offer distinct advantages in spatial coverage and temporal frequency. In this study, we focused on a marine lagoon (Swan Lake), located in the Shandong Peninsula of China which is characterized by a large and typical seagrass population. We conducted an analysis of remote sensing reflectance of seagrass and other objectives using a comprehensive Landsat satellite dataset spanning from 2002 to 2022. Subsequently, we constructed Seagrass Index I (SSI-I) and Seagrass Index II (SSI-II), and used them to develop a stepwise model for seagrass detection from Landsat images. Validation was performed using in situ acoustic survey data and visual interpretation, revealing the good performance of our model with an overall accuracy exceeding 0.90 anda kappa coefficient around 0.80. The long-term analysis (2002-2022) of the seagrass distribution area in Swan Lake, generated from Landsat data using our model, indicated that the central area of Swan Lake sustains seagrass for the longest duration. Seagrass in Swan Lake exhibits a regular seasonal variation, including seeding in early spring, growth in spring-summer, maturation in the middle of summer, and shrinkage in autumn. Furthermore, we observed an overall decreasing trend in the seagrass area over the past 20 years, while occasional periods of seagrass restoration were also observed. These findings provide crucial information for seagrass protection, marine blue carbon studies, and related endeavors in Swan Lake. Moreover, our study offers a valuable alternative approach that can be implemented for seagrass monitor ing using satellite observations in other coastal regions.																			1094-4087					AUG 14	2023	31	17					27677	27695		10.1364/OE.498901	http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/OE.498901								37710838					WOS:001108916100004

These cyanobacteria, capable of regulating their vertical position, often flourish at the thermocline to form a deep chlorophyll maximum. In Lake Zurich (Switzerland), they accumulate during stratified season (May-October) as a persistent metalimnetic thin layer (similar to 2 m wide). This study investigated the role of turbulent mixing in springtime layer formation, its persistence over the summer, and its breakdown in autumn. We characterised seasonal variation of turbulence in Lake Zurich with four surveys conducted in April, July and October of 2018 and September of 2019. Surveys included microstructure profiles and high-resolution mooring measurements. In July and October, the thin layer occurred within a strong thermocline (N greater than or similar to 0.05 s(-1)) and withstood significant turbulence, observed as turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates (epsilon approximate to 10(-8) W kg(-1)). Vertical turbulent overturns -monitored by the Thorpe scale- went mostly undetected and on average fell below those estimated by the Ozmidov scale (L-O approximate to 1 cm). Consistently, vertical diffusivity was close to molecular values, indicating negligible turbulent fluxes. This reduced metalimnetic mixing explains the persistence of the thin layer, which disappears with the deepening of the surface mixed layer in autumn. Bi-weekly temperature profiles in 2018 and a nighttime microstructure sampling in September 2019 showed that nighttime convection serves as the main mechanism driving the breakdown of the cyanobacterial layer in autumn. These results highlight the importance of light winds and convective mixing in the seasonal cycling of P. rubescens communities within a strongly stratified medium-sized lake.

We investigated phytoplankton communities in the upper (0-20 m) and lower (30-35 m) layer of oligotrophic Lake Tovel, Brenta Dolomites (Italy) over 6 years during summer and under ice. Winter conditions were different from one year to another with respect to ice thickness and snow cover. Proxies for light transmission (Secchi disc transparency, light attenuation) were similar between seasons, even though the incident solar radiation was lower in winter. Algal richness and chlorophyll-a were not different between seasons while biomass was higher during summer. In four of the 6 years, Bacillariophyta dominated during summer and Miozoa (class Dinophyceae) under ice while in 2 years Bacillariophyta also dominated under ice. Generally, a shift to larger size classes from summer to under ice was observed for Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta, and Ochrophyta (class Chrysophyceae) while Dinophyceae showed the opposite pattern. No strong links between phytoplankton community composition and abiotic factors (under-ice convective mixing, snow on ice, under-ice light) were found. We suggest that inter-species relationships and more precise indicators of under-ice light should be considered to better understand under-ice processes.

We assessed the fat mass of neck-banded geese by observing their abdominal profiles. In spring, the variation in departure dates among individuals was smaller than that in arrival dates, and there was a positive correlation between arrival dates and departure dates in the fall. The factors affecting decision-making relating to the timing of departure are assumed to be the time constraints of migration before breeding in the spring and on the duration of stay in the fall. The spring fat increase in females was larger than in the fall, and had a tendency to be larger than in males in the spring. The seasonal and sexual difference in fat mass increase seems to be explained by the requirement of fat for breeding after departing from the stopover site. This study supports the possibility that migratory birds adjust their fat mass and the timing of departure at stopover sites according to seasonal differences in events occurring after migration, such as breeding.					; Moriguchi, Sachiko/M-1117-2019; Amano, Tatsuya/E-7367-2010	Moriguchi, Sachiko/0000-0002-2389-6722; Amano, Tatsuya/0000-0001-6576-3410													1347-0558					JUN	2010	9	1					75	82		10.2326/osj.9.75	http://dx.doi.org/10.2326/osj.9.75													WOS:000282418500008
J	Derbalah, ASH; Nakatani, N; Sakugawa, H				Derbalah, ASH; Nakatani, N; Sakugawa, H			Distribution, seasonal pattern, flux and contamination source of pesticides and nonylphenol residues in Kurose River water, Higashi-Hiroshima, Japan	GEOCHEMICAL JOURNAL												Distributions, seasonal variation, flux and contamination source of pesticides and nonylphenol were examined during the period from April 2001 to January 2002 at 5 sites (Namitakiji, Tokumasa-Kami, Izumi, Ochiai and Hinotsume) in Kurose River water, Higashi-Hiroshima, Japan. Water samples were collected monthly and subjected to solid phase extraction followed by GC-MS analysis. Nineteen pesticide compounds were detected and isoprothiolane (37 ng/l), fenitrothion (35) and iprodione (34) showed the highest mean concentrations (as 5 site averages), while pencycuron (5), diazinon (6), tolclofos-methyl (7) and dithiopyr (8) were the compounds of lowest mean concentrations. Nonylphenol, which is a degradation product of a nonylphenolpolyethoxylates that are used in a wide range of industrial and household products, had an average concentration of 305 ng/l. At each of the five sites, its concentration was greater than individual pesticides. The concentration levels of pesticides and nonylphenol were highest at Izumi (the downtown site of Higashi-Hiroshima) and were lowest at Namitakiji and Tokumasa-Kami (upstream sites). Concentrations and fluxes of both compounds tended to be higher during spring to summer and low during fall to winter at most of the sites. The total pesticides concentration was poorly correlated with nonylphenol concentration. A statistical analysis of water quality data suggested that their main sources appear to be different such as agricultural activity for pesticides and waste water discharge for nonylphenol.					; Derbalah, Aly/CAE-4331-2022	Sakugawa, Hiroshi/0000-0002-1903-3078; Derbalah, Aly/0000-0001-9709-0337													0016-7002	1880-5973					2003	37	2					217	232		10.2343/geochemj.37.217	http://dx.doi.org/10.2343/geochemj.37.217													WOS:000182422700005

The dual isotopic approach was employed to determine the sources of nitrate. Thirty-five and thirty-one water samples were collected in summer and winter, respectively. The concentrations of nitrate in the surface waters and lake waters were lower in summer than that in winter, due to the dilution of the wet deposition in summer. The concentrations of nitrate in the western part of the Chaohu Lake are higher than that in the eastern part, due to the inflow river discharge. The delta N-15 values of nitrate in winter are higher than that in summer, which is consistent with the seasonal variation of nitrate. The primary nitrate sources in northwestern part of the Chaohu Lake are the input of soil organic nitrogen and sewage/manure effluents, while the soil organic nitrogen is the main source in the southwestern and eastern part of the Chaohu Lake. Meanwhile, the data concerning delta O-18-NO3 (-) values in this study indicate that the nitrification process is one important source for the variability of nitrate in Chaohu Lake. This study can provide useful scientific guidance for the remediation and management of Chaohu Lake.

J	Kirillin, G; Shatwell, T; Kasprzak, P				Kirillin, Georgiy; Shatwell, Tom; Kasprzak, Peter			Consequences of thermal pollution from a nuclear plant on lake temperature and mixing regime	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												We investigated the combined effects of thermal pollution from a nuclear power plant (NPP) and regional climate warming on the thermal regime of a lake. For this purpose, we used the lake model FLake and analyzed 50 years of temperature data from Lake Stechlin, Germany, which served as the cooling water reservoir for the Rheinsberg NPP from 1966 until 1990. Both modeling and statistical data analysis revealed a strong influence of the NPP cooling water discharge on the lake water temperatures and the vertical stability of the water column. A remarkable effect of thermal pollution consisted of strong vertical mixing in winter produced by the discharge of warm water into the lake when ambient water temperatures were below 4 degrees C. This effect caused a significant increase in the deep hypolimnion temperatures and a corresponding decrease of the vertical stability in the summer. In turn, climate warming had the opposite effect on the summer stability by increasing lake surface temperatures. Both the thermal pollution and climate change increased the duration of the summer stratification period. Our results suggest that industrial thermal pollution in temperate lakes during winter is stored in the deep water column until the next winter, whereas heat added in the summer dissipates relatively rapidly into the atmosphere. Accordingly, the winter thermal pollution could have a long-lasting effect on the lake ecology by affecting benthic biogeochemical processes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Pollution and environmental factors influence the reproductive effort of these bivalves. Therefore, the evaluation of the gametogenic cycle is important for understanding environmentally-related physiological alterations in this dioecious species. Animals from an unpolluted reference site close to the highly polluted Seine River, France, were monitored monthly over 1 year using qualitative and quantitative measures of gametogenesis. Developmental stages of the gonad were determined by visual inspection of histological slides. Unbiased quantitative stereological analysis was conducted to estimate oocyte development and the gonad index was determined. To investigate a possible role of female sex steroids in bivalve gametogenesis as a possible target for xenoestrogens, free oestradiol levels were assessed and analysed with respect to oocyte development. The basic pattern of the reproductive cycle consisted of early gametogenesis during autumn and winter, followed by rapid vitellogenesis in early spring, and spawning towards the summer months. However, the population was characterized by high inter-individual variability of the gonad stages. Furthermore, the simultaneous occurrence of different developmental stages within the same animal made classification difficult. Stereological determination of oocyte volumes as well as gonadosomatic index provided a more precise evaluation of reproductive effort. Oestradiol levels did vary significantly between months, but did not show any clear relationship with a particular stage of gametogenesis or oocyte volume.

Here, we compare snowfall observations and bias adjusted snowfall to end-of-winter snow accumulation measurements on the ground for 16 years (1999-2014) and assess the implication of precipitation underestimation on the water balance for a low-gradient tundra wetland near Utqiagvik (formerly Barrow), Alaska (2007-2009). In agreement with other studies, and not accounting for sublimation, conventional snowfall gauges captured 23-56% of end-of-winter snow accumulation. Once snowfall and rainfall are bias adjusted, long-term annual precipitation estimates more than double (from 123 to 274 mm), highlighting the risk of studies using conventional or unadjusted precipitation that dramatically under-represent water balance components. Applying conventional precipitation information to the water balance analysis produced consistent storage deficits (79 to 152 mm) that were all larger than the largest actual deficit (75 mm), which was observed in the unusually low rainfall summer of 2007. Year-to-year variability in adjusted rainfall (33 mm) was larger than evapotranspiration (13 mm). Measured interannual variability in partitioning of snow into runoff (29% in 2008 to 68% in 2009) in years with similar end-of-winter snow accumulation (180 and 164 mm, respectively) highlights the importance of the previous summer's rainfall (25 and 60 mm, respectively) on spring runoff production. Incorrect representation of precipitation can therefore have major implications for Arctic water budget descriptions that in turn can alter estimates of carbon and energy fluxes. Plain Language Summary Measuring precipitation is difficult in the Arctic because the region is a windy, cold desert. Most rainfall and snowfall occur in amounts that are often too small to be effectively measured, with a majority of the precipitation falling as snow. Measurement gauges perform poorly in this windy environment with undercatch reaching 400 % for solid precipitation (snow), but performing better for liquid precipitation. Still, engineering and research studies that rely on precipitation measurements, rarely account for this underestimation of water received by the landscape. Too low rainfall and snowfall leads to underestimates of both streamflow and water storage in soils and surface water bodies. This, in turn, can lead to erroneous conclusions in regards to permafrost thaw and greenhouse gas emissions, which is partly how the Arctic plays a major role in affecting the global climate. A simple measurement of the maximum snow depth on the ground at the end of the winter, which anyone can do with a ruler, can be an effective solution to reduce the precipitation underestimation problem and its cascading effects on a myriad of other processes.

On the ecology and host relationships of Acanthogyrus (Acanthosentis) tilapiae (Acanthocephala: Quadrigyridae) from Cichlids in Lake Malawi	COMPARATIVE PARASITOLOGY												About 2,000 specimens of the quadrigyrid acanthocephalan Acanthogyrus (Acanthosentis) tilapine (Baylis, 1948) were collected from 9 species of cichlid fish hosts (Cichlidae: Pereiformes) in 7 different sites in Lake Malawi, Africa, during September 2005. New host records are noted in 5 species. Labeotrapheus trewavasae (Fryer), Melanochromis vermivorus (Trewavas), Nimbochronis polystigma (Regan), Tropheops microstoma (Trewavas), and Rhamphochromis sp. (Regan). High prevalence of A. tilapiae was observed in all host species analyzed. The parasite manages to infect its cichlid hosts, despite their distinct trophic specializations. Nevertheless, significant variation in parasite load was detected between sympatrically occuring rock-dwelling (mbuna) cichlids, with Pseudotropheus zehra (Boulenger) showing the most heavy infections. In addition, significant variation in parasite burden was detected between sampling locations, but host gender and weight did not explain significant variation in the numbers of A. tilapiae individuals. Differential exposure to parasites and host susceptibility may explain the marked variation in parasite abundance among cichlid hosts. Worms appear to be recruited in the summer, develop and mature through the winter and reproduce sexually in late winter and spring.					; van Oosterhout, Cock/A-6672-2008; Cable, Joanne/A-4360-2010	van Oosterhout, Cock/0000-0002-5653-738X; Cable, Joanne/0000-0002-8510-7055													1525-2647					JUL	2008	75	2					278	282		10.1654/4321.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1654/4321.1													WOS:000258733700012
J	Pratt, TC; Fox, MG				Pratt, TC; Fox, MG			Contribution and relative survival of age-0 walleyes stocked at two sizes in six eastern Ontario lakes	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Size at stocking is believed to be a critical factor in determining the success of stocking events for many species. We examined the relative performance of summer (reared extensively, planted in June, average weight < 1 g) and fall (reared intensively, planted in September, average weight similar to 10 g) walleye Stizostedion vitreum fingerlings stocked at a 5:1 summer-to-fall fingerling ratio into six small lakes in Eastern Ontario. One lake was stocked concurrently during 1990-1993, and three lakes were given paired plants in 1992 and 1993; stocking assessments occurred at age I and as adults in 1997. Two additional lakes were stocked in 1998; in one the stocking failed, and in the other the stocking was assessed at age 1. Walleyes planted as summer fingerlings were significantly larger at first annulus formation than those planted as fall fingerlings, but these size differences disappeared in the adult fish recovered 4-7 years after the paired plants. By the time the fish were adults, summer fingerlings were more abundant in the samples of all four lakes assessed to that stage. After accounting for the difference in stocking ratios, the relative survival to adulthood did not differ between the two fingerling types, except in Warrens Lake where summer fingerlings had a greater probability of survival. Given the relatively high cost of raising walleyes to the fall fingerling stage, we recommend that summer fingerlings be used when stocking walleyes into small, inland lakes.

J	Roberts, ME; Burr, BM; Whiles, MR; Santucci, VJ Jr				Roberts, ME; Burr, BM; Whiles, MR; Santucci, VJ Jr			Reproductive ecology and food habits of the blacknose shiner, Notropis heterolepis, in northern Illinois	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Although once broadly distributed in the region, the blacknose shiner, Notropis heterolepis, has declined or has already been extirpated throughout much of the Midwest and little is known about its life history. We describe characteristics of reproductive biology and food habits for a lake population of N. heterolepis in northern Illinois to provide information for conservation and management. Gonado-somatic index scores and ovarian stage of female individuals indicated that multiple clutches of ova were produced over a prolonged period lasting from spring until mid-summer. The number of ova present in a clutch was positively related to standard length. However, this relationship weakened and less ova were present in clutches of larger individuals as the reproductive season progressed. Female individuals >= 34 mm SL were mature and the presence of tubercles on male pectoral fins suggested a similar size at maturity for males. Individuals consumed the greatest number of prey items during morning and night-time periods and consumption was less in summer and fall compared to spring. Cladocerans (Chydoridae and Bosminidae) and ostracods were principal diet contributors. Chydorid cladocerans, which are known to associate with aquatic vegetation, were increasingly selected for when ambient densities of all three principal diet contributors were relatively low. Our results indicate that N. heterolepis utilizes a reproductive strategy that should allow resilience to short term, minor disturbances, but they are likely vulnerable to chronic disturbances. In particular, chronic disturbances that reduce or eliminate aquatic vegetation, an important foraging habitat and nursery habitat, will likely have negative impacts on remaining populations.																			0003-0031	1938-4238				JAN	2006	155	1					70	83		10.1674/0003-0031(2006)155[0070:REAFHO]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1674/0003-0031(2006)155[0070:REAFHO]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000234902500007
J	Hu, LM; Hu, WP; Zhai, SH; Wu, HY				Hu, Liuming; Hu, Weiping; Zhai, Shuhua; Wu, Haoyun			Effects on water quality following water transfer in Lake Taihu, China	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												To improve lake water quality, two experimental water transfers were conducted in winter-spring 2002 and summer-fall 2003 in Lake Taihu, a large shallow lake in China. Both observed data and estimated nutrient concentration with the elimination of effect from natural factors were used in this research to assess the spatial and temporal variations of water quality improvement induced by the two transfers. Clear improvement of water quality associated with deduction of TN, TP, and chlorophyll a (Chl-a)concentration was observed in many areas of the lake during the two water transfers. The over all reduction in TP concentration was notable in Southwest Zone, Centre Zone, and Dongtaihu Bay during the 2002 transfer, and was more pronounced in Meiliang Bay and Southwest Zone during the 2003 transfer period. However, the reduction in TN and Chl-a concentration was relatively weak. Results indicate a less impressive improvement of water quality from water transfer in large lakes than in small ones as the effectiveness of water transfer in large lakes is generally limited by large size, complex boundaries, and the difficulty of finding proper water source to be transferred. The comparison of observed and estimated water transfer effectiveness suggests a greater improvement of water quality derived from water transfer than appeared from the observation.

Lysimetric waters (soil waters) of background territories in different seasons are considered. Features of the change in molecular weights, elemental composition, and zeta potential of organic matter during fractionation from 8 mu m to 100 kDa were found. The number of labile and non-labile speciation of some elements obtained by membrane filtration and ion-exchange separation methods were found and compared. The highest molecular weights of organic substances were found in summer samples of lysimetric waters (more than 100 kDa) with a predominance of the aromatic component in the IR spectra of the samples. Several maxima were also found in the molecular weight distribution, including the increase in autochthonous organic substances. The most stable negative zeta potential, as a stabilized colloid matter, are represented in summer (near -26 mV) and in autumn (near -22 mV) lysimetric water. A slight increase in metal ions bound into organic complexes is typical for summer and autumn samples.

J	Henderson, BA; Wong, JL; Nepszy, SJ				Henderson, BA; Wong, JL; Nepszy, SJ			Reproduction of walleye in Lake Erie: Allocation of energy	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												An energetics mechanism is proposed to explain the trade-off between current and future reproduction. Surplus energy can be used for reproductive tissue (current reproduction) or somatic tissue (needed for future reproduction); therefore, we needed to determine first, when does growth of somatic and reproductive tissues occur, and second, how and when is energy allocated to reproduction. Walleye were sampled monthly from the commercial fishery in Lake Erie. Morphological attributes were recorded from these walleye, as well as the lipid composition of a smaller subsample. Energy for reproduction is acquired in the winter, spring, and summer before spawning and stored as visceral lipids. Ovarian lipids are largely derived from visceral fat deposits; thus, females appear to be capital breeders. Females elaborate gonadal tissue only if there is sufficient visceral fat. The circannual endocrine switch to reproduction may occur in midsummer (August) and in October. Females may discontinue ovarian development during the early winter if there is insufficient surplus energy (visceral fat). Year-class variation may be partly explained by the energy condition of the females and the proportion of the stock able to spawn successfully each year.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JAN	1996	53	1					127	133		10.1139/cjfas-53-1-127	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-53-1-127													WOS:A1996UB97900013

Effects of macrophytes and environmental factors on sediment denitrification in a subtropical reservoir	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Sediment denitrification plays an important role in nitrogen removal in aquatic systems. However, the importance in nitrogen removal in reservoirs, with a focus on seasonal differences of conditions such as macrophyte beds and environmental factors, is less well understood. This study examined sediment denitrification rate (D-n), and their potential controlling factors were determined in both macrophyte beds and deeper waters in the subtropical reservoir. The mean D-n in the reservoir annually was 18.0 +/- 6.3 (mean +/- S.E.) mmol N m(-2) d(-1), with significant seasonal variation (p < 0.01), i.e. 43.2 +/- 12.8, 6.7 +/- 6.3, and 4.0 +/- 2.2 mmol N m(-2) d(-1) in winter, spring and summer respectively. There were no statistical differences in D-n between shallow waters with macrophyte beds and deeper waters without macrophyte beds, although macrophyte beds had higher denitrification rates in summer. The D-n rates were significantly correlated with temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, pH, nitrate-nitrogen concentration (NO3--N) (p < 0.01) and turbidity (p < 0.05). Linear regression models demonstrated environmental variables explained between 36% and 76% of the variation in D-n. The correlation with NO3--N concentrations suggests that it may be a limited factor for D-n. Annual nitrogen removal of the reservoir by a combination of sediment and water denitrification was totally estimated to be 370 t N with an annual removal efficiency of approximately 11%. Nitrogen removal was much higher in winter than other seasons, with about 305 t N removed, accounting for 12% of the total nitrogen inputs. Therefore, denitrification appears to play a minor role throughout much of the year, but in winter months when nitrate accumulates, it may play a more major role.

J	GONS, HJ				GONS, HJ			STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL-CHARACTERISTICS OF EPIPHYTON AND EPIPELON IN RELATION TO THEIR DISTRIBUTION IN LAKE VECHTEN	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Epiphyton and epipelon were quantitatively collected, respectively, from the submerged macrophytes and the sandy lake bottom of Lake Vechten (The Netherlands). On a weight basis, epiphyton was maximal in autumn and epipelon in summer. In winter the chemical composition of epiphyton and epipelon was similar. In summer the epiphyton had on a unit weight basis more organic matter and carbonate, and had per unit organic matter a higher algal number, N and energy content than the epipelon. Algae predominating the epiphyton were filamentous greens and pennate diatoms; those in the epipelon were pennate diatoms and blue-green algae. In both cases, species known to frequent the phytoplankton were abundant. The diatoms were quantified using paper chromatographic pigment analyses. Both the epiphyton and the epipelon exhibited maximal photosynthesis in mid summer. That light was generally the limiting factor was evident from periphyton developed on artificial substrates. This periphyton differed widely in its composition from that on the natural substrates, mainly because the latter collected much more sedimenting matter. In dense Ceratophyllum stands light was severely attenuated and the significant gradients in O2 and pH were caused by the differences with depth in the proportions of photosynthesis and respiration. The O content and pH at the bottom decreased owing to epipelic respiration. The epiphytic composition depended greatly on the degree of light attenuation. The epiphytic and epipelic respiration, except during part of the early summer, exceeded photosynthesis on a 24 h basis; this included the macrophytic photosynthesis during the time the vegetation was maximally developed. During the growing season import of organic matter, i.e. deposited seston, greatly exceeded that due to the photosynthetic production. After the summer maximum, the epipelon decreased faster than predicted from its O2 exchange. Sedimentation and resuspension determined mainly the changes in epiphyton and epipelon. Especially when covered with vegetation, the lower littoral of Lake Vechten plays a large part in the aerobic decomposition of sestonic organic matter.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	1982	95	1					79	114		10.1007/BF00044478	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00044478													WOS:A1982PP41900008

Age, growth and spawning season of Luciobarbus esocinus Heckel, 1843 in Gamasiab River, Iran	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES												In the current paper reproductive strategy and growth rates of Luciobarbus esocinus were investigated from 2010 to 2012, in Gamasiab River, Kermanshah, Iran. Samples were collected seasonally by gillnet and electro-fisher device. Sex ratio was evaluated from 162 individuals and the percentage of male and female individuals were 54.76% and 45.24% respectively. Age structure was distributed between I and V and most frequency numbers for males and females belonged to II and IV age group, respectively. Length-weight relationship was computed as W = 8E-05TL(2.6546) for all individuals. Mean total length and weight was 333.82 +/- 13.10 mm and 297.67 +/- 4.85 g for males, and 371.5 +/- 21.17 mm and 307.85 +/- 7.64 g for females. The von-Bertalanffy growth models of L. esocinus were described as Lt = 357.14x[1-e((-0.77x (t -0.090)))] for males, Lt = 367.02x[1-e((-0.78x (t) (-0.094)))] for females and Lt = 363.57x[1-e((-0.76x (t-0.087)))] for both sexes. Results indicated that growth factors were highly similar in spring, summer and winter. CDA analysis revealed that the total and gonad weight are the main factors in discriminant analysis. The highest GSI values were found in spring for females and winter for males, however, it decreased rapidly after spring in females. Maximum growth rates were observed in early ages (I-II) and depleted with ages. K value and L infinity were determined as 0.77 +/- 0.09 Y-1 and 357.14 +/- 10.38 mm for males and 0.78 +/- 0.24 Y-1 and 367.02 +/- 24.15 mm for females, respectively.

J	Wang, HW; Li, ZK; Wang, Y; Xia, TT				Wang, Haowei; Li, Zhoukang; Wang, Yang; Xia, Tingting			Spatiotemporal Patterns of Algal Blooms in Lake Bosten Driven by Climate and Human Activities: A Multi-Source Remote-Sensing Perspective for Sustainable Water-Resource Management	WATER												Algal blooms pose a serious threat not only to the lake ecosystem of Lake Bosten but also by negatively impacting its rapidly developing fisheries and tourism industries. This study focuses on Lake Bosten as the research area and utilizes multi-source remote sensing imagery from Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI. The Adjusted Floating Algae Index (AFAI) was employed to extract algal blooms in Lake Bosten from 2004 to 2023, analyze their spatiotemporal evolution characteristics and driving factors, and construct a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network model to predict the spatial distribution of algal-bloom frequency. The stability of the model was assessed through temporal segmentation of historical data combined with temporal cross-validation. The results indicate that (1) during the study period, algal blooms in Lake Bosten were predominantly of low-risk level, with low-risk bloom coverage accounting for over 8% in both 2004 and 2005. The intensity of algal blooms in summer and autumn was significantly higher than in spring. The coverage of medium- and high-risk blooms reached 2.74% in the summer of 2004 and 3.03% in the autumn of 2005, while remaining below 1% in spring. (2) High-frequency algal bloom areas were mainly located in the western and northwestern parts of the lake, and the central region experienced significantly more frequent blooms during 2004-2013 compared to 2014-2023, particularly in spring and summer. (3) The LSTM model achieved an R2 of 0.86, indicating relatively stable performance. The prediction results suggest a continued low frequency of algal blooms in the future, reflecting certain achievements in sustainable water-resource management. (4) The interactions among meteorological factors exhibited significant influence on bloom formation, with the q values of temperature and precipitation interactions both exceeding 0.5, making them the most prominent meteorological driving factors. Monitoring of sewage discharge and analysis of agricultural and industrial expansion revealed that human activities have a more direct impact on the water quality of Lake Bosten. In addition, changes in lake area and water environment were mainly influenced by anthropogenic factors, ultimately making human activities the primary driving force behind the spatiotemporal variations of algal blooms. This study improved the timeliness of algal-bloom monitoring through the integration of multi-source remote sensing and successfully predicted the future spatial distribution of bloom frequency, providing a scientific basis and decision-making support for the sustainable management of water resources in Lake Bosten.

Here we investigated patterns of energy accumulation and the importance of growth history for winter survival in young-of-the-year Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis). Under simulated winter conditions in aquaria, we showed that high winter mortality most likely relates to the depletion of energy reserves in small perch. Correspondingly, in a field study, using four lakes covering 3-6 lake-years each, overwinter survival within cohorts was positively related to individual size. However, average size in autumn did not explain the variation in overwinter survival between cohorts. Instead, we showed that seasonal growth history is an important factor. High growth rates late in season may increase cohort survival over winter, irrespective of average size, related to a positive growth-dependent increase in allocation to energy reserves when approaching winter. Mechanisms regulating within-season temporal dynamics of growth rates are therefore suggested to be important for overall cohort performance.

J	OLAFSSON, J				OLAFSSON, J			CHEMISTRY OF LAKE MYVATN AND RIVER LAXA	OIKOS												The major ion composition and distribution in Lake Myvatn [Iceland] reflects the chemical composition of the cold and warm spring waters which drain into the lake. Spring discharge rates as calculated from chemical balances agree well with direct current measurements. Trace metal concentrations are generally low. The input loading rates of nutrient elements from springs are presently 1.4, 1.5 and 340 g m-2 yr-1 for N, P and Si, respectively. Diatomite mining and refining activities have in recent years increased the N and P loading by 38% and 3%, respectively. Dissolved silicate concentrations in the lake remain high throughout the summer but concentrations of inorganic N compounds are very low. The summer phosphate concentrations are few but biologically significant. In winter after the onset of ice cover an inverse thermocline develops and O2 may be depleted from the bottom water. O2 production by benthic diatoms re-establishes oxic conditions in Feb.-March, with improving light conditions. Chemical balance calculations suggest a net production by diatoms of 380 SiO2 m-2 yr-1 and 222 g C m-2 yr-1 and also suggests that the N fixation by blue-green algae may amount to 8 g N m-2 yr-1. A tephra layer dating from 1477 in a core from the Syorifloi basin indicates a sedimentation rate of 2.2 mm yr-1 or 500 g m-2 yr-1. The annual cycles of plants and nutrients are discussed in the light of results from algal bioassay, the loading and distribution of nutrients and phytoplankton succession.																			0030-1299	1600-0706					1979	32	1-2					82	112		10.2307/3544222	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3544222													WOS:A1979HJ61200006

Detecting spring after a long winter: coma or slow vigilance in cold, hypoxic turtles?	BIOLOGY LETTERS												Many freshwater turtle species can spend the winter submerged in ice-covered lakes by lowering their metabolism, and it has been proposed that such severe metabolic depression render these turtles comatose. This raises the question of how they can detect the arrival of spring and respond in a sensible way to sensory information during hibernation. Using evoked potentials from cold or hypoxic turtles exposed to vibration and light, we show that hibernating turtles maintain neural responsiveness to light stimuli during prolonged hypoxia. Furthermore, turtles held under hibernation conditions for 14 days increase their activity when exposed to light or elevated temperatures, but not to vibration or increased oxygen. It is concluded that hibernating turtles are not comatose, but remain vigilant during over-wintering in cold hypoxia, allowing them to respond to the coming of spring and to adjust their behaviour to specific sensory inputs.

J	McInerny, MC; Cross, TK				McInerny, MC; Cross, TK			An evaluation of mark-recapture estimates of black crappie population size determined by trap-netting during fall and spring in Minnesota lakes	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We evaluated mark-recapture population estimates of black crappies Pomoxis nigromaculatus 200 mm and longer made with trap-net catches during fall or spring in eight Minnesota lakes (18-168 ha). We estimated population size N during fall by use of marking and recapture in fall (FF estimates) and marking in fall and recapture during the following spring (FS estimates). We estimated spring N by use of marking and recapture after ice-out in early spring (ES estimates) and marking after ice-out and recapture during late spring (LS estimates). The FF and ES estimates were multiple-census estimates, whereas the FS and LS estimates were two-census estimates even though sampling occurred over many days. The most precise estimates were the LS estimates (median 95% confidence limits [CLs] were within 36% of 1/N), and FF estimates were least precise (median 95% CLs were within 51% of UN) among sampling scenarios. The median trap-net effort needed to achieve 95% CLs within 25% of 1/N estimates ranged from 160 (ES estimates) to 490 trap-net sets (FS estimates), and the effort needed for this level of precision decreased with increasing density of marked fish at large. The ES and LS estimates for the same lakes and years differed significantly (P < 0.05), and FF estimates did not exceed LS estimates from the following spring, which indicates that either the estimates from one or more scenarios were biased or that the catchable portions of populations differed temporally. Probable sources of bias included unequal capture probabilities, unequal mortality, and unequal emigration between marked and unmarked individuals during or after marking, as well as immigration of unmarked individuals after marking. Although marking occurred over short time periods, mortality, emigration, and immigration were possible, and therefore Populations may not have been closed. Comparisons of N estimated from the same sampling scenario are the most meaningful because the similarity in biases or catchable portions of populations should be highest.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				MAY	2005	25	2					475	490		10.1577/M03-197.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M03-197.1													WOS:000229839000007
J	Hou, PF; Chang, FQ; Duan, LZ; Zhang, Y; Zhang, HC				Hou, Pengfei; Chang, Fengqin; Duan, Lizeng; Zhang, Yang; Zhang, Hucai			Seasonal Variation and Spatial Heterogeneity of Water Quality Parameters in Lake Chenghai in Southwestern China	WATER												Seasonal dynamics and the vertical stratification of multiple parameters, including water temperature (WT), dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), were analyzed in Lake Chenghai, Northern Yunnan, based on monitoring data collected in 2015 (October), 2016 (March, May, July), 2017 (March, June, October), 2018 (August), and 2020 (June, November). The results indicate that the lake water was well mixed in winter and spring when the water quality was stable. However, when WT becomes stratified in summer and autumn, the Chl-a content and pH value changed substantially, along with the vertical movement of the thermocline. With rising temperature, the position of the stratified DO layer became higher than the thermocline, leading to a thickening of the water body with a low DO content. This process induced the release of nutrients from lake sediments and promoted eutrophication and cyanobacteria bloom. The thermal stratification structure had some influence on changes in DO, pH, and Chl-a, resulting in the obvious stratification of DO and pH. In summer, with an increase in temperature, thermal stratification was significant. DO and pH achieved peak values in the thermocline, and exhibited a decreasing trend from this peak, both upward and downward. The thermocline was anoxic and the pH value was low. Although Chl-a maintained a low level below the thermocline and was not high, there was a sudden increase in the surface layer, which should be urgently monitored to prevent large-scale algae reproduction and even local outbreaks in Lake Chenghai. Moreover, Lake Chenghai is deeper in the north and shallower in the south: this fact, together with the stronger wind-wave disturbance in the south, results in surface WT in the south being lower than that in the north year-round. This situation results in a gradual diminution of aquatic plants from north to south. Water quality in the lake's southern extent is better than that in the north, exhibiting obvious spatial heterogeneity. It is recommended that lake water quality monitoring should be strengthened to more fully understand lake water quality and take steps to prevent further deterioration.					; Hou, PengFei/C-4123-2018	Zhang, Hucai/0000-0001-9684-503X; Zhang, Yang/0000-0002-1082-6661														2073-4441				MAY	2022	14	10							1640	10.3390/w14101640	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14101640													WOS:000804281200001

Investigations into the temporal development of epitheliocystis infections in brown trout: a histological study	JOURNAL OF FISH DISEASES												Epitheliocystis in Swiss brown trout (Salmo trutta) is a chlamydial infection, mainly caused by Candidatus Piscichlamydia salmonis and Candidatus Clavichlamydia salmonicola. To gain a better understanding of the temporal development of infections in wild brown trout, we investigated epitheliocystis infections during the course of the summer and autumn months of a single year (2015), and compared this to sampling points over the span of the years 2012-2014. The survey focused on tributaries (Venoge and Boiron) of the Rhone flowing in to Lake Geneva. When evaluated histologically, epitheliocystis infections were found throughout the period of investigation with the exception of the month of June. Fifty to 86 animals per sampling were investigated. Highest prevalence and infection intensities were seen in September. A correlation between epitheliocystis infection and water temperatures was not evident. Interyear comparison revealed consistent levels of prevalence and infection intensities in late summer. The absence of infections in June, combined with the consistent interyear results, indicates seasonal fluctuation of epitheliocystis infections in brown trout with a reservoir persisting during winter months from which infections can re-initiate each year. This could either be at levels below detection limits within the brown trout population itself or in an alternative host.

J	Tang, DH; Liu, XJ; Zou, XQ				Tang, Dehao; Liu, Xingjian; Zou, Xinqing			An improved method for integrated ecosystem health assessments based on the structure and function of coastal ecosystems: A case study of the Jiangsu coastal area, China	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Ecosystem health status assessment is very complex and requires an integrated approach based on combined and synoptic estimates of the environmental background and the study of the structure and function of different ecosystems at a systems level. Here, we present the main results gained over six years (2006-2007, 2009-2012) with the aim of obtaining concise and comprehensive assessment results at 30 routine investigation sites in the Jiangsu coastal area. Our improved approach follows consecutive and interconnected steps. First, we conducted a quantitative assessment of community structure, including species abundance, biomass, and diversity utilizing a multidimensional scaling method. Then, a systemic functional assessment was carried out at the genetic level, including eco-exergy and structural eco-exergy, using a means clustering method, passing through a dimensionless polygonal area to reflect the integrated assessment results. Our results indicate that among the four seasons, the health status was best in autumn, followed by spring and winter, and worst in summer. Among the six assessed years, 2006 had the best health status, whereas 2012 had the worst. The general trend of annual variation in ecosystem health status was in decline. As for the regions, the health status was good or moderate in the southern and northern regions, and worst in the central region. Various human interventions and environmental stresses contributed to the stability and resilience of the ecosystem at different time scales and in different areas; however, these effects were not absolutely negative. This new method has strong applicability for assessing the status of ecosystems composed of several communities, as long as the eco-exergy quality and community structure of the system can be estimated.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				JAN	2018	84						82	95		10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.08.031	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.08.031													WOS:000425828200009

These data provide a means of assessing the absolute magnitude of past temperature changes. Modern salt pans on the floor of Death Valley, California, are among the hottest, driest environments on earth. However, several ancient shoreline terraces, beach bars and tufa deposits attest to the existence of a relatively deep, perennial lake which occupied the basin in the past. A core taken from the Badwater Basin salt pan in 1993 penetrates interbedded salt and mud deposited during the last 200 ka. These sediments are deposits of saline mudflat, ephemeral lake-salt pan and perennial lake environments. Halite deposited in the ephemeral lake-salt pan and perennial lake environments contains fluid inclusions, samples of brine from which the salt grew, trapped during the growth of the crystals. These fluid inclusions contain samples of ancient surface brines, which can be analyzed for stable isotope and major element composition and also act as tiny thermometers, preserving a record of ancient temperatures. Temperature data from fluid inclusions in halite which formed in 1993 compare favorably with temperatures measured in the field as the salt precipitated. The temperature range for fluid inclusions in halite of the salt pan/ephemeral lake sediments (192 to 186 ka) is similar. High frequency (diurnal) variations in temperature are up to 16 degrees C, and temperature tends to rise irregularly through beds. These data indicate that conditions during deposition of the salt were similar to modern, with the salt pan flooding in the winter or early spring and desiccating during spring to summer, but that temperatures were cooler than for the modem. Halite of the perennial lake sequence (186 to 120 ka) also contains fluid inclusions. Hexagonal halite crystals, probable pseudomorphs after the low temperature mineral hydrohalite, are also present. High frequency (diurnal) temperature variations are about 5 degrees C, and temperature decreases upward through beds. Data indicate spring floods, followed by evaporation and formation of salt during late summer. Some beds show an increase, followed by a decrease in temperature, probably a result of lower spring runoff, allowing earlier onset of halite precipitation during evaporation. Although there is no perennial lake in Death Valley at present, data obtained from fluid inclusions in halite are compared with air and brine temperatures from modern lakes. Comparison of these records allows us to quantify past temperature changes in Death Valley. The data point to a decrease of at least 10 degrees C in both maximum summer and minimum winter temperature when the perennial lake existed.																					90-5410-597-6				1998							371	380																WOS:000073252100034
J	Green, MC				Green, MC			The project MOHAVE tracer study: study design, data quality, and overview of results	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												In the winter and summer of 1992, atmospheric tracer studies were conducted in support of project MOHAVE, a visibility study in the southwestern United States. The primary goal of project MOHAVE is to determine the effects of the Mohave power plant and other sources upon visibility at Grand Canyon National Park. Perfluorocarbon tracers (PFTs) were released from the Mohave power plant and other locations and monitored at about 30 sites. The tracer data are being used for source attribution analysis and for evaluation of transport and dispersion models and receptor models. Collocated measurements showed the tracer data to be of high quality and suitable for source attribution analysis and model evaluation. The results showed strong influences of channeling by the Colorado River canyon during both winter and summer. Flow from the Mohave power plant was usually to the south, away from the Grand Canyon in winter and to the northeast, toward the Grand Canyon in summer. Tracer released at Lake Powell in winter was found to often travel downstream through the entire length of the Grand Canyon. Data from summer tracer releases in southern California demonstrated the existence of a convergence zone in the western Mohave Desert. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

M.			Constraining dissolved organic matter sources and temporal variability in a model sub-Arctic lake	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Circumpolar lakes comprise similar to 1.4 million km(2) of arctic and subarctic landscapes and are vulnerable to change in vegetation, permafrost distribution, and hydrological conditions in response to climate warming. However, the composition and cycling of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is poorly understood for these lakes because most are remote and unstudied. The goal of this study was to assess timescale and source controls on DOM composition in Canvasback Lake, a shallow, sub-Arctic lake in interior Alaska with similar hydrologic and geomorphic characteristics to about a quarter of circumpolar lake ecosystems. Lake dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration varied by as much as 16% from the mean (3.34 mg L-1 change) through diel cycles in spring 2016 to fall 2017 and was accompanied by minor changes in DOM composition. At the seasonal scale, DOC concentration increased from spring through fall to very high concentrations under ice in winter. Decreases in both condensed aromatic and polyphenolic compound classes and lignin carbon-normalized yield, plus increased relative abundance of aliphatic compounds, suggests that DOM composition shifts from a pulse of allochthonous DOM in the spring to more autochthonous under-ice. These changes highlight the seasonally-dynamic nature of DOM in circumpolar lakes that are poorly captured by single-visit lake surveys and underscores the need to measure DOM properties and fate consistently across multiple timescales (i.e. seasonally) to better constrain the role of DOM in lake processes. To further assess DOM sources, a suite of endmember leachates were compared to bulk lake DOM, indicating solely allochthonous inputs are not well reflected in lake DOM, highlighting the role of degradation processes or mixing with autochthonous sources. Thus, Canvasback Lake appears less well connected to terrestrial inputs compared to past studies of northern highlatitude lakes and does not behave as previous boreal lake models suggest.

Filtering and feeding rates were measured from Dec. 1975-Oct. 1976. Feeding was measured from the change in concentration in 3 size fractions of chlorophyll a. D. ashlandi fed only on particles in the smallest size class, while the larger D. sicilis consumed particles in all 3 size fractions. During the isothermal period (winter and spring), the feeding rates of both species were proportional to temperature or chlorophyll concentration. D. sicilis preferentially ingested particles in the largest size class, when this size class increased significantly during the spring bloom. During the summer the highest feeding rates of D. ashlandi occured in the epilimnion. The highest feeding rates of D. sicilis were in the metalimnion, where large particles in a sub-surface chlorophyll maximum were available for consumption. The importance of the depth distributions of herbivores and phytoplankton for feeding was discussed.																			0020-9309						1980	65	2					259	267		10.1002/iroh.19800650211	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19800650211													WOS:A1980KD54700005

Seasonally related effects on natural organic matter characteristics from source to tap in Korea	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												In this study, natural organic matter (NOM) characteristics were investigated over three years of monthly monitoring to determine the effect of seasonal variations on NOM levels from source to tap. Liquid chromatography with organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) was used to determine NOMcharacteristics and the level of reduction of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC). The average dissolved organic matter concentration in the source water (Lake Paldang, Korea) was not significantly different between summer and winter. However, the distribution of NOM components, such as biopolymers, building blocks, low molecular weight (MW) neutrals and acids, identified by LC-OCD, varied seasonally. While highMWNOM was preferentially removed by coagulation/sedimentation/ rapid sand filtration (CSR), no seasonal effects were observed on the removal of high MW NOM. CSR and biological activated carbon (BAC) filtration showed a better efficiency of BDOC removal in winter and summer, respectively. High concentrations of chlorine used in the treatment plants in summer resulted in 10% higher DOC concentrations during disinfection. Overall NOM removal efficiencies from source to tap were 45% and 35% for summer and winter, respectively. Principal component analysis also indicated that seasonal variations (principal component 1) showed the strongest positive correlation with the overall performance of water treatment. The long-term monitoring of drinking water treatment processes showed that seasonal variations were important factors affecting NOM characteristics during water treatment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this study details of scales and spines are made with scanning electron microscopy. Ecological data for both taxa along seasonal, temperature, pH, specific conductance and total phosphorus gradients are discussed for Connecticut lakes and compared to records compiled from the literature. C. brevispina and C. longispina were found to be distributed primarily in winter and summer/autumn months, respectively. As a result, C. brevispina had a much lower weighted mean temperature of 6-degrees-C. Both taxa were found to have maximal distribution between pH 5 and 7, and to be more common in waters low in specific conductance; however, C. brevispina was also observed in localities with higher specific conductance. The distribution of both taxa along trophic gradients is also discussed.																			0107-055X						1993	13	3					343	351		10.1111/j.1756-1051.1993.tb00060.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1756-1051.1993.tb00060.x													WOS:A1993LY95700013

A serological technique, the precipitin test, was used to identify the presence of lumbriculid, naidid, tubificid and enchytraeid oligochaetes in the gut of the leeches. The proportion of total worms in the diet of Glossiphonia was greater in unproductive than productive lakes. For each of Erpobdella and Helobdella the proportions were similar. The families most extensively eaten by the leeches were tubificids in productive and lumbriculids in unproductive lakes. No and only a few enchytraeids were recorded in leeches from productive and unproductive lakes respectively. The remaining two worm families, in each lake type, were eaten in similar proportions. For each leech species, dietary composition did not change with increasing body size or with season. Feeding intensity peaked in mid-summer and mid-autumn, and was lowest in winter. It is concluded that the three leeches do not partition, in terms of families, the oligochaete resource.																			0270-5060	2156-6941					1985	3	2					181	187		10.1080/02705060.1985.9665107	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1985.9665107													WOS:A1985AVB2200005
J	Ishida, N; Mitamura, O; Nakayama, M				Ishida, Noriko; Mitamura, Osamu; Nakayama, Masashi			Seasonal variation in biomass and photosynthetic activity of epilithic algae on a rock at the upper littoral area in the north basin of Lake Biwa, Japan	LIMNOLOGY												Vertical distributions of biomass and the photosynthetic activity of epilithic algae were observed seasonally with regard to their physical and chemical parameters along a rocky shoreline of the upper littoral area in the north basin of Lake Biwa. Chlorophyll a amounts in epilithic algae showed a marked change with depth from spring to early summer. The algal biomass showed higher values on the lower part of a large rock in early spring, and gradually increased on the upper part as a result of the growth of Spirogyra sp., a filamentous Chlorophyceae. This growth seems to be associated with a rise in water temperature, with the biomass at the upper depths seeming to be affected by a hydraulic disturbance. The standing crop of epilithic algae showed a maximum value in June and declined to a minimum in August because of the corresponding proliferation or disappearance of Spirogyra as well as changes in the water level. The maximum value of the assimilation number calculated from the potential photosynthetic rate of epilithic algae was obtained at the lower depths in June when Spirogyra grew vigorously. Appreciably high assimilation numbers were also observed in summer and fall, although chlorophyll a amounts were low. The present study is the first in a series to clarify the contribution of epilithic algae on rocky areas to productivity throughout the entire littoral ecosystem.																			1439-8621					DEC	2006	7	3					175	183		10.1007/s10201-006-0181-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-006-0181-1													WOS:000242770900005

In Lake Ontario, sediment down flux rates and corresponding contaminant down flux rates were highest in winter and increased with depth due to the influence of resuspended bottom sediments. Sediment down flux rates in western Lake Erie (22 to 160 g m(-2) d(-1)) were far greater than in Lake Ontario (0.19-3.0 g m(-2) d(-1)). Suspended material in western Lake Erie was characterized as predominately resuspended bottom sediments; down flux rates were roughly 5- to 10-fold higher in spring and fall, compared to summer. Suspended sediment concentrations of PCBs and other organochlorine contaminants, represented by both annual means and individual seasonal values, were higher in Lake Ontario throughout the duration of the study, compared to Lake Erie. The mean annual concentration of PCBs in suspended sediments over the period 1997-2000 was 330 ng/g in western Lake Erie and 530 ng/g in Lake Ontario. Based on a comparison with historical data from Lake Ontario, mean contaminant concentrations over the period 1997-2000 for PCBs, hexachlorobenzene, and mirex corresponded to decreases of 38%, 74%, and 40%, respectively, since the mid-1980s. Corresponding down flux rates for PCBs, hexachlorobenzene, and mirex decreased by approximately 70%, 90%, and 80%, respectively, since the 1980s.																			0380-1330						2004	30	2					277	286		10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70345-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70345-7													WOS:000223086800005

Reconstructing hydro-climatic events and glacier fluctuations over the past millennium from annually laminated sediments of Cheakamus Lake, southern Coast Mountains, British Columbia, Canada	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We recovered sediment cores from Cheakamus Lake in the southern Coast Mountains, southwest British Columbia, to reconstruct late Holocene environmental conditions in the watershed. The cored sediments are inorganic, rhythmically laminated clayey silt. Radiocarbon ages and correlation of lamina thickness with the magnitude of the annual flood recorded at a nearby gauging station indicate that the laminae are varves. We discriminate seven types of varves on the basis of couplet thickness and internal structure, and compare them to annual hydrographs over the period of record. The seven varve types record summer snowmelt floods, autumn floods, mid-season floods, years with two major floods, years with three major floods, years with more than three major floods, and periods of sustained glacier runoff. Varves attributed to autumn storms and glacier runoff are dominant, exhibit serial dependence, and are most common during six periods: AD 1300-1320, 1380-1410, 1470-1500, 1710-1730, 1880-1906, and 1916-1945. In contrast, varves attributed to summer snowmelt floods are randomly distributed through time. Thickest varves occur during the decades AD 1090-1110, 1120-1170, 1210-1250, 1310-1330, 1390-1450, 1720-1780, 1860-1900, and 1920-1945. The relation between Little lee Age glacier activity and lake sedimentation is complex, but the thickest varves coincide with times of rapid glacier retreat and periods when air temperatures were warmer than average. The results confirm the importance of sediment transfers during the summer and autumn runoff season in the British Columbia Coast Mountains. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Multi-decadal scale variability in autumn-winter rainfall in south-western Australia since 1655 AD as reconstructed from tree rings of Callitris columellaris	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												We present the first tree-ring based reconstruction of rainfall for the Lake Tay region of southern Western Australia. We examined the response of Callitris columellaris to rainfall, the southern oscillation index (SOI), the southern annular mode (SAM) and surface sea temperature (SST) anomalies in the southern Indian Ocean. The 350-year chronology was most strongly correlated with rainfall averaged over the autumn-winter period (March-September; r = -0.70, P < 0.05) and SOI values averaged over June-August (r = 0.25, P < 0.05). The chronology was not correlated with SAM or SSTs. We reconstructed autumn-winter rainfall back to 1655, where current and previous year tree-ring indices explained 54% of variation in rainfall over the 1902-2005 calibration period. Some variability in rainfall was lost during the reconstruction: variability of actual rainfall (expressed as normalized values) over the calibration period was 0.78, while variability of the normalized reconstructed values over the same period was 0.44. Nevertheless, the reconstruction, combined with spectral analysis, revealed that rainfall naturally varies from relatively dry periods lasting to 20-30 years to 15-year long periods of above average rainfall. This variability in rainfall may reflect low-frequency variation in the El Nio-Southern Oscillation rather than the effect of SAM or SSTs.

J	ELLIOTT, JE; SHUTT, L				ELLIOTT, JE; SHUTT, L			MONITORING ORGANOCHLORINES IN BLOOD OF SHARP-SHINNED HAWKS (ACCIPITER-STRIATUS) MIGRATING THROUGH THE GREAT-LAKES	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Blood samples from sharp-shinned hawks (Accipiter striatus) were collected from 1985 to 1989 during the fall migration at Hawk Cliff, Ontario, and during the spring migration at White-fish Point, Michigan, and analyzed for organochlorine contaminants. The study was designed to investigate the potential of using blood samples from birds of prey trapped by banders as a means of estimating the organochlorine exposure of migrant birds on their breeding and wintering grounds. Mean plasma levels averaged over the entire sample were highest for p, p'-DDE (0.28 mg/kg, wet weight), followed by total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (0.08 mg/kg, wet weight). Mean levels of DDE, mirex, oxychlordane, heptachlor expoxide, dieldrin, hexachlorobenzene, and PCBs increased significantly in hatch-year birds from their first southward migration to their return flight the following spring as second-year birds. Thereafter, mean residue levels of the more persistent chemicals, including DDE, oxychlordane, and PCBs, did not change significantly between seasons in adult age classes. In contrast, dieldrin and heptachlor epoxide, which have a shorter half-time in the body, increased significantly in the blood of all age classes after each winter and decreased significantly after each breeding season. The results were interpreted in terms of the clearance rates of the compounds as well as the diet of the birds on the breeding grounds. The sharp-shinned hawk is a useful indicator species for contaminant-monitoring programs involving birds of prey.																			0730-7268	1552-8618				FEB	1993	12	2					241	250		10.1002/etc.5620120207	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/etc.5620120207													WOS:A1993KK07000007

J	Pothoven, SA; Madenjian, CP				Pothoven, Steven A.; Madenjian, Charles P.			Increased Piscivory by Lake Whitefish in Lake Huron	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We evaluated the diet of Lake Whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis in Lake Huron during 2002-2011 to determine the importance of Round Goby Neogobius melanostomus and other fish as prey items. Lake Whitefish that had reached approximately 400mm in length incorporated fish into their diets. The overall percentage of adult Lake Whitefish in Lake Huron that had eaten fish increased from 10% in 2002-2006 to 20% in 2007-2011, with a corresponding decrease in the frequency of Lake Whitefish that ate Dreissena spp. from 52% to 33%. During 2002-2006, Round Goby (wet mass, 38%), sculpins (Cottidae) (34%), and Ninespine Stickleback Pungitius pungitius (18%) were the primary fish eaten, whereas Round Goby accounted for 92% of the fish eaten in 2007-2011. Overall, Round Goby were found in the fewest Lake Whitefish stomachs in the north region of Lake Huron (6%) and in the most in the central (23%) and south (19%) regions of the lake. In the central region, Round Goby were eaten during all seasons that were sampled (spring through fall). In the south region, Round Goby were eaten only in the winter and spring but not in the summer when Dreissena spp. and spiny water flea Bythotrephes longimanus dominated the diet. Based on the 2007-2011 diet composition, an individual Lake Whitefish would need to have increased their consumption relative to that in 1983-1994 by 6% in the north region, 12% in the central region, and 41% in the southern region in order to achieve the same growth that was observed before dreissenid mussels arrived. However, Lake Whitefish weight adjusted for length only increased by 2% between 2002-2006 and 2007-2011 in the central region, decreased by 4% in the northern region, and remained constant in the southern region. This suggests that a shift toward more frequent piscivory does not necessarily improve the condition of a generalist feeder like Lake Whitefish.

For this purpose, the yearly movements of UNAVCO stations-South Pole Station (AMU2) (winter-summer) and other stations in the South Pole region have been observed in this paper for about a fifteen-year period (2006-2021). In addition, the area differences of the Antarctic continent due to seasonal changes (winter-summer) between 1980 and 2021 were investigated in this study. Moreover, the height values of the stations on the Antarctic continent were observed seasonally. The subglacial lakes in the Antarctic continent cause the differences in the height values as a result of the seasonal changes. A decrease in sea ice of 0.91 million km(2) for the winter season and 0.55 million km(2) for the summer season during a 41-year period has been determined for four sectors of the Antarctic continent. The temperature changes on the Antarctic continent in the summer and winter seasons (2005-2022) were also evaluated in this paper. Air temperature increases was apparent especially in the Antarctic Peninsula, East Antarctic and West Antarctic coasts. The Weddell Sea and the Amundsen Sea regions have had the most sea ice loss, each with 1.24 million km(2). On the other hand, it can be observed that the East Antarctic sector has expanded by 0.32 million km(2).

Mean metacercariae, intensity in young-of-the-year minnows varied extensively (5-123 metacercariae/host) among year, month. and lakes. In 2 of the lakes, prevalence always reached 100%. and mean intensity always peaked in September or October. The high spatial and annual variation in metacercarial recruitment was partly attributable to variation in host size, but variation in water depth, temperature, snail densities, and bird visitation likely also played a role. A laboratory experiment demonstrated that host and metacercariae survival was intensity-independent during a period of simulated winter. Thus. metacercariae recruited in the fall survive until the following spring.																			0022-3395	1937-2345				AUG	2001	87	4					744	748		10.2307/3285129	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3285129								11534636					WOS:000170585800008

Here, we measured Hg isotopic compositions in 30 potential source materials and 23 PM2.5 samples collected in four seasons from the megacity Beijing (China) and combined the seasonal variation in both mass-dependent fractionation (represented by the ratio Hg-202/Hg-198, delta Hg-202) and mass-independent fractionation of isotopes with odd and even mass numbers (represented by Delta Hg-199 and Delta Hg-200, respectively) with geochemical parameters and meteorological data to identify the sources of PM2.5-Hg and possible atmospheric particulate Hg transformation. All PM2.5 samples were highly enriched in Hg and other heavy metals and displayed wide ranges of both delta Hg-202 (-2.18 to 0.51 parts per thousand) and Delta Hg-199 (-0.53 to 0.57 parts per thousand), as well as small positive Delta Hg-200 (0.02 to 0.17 parts per thousand). The results indicated that the seasonal variation in Hg isotopic composition (and elemental concentrations) was likely derived from variable contributions from anthropogenic sources, with continuous input due to industrial activities (e.g., smelting, cement production and coal combustion) in all seasons, whereas coal combustion dominated in winter and biomass burning mainly found in autumn. The more positive Delta Hg-199 of PM2.5-Hg in spring and early summer was likely derived from long-range-transported Hg that had undergone extensive photochemical reduction. The study demonstrated that Hg isotopes may be potentially used for tracing the sources of particulate Hg and its vectors in the atmosphere.

Activity patterns of Gulf Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi) in the staging area of the Pascagoula River during fall outmigration	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Environmental cues that are associated with individual movement of threatened Gulf Sturgeon from upriver areas to nearshore and offshore winter feeding areas have been described throughout much of their range in the Gulf of Mexico. In this study, we focus on small-scale movement of Gulf Sturgeon between summer holding' areas and the fall staging area in the Pascagoula River system (Mississippi, USA). We evaluated a set of logistic regression models using Akaike's Information Criterion and found that relative changes in barometric pressure, time of day, and water temperature were cues for small-scale Gulf Sturgeon movements during fall outmigration. Numerous environmental cues appear to drive the activity of Gulf Sturgeon in staging areas, indicating the complexity of abiotic factors affecting the observed staging patterns during emigration. The identification of the environmental drivers that are associated with Gulf Sturgeon movement is particularly important if these known saline transition zones change spatially annually with variable rainfall or due to water withdrawals and are used by Gulf Sturgeon making osmotic adjustments while moving downriver.					; Leaf, Robert/AAE-7345-2019; Peterson, Mark/HTP-1480-2023	Leaf, Robert/0000-0002-2955-3149; 													0906-6691	1600-0633				OCT	2015	24	4					553	561		10.1111/eff.12168	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12168													WOS:000361010500006

Supersaturation and evasion of CO2 and CH4 in surface waters at Mer Bleue peatland, Canada	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) concentrations and evasion rates were measured in surface waters draining Mer Bleue peatland (Ontario, Canada) between spring and autumn 2005. All sites exhibit a consistent pattern of supersaturation throughout the year, which is broadly related to hydrological and temperature changes between spring snowmelt and autumn freezing. Both measurements and estimates of CO2 and CH4 evasion from open water to the atmosphere suggest that parts of the catchment (including beaver dams) are significant degassing hot spots. We present data showing how vertical gaseous carbon fluxes compare with lateral carbon fluxes and make an initial estimate of the importance to the overall carbon budget of CO2 and CH4 evasion to the atmosphere from water surfaces at Mer Bleue.

The lakes have been investigated since 1993 and pass along the tophic gradient from eutrophic, Petersdorfer See and Melangsee to hypertrophic, Langer See. All lakes are dominated by cyanobacteria from early spring to late autumn. Due to low water temperature and low light intensity before ice-cover a decline of cyanobaterial biovolume initiated which led to the total disappearance of cyanobacteria in Melangsee for the whole ice-covered period, whereas their portion in Langer See with at least 6% (3 mm(3) 1(-1)) and in Petersdorfer See with 25% (3 mm(3) 1(-1)) of total biovolume was still considerable. The cyanobacterial breakdown was linked to a switch in dominance to flagellates which built up together with diatoms a subsequent peak of biovolume during ice-cover. Maximum phytoplankton biovolume under the ice peak reached 20 mm(3) 1(-1) with chi-a concentrations up to 100 mu g 1(-1). Oxygen saturation increased during ice-cover with a final oversaturation of more than 200% in the upper water column at the end of ice cover. These findings indicate that the winter period is also characterized by intensive photoautotrophic activities. Therefore, this period should be more worthy of note in investigations of phytoplankton succession and ecology.																			0018-8158						1998	370						229	235																WOS:000076259900020
J	Linton, TK; Reid, SD; Wood, CM				Linton, TK; Reid, SD; Wood, CM			The metabolic costs and physiological consequences to juvenile rainbow trout of a simulated winter warming scenario in the presence or absence of sublethal ammonia	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												This experiment examined the metabolic costs and physiological consequences of growth and energetics of juvenile rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss in a warmer. more polluted winter environment. Growth under the warm-winter conditions was approximately three times less than equivalent growth of experimental and control groups previously observed under warm-summer conditions. However, during winter exposure, wet weights and total lengths were roughly 30% higher in the "warmed" fish than in the base temperature group due to a combination of greater appetite and higher energy conversion efficiency. Oxygen consumption and nitrogenous (ammonia + urea) waste excretion rates were 30-40% higher for "warmed" fish but were less than one-third of levels recorded in the summer. A corresponding increase in food intake was associated with elevations in whole-body protein and lipid but not carbohydrate. Addition of 70 mu mol ammonia/L elevated nitrogenous waste excretion much like in the previous summer exposure, but over this winter period it did not result in increased weight gain. Plasma total ammonia was not significantly higher in the ammonia-exposed fish, unlike the summer experiment. Although nitrogen retention efficiency was much lower for overwintering juvenile trout fed to satiation, the metabolic cost of nitrogen retention (growth) was similar to that of juvenile trout exposed during summer. We conclude that overwintering juvenile trout fed unlimited ration and subjected to simulated warming, both alone and in combination with elevated environmental ammonia, will exhibit increased growth with only a slight elevation in energetic cost.

The streams cover a forest-wetland gradient, spanning from 0% to 69% wetland coverage. Lower values of the absorbance ratio measured at 254 nm and 365 nm (A(254)/A(365)), in both soil plots and streams, indicated that wetland-derived DOC had higher average molecular weight than forest DOC. Higher SUVA(254) ( DOC specific ultraviolet absorption at 254 nm) in wetland runoff indicated more aromatic DOC from wetlands than forests. During low flow, the stream DOC character was sensitive to the forest-wetland proportion of the catchment, and when wetland coverage exceeded 10%, the streams appeared to be dominated by wetland-derived DOC. During the spring snowmelt period, the character changed to lower molecular weight and more aliphatic DOC, particularly in streams with a high proportion of forest in the catchment. The forested soil solutions had higher A(254)/A(365) in the surface horizons that were hydrologically activated during the high flow events, while wetland soil solution had relatively low A(254)/A(365) at all depths. Consequently forest soils contributed more to stream DOC concentration during snowmelt that during winter low flow.					; Ågren, Anneli/B-7887-2012; Bishop, Kevin/C-7816-2012; Laudon, Hjalmar/J-3074-2013; Berggren, Martin/G-1401-2012	Agren, Anneli M./0000-0002-6758-3971; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				SEP 3	2008	113	G3							G03031	10.1029/2007JG000674	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2007JG000674													WOS:000259000900001
J	FREVERT, T				FREVERT, T			HEAVY-METALS IN LAKE KINNERET (ISRAEL) .1. TOTAL COPPER AND CUPRIC ION CONCENTRATIONS IN LAKE KINNERET AND THE RIVER JORDAN	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Total and acid-dissolvable copper (DPASV after HNO3 adds and H2O2/UV treatment) and cupric ion concentrations (modif. ISE technique) have been determined in Lake Kinneret/Israel (during summer stagnation and after winter overturn) and in its main tributary, the River Jordan. The results indicate that Cutot in lake and river water is about one order of magnitude higher concentrated than more recently reported from unpolluted lacustrine environments. Only in the river water the concentrations increased after UV treatment. The major dissolved species in both systems seem, to be CuOH+, Cu(OH)2.degree. and CuCO3.degree.. Besides submersed thermomineral springs, riverine inorganic or acid-dissolvable organic particles are the main input of Cu into the lake. An additional release of Cu from the lake sediment after winter overturn is likely. Cu2+ .cntdot. aq concentrations as calculated from operationally defined .alpha.* partitioning ratios suggest that in Kinneret water a growth inhibiting effect of Cu has to be considered.																			0003-9136						1985	104	4					527	542																WOS:A1985ARC9500006

DIVERSITY-BASEL												The global degradation and loss of natural wetlands are increasingly threatening wetland-dependent taxa, particularly waterbirds, which are highly vulnerable to environmental changes. In response to these threats, an increasing number of waterbirds are relocating to surrounding satellite wetlands in search of compensatory habitats. However, how waterbirds utilize these satellite wetlands and respond to varying environmental variables remain poorly understood. In the winter of 2022-2023 and summer of 2023, we conducted surveys on waterbird assemblages in 49 satellite wetlands of different types (reservoirs, aquaculture ponds, paddy fields and natural ponds) surrounding Shengjin Lake, a Ramsar site, and analyzed the relationship between community metrics and environmental factors. Large numbers of waterbirds were recorded during both summer and winter, including several threatened and nationally protected species. Species richness and number of individuals varied significantly across wetland types, with aquaculture ponds supporting the highest number of species and individuals. These two metrics showed positive correlations with wetland areas and landscape connectivity in both seasons. Species richness was also positively correlated with habitat diversity in summer. The number of individuals was positively correlated with habitat diversity and negatively with distance to human settlements, but the pattern was in contrast to that in winter. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index displayed a similar pattern among wetland types in winter but did not in summer. We detected no effects of environmental factors on the diversity index. Species composition differed markedly between wetland types in both seasons, especially between reservoirs and aquaculture ponds. To safeguard waterbird communities in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, we recommend integrating surrounding satellite wetlands into the regional wetland network and reducing human disturbances, particularly during the winter months.

Modification of climate signals by human activities recorded in varved sediments (AD 1608-1942) of Lake Holzmaar (Germany)	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Paleolimnological data from varved sediments in Lake Holzmaar (Eifel, Germany) were combined with documentary data on human activities, long-term data from the Historical Climate Database (HISKLID) for Germany and with recent monitoring data to evaluate changes in deposition that arose from climatic and human influences. The sediment data included seasonal layer thickness in an established varve chronology (1608-1942 AD), subannual chemical element counts, and multiannual organic matter data (TOC, TN, delta C-13(org)), all combined on an annual scale. Indicators for detritus deposition (lithogenic element counts and detritus layers) determined the first principal component (PC1) of the sediment data. This detritus PC1 was compared to the first PCs of the seasonal precipitation and temperature from HISKLID. While no relation was found to precipitation, the correlation with the temperature PC1 determined by spring to fall temperatures was significant. From 1608 to 1870, a positive correlation of the PCs suggests an increase of detritus deposition in the lake center with increasing non-winter temperatures. These may be linked by lake-internal sediment redeposition that increases when the periods of winter stratification become shorter and that of lake circulation longer. The detritus deposition is modulated by external detritus input depending on the intensity of erosion-conducive land use (wood pasture, wood cutting, and rotational slash-and-burn cultivation). Detritus input diminished when land use slowed down with population decrease as the consequence of plague epidemics, warfare and emigration. After 1870, forest regeneration and improving agricultural practices led to a stabilization of the catchment. Erosion and detritus deposition decreased progressively. The negative correlation of detritus deposition with the gradually increasing temperature presumably mimics a cause-effect relation, although a link with decreasing freeze-thaw action is possible. The modernization of agriculture proceeded with manuring and fertilizing, which caused an increase of lake productivity as indicated by summer blooms of diatoms with enhanced nutrient demand, increased delta C-13(org) values and sulfur concentrations. Within this well established data base we found combinations of criteria that may be used to deduce natural climatic or anthropogenic influences. The quantitative attribution of these influences remains a challenging task in paleolimnology because their interaction makes the detection of linking mechanisms difficult even at high degree of detail and the processes themselves remain debatable.

J	Pépino, M; Magnan, P; Leroux, R; Bertolo, A				Pepino, Marc; Magnan, Pierre; Leroux, Riwan; Bertolo, Andrea			Thermal habitat fragmentation in stratified lakes induces resource waves that brook charr track across seasons	OIKOS												The spatial configuration of thermal habitats constrains the thermoregulatory performance of ectotherms. Thermal landscapes also vary through time, which is particularly relevant in seasonal environments such as temperate lakes. Indeed, elevated temperatures in the epilimnion of dimictic lakes during summer could substantially reduce the use of this habitat by cold-stenothermic fish during the stratified period. The main objective of this study was to evaluate whether thermal habitat fragmentation in stratified lakes modulates accessibility to resources that brook charr, Salvelinus fontinalis, which is a mobile consumer, can track across seasons. More specifically, we hypothesize that reduced access to the littoral habitat during summer enhances foraging opportunities in this habitat during winter. We used an automatic acoustic telemetry system offering full coverage of the lake to continuously record brook charr locations across seasons, and we estimated zoobenthos abundances in the littoral habitat using image processing and semi-automatic classification. While brook charr concentrate in the metalimnion of the pelagic habitat in summer, most individuals in winter shift to a shallow bay that is unexploited in summer due to thermal constraints. In this habitat, zoobenthos abundance is more than twice as high at the end of the summer compared to littoral habitats close to the thermal refuge in the pelagic habitat. Surprisingly, brook charr showed strong within-lake site fidelity between two consecutive summers, which suggests that spatial memory could be a key driver of seasonal habitat use in this lacustrine population. Overall, our results suggest that thermal barriers create fragmentation between littoral and pelagic habitats that in turn produces resource opportunities that brook charr can track across seasons.

J	Rössler, O; Brönnimann, S				Roessler, Ole; Bronnimann, Stefan			The effect of the Tambora eruption on Swiss flood generation in 1816/1817	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The Tambora volcano erupted in April 1815 caused many direct and indirect impacts on the climate system, as well as ecosystems and societies around the world. In Switzerland, the eruption contributed to the 1816 "Year Without a Summer", which is considered to be a key factor in generating the highest flooding ever documented of the Lake Constance (7th July 1817) and the flood of the Rhine in Basel. Snow was reported to remain during the summer of 1816, which laid the basis for a massive snow accumulation in the spring of 1817. The meltwater together with a triggering event led to the reported flooding. We aim to create a hydro-meteorological reconstruction of the 1816/1817 period in Switzerland to verify and quantify the historical sources and place them into present-day context. We used an analogue method that was based on historical measurements to generate temperature and precipitation fields for 1816/1817. These data drove a hydrological model that covers the Rhine Basin to Basel. We reproduced the reported features of the hydroclimate, especially in regards to the temperature and snow storage. We showed that the snow storage in spring 1816 and 1817 was substantial and attained the magnitude of a recent extreme, snow-rich-winter (1999). However, simulations suggest that the snowfall alone in the spring of 1817, rather than the enduring snow from 1815/1816, led to the meltwater produced from the snow pack that contributed to the flooding in Lake Constance and Basel. These events were strongly underestimated, as the triggering rainfall event was reconstructed too weak. Artificial scenarios reveal that a precipitation amount with a magnitude higher than the largest recent flood (2005) was necessary to generate the documented flood levels. We conclude that these Tambora-following flood events were a product of an adverse combination of extreme weather within an extreme climate. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Mean overall range of Fox River fish was 32.1 km (5.5-77.4 km) and 57.6 km (2.3-158.5 km) for Wolf River fish. Mean range was not significantly different between rivers (P = 0.158). Summer ranges averaged 16.7, 6.8, and 12.9 km for Fox River fish and 7.6, 5.6, and 4.5 km for Wolf River fish during three summers. Winter ranges averaged 2.4 and 5.9 km for Fox River fish and 3.6 and 1.9 km for Wolf River fish during two winters. Summer ranges were significantly greater than winter ranges (P = 0.048). Fish showed strong river and site fidelity returning to the same river reach and often the same woody structure in successive years during spawning and summer period. Summer site fidelity was 89% in the Fox River and 87% in the Wolf River. Winter site fidelity was 56% in the Fox River and 86% in the Wolf River. Most fish returned to wintering areas in the upper river lakes; however, 31% of Fox River fish and 25% of Wolf River fish wintered in the rivers in deep pool habitat. Fish that wintered in the rivers returned to the same pools in successive years. Upstream movement began in late April and May when water temperatures approached 15 degrees C and stabilized in mid-June when water temperatures reached 20 degrees C. Downstream movement began in August and peaked in September when water temperatures declined from 20 degrees C to 15 degrees C. Mean depth at fish locations during mid-April to mid-September averaged 2.1 m for the Fox River and 3.6 m for the Wolf River. Large woody structure was the dominant cover type used by Fox (83%) and Wolf (69%) river fish during the same time period.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-25-7				2011	77						455	471																WOS:000393725100038

Accurately identifying trends in precipitation is essential for understanding the evolution of the water cycle in the context of climate change. This study uses an innovative trend analysis (ITA), an innovative polygon trend analysis (IPTA), and wavelet analysis to analyze precipitation at multiple timescales (annual, seasonal, and monthly), and the influencing factors at 30 meteorological stations in the Tai Lake Basin (TLB) from 1971 to 2018. The main conclusions are as follows: 1) the annual precipitation had a significantly increasing trend, while high precipitation had the largest increasing trend, leading to a further increase in the flood risk in the TLB. The precipitation trend mainly decreased in spring and autumn, whereas it mainly increased in summer and winter. Precipitation in different months played crucial but varying roles in the corresponding seasons; there was a sharp transition trend from August to September, whereas the transition from January to February was relatively stable. 2) There was a complex nonlinear relationship between precipitation and atmospheric teleconnection. The dominant tele-correlation alone could not explain the relationship between precipitation and large-scale circulation. The highest percentage of significant power includes the optimal combination of variables meant to explain the precipitation variations. 3) The detection results from the ITA method and classic trend analysis methods (Linear regression analysis, Mann Kendall, and Modified Mann Kendall) were consistent; the non-monotonic trends masked by these methods were detectable. IPTA can systematically identify consecutive seasons and monthly transition characteristics as a supplement to ITA. This study can, therefore, provide a reference for water resource management and the prevention and control of droughts and floods.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				JUN	2022	139								108868	10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.108868	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.108868		APR 2022											WOS:000795544700003

We compiled data from 389 lakes in Fennoscandia and eastern North America to investigate the effects of climate on lake TP concentrations. Synchrony in year-to-year variability is an indicator of climatic influences on lake TP, because other major influences on nutrients (e.g., land use change) are not likely to affect all lakes in the same year. We identified significant synchrony in lake TP both within and among different geographic regions. Using a bootstrapped random forest analysis, we identified winter temperature as the most important factor controlling annual TP, followed by summer precipitation. In Fennoscandia, TP was negatively correlated with the winter East Atlantic Pattern, which is associated with regionally warmer winters. Our results suggest that, in the absence of other overriding factors, lake TP and productivity may decline with continued winter warming in northern lakes.

A 13,600-year diatom oxygen isotope record from the South Carpathians (Romania): Reflection of winter conditions and possible links with North Atlantic circulation changes	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												This study provides a continuous lateglacial and Holocene record of diatom silica oxygen isotope changes (delta O-18(DIAT)) in a subalpine lake sediment sequence obtained from the Retezat Mts (Taul dintre Brazi, 1740 m a.s.l.). This through-flow, shallow, high-altitude lake with a surface area of only 0.4 ha has short water residence time and is predominantly fed by snowmelt and rainwater. Its delta O-18(DIAT) record principally reflects the oxygen isotope composition of the winter and spring precipitation, as diatom blooms occur mainly in the spring and early summer. Hence, changes in delta O-18(DIAT) are interpreted as seasonal scale changes: in the amount of winter precipitation. Low oxygen isotope values (27-28.5 parts per thousand) occurred during the lateglacial until 12,300 cal BP, followed by a sharp increase thereafter. In the Holocene delta O-18(DIAT) values ranged from 29 to 31 parts per thousand until 3200 cal BP, followed by generally lower values during the late Holocene (27-30 parts per thousand). Short-term decreases in the isotopic values were found between 10,140-9570, 9000-8500, 7800-7300, 6300-5800, 5500-5000 and at 8015, 4400, 4000 cal BP. After 3200 cal BP a decreasing trend was visible with the lowest values between 3100-2500 and after 2100 cal BP The general trend in the record suggests that contribution of winter precipitation was generally lower between 11,680 and 3200 cal BP, followed by increased contribution during the last millennia. The late Holocene decrease in delta O-18(DIAT) shows good agreement with the speleothem delta O-18, lake level and testate amoebae records from the Carpathian Mountains that also display gradual delta O-18 decrease and lake level/mire water table level rise after 3200 cal BR Strong positive correlation with North Atlantic circulation and solar activity proxies, such as the Austrian and Hungarian speleothem records, furthermore suggested that short-term increases in the isotopic ratios in the early and mid Holocene are likely connectable to high solar activity phases and high frequency of positive North Atlantic Oscillation indexes that may have resulted in decreased winter precipitation in this region.

About 80% of parr and residents live at depths < 5 m, smolts and migrants are more confined to near-surface water. Brown trout partly segregate by size, age and sex from spring through autumn. More than 90% of parr and residents in the tributaries are 0-2 years old, 2-14 cm in length, in the littoral zone 0-3 years old, 7-24 cm in length, and in the pelagic zone 2-6 years old, 18-32 cm in length. The mean body length of equal-aged fish increases from tributaries through littoral to pelagic zones in the lake. Smolts (2-7 years, 14-29 cm) leave the lake from April through August and return during September-October. Migrants (2-11 years, 23-67 cm) leave the lake in April-May and return during August-September: sexually mature fish return earlier than immatures. Female brown trout are less stream-dwelling, but more migrant and pelagic than males. Most individuals in the lake population spend the winter in the littoral zone. In the tributaries, diet differs significantly between age-groups of parr; young fish feed on smaller food items than do older fish. In the lake, parr and residents living in the same habitats feed on the same food items. Littoral brown trout feed mainly on insect larvae and chironomid pupae, pelagic brown trout feed on zooplankton and surface insects. Migrants feed little while staying in freshwater, except for matures which feed on young salmonids and surface arthropods during the 2 first months after they had returned from coastal waters. The results are discussed in relation to growth possibilities and mortality risks of the different habitats.																			0378-1909	1573-5133					1985	14	4					281	293		10.1007/BF00002633	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00002633													WOS:A1985AWL7500007

Alterations to natural sediment transport such as those caused by hydropower dams and associated reservoirs must be understood since the entire ecosystem will be affected. The purpose of this research is to quantify the downstream effects that the Mactaquac Generating Station (MQGS) has on the sediment dynamics in the Wolastoq|Saint John River (W|SJR) in New Brunswick, Canada; we are specifically investigating how the downstream Grand Lake Meadows Complex (GLM Complex) has been affected by the changes in suspended sediment load. In order to understand implications of changes in sediment, wemust first estimate howmuch sediment enters the reservoir, and the relationship between inflowing sediment and depositing sediment. Hydraulic parameters such as total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity and trap efficiency (TE) were used in this research to quantify the amount of suspended sediment entering the reservoir since the construction of the MQGS in 1968. Field data were collected during the summer and fall months to estimate suspended sediment concentrations, and a linear relationship between turbidity and TSS was developed during ice cover months to complete a year-round dataset. The relationships were generated for four different reaches in the lowerWolastoq vertical bar Saint John River and were used as a passive method for estimating TSS concentrations. The relationships had R2 values of 0.85, 0.88, 0.95 and 0.98 for the Meductic, Longs Creek, MQGS and Bill Thorpe Walking Bridge sites, respectively. In the study region, sediment transport peaks with the high flows during the spring freshet and fall rain storms and reduces with the low flows during the summer and winter months. The results of this research will further the understanding of sediment dynamics locally, and the impacts on the development and formation of the GLM Complex, while also advancing our understanding of sediment dynamics and regulated rivers in general.																			2366-2557	2366-2565	978-3-031-61521-4; 978-3-031-61519-1; 978-3-031-61518-4				2024	503						205	213		10.1007/978-3-031-61519-1_15	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-61519-1_15													WOS:001413975200015

Zooplankton changes at six reservoirs in the Ebro watershed, Spain	LIMNETICA												In the present study, six reservoirs of the Ebro watershed were sampled during summer and autumn of 2016, with the objective of recognizing the zooplankton community, the environmental variables that are correlated with them and update the species checklist. We identify 40 zooplankton species among reservoirs: 21 rotifer species, 10 cladocerans, 8 copepods, and the veliger larvae of the invasive zebra mussel. Species that had higher abundances and biomass were: the rotifer Polyarthra dolichoptera (up to 278 ind/L), the cladoceran genera Daphnia spp. and Ceriodaphnia spp., the copepods Copidodiaptomus numidicus (83 ind/L), Acanthocyclops americanus (72 ind/L), Eudiaptomus vulgaris (62 ind/L) and zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha (540 ind/L). In general, the smaller species were dominant during the summer while the larger species were dominant in the autumn. The density and biomass of zooplankton in four out of six reservoirs during the summer were double that in autumn. The main physicochemical variables correlated with the zooplankton species through a Canonical Correspondences Analysis (CCA) were: chlorophyll a, Secchi disk, total phosphorus, pH and depth. We report for the first time the species presented at the Ullibarri-Gamboa reservoir, and present new species registered in the reservoirs compared with those reported in previous studies. For the first time, the presence of the zebra mussel was detected at La Sotonera reservoir. This indicate its expansion throughout the watershed, suggesting that knowledge of zooplankton species and the changes that occur through time can be a tool for reservoirs and watershed management.

The research was performed in spring, summer and autumn 2018 at four research stations located along the reservoir and in three sediments layers: 0-5 cm, 5-10 cm and 10-15 cm. The values of delta C-13-CH4 in pore water, the fractionation coefficient alpha(CH4-CO2), and the delta C-13 isotope mass balance of pore water CH4 and CO2 were used to determine the temporal and spatial changes of CH4 production pathways. The obtained values of delta C-13-CH4 in the pore water of the Nielisz Reservoir ranged from -68.40% to -50.87%, the alpha(CH4-CO2) values varied from 1.04 to 1.07, and the calculated contributions of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in the total production of CH4 (fCH(4,h)) ranged from 7% to 85%. These values varied depending on the research station and the sediment layer studied. During the entire study period, both acetate and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis participated in CH4 and the contribution of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis increases in the deeper layers of sediment and in the autumn season. The main controlling factor of CH4 production pathways in sediments is the qualitative composition of organic matter (content of labile organic matter and humic substances).

Although the data set is relatively limited, it still covers 263 days and characterizes well the basic properties of wave climate in this water body. The wave regime is mostly calm, with the long-term average significant wave height below 0.3 m and seas with H-s < 1.2 m covering at least 2/3 of the ice-free time. The seasonal variation in wave properties mimics the analogous variation in the wind speed, with the most stormy months October-December. Wave heights are, on average, considerably lower in summer (July-August) than in autumn (October-November). Significant wave heights >1 m were recorded in autumn and covered 3% or the measurement time. The maximum recorded wave height H-s = 1.98 m occurred on October 27, 2005. The mean periods are mostly concentrated in a range of 1.5-2.5 s and exhibit an almost Gaussian distribution.

J	Pulatsü, S; Akçora, A; Köksal, FT				Pulatsü, S; Akçora, A; Köksal, FT			Sediment and water phosphorus characteristics in a pond of spring origin, Sakaryabasi springs basin, Turkey	WETLANDS												The purpose of this study was to determine the changes in concentrations of phosphorus and iron in pondwater and porewater in the littoral zone of Sakaryabasi-Kirkgiz pond in central Turkey. The pond supplies water to the Rainbow Trout Fish Culture and Research Station in four months in which temperatures do not show a strong variation (16degreesC-22degreesC). Concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus were 4- to 5-fold higher in porewater than in pondwater; thus, diffusion of SRP from porewater to pondwater might be possible. Water content of the sediment was high, although loss on ignition ranged from 13 to 18% and iron content ranged from 0.16 to 0.22 mg/gdw. The total phosphorus content of the sediment was high, with a range 0.64 to 1.70 mg/gdw, and organic phosphorus was the dominant sedimentary phosphate pool in October, January, and April. Despite having calcerous sediment in the drainage area, a relatively low quantity of phosphorus was bound to calcium and aluminium. In April and October, sediment phosphorus and SRP in porewater and overlying water were greater than in other months. Our results suggest that it would be more appropriate to control phosphorus concentration in spring and autumn than in the warm summer months.					; Koksal, Fatma/D-1320-2010; Pulatsü, Serap/AAF-1648-2020	Toksoy-Koksal, Fatma/0000-0003-3187-4838; Pulatsu, Serap/0000-0001-5277-417X													0277-5212					MAR	2003	23	1					200	204		10.1672/0277-5212(2003)023[0200:SAWPCI]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1672/0277-5212(2003)023[0200:SAWPCI]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000181785300019

The present situation and contributing factors of utilization of the tree species resources in the parks and gardens of the West Lake were analyzed, and some corresponding suggestions were proposed. The results were as follows: 1) There were 166 species of woody vascular plants in the parks and gardens of the West Lake, which belonged to 58 families and 108 genera. Compared with zonal plant species in Hangzhou and landscape plants in advanced foreign cities, the plant species number was very low. 2) About 30 species had high important value and application frequency. It indicated that the arbor and shrub species in each community in the parks and gardens of the West Lake was small at present. 3) The results of study of diameter class structure showed that, the average breast-height diameter of trees in the West Lake was 34cm, and about 67% trees had 20-40cm breast-height diameter. It indicated that a majority of trees were mature. 4) The results of study of health status showed that, most plant species developed well. 5) The results of study of seasonal aspect showed that, the plant landscape in the parks and gardens of the West Lake had different characteristics in different seasons, which were numerous flowers in spring, green shades in summer, colorful leaves in autumn and beautiful branches and trunks in winter.																			1022-6680		978-3-03785-661-1				2013	671-674						2819	2824		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.671-674.2819	http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.671-674.2819													WOS:000323185101236

Ebinur Lake Wetland, the most representative temperate arid zone wetland ecosystem in China, is the centre of oasis and desertification of the northern slope of Tianshan conjugate. Soil samples were collected from three sites (Tamarix ramosissima, Halocnemum strobilaceum and Phragmites australis) and different soil layers (0 5, 5 15, 15 25 and 25-35 cm) in this wetland in spring, summer and autumn and were used to characterize the diversity of AOB based on the ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) gene. Polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and bivariate correlation analysis were used to analyse the relationship between the diversity of AOB and soil environment factors. The PCR-DGGE indicated that the diversity of AOB was high in the entire sample and the Shannon diversity index varied from 1.369 to 2.471. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the amoA fragments were grouped into Nitrosospira sp. and Nitrosomonas sp. Most amoA gene sequences fell within the Nitrosospira sp. cluster, and only a few sequences were clustered with Nitrosomonas sp., indicating that Nitrosospira sp. may be more adaptable than Nitrosomonas sp. in this area. Bivariate correlation analysis showed that the diversity of AOB was significantly correlated with soil organic matter, conductivity, total phosphorus and nitrate in the Ebinur Lake Wetland in Xinjiang.																			1310-2818	1314-3530					2016	30	2					305	313		10.1080/13102818.2015.1124738	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2015.1124738													WOS:000372200700013

FRACTIONS AND TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF PHOSPHORUS IN THE SEDIMENTS OF SANCHA LAKE	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The fraction and distribution characteristics of phosphoms in the sediments of Sancha Lake were studied using the SMT Phosphorus fraction method and its influencing factors were discussed. According to the research results, total phosphoms (TP) content in the sediments was 270.00-3,722.80 mu g.g(-1), the organophosphoms (OP) content was 64.00-774.43 mu g.g(-1), the inorganic phosphoms (IP) content, a main phosphoms fraction, was 164.00-3,006.99 mu g.g(-1), accounting for about 69.32% of TP, the HC1-P content, a main phosphoms fraction of IP, was 125.00-2,474.04 mu g.g(-1), accounting for about 69.19% of IP, and the NaOH-P content was less, i.e. 51.00-689.72 mu g.g(-1), accounting for about 30.73% of IP. Different phosphoms fractions had obvious temporal and spatial variation; all the sampling sites showed a general trend where the phosphoms fraction content was higher in winter and lower in summer, similar in spring and autumn. The content of organic matter in the sediments had significant correlation with OP, NaOH-P had significant correlation with Fe in the sediments, between HC1-P in the sediments had significant correlation with Ca, APA had significant positive correlation with OP. However, the pH, TN, dissolved oxygen and temperature had no significant correlation with various phosphoms fractions.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2019	17	5					11731	11743		10.15666/aeer/1705_1173111743	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1705_1173111743													WOS:000490563900098

However, studies on GHGs fluxes from lacustrine groundwater discharge (LGD) remain limited, particularly for subtropical alluvial-lacustrine plains. This study used the radon (222Rn) mass balance model to quantify seasonal variations in LGD rates and fluxes of groundwater-borne GHGs (CH4, CO2, N2O) to the Tian-E-Zhou oxbow lake in Jianghan Plain, central Yangtze. The results showed that the LGD rate in winter was 57.67 & PLUSMN; 28.37 mm/d which was higher than that in summer (24.72 & PLUSMN; 12.16 mm/d). The groundwater-borne fluxes of CH4, CO2, and N2O into the lake in winter were 7.84 & PLUSMN; 6.81 mmol m  2 d  1, 1.47 & PLUSMN; 1.07 mmol m  2 d  1, and 3.50 & PLUSMN; 1.90 x 10  5 mmol m  2 d  1, respectively, whereas that in summer were 1.48 & PLUSMN; 2.36 mmol m  2 d  1, 0.72 & PLUSMN; 0.47 mmol m  2 d  1, and 1.53 & PLUSMN; 1.00 x 10  5 mmol m  2 d  1, respectively. High groundwater-borne fluxes of CH4 across both winter and summer could be attributed to abundant buried organic carbon and strong groundwater reducing environment in this subtropical alluvial-lacustrine plain. Seasonally, fluctuations in water levels mainly affected LGD rates, further resulting in greater groundwater-borne GHGs fluxes in winter than in summer. This study can act as an important reference for future studies on the role of groundwater as an emission pathway for GHGs in lakes of subtropical alluvial-lacustrine plains.					; Du, Yao/HDN-4489-2022; gan, yiqun/NPI-6826-2025; Xu, Jiawen/JEF-5028-2023; 邓, 娅敏/B-1275-2019	Deng, Yamin/0000-0002-4815-7176; Du, Yao/0000-0002-5954-5465; 													0883-2927	1872-9134				AUG	2023	155								105743	10.1016/j.apgeochem.2023.105743	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2023.105743		JUL 2023											WOS:001043824600001

Entrainment of the major species paralleled dominance and abundance observed in the lake, but yellow perch (Perca flavescens), brook stickleback (Eucalia inconstans) and slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus) caught in the lake-each ranging from 5 to 25% of the total catch-were not entrained. White sucker (Catostomus commersoni) was entrained but not captured in the lake. Size of individuals entrained, upper limit approximately 40 mm, paralleled size of individuals in the lake. Vertical distribution, and thus proximity to the submerged intake, greatly influenced entrainment rate.																									1979	36	1					37	41		10.1139/f79-005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f79-005													WOS:A1979GG14300005

Understanding seasonal phosphorus dynamics to guide effective management of shallow, hypereutrophic Grand Lake St. Marys, Ohio	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Grand Lake St. Marys, hereafter Grand Lake, is a large shallow reservoir in western Ohio that has become hypereutrophic in recent decades owing to external phosphorus (P) loading. To restore water quality in Grand Lake, managers must decide whether to reduce external P loading from tributaries or continue to reduce internal P loading from sediments using aluminum sulfate additions. To help managers identify the most effective strategies for water quality improvements in Grand Lake, we quantified the reservoir's seasonal P dynamics using tributary and in-reservoir P measurements during 2009-2011. We also tested the short-term effects of reduced external P loading on Grand Lake's water quality using a pond experiment performed at the adjacent St. Marys State Fish Hatchery. The highest P concentrations in Grand Lake (1660, 391, and 311g/L in 2009, 2010, and 2011, respectively) occurred in summer when external P loads from tributaries were minimal, suggesting internal P release from sediments was the major source of P to fuel cyanobacterial blooms. Results from our pond experiment showed that decoupling the reservoir from external P loading during summer months does not improve short-term water quality. We conclude that external P loading during winter and spring, coupled with internal P loading from sediments during summer, drive the extremely high P concentrations in summer that support dense cyanobacterial blooms. Long-term improvement in Grand Lake water quality will first require major reductions to the external P loads from tributaries, followed by manipulations to reduce internal P loading from sediments.

A total or 300 individuals was collected in monthly samples from September 2005 to August 2006 in Golbasi Lake, Turkey. Calculation of the gonadosomatic index and histological examination of the gonads showed that gametogenesis began in winter and spawning occurred in summer and early autumn. Although, Sex ratios or Anodonta gabillotia pseudodopsis were not significantly different from the expected 1: 1 ratio (p > 0.05). slightly female biased sex ration were recorded. Although mature oocytes and spermatozoa were present for almost the entire year, gonadal activity seemed lowest in October and December, when gonad recovery and reorganization were more evident than gametogenesis. Both sexes displayed greatest gonad activity during the summer months of the year. Three types of gonads were identified, which varied according to the proportion of gametogenic tissue. According to our morphologic and histologic observation, Anodonta gabillotia pseudodopsis were classified as accidental or abnormal hermaphrodite (typically in dioecious species) species.

In this study, we report that viable E. coli populations were repeatedly isolated from northern temperate soils in three Lake Superior watersheds from October 2003 to October 2004. Seasonal variation in the population density of soilborne E. coli was observed; the greatest cell densities, up to 3 X 10(3) CFU/g soil, were found in the summer to fall (June to October), and the lowest numbers, <= 1 CFU/g soil, occurred during the winter to spring months (February to May). Horizontal, fluorophore-enhanced repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR (HFERP) DNA fingerprint analyses indicated that identical soilborne E. coli genotypes, those with >= 92% similarity values, overwintered in frozen soil and were present over time. Soilborne E. coli strains had HFERP DNA fingerprints that were unique to specific soils and locations, suggesting that these E. coli strains became naturalized, autochthonous members of the soil microbial community. In laboratory studies, naturalized E. coli strains had the ability to grow and replicate to high cell densities, up to 4.2 X 10(5) CFU/g soil, in nonsterile soils when incubated at 30 or 37 degrees C and survived longer than 1 month when soil temperatures were <= 25 degrees C. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the growth of naturalized E. coli in nonsterile, nonamended soils. The presence of significant populations of naturalized populations of E. coli in temperate soils may confound the use of this bacterium as an indicator of fecal contamination.

In summer and autumn, the hydrogen sulfide concentration ranged from < 0.1 to 4 mg.S L-1. In this study, only hydrogen sulfide was observed in autumn and at two stations in summer. In contrast, some earlier studies reported in all seasons in Hiroshima Bay the presence of acid volatile sulfide, which is used as a proxy of sulfide content. The sulfur species in sediments were mainly identified as sulfate, thiosulfate, elemental sulfur, and pyrite. Thiosulfate was a minor component compared to the other sulfur species. The formation of pyrite and sulfur derived from hydrogen sulfide oxidation played an important role in the scavenging of hydrogen sulfide.					; NAKAI, Satoshi/D-7225-2011; Jadoon, Waqar/U-6842-2019; Asaoka, Satoshi/E-5472-2016; Hayakawa, Shinjiro/B-1840-2010; Nishijima, Wataru/D-7378-2011	Umehara, Akira/0000-0001-5174-3275; Nishijima, Wataru/0000-0002-8398-3449; Jadoon, Waqar/0000-0002-5750-3173; Hayakawa, Shinjiro/0000-0002-4187-6928; 													0025-326X	1879-3363				AUG	2018	133						891	899		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.06.042	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.06.042								30041392					WOS:000441853600099

West Point waters had low alkalinity (< 0.4 meq l-1) and low conductivity (< 75 .mu.s cm-1 at 20.degree. C) but N and P concentrations typically exceeded those considered apt to cause nuisance blooms of algae. Abiogenic turbidity was normally higher in the upstream areas of the reservoir than in the downstream areas and was several times higher in winter-spring than in summer-autumn due to increased rains and runoff. Primary productivity varied greatly both temporally and spatially. A mean value of 684 mg C m-2 d-1 was well within mesotrophic range and did not approach the highly eutrophic state predicted. Productivity increased from a low of 550 mg C m-2 d-1 in 1976 to high of 763 mg C m-2 d-1 in 1979. Observed variation in both chlorophyll a and primary productivity was more predictable in the cool (Dec.-March) than in the warm (June-Sept.) season and with plant nutrient data than without it. With plant nutrient data in the cool season 84% and 86% of the variation (r2) in chlorophyll a and productivity, respectively, were accounted for by the regression equations. During the warm season, with plant nutrient data, regression equations accounted for 44% and 68% of the variation in chlorophyll a and productivity, respectively. Higher r2 values in cool seasons resulted from the overriding influence of abiogenic turbidity on phytoplankton communities.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1983	13	5					477	489		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1983.tb00006.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1983.tb00006.x													WOS:A1983RL26500006
J	Rettig, JE; Schuman, LS; McCloskey, JK				Rettig, JE; Schuman, LS; McCloskey, JK			Seasonal patterns of abundance: do zooplankton in small ponds do the same thing every spring-summer?	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Small ponds ( <= 2 ha) are often a common landscape feature, but their ecology has been less well studied than that of lakes. Studies of some lakes and reservoirs show among-year repeatability in the seasonal abundance of different zooplankton (i.e., succession). For small ponds the seasonal dynamics of zooplankton community structure are relatively unstudied, as are any mechanisms underlying these dynamics. We took a community-level approach to studying the spring-summer abundance of zooplankton in two small Ohio ponds. In particular we wanted to know if repeatable patterns exist for zooplankton community structure in these ponds. We surveyed the spring-summer zooplankton communities in the ponds from 2001 to 2003 and used community-level ordination techniques (i.e., non-metric multidimensional scaling, NMDS) to characterize the assemblages. For both ponds the seasonal pattern of total zooplankton abundance differed significantly among years. We found that the proportional abundance of taxa across the season also varied among years. Elements of the zooplankton community, as described by the NMDS dimensions, showed among-year variation in the spring-summer trajectories that developed. Some of the variation in these zooplankton communities was associated with seasonal changes in water temperature. This among-year variation in the seasonal pattern of zooplankton community structure suggests that community dynamics in these small ponds may not be very repeatable. These complex dynamics of zooplankton thus challenges us to improve our characterization of zooplankton communities in small ponds such that we can better understand the factors that drive the patterns we observe.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2006	556						193	207		10.1007/s10750-005-1278-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-005-1278-y													WOS:000234198800015

Survival and growth of brown trout Salmo trutta L. embryos and the timing of hatching and emergence in two boreal lake outlet streams	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Survival, growth and hatching of brown trout Salmo trutta embryos were studied using in situ incubation experiments in two lake outlet streams in Finland. The experimental design in both streams included an outlet site and a reference site far downstream. The date of hatching was recorded and the Elliott-Hurley model was then used to predict the time of emergence based on water temperature. For data analyses, the incubation period was divided into 'winter' (from fertilization to mid March) and 'spring' (from mid March until the end of the experiment). Temperature of the large-lake outlet remained at 1 degrees C through the winter, while in other sites temperature was close to 0 degrees C. In spring, temperature increased more slowly in the large-lake outlet. The survival of embryos was overall very high, from 83 to 98%, and they were larger in the outlets than in the downstream sites. Embryos hatched at the large-lake outlet in March, and 3-5 weeks later in the other sites. Although there were considerable between-site differences in hatching intervals, difference in expected 50% emergence dates of the earliest and latest site was only 4 days. Thus, any growth advantage that the outlet embryos had in winter disappeared by the end of the alevin period. Lake outlets, however, may be important for age 0 year brown trout later during the summer when other stream habitats do not provide adequate food resources.

Considerable progress has been made in the study of phytoplankton dynamics in lakes; The long-term in situ evolution of dominant bloom -forming cyanobacteria in meso-eutrophic plateau lakes, however, lacks systematic research. Here, the monthly parameters from 12 sampling sites during the period of 1997 - 2022 were utilized to investigate the underlying mechanisms driving the superiority of bloom -forming cyanobacteria in Erhai, a representative meso-eutrophic plateau lake. The findings indicate that global warming will intensify the risk of cynaobacteria blooms, prolong Microcystis blooms in autumn to winter or even into the following year, and increase the superiority of filamentous Planktothrix and Cylindrospermum in summer and autumn. High RUE TN (1.52 Biomass/TN, 0.95 - 3.04 times higher than other species) under N limitation (TN < 0.5 mg/L, TN/TP < 22.6) in the meso-eutrophic Lake Erhai facilitates the superiority of Dolichospermum .

A distinct direct correlation was found between the specific rate of photosynthesis and the temperature during the summer-autumn season. In spring, the correlation was not so distinct; this period is characterized by higher photosynthetic activity of the phytoplankton due to a number of conditions favouring the development of algae: enrichment of water with nutrients, high daylight factor, and low biomasses in young populations of algae. An inverse correlation was found between the specific rate of photosynthesis and the phytoplankton biomass. The data obtained show that the introduction of nitrogen-phosphorus fertilizers into the lakes (in the absence of unfavourable factors) greatly increases the daily P/B coefficients. The specific rate of photosynthesis and the morphometry of laes were found to be correlated directly in small (up to 50 ha) lakes.																			0020-9309						1985	70	4					453	470		10.1002/iroh.19850700403	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19850700403													WOS:A1985ATC2500002

The study lakes, Tiefer See in NE Germany and Czechowskie in N Poland, have distinct morphology and bathymetry, and therefore, they are ideal to decipher local effects on seasonal deposition. The monitoring setup in both lakes is largely identical and includes instrumental observation of (i) meteorological parameters, (ii) chemical profiling of the lake water column including water sampling, and (iii) sediment trapping at both bi-weekly and monthly intervals. We then compare our monitoring data with varve micro-facies in the sediment record. One main finding is that calcite varves form complex laminae triplets rather than simple couplets as commonly thought. Sedimentation of varve sub-layers in both lakes is largely dependent on the lake mixing dynamics and results from the same seasonality, commencing with diatom blooms in spring turning into a pulse of calcite precipitation in summer and terminating with a re-suspension layer in autumn and winter, composed of calcite patches, plant fragments and benthic diatoms. Despite the common seasonal cycle, the share of each of these depositional phases in the total annual sediment yield is different between the lakes. In Lake Tiefer See calcite sedimentation has the highest yields, whereas in Lake Czechowskie, the so far underestimated re-suspension sub-layer dominates the sediment accumulation. Even in undisturbed varved sediments, re-suspended material becomes integrated in the sediment fabric and makes up an important share of calcite varves. Thus, while the biogeochemical lake cycle defines the varves' autochthonous components and micro-facies, the physical setting plays an important role in determining the varve sub-layers' proportion.

Event-Based Precipitation Isotopes in the Laurentian Great Lakes Region Reveal Spatiotemporal Patterns in Moisture Recycling	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Lake effect snowstorms influence climate, ecology, and agriculture in the Laurentian Great Lakes region and can be costly to surrounding communities in the United States and Canada. Stable isotopes of lake effect precipitation events throughout the year display a distinct signature that can be used to better understand how these storms may respond to a changing climate. Here we present event-based O-18 and H-2 of precipitation from a site in Skaneateles, NY, downwind of Lakes Ontario and Erie, between April 2015 and February 2018. We find a seasonal isotopic cycle with a well-defined signature of high deuterium excess (d-excess) during National Weather Service-defined lake effect snowstorms. Application of a previously developed moisture recycling model to this data set shows that up to 25% more moisture recycling takes place when the lake water and air temperature difference is large, air temperature is below freezing, and wind direction permits storms to move over Lake Ontario or Lake Erie. Moisture recycling occurs less frequently during spring, summer, and early fall due to meteorological and lake parameters that are less conducive to moisture recycling. Comparison of annual mean precipitation d-excess at sites both upwind and downwind of the Laurentian Great Lakes provides evidence that this high d-excess signature is characteristic of mean annual precipitation isotopic composition at downwind sites and therefore may be used to quantify changes in moisture recycling that occur on event to annual time scales in response to past and future climate changes.

Val			Quantifying the influence of cold water intrusions in a shallow, coastal system across contrasting years: Green Bay, Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We present water column thermal structure for two climatically different years: 2012, which experienced abnormally warm spring and summer air temperatures preceded by a relatively low ice winter and 2013, which experienced cooler than average spring and average summer air temperatures and preceded by average ice conditions. Mean bottom water temperatures for the season and during cold water intrusions were significantly warmer in 2012 than 2013 leading to a significantly reduced stratified season in 2012. Cold water intrusions were driven into southern Green Bay by southerly winds while intrusions were terminated when winds switched to persistent northerly winds. 2012 observed a significant increase in northerly winds relative to 2013, decreasing cold water intrusion presence and duration but winds did not fully explain the difference in thermal conditions for southern Green Bay. These cold bottom waters drive stratification in polymictic southern Green Bay while dimictic waters were found to have significantly warmer bottom temperatures during 2012 and a deeper mixed layer. Our observations suggest that relatively shallow (<20 m), seasonally stratified systems may not increase in stratification strength and duration under a warming climate; rather, changing wind climatology and surface heat flux can inform the degree to which the mixing regime can be expected to change and impact stratification and thermal structure of coastal systems. We discuss the biogeochemical implications of different thermal regimes, particularly within the context of multiple drivers of physical water column structure in eutrophic, stratified coastal systems.

Seasonal spatial distribution of juvenile lake sturgeon in Muskegon Lake, Michigan, USA	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												We examined seasonal spatial distribution and diel movements of juvenile lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens in Muskegon Lake, Michigan (a protected, drowned river mouth lake that links the Muskegon River to Lake Michigan). We surgically implanted ultrasonic tags in 20 juveniles (age 1-7) captured in gill nets to track their locations during August-December 2008/2009 and September 2010-October 2011. Most juveniles were observed 1.5km from the mouth of the Muskegon River in Muskegon Lake at a mean depth of 7.5m (SE=1.3m) during summer. In fall, juveniles moved away from the river mouth to the deepest part of Muskegon Lake and were observed at a mean depth of 15.8m (SE=1.3m) during winter. The shift in spatial distribution coincided with fall turnover (i.e., loss of thermal stratification) and with changes in dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in the hypolimnion. During summer, DO concentrations in the hypolimnion were typically <4mgl-1 in the deepest part of Muskegon Lake and DO concentrations at locations of tagged lake sturgeon were >7mgl-1 in 94% of instances. Tracking in 2009 revealed no significant change in depth distribution or movement over the diel cycle. We only observed two tagged juveniles immigrating to Lake Michigan, suggesting that juveniles use Muskegon Lake for multiple years. Our results suggest that: (i) Muskegon Lake serves as an important nursery habitat for juvenile lake sturgeon that hatched in the Muskegon River before they enter Lake Michigan and (ii) seasonal changes in DO concentration in the hypolimnion likely affect the spatial distribution of juveniles in Muskegon Lake.

Applicability of API ZYM to capture seasonal and spatial variabilities in lake and river sediments	ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY												Waters draining into a lake carry with them much of the suspended sediment that is transported by rivers and streams from the local drainage basin. The organic matter processing in the sediments is executed by heterotrophic microbial communities, whose activities may vary spatially and temporally. Thus, to capture and evaluate some of these variabilities in the sediments, we sampled six sites: three from the St. Clair River and three from Lake St. Clair in spring, summer, fall, and winter of 2016. At all sites and dates, we investigated the spatial and temporal variations in 19 extracellular enzyme activities using API ZYM. Our results indicated that a broad range of enzymes were found to be active in the sediments. Phosphatases, lipases, and esterases were synthesized most intensively by the sediment microbial communities. No consistent difference was found between the lake and sediment samples. Differences were more obvious between sites and seasons. Sites with the highest metabolic (enzyme) diversity reflected the capacity of the sediment microbial communities to breakdown a broader range of substrates and may be linked to differences in river and lake water quality. The seasonal variability of the enzymes activities was governed by the variations of environmental factors caused by anthropogenic and terrestrial inputs, and provides information for a better understanding of the dynamics of sediment organic matter of the river and lake ecosystems. The experimental results suggest that API ZYM is a simple and rapid enzyme assay procedure to evaluate natural processes in ecosystems and their changes.

Changes were greatest in the treated basin and during 1990-1993, when an upgraded injection system operated; injection rates of less than or equal to 1.3 t.day(-1) increased mean summer hypolimnetic DO concentrations from 1.0 (1980-1987) to 4.6 mg.L-1 (1990-1993). Summer hypolimnetic DO depletion rates nearly doubled relative to the pretreatment period. Mean summer hypolimnetic total phosphorus (TP) concentrations decreased from 123 to 56 mu g.L-1, despite low iron to phosphorus ratios near the sediments. Similarly, mean hypolimnetic ammonium concentrations declined from 120 to 42 mu g.L-1. Epilimnetic TP and chlorophyll a concentrations decreased to 87 and 45%, respectively, of pretreatment summer means. Oxygen consumption rates in the treated basin were lower in winter than in summer; injection rates of less than or equal to 0.8 t.d(-1) increased mean winter deepwater DO concentrations from 2.5 to 7.2 mg.L-1. In winter, mean deepwater TP concentrations decreased from 96 to 51 mu g.L-1. Oxygenation enhanced deepwater circulation in the treated basin in summer and winter. No changes were seen in two other reference basins during the study period. The hypolimnetic oxygen injection technology developed at Amisk Lake can be a cost-effective management tool for lakes with high hypolimnetic oxygen depletion rates related to high internal nutrient loading rates.																			0706-652X					SEP	1997	54	9					2111	2120		10.1139/f97-125	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f97-125													WOS:A1997YH98200017

THE MACROINVERTEBRATE COMMUNITY - ITS DEVELOPMENT, COMPOSITION, AND CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO EUTROPHICATION	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The macroinvertebrate communities of 4 flood control reservoirs in eastern Nebraska [USA], differing in age and degree of eutrophy were investigated from Ekman grab samples. Generally, the longer a reservoir had been influenced by eutrophication the larger the standing crop in it. Chironomids, ceratopogonids, fingernail clams and Hexagenia were important at various stages of eutrophication with Chironomus predominating in the most eutrophic reservoirs. Tubifex decreased with eutrophication as did Sphaerium simili while S. declive maintained its abundance and sometimes increased. The chironomids Chironomus, Coelotanypus and Procladius, fingernail clams and Tubifex were early colonizers in the newest reservoir and developed a total standing crop as large the 1st summer as in subsequent ones. Its composition became more diverse with time. In 1 reservoir sampled year-round, the standing crop was largest in late fall or early winter and smallest during summer. The most accurate information on macro-invertebrate standing crops in lakes and reservoirs comes from data collected on a year-round basis.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1980	75	1					7	25		10.1007/BF00006557	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006557													WOS:A1980KN86100001

This dimictic volcanic lake has a pH of 2.0-2.2. In summer, volcanic heat at the lake bottom results in a small water temperature difference of 3-7 degreesC between the epilimnion and hypolimnion. During the April-August stratification period in 1998, 1999, and 2002, the entire water column mixed for 1-8 d, when air temperature declined 4-8 degreesC from the epilimnion temperature. During these mixing events, anoxic, hydrogen sulfide-rich water from the hypolimnion spread over the entire lake. In contrast, distinct short-term turnover did not occur during the stratification period in 2000 or 2001. However, the early onset of autumn turnover in August 2000 and 2001 caused anoxic conditions with negative Eh values to persist for similar to2 weeks throughout the entire water column. Volcanic heat flux from the lake bottom fluctuated from 29.0 to 35.8 W m(-2) from year to year. The frequency and duration of short-term holomixis thus depended on interannual variations in volcanic heat flux and weather.					; Doi, Hideyuki/D-2012-2010	Doi, Hideyuki/0000-0002-2701-3982; 													0024-3590					NOV	2004	49	6					2287	2292		10.4319/lo.2004.49.6.2287	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2004.49.6.2287													WOS:000225137100036

Classical cultivation and modern high-throughput sequencing techniques provided quantification and identification of key phototrophic populations, including aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs (AAP). Annual dynamics found total heterotrophs reached 4.23 x 10(6) CFU/g in littoral sands, and 7.69 x 10(4) CFU/mL in summer littoral waters on oligotrophic media, higher counts than for copiotrophic compositions. Limnetic numbers inversely dipped to 4.34 x 10(3) CFU/mL midsummer. Cultured AAP did not follow heterotrophic trends, instead peaking during the spring in both littoral and limnetic waters as 19.1 and 4.7% of total copiotrophs, or 3.9 and 4.9% of oligotrophs, decreasing till autumn each year. Complementary observations came from environmental 16S V4 rRNA gene analysis, as AAP made up 1.49 and 1.02% of the littoral and limnetic sequenced communities in the spring, declining with seasonal progression. Spatial and temporal fluctuations of microbes compared to environmental factors exposed photosynthetic populations to independently and regularly fluctuate in the ecosystem. Oxygenic phototrophic numbers expectantly matched the midsummer peak of Chl a and b, oxygenic photosynthesis related carbon fixation, and water temperature. Independently, AAP particularly colonized spring littoral areas more than limnetic, and directly corresponded to habitat conditions that specifically promoted growth: the requirement of light and organic material.					; Kuzyk, Steven/JWQ-0585-2024	Kuzyk, Steven B./0000-0002-9046-0371; 														2076-2607				SEP	2022	10	9							1690	10.3390/microorganisms10091690	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms10091690								36144291					WOS:000858765200001

Urban climate effects on extreme temperatures in Madison, Wisconsin, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												As climate change increases the frequency and intensity of extreme heat, cities and their urban heat island (UHI) effects are growing, as are the urban populations encountering them. These mutually reinforcing trends present a growing risk for urban populations. However, we have limited understanding of urban climates during extreme temperature episodes, when additional heat from the UHI may be most consequential. We observed a historically hot summer and historically cold winter using an array of up to 150 temperature and relative humidity sensors in and around Madison, Wisconsin, an urban area of population 402 000 surrounded by lakes and a rural landscape of agriculture, forests, wetlands, and grasslands. In the summer of 2012 (third hottest since 1869), Madison's urban areas experienced up to twice as many hours >= 32.2 degrees C (90 degrees F), mean July T-MAX up to 1.8 degrees C higher, and mean July T-MIN up to 5.3 degrees C higher than rural areas. During a record setting heat wave, dense urban areas spent over four consecutive nights above the National Weather Service nighttime heat stress threshold of 26.7 degrees C (80 degrees F), while rural areas fell below 26.7 degrees C nearly every night. In the winter of 2013-14 (coldest in 35 years), Madison's most densely built urban areas experienced up to 40% fewer hours <= -17.8 degrees C (0 degrees F), mean January T-MAX up to 1 degrees C higher, and mean January T-MIN up to 3 degrees C higher than rural areas. Spatially, the UHI tended to be most intense in areas with higher population densities. Temporally, both daytime and nighttime UHIs tended to be slightly more intense during more-extreme heat days compared to average summer days. These results help us understand the climates for which cities must prepare in a warming, urbanizing world.

J	George, G; Hurley, M; Hewitt, D				George, Glen; Hurley, Margaret; Hewitt, Diane			The impact of climate change on the physical characteristics of the larger lakes in the English Lake District	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The larger lakes of the English Lake District have been the subject of intensive scientific study for more than 60 years. Year-to-year variations in the weather have recently been shown to have a major effect on their physical characteristics. The area is mild but very wet and the dynamics of the lakes are strongly influenced by the movement of weather systems across the Atlantic. 2. Here, we combine the results of long-term measurements and the projections from a Regional Climate Model (RCM) to assess the potential impact of climate change on the surface temperature and residence times of the lakes. 3. The RCM outputs used were produced by the U.K. Hadley Centre and are based on the IPCC 'A2' scenario for the emission of greenhouse gases. These suggest that winters in the area will be very much milder and wetter by the 2050s and that there will be a pronounced reduction in the summer rainfall. 4. An analysis of the meteorological data acquired between 1940 and 2000 shows that there have been progressive increases in the winter air temperature and in the rainfall which are correlated with the long-term change in the North Atlantic Oscillation. The trends reported during the summer were less pronounced and were correlated with the increased frequency of anticyclonic days and a decrease in the frequency of westerly days in the British Isles. 5. A simple model of the year-to-year variations in surface temperatures showed that the highest winter temperatures were recorded in the deeper lakes and the highest summer temperatures in the lakes with the shallowest thermoclines. When this model was used to predict the surface temperatures of the lakes in the 2050s, the greatest winter increase (+1.08 degrees C) was observed in the shallowest lake and the greatest summer increase (+2.18 degrees C) in the lake with the shallowest thermocline. 6. The model used to estimate the seasonal variation in the residence time of the lakes showed that the most pronounced variations were recorded in lakes with a short residence time. Average winter residence times ranged from a minimum of 10 days to a maximum of 436 days and average summer values from a minimum of 23 days to a maximum of 215 days. When this model was used to predict the residence time of the lakes in the 2050s, the greatest winter decrease (-20%) was observed in the smallest lake and the greatest summer increase (+92%) in the lake with the shortest residence time. 7. The results are discussed in relation to trends reported elsewhere in Europe and the impact of changes in the atmospheric circulation on the dynamics of the lakes. The most serious limnological effects were those projected for the summer and included a general increase in the stability of the lakes and a decrease in the flushing rate of the lakes with short residence times.

J	SPRUNG, M				SPRUNG, M			PHYSIOLOGICAL ENERGETICS OF THE ZEBRA MUSSEL DREISSENA-POLYMORPHA IN LAKES .2. FOOD UPTAKE AND GROSS GROWTH EFFICIENCY	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Food uptake of Dreissena polymorpha from two shallow water sites and one site at a 9 m depth in lakes was monitored over the course of 1 1/2 years. Feeding was characterized by the filtration capacity and ingestion capacity (i.e. the unrestricted maximum rates) at ambient temperature. The available food was estimated as seston dry weight, as seston ash free dry weight and as seston volume (sum of the volumes of the particles in the water column). The filtration capacity and ingestion capacity varied strongly during the course of the year by more than 1:10, with maximum values during late spring and early summer. The filtration capacity was correlated with water temperature, the ingestion capacity with temperature and seston concentration. However, at identical water temperatures both capacities were higher in spring than in autumn. At the 9 m site, filtration and ingestion capacity was also significantly influenced by lack of oxygen caused by stratification during summer. In the allometric equations by which both capacities (C) were related to body weight W(C=a W-b), an exponent b of 0.89+/-0.14 (mean+/-95% confidence interval) was calculated for the filtration capacity and 1.00+/-0.18 for the ingestion capacity. Both exponents did not vary significantly during the course of the year. The seasonal trend of the incipient limiting concentration (i.e. the seston concentration at which the intestine is filled to its capacity when the animal filters at maximum rate) was less pronounced. It showed a significantly positive correlation with seston concentration and a negative correlation with temperature. Except during the spring bloom, the incipient limiting concentration was in the range of the seston volume registered at the sites. Gross growth efficiencies were highly variable. An annual average between 5 and 20% was calculated. Growth efficiencies were lower at the shallow water sites with the highest seston concentrations.																			0018-8158					MAY 12	1995	304	2					133	146		10.1007/BF02579418	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02579418													WOS:A1995RC89600004

Patterns of age-0 yellow perch growth, diets, and mortality in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Identifying mechanisms influencing early-life survival may elucidate recruitment variability of fish populations. Yellow perch (Perca flavescens), are economically and ecologically important in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron, but have recently experienced low recruitment despite strong production of age-0 fish. Recent year classes have been characterized by slow first-year growth, as indexed by fall size of age-0 yellow perch; however, seasonal growth patterns and accompanying diet and survivorship patterns have not been documented for age-0 yellow perch in Saginaw Bay. To this end, we collected age-0 yellow perch weekly (larvae) and monthly (juveniles) throughout the first year of life during 2009 and 2010 to track changes in growth and diet composition. We also evaluated predation and over-winter energy-loss as potential mechanisms of size-selective mortality. Yellow perch growth, energy accumulation and size-specific condition decreased during late summer and fall. During larval and juvenile stages, predominant components of yellow perch diets transitioned from copepods to Daphnia and other zooplanlkton; however, we observed only weak ontogenetic shifts toward benthic prey. Smaller yellow perch a) were preferentially preyed upon by walleye (the bay's main piscivore) and b) displayed lower mass-specific energy content, potentially increasing overwinter starvation risk, suggesting that slow growth increases mortality risk. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that recruitment dynamics are influenced by an interplay of size-selective mortality and diet-induced reductions in growth.

The temporal trends were analyzed using the innovative trend analysis (ITA) method with significance testing. The ITA method results were compared with the Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test at a 95% confidence level. The comparison results revealed that the ITA method could effectively identify the trends detected by the MK trend test. Specifically, the MK test found that the time series percentage decreased from 46.15% in the north to 25.64% in the south, while the ITA method revealed a similar rate of decrease, from 39.2% to 29.4%. According to the temporal distribution of the MK test, significantly increasing (decreasing) trends were observed in 5 (0), 6 (2), 4 (3), 8 (0), and 8 (1) time series in annual, spring, summer, autumn, and winter river runoff data. At the same time, the ITA method detected significant trends in 7 (1), 9 (3), 6(3), 9 (3), and 8 (2) time series in the study area. As for the ITA method, the "peak" values of 24 time series (26.97%) exhibited increasing patterns, 25 time series (28.09%) displayed increasing patterns for "low" values, and 40 time series (44.94%) showed increasing patterns for "medium" values. According to the "low", "medium", and "peak" values, five time series (33.33%), seven time series (46.67%), and three time series (20%) manifested decreasing trends, respectively. These results detailed the patterns of annual and seasonal river runoff data series by evaluating "low", "medium", and "peak" values.					; ge, yongxiao/K-1251-2012	ji, li li/0000-0001-8483-1554; 														2073-4441				JAN	2021	13	1							95	10.3390/w13010095	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13010095													WOS:000606396700001

Spatial and temporal patterns of nearshore clarity in Lake Tahoe from fine resolution turbidity measurements	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Shanafield MA, Susfalk RB, Taylor KC. 2010. Spatial and temporal patterns of nearshore clarity in Lake Tahoe from fine resolution turbidity measurements. Lake Reserv Manage. 26: 178-184. The nearshore areas of lakes respond quickly to watershed runoff, increases in tributary inflows from annual snowmelt, and increased anthropogenic activity in the basin. Therefore, this area of the lake serves both as an early warning system for water quality degradation and as an indicator of the effectiveness of land management practices or sediment control projects. In this study we evaluated the usefulness of combining fine-scale water quality measurements and discrete particle sample analysis to gain a better understanding of seasonal and spatial trends in the nearshore area of Lake Tahoe. Turbidity and mineral composition at 0.5 m depth were measured in nearshore waters near the City of South Lake Tahoe at a spatial resolution of 5-30 m in 2002 and 2003. Particles filtered from discrete samples collected 200 m from shore were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and chemical analysis using quantum electron dispersive spectrometry. Baseline turbidity levels were extremely low (0.15 NTU) during calm periods in the fall but rose to levels above 4.0 NTU in response to winter and spring precipitation events and spring snowmelt runoff. Discrete samples collected 200 m from shore contained over 80% organic material during the dry part of the year and at least 50% mineral particles during the winter and spring. The effectiveness of this method for detecting variability in nearshore conditions at Lake Tahoe is promising for monitoring the littoral areas of other pristine lakes facing increased anthropogenic pressure and other watershed disturbances.					; Taylor, Kendrick/A-3469-2016	Shanafield, Margaret/0000-0003-1710-1548; Taylor, Kendrick/0000-0001-8535-1261													1040-2381	2151-5530					2010	26	3					178	184		10.1080/07438141.2010.504064	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438141.2010.504064													WOS:000288116800002

Particularly, the distribution and variation of AOD over the desert region of the southern Xinjiang basin which is one of the major Asian dust sources was described. To investigate the seasonal and yearly variation trends of the AOD over China, the linear trend was analyzed for each point during the 18 years. The correlations between AOD and terrain, Gross Domestic Product and Population Density were also analyzed. The results were as follows. (1) In China, the all-year high value (tau(MODIS) > 0.50) of the AOD occurred in the Sichuan basin, the Two Lakes Plain, North China, the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, the Guangzhong Plain, and the Jingjinji Metropolitan Region. In particular, the southern Xinjiang basin is not the high value center. While the all-year low value (tau(MODIS) < 0.20) of the AOD occurred in Northwest Sichuan, Southeast Xizang, the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau (Tibetan Plateau), Northern Xinjiang, Shanxi, Gansu, and Inner Mongolia. (2) The AOD over China varied with years from 2000 to 2017, which increased in the previous decade but gradually decreased from 2011. (3) The AOD changed more significantly with the seasons, with higher AOD in spring and summer, and lower in autumn and winter. (4) The AOD was negatively associated with Digital Elevation Model, with a Spearman correlation coefficient of -0.733, which was positively associated with Gross Domestic Product and Population Density, with Spearman correlation coefficients of 0.698 and 0.688.

Sub-hourly water temperature data collected across the Nechako Watershed, 2019-2021	DATA IN BRIEF												Water temperature is actively being monitored along the regulated Nechako River and some of its unregulated tributaries in northern British Columbia (BC) to determine how climate variability, climate change and flow regulation influence water temperatures. The Nechako Watershed, located mainly in the sub-boreal spruce biogeoclimatic zone, spans 47,200 km(2) in area [1]. The regional climate experiences a prominent seasonal cycle in air temperature and precipitation, with subfreezing temperatures and snow accumulating during winter. Waterways therefore experience extended near 0 degrees C water/ice temperatures during the winter season. The accumulation of snow yields snowmelt-generated peaks in discharge during the spring freshet period in unregulated tributaries [2]. Regional studies on climate reveal recent warming trends that are anticipated to persist through the 21st century, with a projected mean air temperature increase of similar to 2 degrees C by the 2050's [3]. In response to warming air temperatures, regional water temperatures are also on the rise, with an average warming trend of 0.7 degrees C from 1950 to 2015 [4]. Changing water temperatures are important in understanding ecological and environmental impacts on riverine systems, including aquatic species such as fish (e.g., sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), all endemic species to the Nechako Watershed), invertebrates, and microorganisms. Managing water temperatures during the fish spawning season is crucial as elevated temperatures induce stress and affect reproduction success [5]. Starting with a pilot project in summer of 2019, we expanded in situ monitoring of water temperature to 29 sites; however, for the purposes of this paper, only data from 24 sites are included (some sites have limited data samples or loggers could not be retrieved in the field). Currently, 25 sites are fully operational and collecting data, all deployed to sample and record data at 15-minute intervals starting at the top of the hour. Site data collection occurs at minimum once annually (typically during summer/early fall), along with site and logger maintenance. Field notes are taken to identify any potential issues with data collection, such as loggers dewatering during low flows, duration of logger removal for data collection, and any other environmental concerns that should later be considered during data analysis. The assembled data are useful to build long-term time series of observed water temperatures within the Nechako Watershed and as a baseline for future projects. The data are also used to determine the effectiveness of the Summer Temperature Management Program at the Nechako Reservoir and Skins Lake Spillway [1]. Therefore, these data can be used in the future to better identify the optimal discharge from the reservoir to minimize ecological effects on the watershed. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

J	Futia, MH; Marsden, JE				Futia, Matthew H.; Marsden, J. Ellen			Movement behaviours of stocked and wild lake trout Salvelinus namaycush determined using acoustic telemetry	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Hatchery practices are a critical tool of fisheries management to supplement diminished fish populations and restore extirpated species. However, stocking programs that successfully restore self-sustaining populations are rare. Unintentional artificial selection and domestication of hatchery-reared fish are potential limitations to the success of stocked individuals by selecting for behaviours that are poorly suited for natural conditions. Here, we compared seasonal movement behaviours between an established population of hatchery origin (stocked) and naturally produced (wild) lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in Lake Champlain at a range of sizes, including immature and mature fish. Fifty-six stocked and 34 wild lake trout were implanted with acoustic transmitters, including 45 transmitters with temperature and pressure (depth) sensors, to evaluate three-dimensional movement. Movement behaviours were assessed based on the number of distinct lake regions used, proportional time spent among lake regions, average daily distance travelled and depth distribution. Overall, horizontal and vertical movements were similar between stocked and wild lake trout across sizes, although individuals tended to occupy shallower depths at larger sizes. Seasonal differences in movement behaviours were observed and in some cases were dependent on origin. For all lake trout, average daily movement was greatest during fall and least during summer. Depth occupied, however, had an opposite trend, with the deepest average depths during summer and shallowest during fall and winter. The proportion of time spent among lake regions and variability in depth occupied also varied seasonally but only for wild fish, and included less time spent in individual regions and greater depth variability during fall compared to other seasons. While origin had insignificant effects in most models we evaluated, model predictions consistently suggested stocked lake trout had slightly smaller movements than wild fish. These results suggest that hatchery practices may have long-term, unintended effects on fish behaviour yet overall differences are likely subtle.

Exploiting seasonal habitat use of the common carp, Cyprinus carpio, in a lacustrine system for management and eradication	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The control of invasive species is a major challenge to the preservation of native ecosystems, both terrestrial and aquatic. A population of the invasive common carp, Cyprinus carpio, was detected in Lakes Sorell and Crescent, Tasmania, Australia, in the mid-1990s. Early detection allowed for the containment of their population to this lacustrine system. Radio-telemetry was subsequently used over a 5-year period to understand seasonal distribution of carp in relation to environmental parameters to guide efficient eradication strategies. The present study found that fish displayed increased mobility during spring-summer periods, moving into shallow habitat rich in macrophytes, particularly during years of high lake levels. During years of low lake levels, this pattern was altered with frequent use of a rocky 'secondary' habitat in Lake Sorell. During winter, carp congregated in deeper habitat in Lake Sorell, whereas no habitat-specific winter aggregations were found in Lake Crescent. The increased knowledge of spatio-temporal preferences of carp provided a basis for deploying barriers to facilitate the capture of fish and sabotage spawning events. The results have led to the eradication of carp from Lake Crescent and a significant reduction of their population in Lake Sorell.					; Hartmann, Klaas/B-3991-2008; Tracey, Sean/J-7446-2014; Patil, Jawahar/B-9527-2012	Patil, Jawahar G/0000-0002-2154-4627; Tracey, Sean/0000-0002-6735-5899; 													1323-1650	1448-6059					2012	63	7					587	597		10.1071/MF11252	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF11252													WOS:000306293200003
J	Wang, ZY; Jiang, XW; Ke, ZJ; Song, YF				Wang, Zunya; Jiang, Xingwen; Ke, Zongjian; Song, Yafang			Interannual variation of the onset of the Tibetan Plateau rainy season and its relationship with the sea surface temperature in the North Pacific	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												The onset of the Tibetan Plateau rainy season (OTPRS) marks the transition from dry season to wet season in situ, which has a great impact on the water cycle and atmospheric heating in extensive areas. This analysis found that the earlier OTPRS is controlled by the weakened westerly wind, a dipole vortex pair with an anomalous anti-cyclone over Lake Baikal but an anomalous cyclone over the Tibetan Plateau, the intensified southerly water vapour transportation on the southern edge of the Tibetan Plateau, the active convection and the increased humidity over the Tibetan Plateau in spring. And the opposite circulation anomalies correspond to the later OTPRS. The interannual variation in the OTPRS is closely related to sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) in the North Pacific in the previous winter, with the opposite phase between the 'tongue' extending eastward from the China East Sea and the surrounding 'semi-circle' in the east. This pattern features the third leading mode of the winter SSTA in the North Pacific and can persist to spring. The vertical motion, convergence and divergence associated with the direct thermal effect from the significant SSTA centres in the southeastern and northwestern North Pacific form two opposite zonal circulation circles along 30 degrees N. The zonal circulation circles bridge the SSTA in the North Pacific and the circulation anomalies over the Tibetan Plateau and have a delayed impact on convection over the Tibetan Plateau, thereby affecting the OTPRS.					jiang, xingwen/AFK-0156-2022														0899-8418	1097-0088				AUG	2023	43	10					4662	4676		10.1002/joc.8109	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.8109		MAY 2023											WOS:000993992600001

In this study, the temporal occurrence and sources of four classes of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), in suspended particulate matter (SPM) from the river mouth were investigated monthly during 2014. Results show that concentrations of all four POPs in SPM were higher than those in the sediment of Lake Chaohu. PBDEs (26.7 ng g(-1) dry weight (dw)) were originated mainly from commercial deca-BDE mixtures. PCB concentrations (1.336 ng dw) were lower than those of sediments in many other water bodies worldwide. PAHs (2597 ng g(-1) dw) and OCPs (5738 ng g(-1) dw) were the most common POPs. PAHs mainly had high molecular weights and originated from pyrolytic sources, with a small proportion of petrogenic origin. The predominant OCPs were DDT5, heptachlorep-oxides, dieldrin, hexachlorocyclohexanes, hexachlorobenzene, and chlordanes. Most OCPs originated from historical use, except lindane. Generally, of all the POPs studied, those of primary ecological concern should be acenaphthene, fluorene, DDT5, and chlordanes. Higher concentrations of POPs were detected during winter and spring than in summer and autumn, probably because of the high river flow during the rainy season. The high concentration of POPs in the riverine SPM and the fractionation of POPs in the water and SPM of the river should be a focal point in the future study of Lake Chaohu.(C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Barwick, DH				Barwick, DH			Species richness and centrarchid abundance in littoral habitats of three southern US reservoirs	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Species richness and centrarchid abundance associated with coarse woody debris (CWD), residentially developed habitats (DEV), and undisturbed (UND) habitats in Lake James (North Carolina), Lake Hickory (North Carolina), and Fishing Creek Lake (South Carolina) were evaluated by use of a boat-mounted electrofisher in spring, summer, and fall of 1999-2000. Species richness and centrarchid abundance were generally higher in CWD and DEV habitats than in UND habitat during most seasons in all reservoirs. Higher species richness and centrarchid abundance in CWD and DEV habitats were probably related to greater habitat complexity than in UND habitat, which made these two habitats more desirable to fish. My findings indicate the beneficial role of complex littoral structure on the distribution of fish in these reservoirs and the need for natural resource managers, riparian landowners, and reservoir owners to work cooperatively to protect and enhance habitat where possible.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				FEB	2004	24	1					76	81		10.1577/M02-163	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M02-163													WOS:000220169400009
J	Futia, MH; Marsden, JE				Futia, Matthew H.; Marsden, J. Ellen			Movement behaviours of stocked and wild lake trout Salvelinus namaycush determined using acoustic telemetry	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Hatchery practices are a critical tool of fisheries management to supplement diminished fish populations and restore extirpated species. However, stocking programs that successfully restore self-sustaining populations are rare. Unintentional artificial selection and domestication of hatchery-reared fish are potential limitations to the success of stocked individuals by selecting for behaviours that are poorly suited for natural conditions. Here, we compared seasonal movement behaviours between an established population of hatchery origin (stocked) and naturally produced (wild) lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in Lake Champlain at a range of sizes, including immature and mature fish. Fifty-six stocked and 34 wild lake trout were implanted with acoustic transmitters, including 45 transmitters with temperature and pressure (depth) sensors, to evaluate three-dimensional movement. Movement behaviours were assessed based on the number of distinct lake regions used, proportional time spent among lake regions, average daily distance travelled and depth distribution. Overall, horizontal and vertical movements were similar between stocked and wild lake trout across sizes, although individuals tended to occupy shallower depths at larger sizes. Seasonal differences in movement behaviours were observed and in some cases were dependent on origin. For all lake trout, average daily movement was greatest during fall and least during summer. Depth occupied, however, had an opposite trend, with the deepest average depths during summer and shallowest during fall and winter. The proportion of time spent among lake regions and variability in depth occupied also varied seasonally but only for wild fish, and included less time spent in individual regions and greater depth variability during fall compared to other seasons. While origin had insignificant effects in most models we evaluated, model predictions consistently suggested stocked lake trout had slightly smaller movements than wild fish. These results suggest that hatchery practices may have long-term, unintended effects on fish behaviour yet overall differences are likely subtle.

J	Cronberg, G				Cronberg, G			The life cycle of Gonyostomum semen (Raphidophyceae)	PHYCOLOGIA												Gonyostomum semen (Raphidophyceae) is today one of the most common flagellates in humic lakes ill Sweden and appears regularly in 30% of these lakes. The first mass development of this alga was recorded in 1948 in Lake Helgasjon, South Sweden. In this paper the life cycle of Gonyostomum is described for the first time. During the winter Gonyostomum survived as resting cysts on the surface of the bottom sediment. In spring (April to May) meiosis took place in the cysts, and on excystment two haploid gametes appeared. After a period of mobility, the gametes formed pairs. The gametes then fused, and a new diploid Gonyostomum cell developed. The vegetative stage of Gonyostomum, which was seen during the summer period (May-October), is thus the diploid phase. During this period normal, longitudinal cell division took place. Under unfavourable conditions, temporary cysts Could be formed. Cyst formation started from the centre of the cell, which swelled and became spherical. This was a thin-walled, temporary cyst, which was mobile and, like ordinary cells, had one flagellum protruding forward and one trailing behind. The temporary cysts could accumulate and settle in large clusters where the flagella were lost or had become invisible. When favourable conditions reappeared, the temporary cysts divided and formed two new gametes. In autumn, when the water temperature decreased to below about 10 degrees C, the temporary cysts went into dormancy and became resting cysts. The cyst wall thickened, and a brown body appeared within the cyst. Below 4-6 degrees C no vegetative cells were found.																			0031-8884					MAY	2005	44	3					285	293		10.2216/0031-8884(2005)44[285:TLCOGS]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.2216/0031-8884(2005)44[285:TLCOGS]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000229349100006
J	Bussmann, I; Fedorova, I; Juhls, B; Overduin, PP; Winkel, M				Bussmann, Ingeborg; Fedorova, Irina; Juhls, Bennet; Overduin, Pier Paul; Winkel, Matthias			Methane dynamics in three different Siberian water bodies under winter and summer conditions	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Arctic regions and their water bodies are affected by a rapidly warming climate. Arctic lakes and small ponds are known to act as an important source of atmospheric methane. However, not much is known about other types of water bodies in permafrost regions, which include major rivers and coastal bays as a transition type between freshwater and marine environments. We monitored dissolved methane concentrations in three different water bodies (Lena River, Tiksi Bay, and Lake Golzovoye, Siberia, Russia) over a period of 2 years. Sampling was carried out under ice cover (April) and in open water (July-August). The methane oxidation (MOX) rate and the fractional turnover rate (k') in water and melted ice samples from the late winter of 2017 was determined with the radiotracer method. In the Lena River winter methane concentrations were a quarter of the summer concentrations (8 nmol L-1 vs. 31 nmol L-1), and mean winter MOX rate was low (0.023 nmol L-1 d(-1)). In contrast, Tiksi Bay winter methane concentrations were 10 times higher than in summer (103 nmol L-1 vs. 13 nmol L-1). Winter MOX rates showed a median of 0.305 nmol L-1 d(-1). In Lake Golzovoye, median methane concentrations in winter were 40 times higher than in summer (1957 nmol L-1 vs. 49 nmol L-1). However, MOX was much higher in the lake (2.95 nmol L-1 d(-1)) than in either the river or bay. The temperature had a strong influence on the MOX (Q(10) = 2.72 +/- 0.69). In summer water temperatures ranged from 7-14 degrees C and in winter from -0.7 to 1.3 degrees C. In the ice cores a median methane concentration of 9 nM was observed, with no gradient between the ice surface and the bottom layer at the ice-water interface. MOX in the (melted) ice cores was mostly below the detection limit. Comparing methane concentrations in the ice with the underlaying water column revealed methane concentration in the water column 100-1000 times higher. The winter situation seemed to favor a methane accumulation under ice, especially in the lake with a stagnant water body. While on the other hand, in the Lena River with its flowing water, no methane accumulation under ice was observed. In a changing, warming Arctic, a shorter ice cover period is predicted. With respect to our study this would imply a shortened time for methane to accumulate below the ice and a shorter time for the less efficient winter MOX. Especially for lakes, an extended time of ice-free conditions could reduce the methane flux from the Arctic water bodies.

J	SCHULZ, S; CONRAD, R				SCHULZ, S; CONRAD, R			EFFECT OF ALGAL DEPOSITION ON ACETATE AND METHANE CONCENTRATIONS IN THE PROFUNDAL SEDIMENT OF A DEEP LAKE (LAKE CONSTANCE)	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												In the profundal sediment of Lake Constance (143 m depth) the temperature is constant at 4 degrees C. Despite the constant temperature, CH4 concentrations changed with season between about 120 mu M in winter and about 750 mu M in summer, measured down to 30 cm depth. The acetate concentration profiles also varied between seasons. In summer, acetate concentration reached a maximum at about 100 mu M in 2 or 4 cm depth. In winter, maximal concentrations of about 5 mu M were observed over the entire depth. Input of organic material in late spring may be the reason for the seasonal change of both compounds. To simulate such a sedimentation event, intact sediment cores were covered with suspensions of Porphyridium aerugenium or Synechococcus sp. The addition of the phytoplankton material resulted in a drastic increase of acetate concentrations with a maximum at 2 cm depth, similar to in situ acetate concentrations measured in summer. The same applies for CH, for which increased concentrations were observed down to 6 cm depth. H-2 concentrations, on the other hand, showed no distinct increase. Treatment of intact sediment cores with C-14-labeled Synechococcus cells resulted in the formation of C-14-acetate, (CH4)-C-14 and (CO2)-C-14. Maximum concentrations of (CH4)-C-14 Were found at 4 cm depth, i.e. just above the depth to which C-14-acetate penetrated. The results show that phytoplankton blooms may cause a seasonal variation of acetate and CH4 in profundal sediments of deep lakes despite the constant low temperature. They also indicate that acetate is the dominant substrate for methanogenic bacteria in the profundal sediments of Lake Constance.																			0168-6496	1574-6941				APR	1995	16	4					251	259		10.1111/j.1574-6941.1995.tb00289.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.1995.tb00289.x													WOS:A1995QV78100001
J	Fogli, S; Brancaleoni, L; Lambertini, C; Gerdol, R				Fogli, Simona; Brancaleoni, Lisa; Lambertini, Carla; Gerdol, Renato			Mowing regime has different effects on reed stands in relation to habitat	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Reed (Phragmites australis) is widespread in aquatic habitats in Europe where it plays an important ecological role, especially as stabilizer of lake and river shores and as filter against pollutants. Reed is also abundant in ecotones towards terrestrial habitats, especially fen meadows, where its expansion can out-compete rare slowly-growing fen species. Therefore, defining appropriate guidelines for managing reed in wetlands has to consider differences in the ecological roles that reed plays in different wetland habitats. In a small pre-alpine lake in N Italy, we mowed reed stands in three plant communities located along a transect from the lake shore to the periphery. In each community, three areas were subjected to reed mowing in late winter, as traditionally done in the past. Three additional areas were subjected to mowing in winter and summer, while three areas served as un-treated controls. Summer mowing was carried out in August, when the nesting period of birds was concluded. Mowing in winter did not affect reed aboveground biomass (RAB) in any community but enhanced the efficiency of removing nutrients by reducing litter accumulation in the soil. Mowing in winter and summer only slightly decreased RAB in the riparian community, not at all in the intermediate community but significantly diminished RAB in fen meadows. Phosphorus deficiency and/or reduced competition with other species probably accounted for RAB reduction in fen meadows. In conclusion, winter mowing can be overall recommended for preventing eutrophication of littoral habitats while summer mowing is advisable for preventing reed expansion in fen meadows. However, the timing of summer mowing has to be defined considering all requirements needed for optimal management of each individual site. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Successful reproduction by the eastern larch beetle (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) in the absence of an overwintering period	CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST												Eastern larch beetles, Dendroctonus simplex LeConte (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae), are monophagous, phloem-feeding herbivores of eastern larch (tamarack), Larix laricina (Du Roi) Koch (Pinaceae). Recently dead or moribund trees are preferentially colonised. Outbreaks of eastern larch beetles are generally localised and short-lived, although a large outbreak has been occurring in the Great Lakes region of North America since 2000. The beetle is reported as univoltine, with a single, spring-emergent, reproductive parent generation establishing one to three sibling broods per year. Some progeny emerging during summer or fall re-enter the tree bole close to ground level to overwinter, while remaining brood adults overwinter within pupal chambers in situ. Owing to these behaviours, eastern larch beetles have been suggested to possess an obligate overwintering reproductive diapause. However, studies have not confirmed this hypothesis. We tested the reproductive viability of non-overwintered progeny in three laboratory experiments. Non-overwintered progeny were reproductively viable, suggesting that a portion of the population may exhibit a facultative adult overwintering diapause. Progeny that emerged naturally from the host (i.e., putative fall-emergers) demonstrated reproductive rates almost six-fold those of manually extracted insects demonstrating a propensity to remain in situ (i.e., putative spring-emergers). These results shed new light onto the reproductive behaviour of eastern larch beetles, and suggest that future population dynamics may be influenced by a warming climate.																			0008-347X	1918-3240				OCT	2015	147	5					602	610		10.4039/tce.2014.81	http://dx.doi.org/10.4039/tce.2014.81													WOS:000360988100008
J	Groterud, O; Haaland, S				Groterud, Olav; Haaland, Stale			Side Effects of Liming - A Study of Four Dimictic Lakes in Southern Norway	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Side effects related to liming have been studied in four dimictic lakes (553-642 ma.s.l.; 59 degrees 57'N) in Finnemarka, a forested area in Southern Norway with poor catchment buffer capacity. Data series from lake profiles have been sampled two decades apart; 10 years prior to liming and after 10 years of liming. Water samples were collected during spring after ice breakup and during summer after the development of thermal stratification. Before liming, there were very low concentrations of bicarbonate (HCO3-; or alkalinity) in the lakes. After 10 years of liming, up to 90% of the ions in hypolimnion originate from lime products. Hence, liming strengthened the chemical stratification and increased the vertical stability. Differences in chemocline developments between lakes were explained by differences in physical properties, i.e. their depth/surface area ratio. The chemocline developments lead to increased concentrations of organic matter in the hypolimnion with a subsequent reduction in oxygen concentrations. Lime additions during late spring, as an alternative to early autumn, lead to pronounced anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				SEP	2010	211	1-4					135	141		10.1007/s11270-009-0287-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-009-0287-2													WOS:000282159200013

However, little is known about seasonal variation of microbial community functions in lake sediments and their associated environmental influences. In this study, metagenomic sequencing of sediments collected from winter, summer, and autumn from Caohai Lake, Guizhou Plateau, were used to evaluate the composition and function of sediment microbial communities, the potential interactions of functional genes, key genes associated with seasons, and community assembly mechanisms. The average concentrations of nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) in lake sediments were higher, which were 6.136 and 0.501 g/kg, respectively. TN and organic matter (OM) were the primary factors associated with sediment community composition and functional profiles. The diversity and structure of the microbial communities varied with seasons, and Proteobacteria relative abundances were significantly lower in summer than in other seasons (58.43-44.12 %). Seasons were also associated with the relative abundances of functional genes, and in particular korA, metF, narC, nrfA, pstC/S, and soxB genes. Network complexity was highest in the summer and key genes in the network also varied across seasons. Neutral community model analysis revealed that the assembly mechanisms related to carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S) cycle-related genes were primarily associated with random processes. In summary, diverse functional genes were identified in lake sediments and exhibited evidence for synergistic interactions (Positive proportion: 74.91-99.82 %), while seasonal factors influenced their distribution. The results of this study provide new insights into seasonal impacts on microbial-driven biogeochemical cycling in shallow lakes.

Apparent nest success in our study (x = 60%, n = 519 nests) was lower than reported for Grays Lake 30-50 years earlier. Daily survival rates (DSRs) of all nests averaged 0.9707 (41.2%). The best model explaining nest survival included year and water depth and their interaction. Nest survival was highest (DSR = 0.9827) in 1998 compared with other years (0.9698-0.9707). Nest survival changed little relative to water depth in 1998, when flooding was extensive and alternative prey (microtines) irrupted, but declined markedly with lower water levels in 2000, the driest year studied. Hypotheses relating nest survival to vegetation height, land use (idle, summer grazing, fall grazing), and date were not supported. In a before-after-control-impact design using 12 experimental fields, nest survival differed among years but not among management treatments (idle, fall graze, fall burn, and summer-graze-idle rotation), nor was there an interaction between year and treatments. However, DSRs in fall-burn fields declined from 0.9781 in 1997-1998 to 0.9503 in 1999-2000 (posttreatment). Changes in the predator community have likely contributed to declines in nest success since the 1950s and 1970s. Our results did not support earlier concerns about effects of habitat management practices on crane productivity. Nest survival could best be enhanced by managing spring water levels. Managers should continue censuses during late April to evaluate long-term relationships to habitat conditions and management.

Surface sediments and selected limnological variables were collected from 77 Mackenzie Delta lakes representing three categories of river influence: lakes having continuous connection with the Mackenzie River (n = 23; no-closure), lakes that flood every spring but lose connection during the summer (rt = 26; low-closure). and lakes that flood only during an extreme spring flood stage (n = 28; high-closure). Summer lake production, using winter methane concentration as a proxy, and river influence were identified as the principal limnological gradients separating delta lakes. This river influence/primary production gradient also accounted for the greatest amount of variation within the surface sediment diatom assemblages. The diatom flora of the Mackenzie Delta lakes was dominated by benthic taxa, particularly the genera Nitzschia and Navicula, with a greater abundance of stalked, epiphytic ta?ta in the high-closure lakes. A robust predictive model was developed for inferring lake production from fossil diatom assemblages. The model provides a tool for estimating long-term changes in river influence and lake dynamics from the sediment record of Mackenzie Delta lakes. Diatom-inferred river influence changes within these records may then be linked with past river discharge variability.					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696; Hay, Murray/0000-0002-6850-8842													0004-0851					NOV	1997	29	4					430	444		10.2307/1551991	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1551991													WOS:A1997YL52000007

Nevertheless, the occurrence of NEOs in lakes is not well known. Hongze Lake, the largest impounded lake on the Eastern Route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, was selected to investigate the distribution, ecological risks, and health risks of NEOs. Water samples from the lake and nearby rivers were collected and analyzed for 8 widely used NEOs in three seasons. The results indicated the average total NEO concentration in summer, winter, and spring was 222, 211, and 244 ng L- 1 for the river water, and 265, 213, and 181 ng L- 1 for the lake water, respectively, with no statistical seasonal difference. For the river water, the highest total NEO concentration in the three seasons was observed in the Andong River. For the lake water, the total NEO concentrations in summer were relatively high in sites near the inflow river estuaries due to the high riverine inputs during the flood period. The spatial difference in NEO concentration was relatively low in winter, which may be related to the wind- driven lake current. The seasonal variation in NEO compositions in the lake was generally similar to that in the river, indicating riverine input was the important source for the lake. Huai River was the largest contributor to the NEO inputs to the lake, and Sanhe Gate was the major output pathway. Clothianidin and imidacloprid in the river and lake water would produce moderate acute ecological risks in summer. Thus, the usage of the above two NEOs should be decreased or restricted. For integral NEO risks, 53% and 58% of the river and lake water sites exceeded the acute ecological threshold, respectively. Health risk assessment suggested drinking the water obtained from the lake would not produce a negative impact on public health.

Characterizing the hydrology of shallow floodplain lakes in the Slave River Delta, NWT, Canada, using water isotope tracers	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												The relative importance of major hydrological processes on thaw season 2003 lakewater balances in the Slave River Delta, NWT, Canada, is characterized using.. water isotope tracers and total suspended sediment (TSS) analyses. A suite of 41 lakes from three previously recognized biogeographical zones-outer delta, mid-delta, and apex-were sampled immediately following the spring melt, during summer, and in the fall of 2003. Oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions were evaluated in the context I of an isotopic framework calculated from 2003 hydroclimatic data. Our analysis reveals that flooding from the Slave River and Great Slave Lake dominated early spring lakewater balances in outer and most mid-delta lakes, as also indicated by elevated TSS concentrations (> 0.01 g L-1). In contrast, the input of snowmelt was strongest on all apex and some mid-delta lakes. After the spring melt, all delta lakes underwent heavy-isotope enrichment due to evaporation, although lakes flooded by the Slave River and Great Slave Lake during the spring freshet continued to be more depleted isotopically than those dominated by snowmelt input. The isotopic signatures of lakes with direct connections to the Slave River or Great Slave Lake varied throughout the season in response to the nature of the connection. Our findings provide the basis for identifying three groups of lakes based on the major factors that control their water balances: (1) flood-dominated (n = 10), (2) evaporation-dominated (n = 25), and (3) exchange-dominated (n = 6) lakes. Differentiation of the hydrological processes that influence Slave River Delta lakewater balances is essential for ongoing hydroecological and paleohydrological studies, and ultimately, for teasing apart the relative influences of variations in local climate and Slave River hydrology.																			1523-0430	1938-4246				AUG	2007	39	3					388	401		10.1657/1523-0430(06-026)[BROCK]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1657/1523-0430(06-026)[BROCK]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000249936100005

Biomass values varied between 1.2 and 38.0 g m-3 and revealed one autumnal and one vernal peak. Cyanophytes, the most important algal group (mean annual contribution was 78.6% and 49.8% in 1990-1991 and 1991-1992, respectively) remained dominant almost throughout the year. Diatoms, the second abundant group (mean annual contribution was 15.3% and 34.9% in the successive years, respectively) dominated in winter and spring. All other classes contributed to a small degree to the total biomass. The periodicity of the phytoplankton and the height of annual peaks resembled those of many temperature eutrophic lakes but the absence of a summer maximum was opposed to the PEG model statement that eutrophic systems are characterized by increased summer biomass. Temperature, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and dissolved silica appeared to be the main of the studied factors controlling the development of cyanophytes and diatoms. Changes in weather conditions, especially rainfall, seemed to have a strong impact on the species seasonality.

It was found that the total number of planktonic bacteria (TNB) was between 0.01 to 34.90 x 10(7) cells ml(-1) while the number of heterotrophic bacteria (TVC 22degreesC) in the water of the research sites in the lake varied between 0.17 to 42.06 x 10(2) cells ml(-1). The maximum number of bacteria was found in summer, and the minimum in autumn. In the part of the lake near the town (sites I-VI) a distinctly greater number of planktonic bacteria was found in spring and autumn than in the part far from the town (sites VII-IX). Based on Korsh's bacteriological "Q" index (Q > 1000) the water of Lake Chelmzynskie is rated as clean. Among the planktonic bacteria of Lake Chelmzynskie, Gram-negative rods were dominant, and the majority were slowly growing strains. The most numerous among planktonic bacteria were strains that hydrolyse fat, protein, deoxyribonucleic acid and starch. The least numerous were chitinolytic, nitrifying and ureolytic bacteria. Bacteria belonged to genera Flavobacterium, Aeromonas and Alcaligenes dominated in all examined periods.					; Kalwasinska, Agnieszka/AAI-4851-2020	Kalwasinska, Agnieszka/0000-0002-2435-567X; 													1230-1485						2003	12	3					287	295																WOS:000183217600005

Taxonomic composition of cyanobacterial communities was highly variable in both water bodies and fast species replacement was observed. In the first year of the operation of the smaller Konstantynow Reservoir, the mass development of Anabaena flos-aquae and Planktolyngbya limnetica (48.7 and 53.6% of the cyanobacterial abundance) occurred in summer, while in autumn the dominance of Planktothrix agardhii (99.9%, 14.95 x 10(6) ind. dm(-3)) was noted. The surface scum developed in summer consisted of An. flos-aquae that contained high amounts of anatoxin-a (1412.4 mu g AN-a dm(-3) of scum) and smaller amounts of microcystins (10 mu g eq. MC-LR dm(-3) of scum). In the larger Krasnik Reservoir, Aphanizomenon flos-aquae occurred in high abundance in spring and summer, however, it was replaced by different species of Microcystis (1.3 x 10(7) ind. dm(-3)) which created thick surface scum. Simultaneously, a hazardous increase in the total concentration of microcystins (from 13.6 to 788.5 mu g eq.

A statistical method for varve verification using seasonal pollen deposition	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												We developed a fast, inexpensive, statistically rigorous method of varve verification that uses prospective varve layer-splitting and seasonal pollen deposition. This method can be used on any sediment that contains seasonally deposited pollen, and avoids the need for radio-isotopic, optical, or thermoluminescence dating. The method uses a chi(2) test and non-parametric regression, together with recorded plant bloom times from pollen traps, to assess the differences in pollen abundances in light/dark (i.e. summer/winter-spring) sediment layers. A statistical test is required because such seasonally deposited data are inherently noisy, with a low signal-to-noise ratio. To illustrate this approach, visible laminations of Lake Mina, Minnesota, USA, were assessed in two separate regions of a core spanning 900 years. Results show that the laminations were deposited annually.

The CDOM absorption was significantly higher in winter than in summer, due to degradation and release of fixed carbon in phytoplankton and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV). The hyperbolic model was used to model the spectral absorption of CDOM, and the mean spectral slope of 6.38 nm(-1) was obtained. At most sites, the spectral absorption of non-phytoplankton particles was similar to that of the total particles, demonstrating that the absorption of the total particles is dominated by the absorption of non-phytoplankton particles. In summer, phytoplankton absorption increased markedly, due to frequent algal blooms especially in Meiliang Bay. In winter, the significant increase in non-phytoplankton particle absorption resulted from the increase of inorganic particulate matter caused by sediment resuspension. Strong linear relationships were found between ad(440) and total suspended matter (TSM), organic suspended matter (OSM), and inorganic suspended matter (ISM). Strong linear relationships were also found between a(ph)(440), a(ph)(675) and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentration. The total relative contributions of non-phytoplankton particles over the range of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (400-700 nm) were 48.4 and 79.9% in summer and winter respectively. Non-phytoplankton particle absorption dominated the total absorption, especially in winter, in Lake Taihu, due to frequent sediment resuspension in the large shallow lake as a result of strong windy conditions. The results indicate that strong absorption by CDOM and non-phytoplankton particles at the blue wavelength has an impact on the spectral availability, and acts as a selection factor for the composition of the phytoplankton community, with cyanobacteria being the dominate species in Lake Taihu.

As knowledge on asp migrations is restricted, this work investigated the movements of adult asp tagged with acoustic transmitters for 3 years in the large Peipsi-Emajogi-Vortsjarv lake-river system, Estonia, which is free of migration barriers. Asp showed complex migration patterns, moving between and within different waterbodies (lakes, river, tributaries) in all seasons, but with a tendency to repeat habitat use patterns between years. Lakes were mainly used for feeding during spring and summer (after spawning 65% of the fish migrated to Lake Peipsi), and more so by large fish. The majority (80-96%) of the fish spent the winter in the rivers, mostly close to their subsequent spawning area. Spawning areas were in swift-flowing waters in tributaries and the main river. The results indicate that asp may benefit from an extensive and diverse complex of habitats, and any migration barrier during any season may restrict the natural habitat use by asp. Maintenance and restoration of habitat heterogeneity and connectivity is critical to protect behaviourally diverse fish populations and increase resilience in rivers negatively impacted by various human activities.

J	Hart, RC				Hart, RC			A baseline limnological study of Wagendrift Dam (Thukela basin, KwaZulu-Natal)	WATER SA												Basic features of the physical and biological limnology of Wagendrift Dam, a moderately large impoundment on the Boesmans River, were studied between July 1989 and May 1990. This man-made lake showed a typical monomictic pattern of summer stratification (November through April) and holomictic winter circulation (May to October). Water quality was chemically good (Department of Water Affairs and Forestry records), with little evidence of nutrient enrichment. Water clarity during the study was moderately low (mean SD and K-dPAR values of 0.45 m and 2.55 m(-1)), with little evidence of persistent mineral turbidity, suggesting reasonably satisfactory catchment conditions. In keeping with the low nutrient status, surface chlorophyll content remained below 5 mug l(-1) throughout the study. In terms of ecological groupings, the phytoplankton was numerically dominated mostly by 'Competitive' green algae for most of the year. 'Stress-tolerant' cyanophytes were continuously sparse, but were marginally more abundant during summer stratification. Diatoms and other disturbance-tolerant 'ruderal' algae persisted throughout the year. No spring peak in ruderal algae was evident, but it may have been masked by high zooplankton grazing pressure. An autumnal peak in ruderal algae coincided broadly with flood-related inflows and annual de-stratification. Zooplankton was dominated (numerically and/or gravimetrically) by typical clear-water taxa. The copepod Tropodiaptomus spectabilis and cladoceran Daphnia pulex along with various unidentified cyclopoids and rotifers were seasonally persistent, while other cladoceran taxa (D. laevis and Diaphanosoma excisum) showed considerable seasonal periodicity. Zooplankton standing stock was collectively substantial, annually averaging around 0.65 g.m(-2) DM, and approaching 1 g.m(-2) DM in spring/early summer, implying potentially significant natural grazer-control of phytoplankton, aided perhaps by large numbers of benthic bivalve molluscs (Unio caffer), observed stranded in littoral margins following reservoir draw-down.																			0378-4738					OCT	2001	27	4					507	516																WOS:000171754400011

The two seal stocks have been isolated from Arctic stock for 11,000 years and from each other for 8,000 years. Corynosoma strumosum and C. semerme were found in the Baltic seals, but only C. strumosum in those from the lake. Eighty two of the ringed seals caught in the Bothnian Bay were infected with both Corynosoma species, one with a single infection of C. strumosum and one with C. semerme in autumn. The total number of C. semerme increased in relation to the number of C. strumosum in each set of seals both in autumn and spring. Corynosoma semerme was dominant in most seals in spring, but in only an average of 60% in autumn. The predominance of C. strumosum in 40% of the autumn material (range 33-80%) is of interest because species ratio favouring C. strumosum is not found in any more heavily infected paratenic fish host of Corynosoma in the Bothnian Bay. The change in the Corynosoma species ratio of seals in autumn may be explained by their exceptional feeding behaviour at this time of the year (total or partial fasting) and the suggested longevity of C. strumosum as compared with C. semerme. The stability of the acanthocephalan populations in ringed seals is documented.																			0952-8369	1469-7998				FEB	1988	214		2				361	371		10.1111/j.1469-7998.1988.tb04729.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.1988.tb04729.x													WOS:A1988M422200017
J	Burns, CW; Dodds, A				Burns, CW; Dodds, A			Food limitation, predation and allelopathy in a population of Daphnia carinata	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Major factors influencing the population dynamics of zooplankton are food availability and predation. Also, especially in shallow lakes, zooplankton may be affected by benthic macrophytes, some species of which produce allelopathic substances, and by suspended sediments which may constitute an additional food resource, or inhibit feeding. We estimated the influence of resource availability, predation by larval fish, and potential allelopathic substances on the population dynamics of Daphnia carinata in Tomahawk Lagoon, a shallow, coastal lake, over 14 months. Zooplankton and fish were sampled regularly, and estimates of food availability were obtained from biomasses of plant pigments and suspended sediments, and from clearance rates, fecundity and lipid-ovary indices of Daphnia. The effects of allelopathic substances in solution on the clearance rates of Daphnia were assessed regularly by comparison with rates in a 'standard' water. D. carinata underwent large fluctuations in abundance (0-258 l(-1)), with peaks of abundance in early spring. The population appears to have been severely food limited in late spring and early summer of both years; predation by juvenile fish (Gobiomorphus cotidianus) is likely to have contributed to a catastrophic decline of the Daphnia population in mid summer and to have effectively suppressed the adult daphniid breeding stock until late autumn. Substances in solution severely inhibited daphniid feeding only once, and not at a time when macrophytes (Nitella hookeri) were abundant. The possible effects of allelopathy from macrophytes on zooplankton warrant further study in other ecosystems.																			0018-8158					APR	1999	400						41	53		10.1023/A:1003798827352	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003798827352													WOS:000083171500004

We propose here a new proxy-based climate synthesis synthesis and its comparison -at a regional (similar to 100 km) level - with a regional climate model to examine (i) opposing northern and southern precipitation regimes and (ii) an east-to-west precipitation dipole during the Holocene across the Mediterranean basin. Using precipitation estimates in-ferred from marine and terrestrial pollen archives, we focus on the early to mid-Holocene (8000 to 6000 cal yr BP) and the late Holocene (4000 to 2000 cal yr BP), to test these hypotheses on a Mediterranean-wide scale. Special attention was given to the reconstruction of season-specific climate in-formation, notably summer and winter precipitation. The reconstructed climatic trends corroborate the north-south partition of precipitation regimes during the Holocene. During the early Holocene, relatively wet conditions occurred in the south-central and eastern Mediterranean regions, while drier conditions prevailed from 45 degrees N northwards. These patterns then reverse during the late Holocene. With regard to the existence of a west-east precipitation dipole during the Holocene, our results show that the strength of this dipole is strongly linked to the reconstructed seasonal parameter; early-Holocene summers show a clear east-west division, with summer precipitation having been highest in Greece and the eastern Mediterranean and lowest over Italy and the western Mediterranean. Summer precipitation in the east re-mained above modern values, even during the late-Holocene interval. In contrast, winter precipitation signals are less spatially coherent during the early Holocene but low precipita-tion is evidenced during the late Holocene. A general drying trend occurred from the early to late Holocene, particularly in the central and eastern Mediterranean. For the same time intervals, pollen-inferred precipita-tion estimates were compared with model outputs, based on a regional-scale downscaling (HadRM3) of a set of global climate-model simulations (HadAM3). The high-resolution detail achieved through the downscaling is intended to enable a better comparison between site-based paleo-reconstructions and gridded model data in the complex terrain of the Mediterranean; the model outputs and pollen-inferred precipitation estimates show some overall correspondence, though modeled changes are small and at the absolute margins of statistical significance. There are suggestions that the eastern Mediterranean experienced wetter summer conditions than present during the early and late Holocene; the drying trend in winter from the early to the late Holocene also appears to be simulated. The use of this high-resolution regional climate model highlights how the inherently patchy nature of climate signals and paleo-records in the Mediterranean basin may lead to local signals that are much stronger than the large-scale pattern would suggest. Nevertheless, the east-to-west division in summer precipitation seems more marked in the pollen reconstruction than in the model outputs. The footprint of the anomalies (like today, or dry winters and wet summers) has some similarities to modern analogue atmospheric circulation patterns associated with a strong westerly circulation in winter (positive Arctic Oscillation-North Atlantic Oscillation (AO-NAO)) and a weak westerly circulation in summer associated with anticy-clonic blocking; however, there also remain important differences between the paleo-simulations and these analogues. The regional climate model, consistent with other global models, does not suggest an extension of the African summer monsoon into the Mediterranean. Therefore, the extent to which summer monsoonal precipitation may have existed in the southern and eastern Mediterranean during the mid-Holocene remains an outstanding question.

J	Salmaso, N				Salmaso, N			Effects of climatic fluctuations and vertical mixing on the interannual trophic variability of Lake Garda, Italy	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A linked chain of causal factors-namely, winter air temperature, spring lake temperature, extent of the spring take overturn, and extent of surface nutrient enrichment-had significant effects on the annual development of phytoplankton structure and biomass in Lake Garda, a large (49 x 10(9) m(3)), deep (350 m) lake located south of the Alps. The relationship between the winter climate and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) was unclear, probably because of the location of the lake, which was on the border between different centers of action of the NAO (the Mediterranean region and central and northern Europe). Soon after the major enrichment episodes, conjugatophytes and large diatoms developed with higher biovolumes during April, whereas from midsummer to midautumn, the cyanobacteria and, more irregularly, the conjugatophytes were more important. In two other deep southern subalpine lakes (Iseo and Lugano), the interannual variations in the extent of spring vertical mixing, nutrient replenishment, and phytoplankton development were closely related because of the common effects of winter climate on the subalpine region. The effect was proportionally more evident in the two meromictic and more eutrophic lakes, Iseo and Lugano, because of the higher nutrient content in their hypolimnia.

J	Riedel, R; Caskey, L; Costa-Pierce, BA				Riedel, R; Caskey, L; Costa-Pierce, BA			Fish biology and fisheries ecology of the Salton Sea, California	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Studies of the fisheries ecology and fish biology of the Salton Sea, California, were conducted in 1999 and 2000 using 50 m gill nets in river, nearshore, pelagic, and estuarine areas. Total lengths and weights were measured for all fish captured, and sub-samples were dissected for gonad weights and aging. Ten fish species were captured of which a hybrid tilapia ( Oreochromis mossambicus x O. urolepis hornorum) was dominant by number and weight. Nearshore and estuarine areas had highest catch rates (over 11 kg h(-1) net(-1) for tilapia). Rivers were richest in the number of species (6 of 10 species were exclusively riverine), but lowest in fish abundance. Orangemouth corvina (Cynoscion xanthulus), bairdiella (Bairdiella icistia), sargo (Anisotremus davidsoni), and tilapia grew faster, but had shorter life spans than conspecifics elsewhere and Salton Sea conspecifics of 50 years ago. Reproduction occurred mostly in the nearshore and estuarine areas. Onset of reproduction of bairdiella and sargo was in the spring and extended through the beginning of summer. Reproduction of orangemouth corvina started in the summer and of tilapia in the spring. Reproduction of orangemouth corvina and tilapia extended through the fall. Gender ratios of tilapia were skewed toward males in all areas, except the rivers, where females predominated. All four species aggregated along the nearshore and estuarine areas in the summer when dissolved oxygen in the pelagic area was limited. Any restoration alternative for the Salton Sea should consider areas close to shore as primary areas for fish reproduction and survival.					; Costa-Pierce, Barry/H-5069-2011	Costa-Pierce, Barry Antonio/0000-0003-3059-1828; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				APR	2002	473	1-3					229	244		10.1023/A:1016510508187	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1016510508187													WOS:000177008500017

Results show that concentrations of the found substances were higher over the Mehrabad station. The mean concentration of ions indicated that, HCO3, SO4 and NO3 and were the main anions, while Ca, Na, NH4 and Mg were the main cations. Measured PH had shown that autumn and winter precipitation were mostly acidic while the spring and summer were mostly alkaline. The pH ranged from 4.6 to 8.1 with a mean of 6.3. The alkaline cations Ca and Mg and also Bicarbonate anion acted as acid neutralizers and buffered the acidity of rain. The Bicarbonate anion had the highest concentration, among all other ions, over both stations and plays an important role in reduction of the acidity of the rain water. Study upon the potential sources of the ions over Tehran by means of Correlation Analysis, Enrichment Factor and Principle Component Analysis indicate that existence of Qom salt lake and desert in the south of the city were the main source of the Ca, Mg, K and Na. There are anthropogenic sources for SO4, NO3, NO2, F, Br ion's. The other ions HCO3 and NH4 were from anthropogenic and dust origin.

Monthly field investigations were conducted at three distinct sites (SI, SII & SIII) throughout the four seasons (winter, spring, summer, autumn) from November 2019 to October 2020. The findings encompass a total of 630 specimens belonging to 11 fish species, three orders Cypriniformes, Siluriforms and Salmoniformes and four families including Cyprinidae, Nemachelidae, Siluridae and Salmonidae were reported from the study sites. Among collected specimens, Cypriniformes were dominant with nine species followed by order Siluriformes and Salmoniformes with one species each. Out of eleven fish species, six fish species belongs to family Cyprinidae, three to Nemachelidae, one to Siluridae and Salmonidae each. The analysis, employing non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), Principal component analysis (PCA), Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) and Per-mutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) on fish abundance data highlighted significant differences among the various sites but not across seasons. The results unveil a diverse occurrence and distribution pattern of fishes from upstream to downstream. Furthermore, diversity metrics confirm higher diversity index values downstream, indicating a more conducive environment for fish survival. Jaccard's index reveals greater similarity in fish fauna between site-II and site-III than site-I and site-III in terms of overlap of fish species composition. The study concludes that anthropogenic activities in the stream catchment area have led to a reduction in fish diversity and abundance, with landscape features significantly influencing fish abundance in this unique Himalayan ecosystem.					; Kumar, Abhinav/AAC-4534-2021; Singh, Rahul/AGX-1365-2022; Paramasivam, Prabhu/AAB-5095-2022	PARAMASIVAM, PRABHU/0000-0002-2397-0873; 														1932-6203				FEB 18	2025	20	2							e0316280	10.1371/journal.pone.0316280	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0316280								39964981					WOS:001425429000031

In this study our main aim was to estimate the trends in agricultural nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes and to explain them by large scale changes in land use and climate. We used long-term monitoring data of discharge and nutrient concentrations of seven small catchments and 20 river basins. In the analysis we used two regression based models to calculate nutrient fluxes and to make source apportionment, and Mann-Kendall statistics to study trends in nutrient concentrations and climatic variables. Annual mean temperature increased at six meteorological stations out of the 16 stations included in the study. There was a statistically significant increase in temperature in late summer/early autumn at 14 stations. There were no trends in annual mean runoff in any of the river basins but there was a decrease in runoff in spring or early summer in 15 and an increase in mid-winter runoff in 13 river basins. There was an increasing trend in the nitrogen concentrations and a decreasing trend in the phosphorus concentrations. The flow normalized nitrogen flux to the Baltic Sea increased steadily until the mid 2000s and has decreased by 20% from that time until 2012. The flow normalized phosphorus flux has steadily decreased from early 1990s to 2012. The specific agricultural nitrogen loading value was 1340 kg km(-2) yr(-1) and the phosphorus loading value 83 kg km(-2) yr(-1). Clearing of new fields explained 50% of the increase in the nitrogen flux to the Baltic Sea between the periods 1995-1999 and 2000-2006. September mean temperature explained 15-30% of the variance in the nitrogen concentrations in the small catchments and 53% of that in the large river basins. Changes in field area or climate did not explain changes in the phosphorus fluxes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Diodato, N; Bertolin, C; Bellocchi, G				Diodato, Nazzareno; Bertolin, Chiara; Bellocchi, Gianni			Multi-Decadal Variability in the Snow-Cover Reconstruction at Parma Observatory (Northern Italy, 1681-2018 CE)	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												Emerging negative trends in snow depth and cover days highlight the challenges posed by changing snow patterns around the world. They suggest that snow-dependent regions in southern Europe could be affected by these changes because the number of days with snow on the ground (DSG) determines soil processes and water-flow in rivers, streams, lakes and reservoirs. We present here the first homogeneous, annually-resolved (from October to April), multi-centennial (1681-2018 CE) DSG time-series for the Parma meteorological observatory (OBS), in northern Italy, which to date is also the longest DSG series reconstructed in the world. DSG data are in fact still poorly documented and misunderstood due to the limited and fragmentary data measurements of the past. DSG recording only began in 1938 at Parma OBS. To generate the long-term annual DSG time-series at the study site, we develop a model consistent with calibration (1938-1990 CE) and validation (1991-2018 CE) samples of observed data. We show that the variability of DSG depends on winter precipitation and air temperature, as well as on winter-spring temperature variability, suggesting that long sequences of DSG are dominated by cold air masses in years with cold weather and high variability. Modeled DSG data show a downward trend from the 19th century, in the transition period from the cold of the Little Ice Age to the warmth of modern times, followed by a more rapid decline in the five most recent decades. The DSG at Parma OBS appear to have followed over the last century trends similar to those observed throughout Eurasia and across the Northern Hemisphere, where a marked decline of snow-cover duration has been reported in the transition seasons (spring and autumn).

These two species coexist with the more common Chilean Flamingo (Phoenicopterus chilensis) throughout much of their range. We conducted four simultaneous surveys from 1997 to 2001 (two in summer and two in winter) to estimate the distribution and abundance of all three species in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and Peru, at a regional scale. Of 224 wetlands surveyed, 179 had flamingos; 63% of these were in the high Andes (above 4000 m), 25% were in the puna (3000 to 4000 m), and the remainder were in lowlands (below 3000 m). Maximum counts were 64 000 Puna Flamingos (summer 1998), 34 000 Andean Flamingos (summer 1997), and 83 000 Chilean Flamingos (winter 1998). In summer, Puna Flamingos congregated at wetlands in the high Andes, with 50% of the population in just three lakes: Colorada, Grande, and Vilama. Andean Flamingos were more uniformly distributed across a broader elevational range (2500 m), and Chilean Flamingos showed a heterogeneous distribution pattern. In winter, all species moved to lower latitudes within the high Andes and to lower altitudes on the central plains of Argentina. The most important nesting wetlands were Colorada, in Bolivia, for the Puna Flamingo, Surire and Atacama, in Chile, for the Andean Flamingo, and Surire for the Chilean Flamingo. We recommend continued monitoring through simultaneous summer surveys, and a conservation strategy that considers the large spatial and temporal scales at which these species operate, including their seasonal migrations.

Estimation of TSM plays a vital role in monitoring, evaluating, and protecting water quality. Many empirical and semianalytical models have been established for clear open ocean waters or extremely turbid coasts/lakes. However, few are generally applicable to inland, optically complex, deep waters. Using data sets of observed in situ data for the slightly turbid water of the Xin'anjiang Reservoir, we developed a semianalytical algorithm to estimate the TSM concentration for slightly turbid waters (TSM < 25 mg L-1; TSM/Chla < 2.2 x 10(3)) [chlorophyll a (Chla)] using [R-rs(542)(-1) -R-rs(600)(-1)] x R-rs (668), (R-rs: remote sensing reflectance), with a coefficient of determination (R-2) > 0.9 and a normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE) < 12%. The semianalytical model was then applied to 14 Landsat 8 OLI images from December 2013 to April 2015, with R-2 = 0.85 and NRMSE = 23%, indicating the feasibility of the semianalytical model for estimating TSM. The TSM concentration estimated from Landsat 8 OLI data in the Xin'anjiang Reservoir exhibited a significant spatial and seasonal difference. The spatial heterogeneity, significantly higher in incoming rivers than the main body of the reservoir, was due to watershed inputs and anthropogenic dredging activity. The temporal heterogeneity of TSM, significantly higher in summer and autumn than in winter and spring, was mainly caused by the seasonal rainfall and seasonal growth of phytoplankton. Our study showed that the semianalytical model for Landsat 8 OLI images could be used to quantitatively monitor TSM in slightly turbid, inland waters.

Largemouth bass consumption demand on hatchery rainbow trout in two Washington lakes	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Christensen DR, Moore BC. 2010. Largemouth bass consumption demand on hatchery rainbow trout in two Washington lakes. Lake Reserv Manage. 26:200-211. High mortality (84-89%) of stocked rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in Twin Lakes, Washington, has been partially blamed on predation from non-native largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). We examined the gut-content of 434 largemouth bass and applied a bioenergetics model to determine the consumption demand on hatchery-released rainbow trout and other prey species in the Twin Lakes. Largemouth bass consumed approximately 4915 (95% CI; 2393-13,452) fall stocked rainbow trout in South Twin. No rainbow trout consumption was observed in North Twin, despite a similar stocking regime. Approximately 6.3% (95% CI; 3-17%) of total fall stocked rainbow trout in South Twin were consumed by largemouth bass. Rainbow trout stocked in the fall ranged from 100 to 160 mm total length and were all subject to predation by large largemouth bass >= 300 mm. Large largemouth bass consumed rainbow trout that reached up to 210 mm in length and 58% of bass body length. No predation was observed on larger rainbow trout (215-370 mm) stocked during the spring. Smaller largemouth bass <= 299 mm consumed primarily invertebrates, including crayfish, and did not consume rainbow trout in either lake. During spring and summer in South Twin Lake, large largemouth bass consumed principally golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas) and crayfish. In North Twin Lake, golden shiner constituted most of the larger bass diet for the entire year. Differences in macrophyte distribution, bathymetry, temperature and/or predator-prey demographics likely influenced variability in largemouth bass predation between lakes. Largemouth bass predation did not account for overall rainbow trout mortality.

We show that the EAWM during Holocene is enhanced, driven overwhelmingly by the local insolation change in the low to mid-latitude Northern Hemisphere (NH) through its impacts on land-sea thermal contrast, with the NH high latitude forcing playing a negligible role. In contrast, the AusSM is also enhanced, opposite to the local insolation forcing, because the local forcing impact is overwhelmed by that from the remote forcing of both NH low latitude and Southern Hemisphere high latitude, with the latter dominating in the mid-Holocene.					; Wen, Qin/GQO-9487-2022	Yan, Mi/0000-0003-4730-3781; Wen, Qin/0000-0003-0858-3864													0094-8276	1944-8007				MAY 28	2022	49	10							e2022GL098865	10.1029/2022GL098865	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022GL098865													WOS:000801827700001

However, the dynamics of the different ARGs within the bacterial communities of lakes and rivers, as well as the factors that drive their selection, are not completely understood. In this study, we analysed the fate of the bacterial resistome (total content of ARGs and of metal resistance genes, MRGs) for a period of six months (summer-winter) in a continuum lake-river-lake system (Lake Varese, River Bardello, Lake Maggiore) in Northern Italy, by shotgun metagenomics. The metagenomic data were then compared with chemical, physical and microbiological data, to infer the role of anthropogenic pressure in the different sampling stations. ARGs and MRGs were more abundant and diverse in the River Bardello, characterised by the highest anthropogenic pollution. The date of sampling influenced ARGs and MRGs, with higher abundances in summer (August) than in fall or in winter, when the impact of the treated wastewater discharge in the river was limited by a higher water flow from Lake Varese. ARG and MRG abundances were significantly correlated and they cooccurred in the main network analysis modules with potential pathogenic bacteria. Different levels of anthropogenic impact selectively promoted specific ARGs while others, generally abundant in waters, were not affected by anthropogenic pressure. Reducing the level of anthropogenic pressure resulted in a rapid decrease of most ARGs.

Genotoxicity risk assessment in fish (Rutilus rutilus) from two contaminated rivers in the Kosovo	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Being exposed to untreated urban and industrial water, the rivers Drenica and Sitnica are considered to be the most polluted ones in the Kosovo. Our previous investigations on the cyto- and genotoxic potential of water samples from these rivers evaluated with primary rat hepatocyte cultures indicated a risk for the health of aquatic organisms. In order to assess the genotoxic risk to aquatic organisms, we therefore performed a two year study (2016-2017) on roach (Rutilus rutilus) from these rivers. Specimens were collected at three locations along the Drenica river and two locations along the Sitnica river, and the genotoxicity was evaluated by the micronucleus as well as the Comet assay (DNA damage) in erythrocytes. The frequencies of micronucleated cells were determined for samples collected in four seasons, whereas the Comet assay was employed on samples collected in five seasons during the two-year period. The data obtained revealed an increase of the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes from Rutilus ruffle's collected at most sampling locations and from both rivers at all seasons investigated. Significant differences to the control (lake Badovc) were found in summer 2016 and spring 2017 samples. When comparing the seasons, the summer 2016 samples were most genotoxic, followed by spring 2017 and autumn 2016. With regard to the Comet assay data, a similar but more prominent "response" was observed. Another important observation is that micronucleus rates as well as DNA damage levels were significantly higher in samples collected in 2016 compared to the respective seasons in 2017. Altogether, the "response" obtained with both markers confirmed a genotoxic risk for fish due the pollution of these rivers. Since there were, however, seasonal and annual variations of the genotoxicity levels further in depth studies have to be carried out addressing the nature of these changes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding their long-term characteristics and possible relationship with large-scale meteorological factors is essential. In this study, we apply signal denoising, dimensionality reduction technique, and wavelet transform to study the spatiotemporal distribution pattern of drought/flood and its teleconnection with large-scale climate indices. Based on the precipitation data of 63 hydrological stations in the Taihu Lake Basin (TLB) for 54 years from 1965 to 2018, the standard precipitation index (SPI) was used as an indicator. The ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and empirical orthogonal function (EOF) methods were used to explore the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of droughts and floods. In addition, the cross-wavelet transform (XWT) method was used for teleconnection analysis. The results indicated that during 1965-2018, the SPI of the TLB showed quasiperiodic oscillations dominated by interannual oscillations (52.5%). Except for the trend of drought in spring, the basin showed a wetter trend at annual, summer, autumn, and winter scales. There were two main spatial modes (total 78.48% contribution) in the TLB, consistent across the region and reverse distributed from south to north. The dry areas were mainly in southern Zhexi and the northern Huxi sub-regions; the Hangjiahu and Yangchengdianmao sub-regions were prone to flooding. In addition, SPI was correlated with various large-scale meteorological factors, but the strength of the correlation had specific temporal and spatial heterogeneity. The research results can provide TLB reference values for water resource management and flood/drought disaster control.

Different APA fractions, environmental parameters, and phytoplankton communities were followed. High spatio-temporal variations of APA were observed, with the highest value in summer and the lowest in winter. The annual average APAT (total alkaline phosphatase activity) ranged from 7.78-14.03 nmol.L-1.min(-1) with the highest in the midstream and the lowest in the estuary. The dominant phytoplankton phyla in summer and winter were Cyanophyta and Bacillariophyta, respectively. The mean cell density in the midstream and in the estuary was 5.2 x 10(7) cell.L-1 and 1.4 x 10(7) cell.L-1, respectively. That APA(>3.0 mu m) was significantly higher than APA(0.45-3 mu m) indicating phytoplankton was the main contributor to alkaline phosphatase. Correlation analysis indicated the dominant species and cell density could determine the distribution pattern of APA. Turbidity, total phosphorus, chemical oxygen demand, water temperature (WT), pH and chlorophyll a were proved to be positively correlated with APA; soluble reactive phosphorus, conductivity, transparency and water level(WL) were negatively correlated with APA. It was concluded that spatiotemporal heterogeneity of APA determined by phytoplankton communities was related to WT and WL.																			2045-2322					NOV 27	2017	7								16404	10.1038/s41598-017-16740-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-16740-4								29180646					WOS:000416308200012

Long-term records of air temperature and ice phenology (ice duration), and phyto- and zooplankton time series (1979-1997) were used to study the effects of ice duration on the successional pattern within plankton communities during spring in a shallow polymictic lake. 2. Water temperature in March was significantly lower after cold winters when compared to average or mild winters. Mean water temperature in April was not significantly different after mild, average or cold winters, but showed an overall significant negative correlation with ice duration. 3. Ice duration affected the timing and the magnitude of the peak abundance of diatoms, rotifers and daphnids during spring, but had no direct effects on the timing and maximum of chlorophytes, cryptophytes, cyanobacteria, bosminids and cyclopoid copepods. 4. Plankton groups which appeared first in the seasonal succession (i.e. diatoms, rotifers and daphnids) reached maximum abundance earlier after mild and average winters. The peak abundance of diatoms was negatively correlated with ice duration, whereas that of rotifers and daphnids was independent of the conditions during the preceding winter. 5. Temperature alone was generally a poor predictor of the timing and magnitude of both phyto- and zooplankton maxima. Turbulence may be important in the timing and the magnitude of peaks in diatoms, while total algal biomass was the most important determinant for the timing of the rotifer maximum. The magnitude of the daphnid maxima were significantly influenced by water temperature in March and April, and by rotifer abundance. The magnitude of the bosminid maximum was correlated with food availability and predation, whereas the timing of the maximum was more closely related to water temperature in May. 6. We conclude that, as a result of the low heat storage capacity of shallow lakes, the effects of winter on planktonic communities are short lived, and soon overtaken by the prevailing weather and by biotic interactions.																			0046-5070					MAY	1999	41	3					621	632		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1999.00411.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1999.00411.x													WOS:000081362000013

In order to improve water quality, it is urgent that water environmental quality is to be assessed scientifically and properly, and main pollution sources should be distinguished. Based on data of 5 monitoring spots, time series analytic method was adopted to analyze law of variable water pollutants concentration. Then based on survey results of pollution sources and geographic information in Changhu watershed, basic characteristics of pollution sources and impact factors of water pollution were analyzed by factor analytic method and correlation analytic method. The results show that: (1) Seasonal variation of organic pollutants concentration in Changhu Lake is obvious, with COD, TN and NH3-N all following the law: both spring and winter > summer > autumn, which indicates that rainy seasons are better than dry seasons in respect to water quality. In the meantime, the highest concentration of TP at inlets of the lake occurs in July when there is more pollutants load(PL) of non-point sources(NPS), and the concentration of NH3-N and TN in July is higher than that of May in part of monitoring points. The highest concentration of NH3-N arises in March. (2) Higher concentration of pollutants appears in the northwest and north of Changhu Lake where water inflows, and lower concentration in the southeast of the lake where water outflows. (3) Waste water discharged by point sources(PS) including industrial effluent, municipal wastewater as well as livestock and poultry sewage, NPS, and the amount of natural precipitation and runoff are the main factors of variable water quality.																					978-1-60595-186-7				2014							176	184																WOS:000351911500028

To address this challenge, we proposed a novel remote sensing model to derive column-integrated chlorophyll a (CIC), a better indicator than water surface chlorophyll a concentration (Csurf), for evaluating total algal biomass. The proposed algorithm was utilized to construct the patterns of spatiotemporal change in CIC in the Xin'anjiang Reservoir (the largest freshwater human-made reservoir in East China, located in Zhejiang Province) based on 97 cloud-free Sentinel-2 satellite images from 2016 to 2020. The results showed that the best index for developing the CIC remote sensing model was the average chlorophyll a concentration within the euphotic layer, which could be derived from Csurf and euphotic depth. The proposed model demonstrated good performance in deriving CIC in the Xin'anjiang Reservoir from Sentinel-2 images (yielding a mean absolute percent error of 20.7% and a root mean square error of 16.3 mg/m2). The values of the five-year averaged CIC and total algal biomass within the reservoir were 62.38 mg/m2 and 22.31 t, respectively. The CIC in the Xin'anjiang Reservoir displayed noticeable spatial variation, with the highest CIC appearing in the riverine zone and the lowest CIC appearing in the lacustrine zone. Clear seasonal variation in CIC was observed, with CIC exhibiting the order summer > autumn > spring > winter. Although the model was developed for a specific reservoir, we believe that this research can serve as a case study that illustrates the benefits of using CIC for assessing spatiotemporal variation in phytoplankton.					; Liu, Simin/I-3689-2014; Guo, Yulong/AAW-6008-2021; Liu, Zhao/B-2189-2012; , 张一波/AAY-5453-2020; Shi, Kun/O-2638-2013; Qin, Boqiang/E-5900-2013	Li, Yuan/0000-0003-0381-2605; Guo, Yulong/0000-0002-6146-1949; Liu, Miao/0000-0002-3888-1849													0022-1694	1879-2707				JUL	2022	610								127918	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.127918	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.127918		MAY 2022											WOS:000804544100005

SRP ranged from 53 to 182 mu g(-1) l(-1) and DIN from 265 to 850 mu g(-1) l(-1). Nutrient values do not indicate strong anthropogenic effects. Chlorophyll alpha ranged from 1.0 to 35.3 mu g(-1) l(-1) and followed the temporal distribution of total phytoplankton biomass. Phytoplankton biomass exhibited maxima in winter - spring and summer (6.8 g m(-3) in December 1991, 4.8 g m(-3) in April 1992 and 9.3 g m(-3) in August 1992) composed mainly of diatoms, chlorphytes, cyanophytes and dinophytes. Nanoplankton was the most important component of phytoplankton biomass (69.5%) revealing increased values in winter and early spring. Phytoplankton diversity ranged from 0.8 to 3.2. The hydrological conditions in the river Strymon seem to be appropriate for the algae to reproduce themselves in the running water and so, to develop as a true potamoplankton. However, significant populations of phytoplankton must have been carried out from the Kerkini reservoir, situated at the north of the sampling station. The phytoplankton species composition and their periodicity in the river resemble those of typical, large, lowland and nutrient - rich rivers of Europe.

Stratification and mixing in Lake Elsinore, California: An assessment of axial flow pumps for improving water quality in a shallow eutrophic lake	WATER RESEARCH												A 3-year study was conducted to quantify the effectiveness of a destratification system on weakening thermal stratification and increasing dissolved oxygen (DO) levels in Lake Elsinore, California. Biweekly measurements of temperature, DO, and other parameters were made at 14 sites across the lake beginning in July 2003. A destratification system consisting of 20 axial flow pumps fitted with 3HP electric motors and 1.8m diameter impellers mounted 2 m below the water surface was installed in the spring of 2004 and made fully operational in July 2004. An unusually wet winter of 2005 raised the summer mean depth from 3.0 m in 2004 to 6.7 m in 2005. This study thus allowed us to quantify the influence of axial flow pump operation on water column properties under shallow water conditions (i.e., before and after axial flow pump installation), and also to compare the effectiveness of the destratification system at two strongly different lake levels. Transparencies increased substantially after the winter storms in 2005 and thermal stability was shown to be strongly dependent upon lake level. Stratification and a large area of anoxic sediments persisted despite pump operation in the summers of 2004 and 2005. Acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) measurements showed that mixing energy was not being efficiently transmitted laterally into the water column. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Cheam, V; Lawson, G; Lechner, J; Desrosiers, R				Cheam, V; Lawson, G; Lechner, J; Desrosiers, R			Recent metal pollution in Agassiz Ice Cap	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Metal data for Ph, Zn, Al, Cd, and TI show seasonal variations of high levels during the winter-early spring period and low levels during the summer-fall period. In terms of Pb magnitudes and seasonal variations, our data of the late 1980s and early 1999s (unleaded gasoline era) appear compatible with those of Murozumi et at. (Murozumi, M.; Chow, T. J.; Patterson, C. C. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 1969, 33, 1247-1294.) of the 1950s and 1965 (leaded gasoline era). This is probably due to the close proximity and similar elevation of the two areas (Agassiz Ice Cap, Canadian Arctic and Camp Century, northwest Greenland), which are likely subjected to the same polluted air masses. Despite the implementation of unleaded gasoline since the early 1970s, our data show that the Agassiz Ice Cap still received a significant amount of lead during the late 1980s and early 1990s; this is in contrast to Summit, Greenland, which saw a very drastic decrease of the element during similar periods. This is because of the different locations and altitudes, as well as different sources, mainly Eurasian for Agassiz versus mainly U.S. for Summit. Lead was determined by laser-induced fluorescence spectrometry via the direct injection of microliter sample sizes. Its fallout flux was estimated to be 1.2 ng cm(-2) year(-1) The lead concentration in the surface snow appears to follow the order of Agassiz and northwest Greenland > central Greenland > Antarctica.																			0013-936X					DEC 15	1998	32	24					3974	3979		10.1021/es971012w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es971012w													WOS:000077561200020

The study areas were situated in the outer archipelago at depths of 21 to 25 m and 26 to 30 m and in the sea zone at 46 m. In P. affinis growth rates decreased with increasing depth, but the same seasonal pattern was evident at all depths: growth began in spring, increased to a maximum in early or midsummer, and decreased again or ceased altogether by autumn. In the archipelago the 1 + age group attained its maximum growth rate in May June and the 0 + age group clearly later, in June-July. In P.femorata the growth rates of all age groups were more even, having only slight peaks in summer and autumn. The seasonal variation in growth of Pontoporeia spp. was not directly dependent on sedimentation of the spring phytoplankton bloom, but was more closely connected with seasonality of temperature and total benthic metabolism. Because estimates of annual food consumption by Pontoporeia spp. exceeded bacterial and meiofaunal production, these species must have derived the majority of their energy demands from dead organic detritus. Both Pontoporeia species are probably strictly food-limited in the area. The cessation of growth seemed to coincide with the approach or a plateau of total biomass, suggesting food competition. Different timing of growth between the age groups of P. affinis suggests differences in sources or utilization of food; differences between P. affinis ad P. femorata may indicate interspecific competition or different food.

While the seasonal hypoxia in deep reservoirs is widely acknowledged, there is limited research on its impact on benthic phosphorus (P) cycling and P fraction release from the reservoir sediments. Here we show that seasonal hypoxia enhances sediment P release and P fluxes at the sediment -water interface (SWI) which might alter P dynamics in deep reservoirs. We conducted a detailed measurement of sediment P fractions through the SEDEX approach, combined with a labile P gradient analysis using the diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) technique to understand P cycling patterns in sediments during the transition period from spring (oxic) to late summer (hypoxic) conditions. The sediment P pool was predominantly composed of iron-bound phosphorus (Fe -P, 76 -80 %), primarily due to the widespread occurrence of lateritic red soil (rich in Fe 2 O 3 /MnO 2 ) in subtropical areas. More organic-P was observed in summer compared to spring. A significant increase in labile P occurred at the depth of 0 -4 cm and 0 -1 cm in spring and summer, respectively, where sediment P release was primarily governed by the reduction of Fe -P and the generation of S 2- . A higher apparent fluxes of phosphate across the SWI were observed in summer characterized by higher temperature and lower oxygen levels. The current results suggest that seasonal hypoxia was a crucial factor affecting P cycling and diffusion in deep reservoirs. These findings present important implications for the ecology and management of the watershed -coast ecosystem.

Globally, lakes are warming and browning with ongoing climate change. These changes significantly impact a lake's biogeochemical properties and all organisms, including invertebrate consumers. The effects of these changes are essential to understand, especially during critical periods after and before the growing season, that is, autumn and spring, which can determine the composition of the invertebrate consumer community.2. In this study, we used a large -scale experimental pond system to test the combined effect of warming (+3 degrees C) and increased input of terrestrial and coloured dissolved organic carbon (gradient of 1.6- 8.8 mg/L in the ambient and 1.6- 9.3 mg/L in the warm)- which causes browning- on zooplankton and benthic macroinvertebrate biomass and composition during the autumn and the following spring.3. Total zooplankton biomass decreased with warming and increased with browning, while total zoobenthos did not respond to either treatment. Warming and browning throughout the autumn had no overall interactive effects on zooplankton or zoobenthos. Autumnal warming decreased total pelagic consumer biomass, caused by a decrease in both Rotifera and Copepoda. In contrast, there was no effect on overall benthic consumer biomass, with only Asellus sp. biomass showing a negative response to warming. An autumnal increase in dissolved organic carbon led to increased total pelagic consumer biomass, which was related to increases in Daphnia sp. biomass but did not affect zoobenthos biomass. While we expected zooplankton and zoobenthos biomass to follow responses in primary and bacterial production to treatments, we did not find any relationship between consumer groups and these estimates of resource production.4. Our results suggest that consumer responses to warming and browning during autumn may lead to less overarching general changes in consumer biomass, and responses are mostly taxon-specific.5. This study gives novel insights into the effects of warming and browning on consumer biomass during autumn and spring and increases the understanding of the effects of climate change on invertebrate community biomass in the different habitats.					; Hamdan, Mohammed/HMD-4935-2023	puts, Isolde Callisto/0000-0003-0291-2639; Hamdan, Mohammed/0000-0003-4068-2109; Bergstrom, Ann-Kristin/0000-0001-5102-4289; Koizumi, Shuntaro/0000-0001-6855-6273													0046-5070	1365-2427				JUL	2023	68	7					1224	1237		10.1111/fwb.14099	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.14099		APR 2023											WOS:000973390200001

CHANGE CHARACTERISTICS OF WATER EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE YANGTZE RIVER AND THE DONGTING LAKE DURING 1960-2018 IN CHINA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Hydrological exchange between the trunk stream and the floodplains is the key factor maintaining ecological functioning. The water discharge diverting from the Yangtze River to the Dongting Lake has recently decreased considerably in China However, their variation characteristics and major driving factors remained unclear. In this study, Mann Kendall trend and Pettitt abrupt tests were employed to determine the changes of time series. Double mass curve analysis and regression analysis were used for the qualitative analysis of the impacts of climate change and human activity. Results revealed that precipitation change trends significantly decreased in autumn. The water discharge at the trunk Yangtze River had a decreasing trend in autumn and an increasing trend in winter. The annual and seasonal water discharge diverting from the Yangtze River to the Dongting Lake, except at Xinjiangkou in summer, exhibited significant downward trends. No consistent trends in precipitation and water discharge were identified, thereby indicating that the seasonal relationships between them had been disturbed by human activities.

J	VANDENBOSCH, F; SANTER, B				VANDENBOSCH, F; SANTER, B			CANNIBALISM IN CYCLOPS-ABYSSORUM	OIKOS												We study cannibalism in the cyclopoid copepod Cyclops abyssorum (Sars). The functional response of predatory stages Of C. abyssorum on inter- and conspecific prey is determined. Methods are developed to calculate the impact of cannibalism on populations. Four whole-lake studies found in the literature provide sufficient data to apply the methods. For these populations we calculate: 1. The cannibalism induced naupliar death-rate, CID. 2. The probability that a nauplius falls victim to cannibalism before reaching the copepodite stage, P(cann). 3. The percentage of the total amount of food ingested by the predator which is due to cannibalism, PWIC. P(cann) is on average 20% with a maximum of 80%. We conclude that cannibalism is an important factor in naupliar mortality. CID is on average 0.007 d-1 with a maximum of 0.026 d-1. PWIC shows a seasonal trend with minima in summer and maxima in winter. In winter conspecific nauplii constitute up to 45% of the total dry weight ingested by adult females. PWIC is smaller in lakes with larger alternative prey populations. Consequences for the dynamics of C. abyssorum populations are discussed.																			0030-1299	1600-0706				MAY	1993	67	1					19	28		10.2307/3545091	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3545091													WOS:A1993KZ77900003

The contemporary spatial distributions were compared with past distributions of the BBN and NAB stocks. Sixty-two percent of BBN tag recoveries occurred in Wisconsin waters during winter, spring and summer, but 83% of fall tag recoveries were made near the tagging site. Eighty-eight percent of the NAB tag recoveries were made in the management unit of tagging and 7% occurred into northern Lake Huron. Over 90% of the DET stock remained in the vicinity of the tagging sites regardless of the season, while 75% of the CHB tag recoveries were made in northwestern Lake Huron and 17% were made in Ontario. Based on regression tree analysis, there were strong stock, season, and year effects on movement distances, with weaker effects due to sex and length at tagging. Spatial distribution of the BBN stock changed from 1978-1982 to 2003-2008, but spatial distribution of the NAB stock did not. Substantial differences in movement and distribution existed among the four stocks, large seasonal differences in spatial distribution were found within some stocks, and lake whitefish exhibited strong spawning site fidelity. Present management unit boundaries are inappropriate for managing three of our four stocks, and agencies should consider developing single harvest limits for both northern Lake Huron and western Lake Michigan.

Temporal variability in dissolved organic matter composition export in streams	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from freshwater systems has been the focus of many studies owing to its pivotal role in regulating global carbon fluxes and ecosystem function. Both the flux and composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) are critical for understanding its ecological impact, as similar compositions can have vastly different consequences depending on the magnitude of input and hydrological context. However, very little data exists on the composition of DOM export fluxes to downstream ecosystems. Here we investigate the interaction of water temperature and discharge on DOC and DOM composition export fluxes in two streams draining contrasting watersheds (agriculture versus forested) in southern Ontario, Canada across seasons. Using Generalized Additive Models, we observed that both stream discharge and water temperature significantly affected DOM composition, and the proportion of terrestrial humic-like DOM exhibited strong positive relationship with discharge. Although DOC loads were comparable between the two streams, the export loads and fluxes of DOM composition (in terms of fluorescent loads and fluxes) differed significantly. These patterns of DOM composition fluxes in both streams remained consistent across seasons, suggesting that watershed characteristics and nutrient availability primarily govern DOM dynamics and export, while seasonal drivers such as discharge and temperature further modulate these patterns. Export loads and fluxes of DOM components were higher in spring and winter months compared to summer and autumn in both streams, while fluxes also increased at medium (Q10-Q90) and high flow (> Q10) at a variable extent in the contrasting streams. Temperature and discharge regulated export of DOM can be further affected with changing climate and increasing frequency of extreme events and alter the processing and delivery of DOM to downstream ecosystems.

These two areas were surveyed for lakes containing laminated sediments. Using bathymetry as a criterion, 60 small, deep lakes, representing preferred conditions for formation and preservation of lacustrine non-glacial varves, were selected for gravity coring. We found laminated sediments in 24 of the lakes, 15 in the Land of Great Masurian Lakes and 9 in the Suwaki Lakeland. Seven of these 24 sediment records were laminated in the topmost part only. Analysis of lake morphometric variables showed that the relation between surface area and maximum water depth can be used to identify lakes with laminated sediments. Most of the newly discovered lakes with laminated deposits have surface areas a parts per thousand currency sign0.3 km(2) and maximum depths of 15-35 m. Multivariate statistical analysis (Linear Discriminant Analysis) of the lake dataset identified the morphological features of lake basins and their catchments that largely control preservation of laminated sediments. Microscopic and geochemical analyses revealed a biogenic (carbonaceous) type of lamination typical for lakes in northeast Poland. Such lakes are characterized by a spring-summer lamina that is rich in calcium carbonate and an autumn-winter lamina composed of organic and minerogenic detritus. This pattern may be modified by multiple periods of calcite deposition during a single year or substantial contribution of clastic material. Laminations and high sedimentation rates offer the possibility of high-resolution investigation of past climate and environmental changes through application of myriad biological, isotopic and geochemical proxies.					; Tylmann, Wojciech/AAL-3504-2021; Enters, Dirk/AAF-1669-2021; Zolitschka, Bernd/P-1487-2019	Enters, Dirk/0000-0002-0484-541X; Tylmann, Wojciech/0000-0003-1749-5882; Zolitschka, Bernd/0000-0001-8256-0420; Ohlendorf, Christian/0000-0003-3794-7313; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				DEC	2013	50	4					487	503		10.1007/s10933-013-9741-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-013-9741-7													WOS:000326622200006

Lake water was amended with phosphorus (+P), organic carbon (+C), alone or in combination (+CP), to test for short-term changes (48 hours) in bacteria activity and community structure (CARD FISH). Experiments were carried out in spring and summer. Results showed that bacterial production increased in the +CP treatment in both lakes, and in the +P treatment in the ultroligotrophic lake. In both lakes the bacterial activity increased more rapidly in summer (within 24 hours). Bacteria composition changed in both seasons in all the treatments. At the beginning of the experiments the subclass of beta-Proteobacteria dominated both lakes, while gamma-Proteobacteria showed higher percentage in spring in Lake Maggiore and in summer in Lake Gutierrez. After incubation, in spring and in particular in the +CP treatment, we observed an increase in the relative importance of gamma-Proteobacteria in both lakes, whereas in Lake Maggiore this group declined in the summer experiments following an increase in beta-Proteobacteria. All our results indicate the different response of bacterioplankton in systems at the edges of the oligotrophic range.					; Balseiro, Esteban/Y-2743-2019	Balseiro, Esteban/0000-0002-5052-0587; Modenutti, Beatriz/0000-0002-8683-5679													1129-5767						2008	67	2					120	127		10.4081/jlimnol.2008.120	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2008.120													WOS:000261475800006

Developing habitat associations for fishes in Lake Winnipeg by linking large scale bathymetric and substrate data with fish telemetry detections	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Understanding relationships between freshwater fishes and habitat is critical for effective fisheries and habitat management. Habitat suitability indices (HSI) are commonly used to describe fish-habitat associations in rivers and other freshwater ecosystems. When applied to large lakes however, standard sampling procedures are inadequate because of larger sampling areas and an increased risk of fish collection bias through one-time observations. Here, we use lake bathymetry, substrate, and multiple fish telemetry detections collected from a systematically deployed receiver grid to develop HSI for four fish species (lake sturgeon, freshwater drum, common carp, and walleye) in Lake Winnipeg. Seasonal variations in habitat use based on water depth and substrate were observed in three of four species. Lake sturgeon remained in shallow locations with predominantly gravel substrate near the mouth of the Winnipeg River regardless of season. Freshwater drum persisted over fine substrate in both summer and winter but had a broader depth range in the summer compared to winter. Common carp shifted from mid-range depths and silt substrate in the summer to shallow depths and gravel substrate in the winter. Walleye showed an unchanging association to fine substrate but expanded from primarily mid-range depths in the summer to include shallower depths in the winter. These findings show how multiple telemetry detections per fish can be combined with hydroacoustic data to provide informative habitat associations for fishes in a large lacustrine ecosystem.

J	Dibike, Y; Prowse, T; Shrestha, R; Ahmed, R				Dibike, Yonas; Prowse, Terry; Shrestha, Rajesh; Ahmed, Roxanne			Observed trends and future projections of precipitation and air temperature in the Lake Winnipeg watershed	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												While the cause of eutrophication in Lake Winnipeg is known to be excess nutrient loading from watershed sources, few comprehensive studies have attempted to quantify the effects of changes in temperature and precipitation on the hydrological and nutrient transport regimes in the region. In this paper, results of spatial and temporal analyses of observed and regional climate model (RCM) projections of precipitation and air-temperature regimes within the Lake Winnipeg watershed (LWW) are presented. The Mann-Kendall trend analysis of observed data over a recent time period of 1961 to 2003 shows that, while there has been a consistent increasing trend in the mean annual air temperature in the region, there is no significant trend in annual precipitation. Seasonally, precipitation exhibited a significantly decreasing trend in the Saskatchewan and Assiniboine river basins during the winter and an increasing trend in part of the Red and Assiniboine river basins during summer season. Air temperatures showed significant increases in winter, spring and summer throughout the LWW. Future climate projections from three RCMs driven by the SRES's A2 emission scenario indicate that by the 2050s (2041-2070), total annual precipitation (air temperature) increases by 5.5-7.7% (2.1-2.8 degrees C) compared to the 1980s (1971-2000). These observed and projected changes in the climate regimes of the LWW will have important implications for the hydrology and nutrient transport regimes of this region, which is the subject of additional investigation in a companion paper of this special issue (Shrestha et al., 2012).

A Comparison Between Tropical and Subtropical Rivers	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												The unique environmental characteristics of the tropics and subtropics, including precipitation patterns, photoperiods and temperatures, can influence riverine zooplankton communities in contrasting ways. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the seasonal dynamics of zooplankton in tropical and subtropical rivers and compare the structure of zooplankton in response to distinct climatic conditions. To this end, we collected zooplankton samples from rivers located in two different climatic zones in Brazil (tropical and subtropical) during winter, spring, summer and autumn. Our results showed that testate amoebae and rotifers play a crucial role in zooplankton dynamics in both climatic zones, emerging as the predominant groups regarding density, species richness and diversity. In tropical rivers, seasonal variations in zooplankton are strongly influenced by temperature and flooding events, which affect total suspended solids, turbidity and pH. In subtropical rivers, zooplankton seasonal dynamics are closely linked to fluctuations in temperature and dissolved oxygen. We identified 142 zooplankton taxa, with the tropical zone comprising 125 taxa and the subtropical zone comprising 97 taxa. The results also revealed that tropical rivers had greater species richness and diversity than subtropical rivers. This disparity was primarily attributed to the higher temperatures, greater nutrient concentrations and lower thermal amplitudes in tropical waters compared to those in subtropical waters. Thus, it is evident that different climatic conditions have varying influences on riverine zooplankton dynamics, highlighting the need to consider regional characteristics in the management and conservation of aquatic ecosystems.					dos Santos Picapedra, Pablo Henrique/H-1609-2015; Picapedra, Pablo Henrique dos Santos/H-1609-2015	dos Santos Picapedra, Pablo Henrique/0000-0002-3244-7611; 													1535-1459	1535-1467				MAY	2025	41	4					820	835		10.1002/rra.4419	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.4419		JAN 2025											WOS:001392279300001

This paper examines the stormflow dynamics of heavy metals (Pb, Cu, Cd and Zn) in the Nant-y-Fendrod stream, South Wales, which has been affected by 250 years of metal smelting, followed by 35 years of landscape rehabilitation measures. For storm events of contrasting (very dry and very wet) antecedent conditions in May 2000 and February 2001, respectively, temporal changes in streamwater heavy metal concentrations above and below an in-line flood detention lake are analysed. At the upstream site, peaks in total metal concentration were recorded on the rising limb for Pb (0-150 mg l(-1)) and Cu (0-038 mg l(-1)) but on the falling limb for Zn (1-660 mg l(-1)) and Cd (0-006 mg l(-1)) in the summer 2000 storm event, yielding clockwise and anticlockwise hysteretic loops respectively. In contrast, metal concentrations, although high throughout the winter storm event, were diluted somewhat during the storm peak itself. The Pb and Cu appear to be supplied by quickflow processes and transported in close association with fine sediment, whereas Zn and Cd are delivered to the channel and lake by slower subsurface seepage in dissolved form. In the winter 2001 event, antecedent soil moisture and shallow groundwater levels were anomalously high and seepage sources of dissolved metals dominated. Downstream of the lake, Pb and Cu levels and suspended sediment were high in the summer storm, but low in the winter storm, suggesting retention with deposition of fine sediment in the lake during the latter. In the winter storm, Zn and Cd levels were higher downstream than upstream of the lake, perhaps because of additional seepage inputs from the surrounding slopes, which failed to have an impact during summer. An understanding of the complex interplay of antecedent soil moisture and the dynamics of subsurface seepage pathways in relation to the three-dimensional distribution of sources is important in modelling heavy metal fluxes and levels in contaminated urban catchments.

This group has been extensively studied via physiological and ecological approaches, albeit their genomics has lagged behind. Here, we monitored a small, shallow, karstic lake, Lagunillo de Cardenillas, that developed a pink coloration throughout the whole water column and prevailed for ca. 2 years across seasons of the limnological cycle. Combining the study of physical/chemical parameters, amplicon sequencing, metagenomics, genomics, and microscopy, we observed this phenomenon was caused by blooms of a novel Thiocapsa species, which represented ca. 40% of the total microbial biomass of the lake's water column during the autumn/winter mixing period, and ca. 36% in the anoxic layers during spring/summer stratification. The dominance of this microbe was attributed to the high sulfur concentrations and biogeochemical features of the lake combined with various genomic footprints/abilities of this microbe to utilize different nutrient sources under anoxic and oxic/microaerophilic conditions. The latter included nitrogen (cyanate and ethanolamine hydrolysis, N fixation, dissimilatory nitrate reduction, ammonia assimilation, denitrification), carbon (anoxygenic photosynthesis and the presence of alpha-carboxysomes and type IA RuBisCOs) and sulfur (dimethylsulfide [DMS] and thiosulfate oxidation, dimethylsulfoxide [DMSO] reduction). In addition, this novel species possessed genes for gas vesicle formation, anoxic/oxic respiration pathways, hydrogenases, oxic stress response, and a CRISPR-Cas array. Thus, its extensive genomic repertoire helped explain its versatility and success in colonizing both the anoxic layers and the oxic/anoxic interphase in this lake.

Therefore, different precipitation regimes bring about the opposing changes in dry/wet states between eastern and central Asia (EA and CA). Based on a comprehensive study of modern observational datasets, ensemble simulations of eight climate models from the Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project phase 3 (PMIP3), and a compilation of 42 proxy records from EA and CA, here we assess the relationship of seasonal precipitation signals involving rain and heat periods and the difference and linkage in dry/wet states from EA and CA. At short-term timescales, empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis results of mean annual precipitation show the spatial diversity of overall precipitation patterns in EA and CA. However, EOF results of summer and winter precipitation indicate a similarity between EA and the east of CA, suggesting that seasonal signals of precipitation affected by the Asian monsoon, westerlies, ENSO, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) are the primary factors causing the linkage in dry/wet states.At long-term timescales, reconstructed dry/wet states from proxy records since the LGM reveal a parallel evolution in EA and the east of CA as well. A visual inspection from PMIP3 multi-model simulations in summer and winter shows that the insolation in different seasons controls the intensity of westerlies and summer monsoon and further influences the summer and winter precipitation in EA and CA since the LGM. Overall, we suggest, in addition to the traditional difference caused by different precipitation regimes, that dry/wet states in EA and CA universally have inter-regional connections affected by seasonal signals of precipitation at multiple timescales.

A cluster analysis is used to extract patterns of multivariate climate response from the reconstructions; these are then compared to the patterns simulated by models. According to paleodata, summers during mid-Holocene were warmer-than-present in the north, and cooler-than-present in the south, while winters were colder-than-present in the southwest but milder-than-present in the northeast. Whereas warmer summers and colder winters may easily be explained as a direct response to the amplified seasonal cycle of insolation during the mid-Holocene, the other recorded responses are less straightforward to explain. We have identified, from the models that correctly simulate the recorded climate change, two important atmospheric and hydrological processes that can compensate for direct insolation effects. First, a stronger-than-present airflow from southwestern Europe that veers to the north over Eastern Europe, in winter, can consistently explain the reconstructed changes in this season's temperatures and water budget. Second, the increased winter soil moisture allows a shift of the partitioning of net radiative energy towards latent rather than sensible heat fluxes, thereby decreasing surface temperature during the following summer season. Our approach therefore solves one of the recurring problems in model-data comparisons that arises when a model simulates the correct response but in the wrong location (as a consequence, for instance, of model resolution and topography).

Using annual DOC concentration in nine boreal lakes in the ice-free season, the potential influences of five regional factors, air temperature, precipitation, SO4 deposition, solar radiation (photosynthetically active radiation, or PAR) and the southern oscillation index (SOI) have been explored through multiple regression. Mean solar radiation, winter precipitation and summer precipitation explained 59% of the variation in the mean DOC concentration (F-3.17 = 8.29, p = 0.0013). Solar radiation and winter precipitation were correlated, negatively, while summer precipitation was correlated, positively, with DOC concentration. Because these relationships were based on only 21 years of data (1979 to 1998), the significance of the parameters in the repression model was evaluated with a randomisation test. This re-analysis indicated that summer precipitation did not contribute significantly to the regression model (p = 0.183). The final multiple regression explained 50% of the variation in DOC (F-2.18-9.33, prand= 0.002) based on solar radiation and winter precipitation.

J	Dudinák, V; Spakulová, M				Dudinák, V; Spakulová, M			The life cycle and seasonal changes in the occurrence of Pomphorhynchus laevis (Palaeacanthocephala, Pomphorhynchidae) in a small isolated lake	PARASITE												In a small isolated lake in Slovakia, the fish ocanthocephalan Pomphorhynchus laevis using Gommarus balconicus and the minnow Phoxinus phoxinus, respectively, as its intermediate and final hosis, represented a dominant helminth species. Its prevalence and intensity of infection in fish showed no significant variation during a year fluctuating above the mean values of 89 and 6.6 worms per fish. The mean prevalence of P. laevis larvae in Gammarus was 41.4 % with a maximum in the late summer and autumn; individual crustaceans were infected by 1-9 larvae, I here v,,as one generation of P. laevis per year. Following up an annual cycle, on occurrence of new infections of Gammarus culminated in October and in the next May for Phoxinus. The sex ratios of both the adults and larvae of acanthocephalans were near unify but favoured slightly males in spring and autumn. The distribution of P. laevis in minnows and crustaceans was highly aggregated and fitted with the negative binomial model. The spatial distribution analysis of parasites along the fish alimentary tract; showed a clear preference of P. laevis for its proximal half, with the maximum numbers in the site of the first intestinal loop. Immature worms at both sexes predominated in the proximal region and moved slightly down the alimentary tract during their growth and maturation.

We analyzed the seasonal effect of zebra mussel colonies on benthic respiration (O-2, TCO2, N-2, and CH4) and nutrient fluxes (NH4 (+), NO (x) (-) , SRP, and SiO2) in a macrophyte-dominated mesotrophic temperate lake. Intact sediments with and without zebra mussel aggregates were collected in winter, summer, and autumn, and incubated to measure fluxes. The contribution of mussel colonies alone to benthic metabolism was also quantified. Sediments with mussels always had higher rates of respiration (O-2 and TCO2) and nutrient recycling (NH4 (+) and SRP) as compared to bare sediments, while there was no effect on CH4, NO3 (-), and SiO2 fluxes. Mussel colonies stimulated nitrogen removal via denitrification, but only in the summer. The effect of colonies was particularly evident in warmer periods, due to mussel respiration and excretion and to biodeposits that increased microbial activity in sediments. In this mesotrophic lake, mussel aggregates contribute to alleviate nutrient (N and P) limitation, but their heterotrophic activity is likely buffered by nutrient uptake and oxygen production by submersed vegetation.

Lagrangian sampling was carried out during six sampling trips, one at every hydrological season except winter from the period of the summer low flow of 1990 to the spring freshet of 1992. Loadings of atrazine are subject to annual variations induced by different climatic and hydrological conditions. Loadings of atrazine are also dependent on season. Results emphasize the persistence of atrazine as it was found in significant amounts at the end of the growing season and in the following spring. Variations in loadings of atrazine along the river as well as the lateral distribution of atrazine concentrations in a downstream direction suggest inputs within the province of Quebec. The Great Lakes and the international corridor of the St. Lawrence River contribute 68% of the loading exported to the estuary, while Quebec tributaries account for 8% of the inputs. The importance of the unmeasured sources within the river itself (24%) stresses the need for further research on internal processes and contaminant transfer in the aquatic environment.																			0049-6979					AUG	1996	90	3-4					355	374		10.1007/BF00282656	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00282656													WOS:A1996VB13500001

Efficacy of a dual fluorescence method in detecting the viability of overwintering cyanobacteria	LETTERS IN APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY												Chill in the light is the major environmental stress that cyanobacteria encounter in winter. Cyanobacterial cells may acquire chill-light tolerance upon exposure to low temperature in autumn and early winter. We sought to establish the efficacy of the dual fluorescence method in detecting the viability of overwintering cyanobacteria and to provide further evidence for the chill-light tolerance of preconditioned cyanobacteria. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Microcystis aeruginosa PCC 7806 were exposed to chill (5 degrees C)-light stress with or without pretreatment at 15 degrees C and stained with SYTO 9 and propidium iodide. Live and dead cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope, and the percentage of viable cells was quantified on a microplate reader. The dual fluorescence method showed consistent results with tests of the ability to reinitiate growth. Cell viability was quantitatively correlated with ratio of SYTO 9/propidium iodide fluorescence. Previously, Microcystis colonies in Lake Taihu had been found to accumulate RNA-binding protein 1 in autumn and winter. Use of this method directly showed the viability of such Microcystis colonies throughout the winter.																			0266-8254					SEP	2013	57	3					174	180		10.1111/lam.12095	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lam.12095								23627896					WOS:000322954700002

Evidence of an extreme weather-induced phenological mismatch and a local extirpation of the endangered Karner blue butterfly	CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE												In 2011, an experiment was undertaken to examine spring synchrony between the endangered Karner blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis) (Kbb) and its obligate host plant, wild blue lupine (Lupinus perennis) at Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore (INDU), where the southernmost population of Kbb occurred at the time of this study. From 2012 to 2014, field-placed Kbb eggs were observed for larvae hatching in conjunction with observations of lupine emergence in oak savanna habitat. In 2012, 61% of Kbb hatched when <5% of lupine had emerged due to an extreme early spring event as compared to subsequent years where temporal overlap was >15% between Kbb and lupine. Laboratory experiments testing the sensitivity of Kbb hatching to warm temperatures during the winter of 2011-2012 confirmed that Kbb eggs were susceptible to temperature-induced hatching. In the summer of 2012, second generation Kbb larvae feeding on sun-exposed lupine had higher mortality due to the heat and drought conditions that resulted in earlier plant senescence. Following 2012, Kbb were no longer observed at INDU. This observation illustrates the pressing need for adaptive management strategies that account for extreme weather events brought on by climate change.

Parasites of the lake-endemic Fundulus waccamensis (Waccamaw Killifish) have not been described previously. In 2011, we collected Waccamaw Killifish (n = 101) by seining and dip netting from 3 sites over 3 seasons (spring, summer, and fall) to investigate the identity, prevalence, and intensity of the parasite-component community. We found 13 taxa of parasites, all of which were new host records, and total prevalence of parasitism = 95%. Infected hosts contained 2.3 +/- 1.0 (mean +/- SD) parasite species, with the component community composed of 6 ecto-and 7 endoparasites. The most prevalent (70.3%) and highest mean intensity (17.3 metacercariae per host) infections were associated with the generalist trematode Posthodiplostomum minimum.

Reconstructing Arctic Precipitation Seasonality Using Aquatic Leaf Wax δ2H in Lakes With Contrasting Residence Times	PALEOCEANOGRAPHY AND PALEOCLIMATOLOGY												Arctic precipitation is predicted to increase this century. Records of past precipitation seasonality provide baselines for a mechanistic understanding of the dynamics controlling Arctic precipitation. We present an approach to reconstruct Arctic precipitation seasonality using stable hydrogen isotopes (delta H-2) of aquatic plant waxes in neighboring lakes with contrasting water residence times and present a case study of this approach in two lakes on western Greenland. Residence time calculations suggest that growing season lake water delta H-2 in one lake reflects summer precipitation delta H-2, while the other reflects amount-weighted annual precipitation delta H-2 and evaporative enrichment. Aquatic plant wax delta H-2 in the "summer lake" is relatively constant throughout the Holocene, perhaps reflecting competing effects of local summer warmth and increased distal moisture transport due to a strengthened latitudinal temperature gradient. In contrast, aquatic plant wax delta H-2 in the "mean annual lake" is 100 parts per thousand H-2 depleted from 6 to 4 ka relative to the beginning and end of the record. Because there are relatively minor changes in summer precipitation delta H-2, we interpret the 100 parts per thousand H-2 depletion in mean annual precipitation to reflect an increase in winter precipitation amount, likely accompanied by changes in winter precipitation delta H-2 and decreased evaporative enrichment. Thus, unlike the "summer lake," the "mean annual lake" records changes in winter precipitation. This dual-lake approach may be applied to reconstruct past changes in precipitation seasonality at sites with strong precipitation isotope seasonality and minimal lake water evaporative enrichment.

Chupakov, Artem; Kopysov, Sergey			Element transport in the Taz River, western Siberia	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												The riverine export fluxes of dissolved carbon, nutrient and metals from the land to the Arctic Ocean are fairly well quantified for five large Arctic rivers but remain virtually unknown for mid-sized Eurasian rivers, notably those draining through the permafrost zone. Because such rivers can most rapidly respond to on-going climate warming and permafrost thaw in the Arctic, their current hydrochemical composition and elemental yields are badly needed for judging the level of changes in the very near future. Towards quantifying the annual export fluxes and assessing the mechanisms of seasonal variability of river solutes, we monitored the pristine subarctic Taz River (Swatershed= 150,000 km2), which drains through boreal forest and peatlands in the discontinuous and continuous permafrost zone, on a weekly to monthly basis over a 3 year period. Based on seasonal pattern of riverine solutes (< 0.45 mu m) and their dependence on discharge, 3 groups of elements were distinguished. These groups of solutes were consistent with several main sources of elements in the main stem of the Taz River such as deep groundwater, riparian zone and floodplain lake sediments, plant litter, mineral soil water, and peatwater from the peatlands. The 1st group was represented by dissolved inor-ganic carbon (DIC), specific conductivity, and some nutrients (NO3, NH4, Ntot and Si) and soluble elements that originated from groundwater and deep soil mineral horizons (Cl, SO4, Li, B, Na, Mg, Ca, Si, K, Rb, Mn, Co, Sr, Mo, Cs, Ba and W) and showed maximal concentration at the end of winter, before the spring ice-off. This group showed negative correlation to discharge. The 2nd group included dissolved organic carbon (DOC), low-mobile hydrolysates and organically-complexed trace metals (Al, Be, V, Ni, Y, Se, Zr, Nb, REEs, Hf, Pb and Th) which demonstrated maximal concentrations during the spring flood and autumn high flow and minimal values during winter. The concentration of these elements generally increased with water discharge, presumably due to their mobilization in the form of organic and organo-mineral colloids by surface flow through forest litter and via suprapermafrost flow from peatlands. And lastly, the 3rd group of solutes included macronutrients (P, N), Fe, Ti, Cr, Ga, Ge, As, Pb, and U which exhibited features of first two groups and originated from both surface and underground sources. This group showed the strong impact of autochthonous biotic processes in the river channel and soils of the watershed (nutrients, Si). Similar to other Arctic rivers, the spring flood (May and June) provided 30-40% of annual export for DOC, macronutrients and most major and minor solutes. The exceptions are DIC, Si, Ca, Mg and Fe which exhibited essential (30-40%) export during winter baseflow, whereas >70% of annual Mn flux occurred in winter. A number of elements present in the snowpack exhibited sizable (> 45%) export during spring flood (Zn, Cu, Pb, Cd, Sb and Cs). The 3 years mean export fluxes (yields) of dissolved components were comparable to or 30-50% lower than those of other large and medium sized Arctic rivers. This was due mostly to a lack of fresh unaltered rocks and a dominance of peatlands within the Taz River watershed. Elevated concentrations of redox-sensitive micro-nutrients (such as Fe and Mn) occurring during winter baseflow can be linked to disproportionally large floodplain zone of this river which can act, especially in the river's lower reaches, as a stratified lake thereby releasing high amounts of redox-sensitive elements from the sediments. The role of suboxic zones in the Arctic boreal riverine landscape may be more important than previously thought, and may allow explaining anoma-lously high concentrations of some metals (i.e., Mn) reported in Arctic Ocean surface waters. It is anticipated that climate warming in the region may increase the contribution of winter flow and enhance the export of soluble elements and some nutrients (such as Si, Mn and Co).

However, it is unclear whether environmental heterogeneity caused by multiple physico-chemical factors can affect the spatial distribution of phytoplankton and its functional groups. In this study, we investigated the seasonal variation and spatial distribution of phytoplankton community structure and its relationships with environmental factors in Lake Chaohu from August 2020 to July 2021. We recorded a total of 190 species from 8 phyla, which were divided into 30 functional groups, including 13 dominating functional groups. The average annual phytoplankton density and biomass were (5.46 +/- 7.17) x10(7) cells/L and 4.80 +/- 4.61 mg/L, respectively. The density and biomass of phytoplankton were higher in summer ((14.64 +/- 20.34) x10(7) cells/L, 10.61 +/- 13.16 mg/L) and autumn ((6.79 +/- 3.97) x10(7) cells/L, 5.57 +/- 2.40 mg/L), with the M and H2 of dominant functional groups. The dominant functional groups were N, C, D, J, MP, H2, and M in spring, whereas functional groups C, N, T, and Y dominated in winter. The distribution of phytoplankton community structure and dominant functional groups exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity in the lake, which was consistent with the environmental heterogeneity of the lake and could be classified into four locations. Location I had higher phytoplankton density and biomass than the other three locations. Additionally, dominant functional groups M, C, and H2 were present throughout the lake, and all 13 dominant functional groups were observed in Location II. Our findings suggest that environmental heterogeneity is a key factor influencing the spatial distribution of phytoplankton functional groups in Lake Chaohu.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				JUL	2023	30	32					79001	79014		10.1007/s11356-023-28043-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-023-28043-5		JUN 2023						37278896					WOS:001004423100015

Study of accumulation and human health risk assessment of trace elements in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Trace elements owing to their bioaccumulation, bio-magnification and higher persistency characteristics have become a major potential risk for aquatic ecosystem worldwide. It is now widely accepted that these trace elements are accumulated in various organs of aquatic organisms and consumption of such animals like fish pose a potential health risk to human. Current study assessed the seasonal (autumn, winter, and spring, summer) accumulation of various trace elements (Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb) in liver, kidney, gills and muscles of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) at Abbasia canal Uch Sharif, Punjab, Pakistan. Moreover, health risks associated with the consumption of O. niloticus were also investigated. Three sites (SI, SII, and SIII) of Abbasia canal, 300 m apart, near Uch Sharif, Punjab, Pakistan were sampled for fish collection. The obtained results confirmed a statistical difference (p < 0.05) in accumulation of trace elements in fish organs, seasons and a non-significant difference (p > 0.05) among various sites. Studies trace elements were found in higher concentrations (mu g/g) in liver (6.81 +/- 0.10) and kidney (7.10 +/- 0.20) than gills (6.06 +/- 0.26) and muscles (4.11 +/- 0.24) with an accumulation trend of liver > kidney > gills > muscle. Furthermore, the overall mean accumulation of trace elements in different body tissues were in the order of Pb (8.76 +/- 0.36) > Cd (6.75 +/- 0.15) > Ni (4.93 +/- 0.21) > Cr (3.64 +/- 0.09). The results also concluded that O. niloticus was safe for human consumption as HITE, THQ(TE) and CRTE values for all studied trace elements were within the permissible limits.

High resolution data collected over 2.5 years (1 Mar 2011 to 30 Sep 2013) revealed inconsistent patterns in (1) the timing and magnitude of lake turnover and (2) the relative importance of the transfer of hypolimnetic sediment-derived P to the epilimnion when compared with external catchment loading. Lake turnover events during spring and summer had the effect of increasing the internal loading of epilimnetic P during the main growing season, thus adding to eutrophication pressure and contributing to algal blooms in the lake. Abrupt pre-fall (autumnal) turnover events and associated increases in eutrophication pressure such as those reported here may become more frequent occurrences in western Europe because of warming-induced increases in Atlantic summer storm frequency and magnitude, and they could counter the apparent effectiveness of measures aimed at reducing eutrophication impacts through limiting external loadings of nutrients from the catchment.					; Taylor, David/ISS-5752-2023	Taylor, David/0000-0002-6098-5636; Melland, Alice/0000-0003-2323-251X; Crockford, Lucy/0000-0001-8336-4149; Jordan, Philip/0000-0002-0893-4591													2044-2041	2044-205X					2015	5	1					15	26		10.5268/IW-5.1.738	http://dx.doi.org/10.5268/IW-5.1.738													WOS:000347285900003
J	Yamamoto, Y				Yamamoto, Yoshimasa			Indirect impact of bluegill Lepomis macrochirus on the development of cyanobacterial blooms in Lake Biwa, Japan	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Seasonal variations in the abundance of cyanobacteria and catch per unit effort (CPUE) of bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) were investigated in Lake Biwa of Japan. High CPUE occurred from late spring to autumn when cyanobacteria dominated the community of photosynthetic plankton. However, the CPUE decreased substantially when the population density of cyanobacteria increased dramatically within an hour. Seasonal variation in the body weight of the fish with a fixed length was estimated from the length-weight relationships, revealing that body weight increased rapidly in early spring and reached its first peak in late spring, eventually decreasing in autumn after reaching the second peak. In May, bluegill fed on extremely large numbers of Bosmina longirostris when it dominated the zooplankton community. From June, the main diet of the bluegill became epiphytic filamentous green algae, which are the competitors for cyanobacteria. The biomass of submersed macrophytes in Lake Biwa has increased recently, potentially affecting cyanobacteria adversely since submersed macrophytes release allelochemicals and provide a habitat for cladocerans. However, propagation of submersed macrophytes also benefits bluegill, possibly contributing to the dominance of cyanobacteria by reducing the amounts of cladocerans and epiphytic algae.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				SEP	2011	26	3					323	335		10.1080/02705060.2011.556419	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2011.556419													WOS:000298288200003

Water samples were collected in spring and summer from south to north at eight water quality monitoring stations, respectively. The results showed that seasonal changes had a more pronounced effect on the bacterioplankton community compositions (BCCs) than spatial variation. The diversity analysis results indicated that samples of summer have more operational taxonomic units (OTUs), higher richness and diversity than those in spring. The main phyla, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria and Chloroflexi, displayed significant differences (P < 0.05) between spring and summer in the main channel. The Redundancy analysis (RDA) targeting all samples indicated that specific conductivity (SPC), dissolved oxygen (DO), pH and temperature (T) might be key factors in driving BCCs, while trophic status showed no significant correlation (P > 0.05). The present study provides important insights into the potential ecological roles of specific taxa in the new artificial ecosystem and it offers reference for studies on ecosystem succession of other giant interbasin water diversion project in the world.

Carbon dioxide supersaturation in high-elevation oligotrophic lakes and reservoirs in the Sierra Nevada, California	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												To better understand the contribution of alpine lakes to global CO2 emissions, carbon dioxide concentrations and fluxes to the atmosphere were measured in five high-elevation lakes and five reservoirs in the Sierra Nevada, California. Median summer surface concentrations of dissolved CO2 (reservoirs: 21.1 mu M, lakes: 23.7 mu M) were supersaturated for most of the ice-free season. Median diffusive flux of CO2 was low as compared to other inland waters (lakes: 260 mg CO2 m(-2) d(-1), reservoirs: 192 mg CO2 m(-2) d(-1)). Linear mixed modeling demonstrated that the length of ice cover, persisting for 5-9 months and allowing for accumulation of under-ice CO2, was a strong predictor of summer surface CO2. During the ice-free period, surface evasion of CO2 was highest for the first 40 d after ice-off when carbon dioxide that had accumulated during winter was released, although supersaturation and evasion continued until fall at most sites despite low rates of ecosystem metabolism. This study suggests that the contribution of high-elevation, oligotrophic lakes and reservoirs in the Sierra to global CO2 emissions are small despite persistent supersaturation, and are primarily driven by the duration of ice cover.

Gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum dominated esocid diets (77-97% by weight) through autumn but were absent by spring. Diets in late autumn and spring included sunfishes Lepomis spp. and brook silversides Labidesthes sicculus. Northern pike and tiger muskellunge grew faster than muskellunge through the first year. Food consumption was highest for tiger muskellunge, followed by northern pike, then muskellunge. Growth rates and rations were highest immediately after stocking, declining through autumn to their lowest levels in December and spring. A bioenergetic model underestimated final mass by a factor of two to three for all esocids; predictions for food consumption were better than those for growth but still overestimated observed values by 39-52%. Neither behavioral thermoregulation nor incorporation of seasonal energetic content of prey altered predictions (maximum of 2% increase). In contrast, adjustments in metabolic rates to account for differences in season and temperature substantially improved model predictions. Size-selective mortality did not account for the inaccuracies in model predictions. Conversion efficiencies (39-63%) exceeded those previously measured for esocids fed maximum rations, suggesting that model variables should be determined for a range of ration levels. Though used extensively, the predictions of bioenergetic models should not be accepted until the models have been subjected to additional field verification.																			0002-8487					MAR	1991	120	2					230	246		10.1577/1548-8659(1991)120<0230:FCAGOT>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1991)120<0230:FCAGOT>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1991FR51600010

We applied this technique for the first time in the pelagic zone of a small temperate meso-eutrophic lake to identify the dominant N cycling pathways, and their spatial and temporal variability. We measured the lake NO3 (-) delta N-15 and delta O-18 signatures over an annual cycle and compared them to that of the watershed. Both delta N-15 and delta O-18 of NO3 (-) in the lake increased during summer relative to the inputs. Relationships between lake NO3 (-) isotopic composition and concentrations were different across thermal strata with an apparent isotope effect in the epilimnion of (15)epsilon(epi) = 4.6aEuro degrees and (18)epsilon(epi) = 10.9aEuro degrees. We found a strong deviation of the lake NO3 (-) delta O-18 and delta N-15 from the expected 1:1 line for assimilation (slope = 1.73) suggesting that nitrification was co-occurring. We estimated that nitrification could support between 5 and 30% of nitrate-based production during the growing season, but was negligible in early spring and fall, and probably more dominant under ice. We showed that the technique is promising to study N processes at the ecosystem scale in shallow lakes, particularly during winter. Our results suggest that recycled NO3 (-) could support primary productivity and influence phytoplankton composition in the surface waters of small lakes.

Metabarcoding reveals unique microbial mat communities and evidence of biogeographic influence in low-oxygen, high-sulfur sinkholes and springs	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												High-sulfur, low-oxygen environments formed by underwater sinkholes and springs create unique habitats populated by microbial mat communities. To explore the diversity and biogeography of these mats, samples were collected from three sites in Alpena, Michigan, one site in Monroe, Michigan, and one site in Palm Coast, Florida. Our study investigated previously undescribed eukaryotic diversity in these habitats and further explored their bacterial communities. Mat samples and water parameters were collected from sulfur spring sites during the spring, summer, and fall of 2022. Cyanobacteria and diatoms were cultured from mat subsamples to create a culture-based DNA reference library. Remaining mat samples were used for metabarcoding of the 16S and rbcL regions to explore bacterial and diatom diversity, respectively. Analyses of water chemistry, alpha diversity, and beta diversity articulated a range of high-sulfur, low-oxygen habitats, each with distinct microbial communities. Conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, sulfate, and chloride had significant influences on community composition but did not describe the differences between communities well. Chloride concentration had the strongest correlation with microbial community structure. Mantel tests revealed that biogeography contributed to differences between communities as well. Our results provide novel information on microbial mat composition and present evidence that both local conditions and biogeography influence these unique communities. Groundwater-fed underwater sinkholes and springs create habitats with high-sulfur, low-oxygen conditions. Multi-marker metabarcoding was used to describe microbial mat communities in these extreme aquatic habitats. Unique bacterial and diatom communities were found in five springs in Michigan and Florida, with water parameters and biogeography contributing to these differences.image					Casamatta, Dale/O-4295-2014	Hamsher, Sarah/0000-0002-5748-9770													2045-7758					MAR	2024	14	3							e11162	10.1002/ece3.11162	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.11162								38529029					WOS:001189775000001

In this study, polyurethane foam (PUF)-disk based passive air samples were collected in and around a big steel industrial park of Anshan. Northeast China from June 2008 to March 2009. The levels, seasonal variations and potential sources of PCDD/Fs, PCBs and PBDEs in the atmosphere around the steel industrial complex were investigated, and potential contribution of these three groups of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) from iron and steel production was also assessed. The air concentrations of Sigma(17)PCDD/Fs (summer: 0.02-2.77 pg m(-3); winter: 0.20-9.79 pg m(-3)). Sigma(19)PCBs (summer: 23.5-155.8 pg m(-3); winter: 14.6-81.3 pg m(-3)) and Sigma(13)PBDEs (summer: 2.91-10.7 pg m(-3): winter: 1.10-3.89 pg m(-3)) in this targeted industrial park were relatively low in comparison to other studies, which implied that the industrial activities of iron and steel had not resulted in serious contamination to the ambient air in this area. On the whole, the air concentrations of PCDD/Fs in winter were higher than those of summer, whereas the concentrations of PCBs and PBDEs showed opposite trends. The result from principal component analysis indicated that coal combustion might be the main contributor of PCDD/F sources in this area. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Savard, JPL; Robert, M				Savard, Jean-Pierre L.; Robert, Michel			Relationships among Breeding, Molting and Wintering Areas of Adult Female Barrow's Goldeneyes (Bucephala islandica) in Eastern North America	WATERBIRDS												While the breeding and wintering ranges of the eastern population of Barrow's Goldeneyes (Bucephala islandica) are generally described, molting locations and links among breeding, molting, and wintering areas are unclear, particularly for adult females. Incubating females from the same breeding location (n = 5) were equipped with satellite transmitters in June 2009. Four molting sites were identified over 2 years, spread broadly across Quebec: an inlet in Ungava Bay 1,100 km from the breeding area, a lake 100 km south of Ungava Bay (880 km from breeding area), a lake near Hudson Bay (910 km from breeding area) and the mouth of the Riviere aux Outardes River in the St. Lawrence Estuary (165 km from breeding area). The distance between molting females averaged 755 km and two females molted in regions where males were known to molt. Of four birds with consecutive years of molt locations, three showed inter-annual fidelity to within 5 km of the previous molt sites and the fourth molted in sites that were 968 km apart. Females wintered in different locations within the St. Lawrence Estuary and moved widely throughout the area during winter. The south coast of the St. Lawrence Estuary was used during spring and fall staging, and the north coast during winter. There was not strong migratory connectivity among annual cycle stages in eastern adult female Barrow's Goldeneyes, indicating that they should be considered a single management unit that occurs over a broad range throughout the year.

J	Li, HQ; Liu, LM; Ji, X				Li, Hongqing; Liu, Liming; Ji, Xiang			Modeling the relationship between landscape characteristics and water quality in a typical highly intensive agricultural small watershed, Dongting lake basin, south central China	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Understanding the relationship between landscape characteristics and water quality is critically important for estimating pollution potential and reducing pollution risk. Therefore, this study examines the relationship between landscape characteristics and water quality at both spatial and temporal scales. The study took place in the Jinjing River watershed in 2010; seven landscape types and four water quality pollutions were chosen as analysis parameters. Three different buffer areas along the river were drawn to analyze the relationship as a function of spatial scale. The results of a Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis suggest that "source" landscape, namely, tea gardens, residential areas, and paddy lands, have positive effects on water quality parameters, while forests exhibit a negative influence on water quality parameters because they represent a "sink" landscape and the sub-watershed level is identified as a suitable scale. Using the principal component analysis, tea gardens, residential areas, paddy lands, and forests were identified as the main landscape index. A stepwise multiple regression analysis was employed to model the relationship between landscape characteristics and water quality for each season. The results demonstrate that both landscape composition and configuration affect water quality. In summer and winter, the landscape metrics explained approximately 80.7 % of the variance in the water quality variables, which was higher than that for spring and fall (60.3 %). This study can help environmental managers to understand the relationships between landscapes and water quality and provide landscape ecological approaches for water quality control and land use management.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				MAR	2015	187	3							129	10.1007/s10661-015-4349-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-015-4349-1								25697310					WOS:000350684300014

The annual testicular cycle is divided into 5 stages and cyclical changes in the spermatogenetic activity have been related to the changing environmental factors, namely day length and water temperature. The annual cycle consists of a prolonged mitotic phase during the fall and winter, and the shorter meiotic phase during the spring. Lobule boundary cells have been examined and changes in their activity have been recorded. Continued spermatogenetic activity during spawning enables repeated spermiation, which is advantageous since the males are comparatively fewer than the females.

At the end of the Pianico Interglacial, continuous varve formation was replaced by predominantly detrital sedimentation. However, 427 varve-years before this shift, an abrupt increase in the frequency and thickness of detrital layers occurred. Microfacies analyses reveal a total of 152 detrital layers, ranging from 0.2 to 20.15 mm in thickness, deposited during the last 896 years of the Pianico Interglacial. Three microfacies types are distinguished: (i) graded layers, (ii) non-graded silt layers, and (iii) matrix-supported layers. The position of detrital layers within an individual varve provides additional information on the season in which they have been deposited. Microfacies analyses in combination with varve counting further enabled precise varve-to-varve correlation of the detrital layers for two sediment sections cropping out ca 130 m apart. The detailed intra-basin correlation allows the source regions of detrital layers to be inferred. Moreover, micro-erosion at sub-millimetre scale has been established. Of the described facies types, only the accumulation of summer and spring graded and non-graded silt layers abruptly increased before the end of interglacial varve formation whereas non-graded winter silt and matrix-supported layers are randomly distributed over the entire study period. Heavy rainfalls are assumed to have triggered spring and summer graded layers, so that the occurrence of these layers is thought to be a proxy for extreme precipitation events in the past.

Aquivalence revisited - New model formulation and application to assess environmental fate of ionic pharmaceuticals in Hamilton Harbour, Lake Ontario	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL												A model formulation based on "aquivalence", as defined in terms of activity is presented to estimate the multimedia fate of ionizing chemicals. The aquivalence approach is analogous to fugacity but aquivalence is applicable to neutral and ionizing compounds, and has been applied previously to speciating chemicals, notably metals. The new aquivalence-based mass-balance model treats ionizing organic compounds that exist as interconverting neutral and ionic species which are subject to fate processes at differing rates. The model is illustrated by application to four ionizing pharmaceuticals in Hamilton Harbour, Lake Ontario. At the system pH of 7.9-8.5, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, and naproxen are expected to be almost entirely ionic and triclosan split between ionic and neutral forms. Measured seasonal surface water concentrations, which were 2-10 times lower in the late summer and fall than during spring, were used to solve for unknown values of chemical half-life in the water column due to degradation (photo- and bio-) of the ionizing and neutral forms and secondarily, ionic sorption coefficients of the ionizing forms. Model estimates of half-lives in the habour's water ranged from 11 to 77, 11 to 147 and 10 to 37 for ionic ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, and naproxen. respectively; and 4-22 days and 2-9 days for ionic and neutral triclosan, respectively, with the shortest half-lives in spring and the longest in summer.

Synoptic climate evidence of a late-twentieth century change to earlier spring ice-out on Maine Lakes, USA	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Trend analysis of spring ice-out on eight lakes within the state of Maine of the northeastern USA reveals a change to earlier occurrence by 1 to 2weeks over the period 1956-2015. Much of the trend occurred from the late 1970s through the 1980s, but a secondary trend toward earlier ice-out appears to have begun in the late 1990s. Synoptic climate data support local and hemispheric climate evidence of increasingly earlier ice-out, particularly during the earlier period of pronounced change. Local spring and winter maximum daily air temperatures increased while winter precipitation decreased; synoptic weather types of moderate temperature character increased in frequency, while polar types became less frequent; synoptic weather types became warmer in spring and winter, and in spring, warmer weather types became wetter, while cooler weather types became drier; and two key climate teleconnections, the Pacific-North American pattern and the El Nino/La Nina pattern, changed significantly toward a phase historically associated with earlier ice-out. While the results underscore the value in monitoring and study of lake ice as a climate proxy, they also demonstrate the value of synoptic climate data for filling the spatial gap between local and large-scale climate data in studies of lake ice phenology.																			0165-0009	1573-1480				APR	2019	153	3					323	339		10.1007/s10584-019-02398-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-019-02398-6													WOS:000465577100002

Seasonal abundance, community composition, and silica content of diatoms epiphytic on Cladophora glomerata	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The establishment of dreissenid mussels in the Great Lakes has been implicated in causing a resurgence of benthic macroalgae, notably Cladophora glomerata (L.) Kutzing. The seasonal proliferation and nutrient retention of epiphyton on Cladophora may be important to littoral zone processes. In this Study, peak diatom epiphyte density (601 diatoms mu g(-1) dry mass) co-occurred with peak Cladophora biomass. The exceptionally adhesive Cocconeis pediculus came to dominate the epiphyton to the near exclusion of all other diatoms by early summer, indicating powerful constraints on the epiphyte assemblage. There was a strong relationship between epiphytic silica content and epiphyte abundance, but the relationship was different between seasons. In the spring and fall when Cladophora Was growing Vigorously, silica content of the diatom epiphytes was 20.1-25.6 pmol Si diatom(-1). In the summer, during Cladophora senescence, silica content was 6.5-10.0 pmol Si diatom(-1) and valves were visibly thinner. These observations Suggest that diatom epiphytes may be limited by Si during peak Cladophora biomass. Areal estimates of silica content of Cladophora epiphyton was strongly related with Cladophora biomass: at 2 m depth, silica content increased from 22.7 mmol Si m(-2) in the spring to 490 mmol Si m(-2) during peak Cladophora biomass. Silica content can be a valuable proxy for diatom epiphyte abundance if the vitality of the Cladophora substrate is considered. Future work needs to assess the seasonality of pelagic versus benthic silica demand and the interannual variability of epiphyte silica content to assess how changes in Cladophora biomass may affect nearshore Si cycling.

However, it is still unclear to what extent the TP concentration in a complex shallow reservoir system attributes to each type of forcing. To resolve this issue, this study proposed a TP concentration contribution index (TPI) to assess the contribution of each forcing, using the data assimilation (DA) method, the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), which was applied in the shallow Yuqiao Reservoir, China. The EnKF model was conducted based on the Vollenweider model and logistic regression models with datasets of 1989-2015. The results showed that human-originated activities forcing (water diversion) contributed the maximum TPI (40%), followed by hydrological variability forcing (37%). Finally, meteorological forcing (air temperature and wind included) only accounted for 23%. Furthermore, the seasonal analyses also showed that the TPI of hydrological variability dominated in spring and winter, with 65% and 73% respectively. However, the contributions of meteorological forcing (air temperature and wind) accounted for a larger proportion of 63% and 57% in summer and autumn. The benefit of our EnKF model denoises the Gaussian noise contained in observation and simulation, which offers a chance to isolate and identify even a minor driving factor (i.e., meteorological forcing) from a complex river and lake system with limited data. The study provides a method to assess the influence of direct and indirect forcing on TP concentration in shallow reservoirs from a quantitative perspective. Thus, it may serve as a useful tool for water quality management in water-receiving systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The species composition, density and biomass of zooplankton and phyto-plankton and the community composition, growth status and biomass of fish were surveyed. Fifty-two species of zooplankton in 3 categories were identified; Rotifera was the dominant group. Among phytoplankton. 143 species belonging to eight phyla were observed, and members of Chlorophyta were dominant. Among the three seasons, summer exhibited the highest species number and biomass of zoo plankton and phytoplankton. Correlation analysis revealed significant negative correlations of the average density of zooplankton with the Shannon-Wiener diversity index and Pielou evenness index of phytoplankton. The average biomass of zooplankton was positively correlated with the average density of phytoplankton. Further, 28 species of fish belonging to 4 orders and 10 families were identified. Cyprinidae was the dominant family. Redundancy analysis revealed that plankton had an impact on fish with different feeding habits, especially the biomass of such fish, while the effect on fish species was nonsignificant.

Seasonal and ontogenetic variations in the diet of Cichla kelberi Kullander and Ferreira, 2006 introduced in an artificial lake in southeastern Brazil	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												The diet of Cichla kelberi introduced in an artificial lake in Leme-SP was predominantly composed of common fish species (Oreochromis niloticus and C. kelberi). In the spring and summer, the most consumed item was O. niloticus. However, cannibalism was very common for this species. The high frequencies of O. niloticus and C. kelberi reveal that this species is adapted to a seasonal cycle, feeding on the most common prey in each period of the year, with a reduction of foraging activity during the winter. The diets were different among the immature and mature individuals suggesting that there are ontogenetic differences, mainly related to prey type, such as: Ephemeroptera consumed by the immature peacock bass and fish by the mature ones, besides the size of the prey.																			1519-6984	1678-4375				NOV	2010	70	4					1033	1037		10.1590/S1519-69842010000500017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1519-69842010000500017								21180910					WOS:000285506500017
J	Hinkel, KM; Nelson, FE				Hinkel, Kenneth M.; Nelson, Frederick E.			Spatial and temporal aspects of the lake effect on the southern shore of Lake Superior	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												A climate-monitoring network was implemented in a large private preserve along the southern shore of Lake Superior. The network uses a dense sampling design to assess the spatial and temporal influence of a large, cold body of water on adjacent terrestrial surfaces. Based on a 3-year record, near-shore sites are 1-2A degrees C cooler than sites 5 km inland in spring and summer, and 1A degrees C warmer in winter. Near the shore, winds are from the NNW most of the year, and are much stronger in winter. Inland, southwesterly flow is typical and overall wind velocity is lower and more consistent. This decoupling is attributable to the influence of the Huron Mountains, a topographic barrier that restricts the lake effect to a narrow coastal zone. A 2-year record of hourly air temperature measurements from 26-30 sites across the study area demonstrates that the mean daily temperature can differ by as much as 11A degrees C, but the average difference is 2.5-3.0A degrees C.																			0177-798X					AUG	2012	109	3-4					415	428		10.1007/s00704-012-0585-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-012-0585-2													WOS:000307243900008

The similarities in the distributions of brGDGTs between surface sediments and catchment soils indicate that soil is the dominant source of brGDGTs. This contrasts with the recent emphasis on lacustrine GDGTs in other regional studies. Holocene temperature evolution is characterized by an early cool phase (with a mean annual air temperature (MAAT) of 12.5 degrees C) prior to 7.6 cal kyr BP, followed by a rapid warming towards the local thermal maximum (MAAT = 13.8 degrees C) from 7.6 to 5.5 cal kyr BP and a subsequent long-term cooling that ended at 1.5 cal kyr BP. Temperature changes after 1.5 cal kyr BP show high variability and low correspondence to global climate events such as the Medieval Warm Period. Overall Holocene temperature variation has been primarily controlled by boreal summer insolation changes. The larger amplitude (1.5-4.0 degrees C) in annual cooling during the early Holocene in MAAT contrasts with summer temperature records from this region (range of cooling 0.3-1.0 degrees C) and indicates the likely influence of lower winter temperature on MAAT variation. We suggest that substantial remnants of the Northern Hemisphere ice-sheets during the early Holocene enhanced the winter westerlies and East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM), and decreased the winter temperature in southwestern China, leading to a cold early Holocene climate.

Seasonal surface sediments trapped at the bottom of the lake suggest that sediments deposited during summer and autumn are mainly light colored monohydrocalcites, while those deposited in winter are dark organic matter, indicating that varve layers form under modern limnological conditions. Continuous varve sediments comprising four types have accumulated in the upper 5.5 m of Core SG03I from the center of the lake. All types exhibit clear seasonality indicative of annual deposition. Varve counts correspondence with Pb-210 dates on recent sediments in the upper core suggest the continuous varves of the upper 5.5 m of the core formed in the late Holocene (2670 a BP).

J	KNIGHT, RL; MARGRAF, FJ; CARLINE, RF				KNIGHT, RL; MARGRAF, FJ; CARLINE, RF			PISCIVORY BY WALLEYES AND YELLOW PERCH IN WESTERN LAKE ERIE	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The stomach contents of 906 age-0 and older walleyes S. v. vitreum and 1575 age-2 and older yellow perch P. flavescens were collected from western Lake Erie in 1979-1981, to measure preferences for prey type and size and diet overlap among different size groups of these 2 percids. Seasonal diets closely followed changes in forage-fish availability. Walleyes ate age-1 shiners Notropis atherinoides and N. hudsonius in spring, but switched to age-0 clupeids Dorosoma cepedianum and Alosa pseudoharengus in summer and autumn. Diet selection was governed by abundance of appropriate-size prey and preferences for forage species. Yellow perch ate invertebrates in spring but clupeids and shiners thereafter; electivity values for prey were low compared with those of walleyes, indicating that yellow perch were the more opportunistic feeders. Diet overlap was greatest among walleye age groups (0, 1, and 2-and-older) and least between walleyes and yellow perch. Density-dependent processes within the percid community probably will occur during years of low shiner and clupeid abundance and they probably will be most intense for walleyes. Walleyes were less size-selective and grew more slowly in 1979-1981 than in 1959-1960, suggesting that forage-fish availability has declined in the presence of increased walleye stocks. Yellow perch should be less affected by forage-fish reductions if invertebrates are plentiful.

Whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) exploited both epibenthic and pelagic areas. Whitefish with body lengths between 25 and 35 cm moved from the epibenthic to pelagic zone during summer; other length groups remained in epibenthic habitats. The pelagic fish returned to epibenthic areas in the autumn, Cladocerans were important food items for both fish species in the pelagic zone. The large copepod Limnocalanus macrurus was eaten only by vendace whereas surface insects were more important prey for whitefish. This suggests that vendace is the more specialized zooplanktivore. The pelagic gillnet catch of whitefish and the pelagic habitat overlap between whitefish and vendace increased with increasing zooplankton densities at depths between 0 and 50 m (r2 = 0.609 and 0.494, respectively, p < 0.01). During spring and autumn we observed a time lag between the change in zooplankton abundance and habitat switches of whitefish. The fish moved to the more profitable habitat several days after food availability had changed, indicating an element of learning in choice of habitat.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				DEC	1991	48	12					2307	2315		10.1139/f91-271	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f91-271													WOS:A1991GY57800002

Climate-related changes in water temperature may have important implications for the future sustainability of these fisheries. However, projecting future habitat availability is difficult because limited information is available on lake whitefish thermal ecology in the region. In this study, archival temperature loggers were implanted into 400 lake whitefish from northwestern Lake Michigan, including Green Bay, during October-November 2017. Loggers recorded temperature for 11 months at 4-hr intervals. Thirteen recovered temperature loggers were used in analyses. In winter (1 December-31 March), temperatures occupied by lake whitefish ranged from 0 to 8.0 degrees C, while in spring (1 April-31 May) temperatures ranged from 0 to 20.0 degrees C. In summer (1 June-15 September) and fall (16 September-7 November), lake whitefish occupied temperatures of 4-21.5 and 4-21.0 degrees C, respectively. Average temperatures in summer (10.8 degrees C) were within the previously proposed optimal temperature range (10-14 degrees C) and broad thermal niche (7-17 degrees C); however, 58% of observations were outside the optimal temperature range and 11% of observations were outside the broad thermal niche. Our results suggest that lake whitefish from northwestern Lake Michigan inhabit temperatures both above and below previously reported expected temperature ranges. This study provides initial insights on lake whitefish thermal ecology in Lake Michigan and can be used as a baseline for future work aimed at determining how lake whitefish habitat availability may change in the future.C) 2023 The Authors.

The characterization of SAMPs in urban environments, as well as the potential risks on health, continues to be a topic of significant research interest. This study provides a comprehensive report on the presence of SAMPs in the Binhai New Area of Tianjin, China, based on samples collected during the autumn and winter of 2023-2024 using a medium-flow total suspended particulate (TSP) sampler at a monitoring station. Microplastics were detected in all samples, with concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 1.8 items/m3 in autumn and from 0.1 to 1.1 items/m3 in winter, and a total mean of 0.6 +/- 0.4 items/m3. Particle sizes spanned 12.28-3248.58 mu m, with fibrous shapes dominating the morphological composition. Observed colors included black, blue, yellow, transparent, red, and green, with black microplastics being the most prevalent. These SAMPs were composed of polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene, rayon, polypropylene, and ethylene-ethyl acrylate copolymer. A risk assessment indicated that residents of Binhai New Area, Tianjin City, face a measurable health risk from microplastic exposure. Significant correlations were identified between SAMPs and dew point temperature as well as relative humidity in the autumn. In the winter, significant correlations were observed between the abundance of SAMPs and ground barometric pressure and wind velocity. Weak negative correlations were observed between SAMP abundances and the Air Quality Index (AQI) in both seasons Future research will utilize more advanced technologies and establish a global monitoring network to further explore the sources, distribution, and impacts of atmospheric microplastics.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				MAY 16	2025	197	6							658	10.1007/s10661-025-14110-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-025-14110-6								40379872					WOS:001489368800002

Rapid winter warming and increasing observations of winter blooms warrant more investigation of these controls. We investigated the mechanisms regulating a massive winter diatom bloom in a temperate lake. High frequency data and process-based lake modeling demonstrated that phytoplankton growth in winter was dually controlled by light and temperature, rather than by light alone. Water temperature played a further indirect role in initiating the bloom through ice-thaw, which increased light exposure. The bloom was ultimately terminated by silicon limitation and sedimentation. These mechanisms differ from those typically responsible for spring diatom blooms and contributed to the high peak biomass. Our findings show that phytoplankton growth in winter is more sensitive to temperature, and consequently to climate change, than previously assumed. This has implications for nutrient cycling and seasonal succession of lake phytoplankton communities. The present study exemplifies the strength in integrating data analysis with different temporal resolutions and lake modeling. The new lake ecological model serves as an effective tool in analyzing and predicting winter phytoplankton dynamics for temperate lakes. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Their diet was dominated by littoral macrobenthos, particularly amphipods (Echinogammarus sp.). There was ontogenetic variation in the diet, with small young-of-the-year (L-F<4 cm) feeding on several littoral microcrustaceans, especially the cladoceran Ceriodaphnia reticulata, whereas larger fish shifted to a freshwater shrimp (Atyaephyra desmaresti), snails and damselfly larvae. Seasonal variation in diet was linked to resource availability, with consumption of fish eggs and plant debris in spring and summer. In autumn, pumpkinseeds were partially zooplanktivores, preying on the cladoceran Daphnia longispinn. The diet of pumpkinseeds in Lake Banyoles and other Iberian populations shows less molluscivory than North American populations. The potential ecological impact of this successful exotic species involves mainly predation on fish eggs and molluscs. (C) 2000 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

In particular, temperature anomalies in the spring-summer months for the European (ER) and Asian (AR) Russian regions for different phase transitions of the ENSO phenomena were estimated using the Nino3, Nino3.4 and Nino4 indices. The largest frequency of the extremely high-temperature and drought conditions in spring-summer months in ER was detected for years starting in the El Nino phase with the transition to the La Nina phase at the end of the year. Such conditions were realized in ER in summer 2010 ("Russian heatwave"). The corresponding largest frequency of high temperature in AR was obtained for conditions with the continuation of the El Nino phase during the whole year. Such conditions in AR were noted, in particular, in the summer of 2015, with an extremely high temperature and extremely low precipitation in the Lake Baikal basin.

J	Pinault, JL; Berthier, F				Pinault, J. -L.; Berthier, F.			A methodological approach to characterize the resilience of aquatic ecosystems with application to Lake Annecy, France	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												[ 1] We propose a methodological approach to characterize the resilience of aquatic ecosystems with respect to the evolution of environmental parameters as well as their aptitude to adapt to forcings. This method that is applied to Lake Annecy, France, proceeds in three stages. First, according to the depth, variations of physicochemical parameters versus time are separated into three components related to ( 1) energy transfer through the surface of the lake, ( 2) the flow of rivers and springs that feed the lake, and ( 3) long-term evolution of the benthic zone as a consequence of mineral and organic matter loads. Second, dynamics of the lake are deduced by analyzing the physicochemical parameter components related to the three boundary conditions. Third, a stochastic process associated with the transfer models aims to characterize the resilience of the lakes according to forcings. For Lake Annecy, whose dynamics are representative of oligotrophic stratified lakes controlled by decarbonation processes where turnover and mixing occurring once a year in winter, the major consequence is the impoverishment of dissolved oxygen in deep water in autumn due to a temperature increase of the surface water in summer. The simulation raises relevant questions about whether a connection exists between physicochemical parameters and global warming, which should not induce harmful consequences on water quality and biodiversity in deep water. This methodological approach is general since it does not use any physical conceptual model to predict the hydrosystem behavior but uses directly observed data.

Total sediment metabolism and bacterial production were strongly related, both over season and in magnitude. Bacterial production constituted, on average, 26.5 % of the total sediment metabolism and bacterial growth efficiencies, ranged between 7 and 30 % with a seasonal mean of 21 %. Maximum growth efficiencies were found shortly after the sedimentation of the spring diatom bloom. Temperature was the main factor controlling seasonal changes in bacterial and total sediment metabolism. In spring and autumn, however, the sedimentation of diatoms caused strong and immediate increases in bacterial and overall activity in spite of low temperatures. in late summer, decreasing bacterial production and total sediment metabolism coincided with decreasing sediment redox potentials, implying that the availability of suitable electron accepters for microbial respiration also played an important role in the control of bacterial and overall activity and/or limitations of the thymidine incorporation capacity of the bacterial community. Altogether, the results showed that bacterial activity constituted a large portion of the total sediment metabolism and that the bacterial community could incorporate externally added thymidine at most occasions, suggesting that the thymidine method is a reliable method for determining bacterial production in these sediments.																			0071-1128		3-510-47053-2				1998	51						177	183																WOS:000078414300013

It will be filled with rainfall on the drainage basin of the mine, runoff waters from outside dump and good-quality water imported from Eume river. A full-mixing geochemical model was constructed to predict water quality. Later it was improved by accounting for lake stratification. Model predictions show that there will be thermal stratification during spring, summer and most of the autumn. The most saline and acid waters will settle at the lake bottom.

As traditional measuring methods present limitations in monitoring with high spatial and temporal coverage, using satellite images to have greater control over lake observation can be a handy tool and have satisfactory results. The study of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) has been widely used to ascertain the quality of the inland aquatic environment using remote sensing, but in general, it depends on the local conditions of the water body. In this study, the suitability of the Sentinel-2 MSI sensor for Chl-a estimation in a lake in south-central Chile is tested. An empirical approach is proposed, applying multiple linear regressions, comparing the efficiency and performance with L1C and L2A products, separating the equations constructed with spring-summer and fall-winter data, and restricting Chl-a ranges to those measured in the field to generate these regressions. The algorithms combining spectral bans proved to have a good correlation with Chl-a measured in the field, generally resulting in R-2 greater than 0.87 and RMSE and MAE with errors less than 6 mu g L-1. The spatial distribution of Chl-a concentrations at the study site was obtained based on the proposed equations.					; Alcayaga, Hernan/AAG-3766-2019	Felez-Bernal, Jorge/0000-0003-1105-9414; ALCAYAGA, Hernan/0000-0001-9300-0816; Pizarro Valdebenito, Alonso Vicente/0000-0002-7242-6559; 														2072-4292				NOV	2022	14	22							5647	10.3390/rs14225647	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14225647													WOS:000887621200001
J	Hu, WP; Zhai, SJ; Zhu, ZC; Han, HJ				Hu, Weiping; Zhai, Shuijing; Zhu, Zecong; Han, Hongjuan			Impacts of the Yangtze River water transfer on the restoration of Lake Taihu	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												In order to improve the water quality and to abate the jeopardy of water bloom in Lake Taihu, China, two experimental water transfers from the Yangtze River to Lake Taihu were conducted in winter-spring 2002 and in summer-autumn 2003. In this study, an ecological model (EcoTaihu) was introduced to assess their environmental effects. First, the model was re-calibrated and reverified for the periods of the water transfer, then numerical calculations with and without the water transfer were carried out. The percentage of the area where water quality was improved by the water transfer was calculated in seven sub-zones of the lake. The results show that the experimental water transfers in both of the periods have notable positive effects on debasing the concentration of phytoplankton, total nitrogen and dissolved oxygen in some sub-areas. The positive effects fluctuated with the duration of the water transfer, and were different for different water quality parameters and in different sub-zones. Among the five water quality parameters considered, chlorophyll a achieved the most significant improvement. There are no notable positive effects on the total phosphor-us in any sub-zones. Meiliang Bay, Gonghu Bay and Northwest Zone had more positive effects than the east epigeal zone and Dongtaihu Bay. As the water transfer results in net input of nitrogen and phosphor-us to Lake Taihu, it can only be used as an emergency measure to abate the jeopardy resulting from water bloom. Otherwise, the water transfer would increase the risk of eutrophication in Lake Taihu if the concentration of phosphorus and nitrogen in the influent water was not cut down to a reasonable level.

This study developed mass-produced nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) removal fillers for the integrated landscape water purification (ILWP) device, comprising an inlet, aeration, and N and P removal unit. The fillers were used to purify actual landscape water bodies. Indoor test results demonstrated that the substrates exhibited high and stable removal efficiencies for NO3--N (>60.5%), TN (>60.1%), and TP (>66.5%) under varying hydraulic retention times (HRT) (1 similar to 4 h), pH (5 similar to 9) and pollutant concentrations. After one year of operation in Meihu Lake, the ILWP device achieved NO3--N removal rates of 55.5-68.1% (average 61.3%), TN removal rates of 55.2-67.8% (average 60.9%) for, and TP removal rates of 37.7-66.3% (average 53.0%). Notably, N removal was higher in spring and summer, while P removal was more efficient in autumn and winter. The ILWP device successfully improved the N and P levels of the effluent of the landscape lake from below Class V to Class IV or Class III surface water standards. Additionally, the effluent showed reduced chlorophyll a content and significantly improved transparency. Microbial tests revealed that the fillers promoted the growth of key microorganisms like Pseudomonas and Acetoanaerium, supporting the long-term removal of pollutants.																				2073-4441				FEB	2025	17	4							556	10.3390/w17040556	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17040556													WOS:001430457800001
J	MEHRA, NK				MEHRA, NK			STUDIES ON PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY IN A SUBTROPICAL LAKE - COMPARISON BETWEEN EXPERIMENTAL AND PREDICTED VALUES	INDIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												These studies were conducted during summer and winter months on a shallow sub-tropical, eutrophic lake Bhalaswa, situated in Delhi (Lat. 28.degree., 40''-28.degree.,50''N, Long, 77.degree.,50''-77.degree.,15''E) [India] where the climate is semi-arid. Primary productivity was estimated by analysing the oxygen data collected by light and dark bottle experiments as well as from data on diurnal variation of dissolved oxygen (D.O.). Primary production during summer was two and a half times higher than during winter. These data have been compared with the predicted values of oxygen production based upon theoretical consideration of oxygen production with reference to location of the water body and also on the basis of the maximum net production in a day. Analysis of data shows that the actual gross production was slightly higher than the predicted values during summer, while reverse was true during winter. In comparison, the actual net production by diurnal variation method was slightly lower than predicted values during both the seasons whereas reverse was true with reference to light and dark bottle experiment data. During both the seasons, the net and gross production calculated from diurnal variation data of D.O. was higher at the station located in the middle of the lake than at the shore station. The photosynthetic efficiency during summer and winter ranged between 2.7 and 3.1% respectively at shore station and between 3.2 and 5.4% respectively at the station located in the middle of the lake.

Each gull was captured after the breeding season using leg nooses and fitted with a 12 g solar-powered Platform Transmitter Terminal. One bird died within a month of capture near the release site, two birds completed the return journey between the breeding and wintering grounds on three occasions, and two birds completed the return migration twice. After departing from Qinghai Lake, migration to the wintering areas took an average of 99 days and covered a mean distance of 2,990 km. Return migration to Qinghai Lake in spring averaged 38 days and covered a mean distance of 2,556 km. In 2006-2009, the gulls left the breeding grounds between 2 and 14 August, stopping at 1 4 sites en route to the wintering areas, which they reached between 3 November and 3 December. In 2007-2009, returning birds departed from the wintering areas and stopped at 1 2 sites before reaching Qinghai Lake. Wetlands at Donggeicuona, Zhaling and Eling Lakes, Keluke Lake, Qinggeda Lakes, Xinjiang, and wetlands along the Yellow River, Ningxia, were most extensively used. The number of Pallas's Gull breeding at Qinghai Lake has already fallen dramatically from over 87,000 in the 1970s to about 15,000 in present times. Rapid economic development on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau (Qinghai province and the Tibet autonomous region), particularly for tourism, poses serious threats to the fragile ecosystems associated with the wetlands where gulls stop over, with some wetlands became unsuitable for the gulls during the period of this study. Conservation measures must be put in place urgently to protect the fragile wetland ecosystems on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau.

Effects of life stage on the spatial ecology of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) during pelagic freshwater foraging	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) have been observed to spatially segregate based on body size in the marine environment. In their introduced range in the Laurentian Great Lakes, where Chinook salmon support important recreational fisheries, very little is known about their seasonal habitat use, including effects of body size on horizontal and vertical distributions. This study quantified the seasonal home ranges and distributions by depth and temperature of two size classes of Chinook salmon in Lake Ontario using pop-off data storage tags (pDST) from 2014 to 2016 and acoustic telemetry from 2017 to 2020. Moderate overlap occurred between immature (age classes 1 and 2) and sub-adult (age classes 3 and 4) individuals at the 50% home range level, a measure of horizontal segregation, with the greatest segregation during the fall and spring. Depth and temperature occupancy for two immature individuals in fall and winter also differed from those of sub-adults. This study is the first to examine the overlap in horizontal and vertical distributions between Chinook salmon size classes in the Great Lakes and contributes key information on their depth and temperature distributions.

Cycling of oxyanion-forming trace elements in groundwaters from a freshwater deltaic marsh	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Pore waters and surface waters were collected from a freshwater system in southeastern Louisiana to investigate the geochemical cycling of oxyanion-forming trace elements (i.e., Mo, W, As, V). A small bayou (Bayou Fortier) receives input from a connecting lake (Lac des Allemands) and groundwater input at the head approximately 5 km directly south of the Mississippi River. Marsh groundwaters exchange with bayou surface water but are otherwise relatively isolated from outside hydrologic forcings, such as tides, storms, and effects from local navigation canals. Rather, redox processes in the marsh ground waters appear to drive changes in trace element concentrations. Elevated dissolved S(-II) concentrations in marsh groundwaters suggest greater reducing conditions in the late fall and winter as compared to the spring and late summer. The data suggest that reducing conditions in marsh groundwaters initiate the dissolution of Fe(III)/Mn(IV) oxide hydroxide minerals, which releases adsorbed and/or co-precipitated trace elements into solution. Once in solution, the fate of these elements is determined by complexation with aqueous species and precipitation with iron sulfide minerals. The trace elements remain soluble in the presence of Fe(III)- and SO42--reducing conditions, suggesting that either kinetic limitations or complexation with aqueous ligands obfuscates the correlation between V and Mo sequestration in sediments with reducing or euxinic conditions.

Seasonal impacts on biofiltration acclimation dynamics and performance	AWWA WATER SCIENCE												The City of Denton, Texas, upgraded the Lake Lewisville Water Treatment Plant (WTP) to add ozone and convert the existing chlorinated anthracite/sand filters to granular activated carbon (GAC) biofilters. Biofilter contaminant removal, operational performance, and biomass were monitored following startup on two filters, one brought online in winter and one brought online in summer, to understand seasonal impacts. In addition, the city also monitored anthracite biofilters following a winter shutdown at another WTP. Key conclusions include (1) acclimation (i.e., the time required to achieve steady-state biomass, total organic carbon [TOC] removal, or total manganese removal, considered individually) was two to three times longer for filters brought online in the winter versus the summer, (2) no acclimation period was observed for turbidity or total iron removal, and (3) the relationship between TOC removal and water temperature was more significant for the WTP with anthracite than GAC biofilters.																			2577-8161					MAY	2021	3	3							e1225	10.1002/aws2.1225	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aws2.1225													WOS:001121708500004

We measured the gonadosomatic index, plasma estradiol, testosterone, and vitellogenin concentrations, and follicle diameters of fish collected from Orange Lake, Florida (USA). Additionally, the reproductive stage of the ovary was resolved histologically. We observed a seasonal pattern in reproduction. Following a quiescent period in the summer, there was an increase in sex steroid hormones during the fall, associated with the onset of vitellogenesis and active oogenesis. During the February collection, we directly observed ovulation in several females. This observation was supported by a sharp decrease in the gonadosomatic index between February and March as well as a decline in plasma hormones to basal levels during the summer months. Our data suggest the Florida gar has a group-synchronous ovary and the majority of females spawned during the early spring, followed by a general decrease in reproductive parameters to summer levels. While hormone and vitellogenin peaks may vary annually and variations in these reproductive patterns are expected for different collection sites, this study is important as it is the first characterization of the seasonal morphological and endocrinological reproductive pattern in a female holostean species. Moreover, it increases our understanding of basic reproductive biology of semitropical fishes in general, and nonteleost, bony fishes in particular. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

J	Tsujimura, S; Tsukada, H; Nakahara, H; Nakajima, T; Nishino, M				Tsujimura, S; Tsukada, H; Nakahara, H; Nakajima, T; Nishino, M			Seasonal variations of Microcystis populations in sediments of Lake Biwa, Japan	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Seasonal variations of colony numbers of Microcystis aeruginosa (Kutz.) Kutz. and M. wesenbergii (Komarek) Komarek in N. V. Kondrat. in sediments of Lake Biwa were investigated over a period of 1 year. At two stations located in the shallow South Basin of Lake Biwa (ca. 4 m water depth), the colony number of Microcystis fluctuated seasonally. The number had a tendency to gradually decrease from winter to early summer, while it increased through mid-summer and autumn. Since the Microcystis population in sediment was rather small, intensive growth and accumulation in the water column should be important for the formation of Microcystis blooms in Lake Biwa. Microcystis colonies in the sediment samples after June were observed to be floating in a counting chamber under a microscope. The observation suggests that the recruitment of Microcystis colonies into the water column mostly occurs in early summer. The number of Microcystis colonies in the deep North Basin of Lake Biwa (70 - 90 m water depth) was larger than in the South Basin. Because the seasonal variation of colony numbers was not observed in the North Basin, and Microcystis cells do not have gas vesicles, these colonies will not return into the water column. The colonies isolated from the sediment of the North Basin were able to grow in cultured conditions, in the same way as those from the sediment of the South Basin. Therefore, Microcystis colonies may survive for a long time under stable conditions of low temperature (ca. 8 degreesC) and darkness, in the sediment of the deep North Basin, accumulating gradually each year.																			0018-8158					SEP	2000	434	1-3					183	192		10.1023/A:1004077225916	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1004077225916													WOS:000089982800014

Under the year-round season, fishing effort was 840 angler-h . ha(-1)yr(-1), and 360 trout ha(-1) were captured. Catch rates were proportional to estimated trout densities in tile reservoir ranging from 1.06 during the winter ice fishery, to 0.18 fish angler(-1). h(-1) in July. Ninety-nine percent of fish harvested were rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Thirty-two percent of the 300,000 75-mm fingerling trout stocked annually were captured by anglers within 2.5 yr, but return rates varied with the strain and/or size of trout stocked. Annual fish yield was 102 kg/ha, among the highest pet reported For a temperate zone, lacustrine system. Extending fishing from a 6-mon season to year-round increased die number of fish captured and provided almost twice as many hours of recreational fishing in the reservoir The harvest period was changed from traditional spring-summer months to primarily a winter-spring fishery because relatively few trout survived for more than 6 mon after reaching harvestable size. Although salmonid production in East Canyon Reservoir is very high, the fishery is in a precarious state because high primary productivity driven, in part, by cultural eutrophication, makes water quality suboptimal during midsummer.

Emigration of fish from two South Carolina cooling reservoirs	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We assessed fish escapement from two South Carolina reservoirs, Par Pond and L Lake, from spring 2002 through summer 2003. Escapement was greatest in the spring and early summer, with lake chubsucker Erimyzon sucetta dominating the escapement catch in early spring and several sunfishes Lepomis spp. dominating in late spring and early summer. Most of the escaping centrarchids were bluegill L. macrochirus, warmouth L. gulosus, and redbreast sunfish L. auritus in L Lake and warmouths, bluegills, dollar sunfish L. marginatus, and spotted sunfish L. punctatus in Par Pond. Escapement was enhanced by high reservoir water levels and surface discharge over the spillway. Escapement declined during periods of hypolininetic release from bottom discharge gates. Location of the Par Pond discharge structure in the littoral zone rather than the pelagic zone as in L Lake contributed to greater escapement of littoral species in Par Pond. Species composition in the escapement catches and reservoirs was not significantly correlated. Relatively low escapement from L Lake and Par Pond compared with that in other reservoirs may have been related to the configuration of the discharge structures, low water levels during 2002, fish habitat preferences, species composition and abundance in the reservoirs, and low rates of discharge.

Autoradiography revealed that the storage sites for triallate in amphipod tissues were associated with lipid-rich tissues, in particular, with triacylglycerol storage sites and the nervous system. Seasonal lipid patterns (total lipid) of amphipods did not differ amongst sites within a waterbody, however, there were marked differences amongst water bodies. Female amphipods had higher lipid contents than males during the reproductive period in early summer but this difference diminished later in the summer. Bioaccumulation factors of triallate in amphipod tissues ranged from 72 to 80 times the nominal water concentrations in 7 day microcosm trials. Triacylglycerol content and triallate body burden were positively correlated (r2 = 0.58-0.91) for H. azteca in the two lakes in which the microcosms were deployed. However, no significant correlations were obtained between triacylglycerol content and triallate body burden for G. lacustris. Triacylglycerol contents in the amphipods were generally highest in spring and autumn, coinciding with application times for triallate.

A Comparison of Nonlethal Methods for Evaluating the Reproductive Status of Female Coastal Cutthroat Trout	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Knowledge of the state of sexual development is important for management of coastal cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii, a fish species targeted for sport fishing throughout its range along the Pacific coast of North America. The purpose of this study was to compare the nonlethal methods of ultrasound imaging, body lipid content, and the measurement of plasma vitellogenin and estradiol levels for assessing the reproductive status of female coastal cutthroat trout. This was examined in a population living in Florence Lake, Alaska, during the spring-early autumn period of the annual reproductive cycle. All methods, except body lipid content, were effective at determining maturity status in either the spring (ultrasound imaging), or spring and autumn (plasma vitellogenin and estradiol). These approaches could be useful for conducting nonlethal assessments of length- or age-at-maturity on populations of coastal cutthroat trout that are small, have conservation concerns, or are heavily utilized by anglers.																			1944-687X					JUN	2014	5	1					183	190		10.3996/022013-JFWM-009	http://dx.doi.org/10.3996/022013-JFWM-009													WOS:000338436900020

For this purpose, 25 samples were collected seasonally and analysed for 36 physiochemical parameters. The proportions of physiochemical parameters exceeding the WHO standards in the samples with their highest exceedances were 9894% for Al, 198% for Mn, 40% for Pb, 1.6% for pH, 3250% for PO4, 11.8% for Sr, 155% for T.Alk, 7813% for turbidity, 1188% for Ti, 1033% for Tl and 1293% for V in the river water and 120% for Co, 74% for Cr, 4485% for Fe and 9% for K in the lake water. The pollution sources were designated by multivariate statistical analysis as being related to industrial and domestic waste, solid waste disposal, fertilisers and organic contamination from agricultural and natural sources. The water quality index (WQI) results were 22.3 to 721.3 for drinking, 13.9 to 86.2 for irrigation, 1.4 to 299.5 for livestock, 71.5 to 1754.4 for the textile industry, 20.7 to 237.9 for recreation and 64.6 to 1867.4 for aquatic life. The irrigation water quality index (IWQI) results were excellent for sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), and for the US salinity scale, all water samples fell into the medium salinity-low sodium category (C2-S1) in all seasons, except for all Chaqan River samples. The Tanjaro River sample in spring fell in the relatively high salinity-low sodium category (C3-S1), excellent and good for sodium percentage (Na%), suitable to moderate for permeability index (PI%), suitable to unsuitable for magnesium hazard percentage (MH%), suitable for Kelly Index (KI) and safe to unsuitable for residual sodium carbonates (RSC). The Sirwan River, Tanjaro River and Zmkan River took first to third place in both the annual average pollution share ratio and the discharge. While the Zalm River ranked fourth in discharge and fifth in pollution share ratio, the Chaqan River was the reverse. The highest pollution share ratio was 64.3 for the Sirwan River in summer, and the lowest was 0.7 for the Zalm River in autumn.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				AUG	2023	195	8							937	10.1007/s10661-023-11543-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-023-11543-9								37436670					WOS:001027111800001
J	Brooks, SJ; Heiri, O				Brooks, Stephen J.; Heiri, Oliver			Response of chironomid assemblages to environmental change during the early Late-glacial at Gerzensee, Switzerland	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Prior to ca. 14,660 yr BP, during the early late-glacial (Oldest Dryas), larval assemblages of Chironomidae (Insecta: Diptera) in Gerzensee, Switzerland, were dominated by cold stenothermic taxa as well as by taxa typical of subalpine lakes today. This was the coldest period of the entire sequence. After ca. 14,660 yr BP, in the Late Glacial Interstadial (Bolling-Allerod), a temperature increase is recorded by a sharp rise in the oxygen-isotope ratio in lake marl and by an increase in the organic-matter content of the sediments. Changes in the chironomid fauna then are consistent with rising temperatures. This warming trend is interrupted between 14,070 and 13,940 yr BP, coinciding with the GI-1d cold oscillation, but the change in the chironomid assemblage is more consistent with a response to increasing lake depth and density of aquatic macrophytes than falling temperature. A rise in cold-adapted chironomid taxa between 13,840 and 13,710 yr BP suggests that summer air temperatures may have declined. Changes in the chironomid assemblage after 13,710 yr BP suggest a decline in submerged macrophytes coupled with a rise in lake productivity and summer temperature, although the latter is not reflected in the oxygen-isotope record. This suggests that there may have been increasing seasonality during this period when summer temperatures were rising, driven by rising summer insolation, and winters becoming cooler, which is largely reflected in the oxygen-isotope record. A decline in thermophilic chironomids and a rise in cold-adapted taxa after 13,180 yr BP suggest a response to cooling at the beginning of the Gerzensee Oscillation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Spatial and temporal variability of prairie lake hydrology as revealed using stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Evaporation and groundwater fluxes are thought to regulate hydrologic variability in lakes of the northern Great Plains, but little is known of how the relative importance of these processes may vary in time or space. To address this issue, we measured the isotopic composition of water (delta O-18, delta H-2) from 70 closed-basin lakes in southern Saskatchewan, Canada. All lakes occupied endorheic basins along a long gradient of salinity (0.2-115 g total dissolved solids L-1). Lakes exhibited synchronous seasonal changes in salinity (synchrony, S = 0.78) and delta O-18 (S = 0.84) during the dry summer of 2003 (similar to 195 mm rain), whereas coherence was reduced to 0.56 and 0.22, respectively, during the wet summer of 2004 (similar to 295 mm rain). However, despite evaporative enrichment of isotopic ratios during dry summers, hydrologic balances were regulated mainly by changes in water inflow (I) rather than evaporation (E) in both wet and dry years, with particularly strong influence of inflow ( lowest E : I ratio) in dry southwestern regions. Analysis of isotopic composition also identified winter precipitation or groundwater as the most influential source of water to most lakes, despite only similar to 30% of annual precipitation being delivered during winter. Therefore, although seasonal variability in lake chemistry was influenced by evaporation during summer, long-term mean chemical characteristics of prairie lakes were regulated mainly by changes in winter precipitation or groundwater influx.

J	Liu, WL; Liu, LN				Liu, Weilin; Liu, Lina			Analysis of Dry/Wet Variations in the Poyang Lake Basin Using Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index Based on Two Potential Evapotranspiration Algorithms	WATER												Global warming has resulted in unevenly distributed changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration, which has some influence on dry/wet conditions, thus exerting a tremendous impact on national life and the social economy, especially agricultural production. In order to characterize the dry/wet variations in the Poyang Lake basin during 1958-2013, based on the potential evapotranspiration (PET) estimated by the Thornthwaite (TH) and Penman-Monteith (PM) formulas, two types of Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), namely SPEI_th and SPEI_pm, were calculated in this study. The characteristic of dry/wet variations in the Poyang Lake basin was analyzed and a comparative analysis of two SPEIs was conducted. The results indicate that both SPEI series showed a wet trend in the Poyang Lake basin on an annual scale as well as seasonal scales during 1958-2013, except for spring and autumn. A drying trend was observed in spring, while in autumn, the dry and wet conditions in two SPEIs had opposite trends. However, all trends from two SPEIs were not significant, except for summer SPEI_pm. Meanwhile, significant positive correlations were detected between precipitation and two SPEIs, with the correlation coefficients above 0.95, whereas negative correlations were detected between PET and two SPEIs, with the correlation coefficients ranging from -0.17 to -0.85. This indicates that precipitation was the main climatic factor to determine change in dry/wet conditions in the Poyang Lake basin. Although there were obvious differences between the accumulated values of the Penman-Monteith-based PET (ET_pm) and Thornthwaite-based PET (ET_th), trends in the SPEI_pm series were generally consistent with those in the SPEI_th series, revealing that the method for PET calculation was not critical to the change in dry/wet conditions. Moreover, the results of the conditional probability of SPEI_pm and SPEI_th show that both SPEI_pm and SPEI_th could detect wet or dry events that were identified by SPEI_pm or SPEI_th.					; Liu, Lina/B-3957-2019	liu, weilin/0000-0003-3726-1223; 														2073-4441				JUL	2019	11	7							1380	10.3390/w11071380	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11071380													WOS:000480632300065
J	Mao, HT; Ye, ZY; Driscoll, C				Mao, Huiting; Ye, Zhuyun; Driscoll, Charles			Meteorological effects on Hg wet deposition in a forested site in the Adirondack region of New York during 2000-2015	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												An analysis of weekly measurement data of mercury (Hg) wet deposition was conducted for Huntington Wildlife Forest (HWF), a forest ecosystem in Upstate New York and a biological Hg hotspot, during 2000 -2015. Annual accumulated Hg wet deposition flux was found to decrease at a rate of -0.13 mu g m(-2) yr(-1) (2% yr(-1)) (p = 0.09), and volume weighted mean (VWM) Hg precipitation concentrations at -0.14 ng L-1 yr(-1) (2.5% yr(-1)) (p = 0.00). In examining data by season, no trends were identified for the two variables. It was found that the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) affected Hg wet deposition predominantly in spring, as did the position of the U.S. East Coast trough in summer, which suggests different dominant mechanisms driving Hg wet deposition in different seasons. The impacts of such large scale circulation processes were facilitated via variations in precipitation amounts. This was manifested in spring 2011 with the strongest positive phase of NAO, resulting in the wettest spring with the largest Hg wet deposition flux, and in summer 2007 with the U.S. East Coast trough positioned the farthest out over the Atlantic Ocean, causing the driest summer with the lowest Hg wet deposition flux of the study period. Extreme precipitation amounts in spring could singularly drive the overall long-term trend in Hg wet deposition whereas in summer other factors could just be as important. Similar mechanisms were thought to control the long term variations of Hg wet deposition and precipitation concentrations in all seasons but summer as indicated in their significant correlation in all but summer. Atmospheric concentrations of gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM) and particulate borne mercury (PBM) at HWF over 2009 -2015 hardly exhibited correlations with Hg wet deposition or precipitation concentrations. Chemical transport model simulations strongly supported efficient scavenging of oxidized Hg by precipitation resulting in the lowest concentration of GOM in the warm season despite the supposedly largest GOM production. Our findings suggest that over the long run climate change could play an important role in atmospheric deposition of Hg into ecosystems facilitated by precipitation amounts, which is closely linked to variations in large scale circulation.

However, they are under a significant anthropogenic load, which together with the climate change leads to negative consequences for the ecosystems. The aim of the work was to study the seasonal changes of physicochemical parameters of water (temperature, pH, oxygen content, salinity, redox potential Eh, optical density and transparency) and Artemia population in Saki Lake in 2022. For the daily fluctuations of temperature, O-2, CH4 and CO2, a vertical temperature profile measuring system was installed at the boundaries of the air, water and bottom at a depth of 4 m and with a spatial discreteness of 0.2 m. The drive sensors for the content of gases assay in the air were installed. The increase in salinity and Eh in summer was accompanied by an increase in air and water temperature. Simultaneously, decreases in oxygen content and pH in brine have been observed. Artemia cysts were found throughout the year, nauplii were mostly available during spring and autumn, and the adults were shown in summer. The obtained results demonstrated the seasonal fluctuations in the hypersaline ecosystem within the ongoing climate change, and they can be used for the development of the optimal management of the mineral and biological resources of such water bodies.

A limited number of these were recorded throughout the year, while others were distributed in different seasons mainly in winter and summer seasons. During winters, Chlorophyceae was the most dominant group followed by Bacillariophyceae. On the other hand, Cyanophyceae and Euglenophyceae were the most dominant during summers. Certain species e.g. Pandorina morum, Pediastrum tetras, Gonium sp., Chlorella vulgaris, Scendesmus quadricauda, Oedogonium cardiocum, Synedra ulna, Oscillatoria agardhii and Euglena gracillis were recorded throughout the year. Chlorella, Stigeoclonium, Pandorina, Micratinium, Oscillatoria, Anacystis, Nitzschia and Cymbella were found to be good indicators of water pollution.																			0254-8704					JAN	2006	27	1					35	38											16850872					WOS:000234812300006
J	Beauchamp, DA; Van Tassell, JJ				Beauchamp, DA; Van Tassell, JJ			Modeling seasonal trophic interactions of adfluvial bull trout in Lake Billy Chinook, Oregon	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We examined the trophic interactions of bull trout Salvelinus confluentus in Lake Billy Chinook, Oregon, using a bioenergetics model combined with data on annual growth, seasonal diet, distribution, and thermal experience to determine the seasonal and size-specific prey requirements of bull trout and the influence of bull trout predation on some of their major prey species in the reservoir Per capita estimates of consumption were expanded to population-level estimates based on estimates of size structure and the abundance of the bull trout population. Bull trout became progressively more piscivorous with increasing size, and fish were the primary prey of predators of 450 mm fork length (FL) or more. Kokanee (lacustrine sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka) and other salmonids (predominantly bull trout and rainbow trout O. mykiss) represented the largest fraction of fish prey in the diet, although cyprinids, cottids, and catostomids were also consumed. Predation on kokanee occurred primarily in autumn and secondarily in winter-spring. Predation by bull trout of less than 450 mm FL was greatest on smaller bull trout and rainbow trout in the reservoir during June-September, whereas predation by bull trout of 450 mm or more on salmonids other than kokanee was most prevalent during winter-spring. Bull trout of all sizes were capable of eating fusiform fish up to 50% of their own length. Given the size structure and estimated abundance of bun trout of 200 mm FL or more in Lake Billy Chinook during 1993 (3,600) and 1994 (8,400), model simulations indicated that annual predation removed large fractions of the bull trout (19-44% of age-0 fish and 7-16% of age-1 fish) and kokanee (5-11% of age-0 fish, 1-2% of age-1 fish, and 9-59% of fish of ages 2-3) populations. Thus, cannibalism and prey supply are potentially important factors limiting the abundance and production of bull trout in Lake Billy Chinook.																			0002-8487					MAR	2001	130	2					204	216		10.1577/1548-8659(2001)130<0204:MSTIOA>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(2001)130<0204:MSTIOA>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000168984800002

The band combinations shown in the images of Donghu Lake (Wuhan City, China) captured by Landsat satellites from 1987 to 2018 were analyzed. The (B4 - B3)/(B4 + B3) [(Green-Red)/(Green+Red)] band combination was employed to construct linear, power, exponential, logarithmic and cubic polynomial models based on Chl-a values in Donghu Lake in April 2016. The correlation coefficient (R-2), the relative error (RE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the cubic model were 0.859, 9.175% and 11.194 mu g/L, respectively and those of the validation model were 0.831, 6.509% and 19.846 mu g/L, respectively. Remote sensing images from 1987 to 2018 were applied to the model and the spatial distribution of Chl-a concentrations in spring and autumn of these years was obtained. At the same time, the eutrophication status of Donghu Lake was monitored and evaluated based on the comprehensive trophic level index (TLI). The results showed that theTLI( n-ary sumation ) of Donghu Lake in April 2016 was 63.49 and the historical data on Chl-a concentration showed that Donghu Lake had been eutrophic. The distribution of Chl-a concentration in Donghu Lake was affected by factors such as construction of bridges and dams, commercial activities and enclosure culture in the lake. The overall distribution of Chl-a concentration in each sub-lake was higher than that in the main lake region and Chl-a concentration was highest in summer, followed by spring, autumn and winter. Based on the data of three long-term (2005-2018) monitoring points in Donghu Lake, the matching patterns between meteorological data and Chl-a concentration were analyzed. It revealed that the Chl-a concentration was relatively high in warmer years or rainy years. The long-term measured data also verified the accuracy of the cubic model for Chl-a concentration. The R-2, RE and RMSE of the validation model were 0.641, 2.518% and 22.606 mu g/L, respectively, which indicated that it was feasible to use Landsat images to retrieve long-term Chl-a concentrations. Based on longitudinal remote sensing data from 1987 to 2018, long-term and large-scale dynamic monitoring of Chl-a concentrations in Donghu Lake was carried out in this study, providing reference and guidance for lake water quality management in the future.					; Yue, Zhiying/JTV-1750-2023	xujie, yang/0000-0002-2678-5905; 														2073-4441				AUG	2020	12	8							2192	10.3390/w12082192	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12082192													WOS:000568126100001

Ice core analysis shows that at all lakes on the coast at Barrow the ice, whether floating or frozen to the bottom, includes an inclusion-free layer overlying a layer of ice with tubular bubbles oriented parallel to the direction of growth. The clear ice may also be overlain by a discontinuous layer of bubbly snow ice. Backscatter is low (-16 to -22 dB) at the time of initial ice formation, probably due to the specular nature of the upper and lower ice surfaces causing the radar pulse to be reflected away from the radar. As the ice thickens during the autumn, backscatter rises steadily. Once the ice freezes to the lake bottom, regardless of the presence of forward scattering tubular bubbles, low backscatter values of -17 to -18 dB are caused by absorption of the radar signal in the lake bed. For ice that remains afloat all winter the ice-water interface and the tubular bubbles combine, presumably via an incoherent double-bounce mechanism, to cause maximum backscatter values of the order of -6 to -7 dB. The sigma(o) saturates at -6 to -7 dB before maximum ice thickness and tubular bubble content are attained. A simple ice growth model suggests that the layer of ice with tubular bubbles need be only a few centimeters thick midway through the growth season to cause maximum backscatter from floating ice. During the spring thaw a previously unreported backscatter reversal is observed on the floating and grounded portions of the coastal lakes but not on the lakes farther inland. This reversal may be related to the ice surface topography and wetness plus the effects of a longer, cooler melt period by the coast. Time series of backscatter variations from shallow tundra lakes are a record of(1) the development of tubular bubbles in the ice and, by association, changes in the gas content of the underlying water and (2) the freezing of ice to the bottoms of the lakes and therefore lake bathymetry and water availability. SAR is also able to detect the onset of lake ice growth in autumn and the initiation of the spring thaw and thus has potential for monitoring high-latitude lake ice growth and decay processes in relation to climate variability.																			2169-9275	2169-9291				NOV 15	1994	99	C11					22459	22471		10.1029/94JC01479	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/94JC01479													WOS:A1994PR66800007

The diatom record was derived from a short core taken from the south basin and has been shown to be free from any sedimentary heterogeneities. We employ here a diatom-based inference model of snow accumulation on the frozen lake for the first time (r(boot)(2)=0.709; RMSEP=0.120 log cm). However, palaeoenvironmental reconstructions have been improved by the use of correction factors, specifically developed for the dominant phytoplankton (Aulacoseira baicalensis, Aulacoseira skvortzowii, Cyclotella minuta, Stephanodiscus meyerii and Synedra acus) in the south basin of Lake Baikal. Cluster analysis identifies three significant zones in the core, zone I (c. 880 AD-c. 1180 AD), zone 2 (c. 1180-1840 AD) and zone 3 (c. 1840-1994 AD), coincident with the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), the Little Ice Age (LIA) and the period of recent warming, respectively. Our results indicate that S. acus dominated the diatom phytoplankton within zone I coincident with the MWP. S. acus is an opportunistic species that is able to increase its net growth when A. baicalensis does not. During this period, conditions are likely to have been unfavourable for the net increases in A. baicalensis growth due to the persistence of warm water in the lake, together with an increased length of summer stratification and delay in timing of the autumnal overturn. In zone 2, spring diatom crops blooming under the ice declined in abundances due in part to increased winter severity and snow cover on the lake. Accumulating snow on the lake is likely to have arisen from increased anticyclonic activity, resulting in prolonged winters expressed during the LIA. Thick, accumulating snow cover inhibits light penetration through the ice, thereby having negative effects on cell division rate and extent of turbulence underneath the ice. Consequently, only taxa whose net growth occurs during autumn overturn (C. minuta) predominate in the lake at this time. Diatom census data and reconstructions of snow accumulation suggest that warming in the Lake Baikal region started as early as c. 1750 AD, with a shift from taxa that bloom during autumn overturn to assemblages that begin to grow underneath the frozen lake in spring. Very recent increases and subsequent decline of S. acus in the surface sediments of the lake mirror monitoring records of this species over the last 50 years. Our study confirms that, over the last 1000 years, physical processes are important in determining planktonic diatom populations in the lake and highlights the value of integrated plankton, trap, and sediment studies for improving quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstructions from fossil material.

J	Zhou, RB; Zhu, LZ; Yang, K; Chen, YY				Zhou, Rongbing; Zhu, Lizhong; Yang, Kun; Chen, Yuyun			Distribution of organochlorine pesticides in surface water and sediments from Qiantang River, East China	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												The levels of 13 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in surface water and sediments from Qiantang River in East China were investigated to evaluate their potential pollution and risks. A total of 180 surface water samples at 45 sampling sites and 48 sediment samples at 19 sampling stations were collected along the river in four seasons of 2005. Soil samples and wet deposition samples were also collected to provide evidence on the source of OCPs pollution. The total OCPs concentrations in surface water and sediments were 7.68-269.4 ng/L and 23.11-316.5 ng/g-dry weight (dw), respectively. The concentrations of OCPs in sediments were in the range of 8.22-152.1 ng/g-dw for HCHs (alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta-HCH), 1.14-100.2 ng/g-dw for DDTs (p,p'-DDD, p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDT o,p'-DDD), 9.41-69.66 ng/g-dw for other OCPs (aldrin, diedrin, endrin, heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide). The total OCPs concentrations in soils and wet deposition were 5.04-214.9 ng/g-dw and 16.18-242.4 ng/L, respectively. Among the OCPs, HCHs, DDTs and heptachlor were the most dominant compounds in the sediments. The dominant OCPs in water were gamma-HCH among HCHs, heptachlor among other OCPs and p,p'-DDE among DDTs. Also, different contamination patterns among sampling seasons were found. The concentrations of OCPs in sediment collected in spring were higher than those in summer and autumn. In contrast, the concentrations of OCPs in surface water in summer and autumn were higher among four sampling seasons. Distribution of HCHs, DDTs and other OCPs were different indicating their different contamination sources. The notable contamination was found in Fuchun reservoir. Composition analyses in sediments indicated a recent usage or discharge of lindane into the river. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We examined the temperature dependency of the effects of macroalgae on the survival of Manila clams in Nakaumi Lagoon in western Japan. We conducted (i) semi-monthly field surveys to clarify seasonal changes in macroalgal abundance and clam density and (ii) 7-day macroalgal enclosing and excluding experiments in two temperature settings (mean water temperatures: 19 and 29 degrees C) to test temperature-induced differences in algal effects on bottom-water redox conditions and clam survival. Clam density decreased during summer (July September), when increased coverage and thickness of drifting macroalgae was observed. In contrast, clam density increased from autumn to spring as macroalgal abundance decreased. Further, reducing conditions (Eh<0) were only detected in bottom waters in the presence of macroalgae during summer (water temperature >29 degrees C), suggesting that drifting macroalgae induced hypoxia under summer temperatures and consequently led to clam mortality. The 7-day algal enclosure experiment resulted in reducing bottom water conditions when mean water temperature was 29 degrees C. Further, clam survival decreased in the algal enclosure at 29 degrees C, whereas no such changes were detected at 19 degrees C. These results indicate that the effects of drifting macroalgae on the geochemical environment and clam survival are temperature dependent; therefore, global warming may enhance the likelihood of macroalgae-induced hypoxia with its associated adverse consequences in marine life.					; Yamada, Katsumasa/AAA-1303-2020	Yamada, Katsumasa/0000-0003-2136-0366; MIYAMOTO, Yasushi/0000-0002-3753-436X													1880-8247	1882-627X				NOV	2017	12	4					238	247		10.3800/pbr.12.238	http://dx.doi.org/10.3800/pbr.12.238													WOS:000417777900004
J	Zhang, JZ				Zhang, Jia-Zhong			Cyanobacteria blooms induced precipitation of calcium carbonate and dissolution of silica in a subtropical lagoon, Florida Bay, USA	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												In recent decades, annual cyanobacteria blooms in Florida Bay displayed spatial and temporal patterns that are consistent with changes in alkalinity and dissolved silicon in water. In early summer, the blooms developed in the north-central bay and spread southward in fall. The blooms drew down dissolved inorganic carbon and increased water pH, causing in situ precipitation of calcium carbonate. Dissolved silicon concentrations in these waters were at minimum in spring (20-60 mu M), increased during summer, and reached an annual maximum (100-200 mu M) during late summer. The dissolution of silica as a result of high pH in bloom water was first observed in this study. During the peak of blooms, silica dissolution in Florida Bay varied from 0.9 x 10(7) to 6.9 x 10(7) mol per month over the study period, depending on the extent of cyanobacteria blooms in a given year. Concurrent calcium carbonate precipitations in the cyanobacteria bloom region are between 0.9 x 10(8) and 2.6 x 10(8) mol per month. It is estimated that 30-70% of atmospheric CO2 uptake in bloom waters was precipitated as calcium carbonate mineral and remainders of CO2 influx were used for the production of biomass.					; Zhang, Jia-Zhong/B-7708-2008	Zhang, Jia-Zhong/0000-0002-1138-2556; 													2045-2322					MAR 11	2023	13	1							4071	10.1038/s41598-023-30905-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-30905-4								36906722					WOS:000958974100031

Regional Risk Assessment for climate change impacts on coastal aquifers	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Coastal aquifers have been identified as particularly vulnerable to impacts on water quantity and quality due to the high density of socio-economic activities and human assets in coastal regions and to the projected rising sea levels, contributing to the process of saltwater intrusion. This paper proposes a Regional Risk Assessment (RRA) methodology integrated with a chain of numerical models to evaluate potential climate change-related impacts on coastal aquifers and linked natural and human systems (i.e., wells, river, agricultural areas, lakes, forests and semi-natural environments). The RRA methodology employs Multi Criteria Decision Analysis methods and Geographic Information Systems functionalities to integrate heterogeneous spatial data on hazard, susceptibility and risk for saltwater intrusion and groundwater level variation. The proposed approach was applied on the Esino River basin (Italy) using future climate hazard scenarios based on a chain of climate, hydrological, hydraulic and groundwater system models running at different spatial scales. Models were forced with the IPCC SRES A1B emission scenario for the period 2071-2100 over four seasons (i.e., winter, spring, summer and autumn). Results indicate that in future seasons, climate change will cause few impacts on the lower Esino River valley. Groundwater level decrease will have limited effects: agricultural areas, forests and semi-natural environments will be at risk only in a region close to the coastline which covers less than 5% of the total surface of the considered receptors; less than 3.5% of the wells will be exposed in the worst scenario. Saltwater intrusion impact in future scenarios will be restricted to a narrow region close to the coastline (only few hundred meters), and thus it is expected to have very limited effects on the Esino coastal aquifer with no consequences on the considered natural and human systems.

Changes in sediment microbial community structure within a large water-storage reservoir during an extreme drawdown event	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Although drought and drying of waters occur globally, the effect of drying on sediment microbial communities underpinning aquatic biogeochemical processes is poorly understood. We used the molecular method of terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) to assess changes in the microbial community structure of sediments undergoing different levels of inundation and drying within a reservoir during drawdown in a drought. Sediments with three hydrological conditions were investigated: dry sediments (no overlying water), littoral sediments (covered with 1-2mm water) and inundated sediments (covered with >1m water). Sampling was done in winter 2006 (August) and summer 2007 (January) in Lake Hume, Australia. The microbial communities differed significantly between the different levels of inundation at each sampling time. Community structure also changed significantly within each site between winter 2006 and summer 2007, possibly influenced by the change of season or protracted drying. Sites that were 'littoral' in winter 2006 became 'dry' in summer 2007, and became more similar to communities that were 'dry' at both sampling times. This suggested that the hydrological history of specific sites did not heavily influence the response of microbial communities to severe drying, and all communities undergoing 'dry' conditions within the summer 2007 sampling responded similarly.					; Baldwin, Darren/H-2257-2011; , Gavin/U-5653-2019	Baldwin, Darren/0000-0002-5355-6745; Rees, Gavin/0000-0002-5270-8559; Suter, Phillip/0000-0002-6116-2885													1323-1650						2008	59	10					890	896		10.1071/MF07232	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF07232													WOS:000260377700003

The acquisition of information on the eukaryotic phytoplankton community is extremely significant for handling and regulating the ecosystems of lakes. In this study, samples were collected from the western half of Chaohu Lake in the summer and winter periods. Analyses revealed that the eukaryotic phytoplankton in this region comprised 70 genera, 34 orders, and 7 phyla. There were 61 genera, 29 orders, and 7 phyla in summer, and 25 genera, 14 orders, and 5 phyla in winter. The dominant genus was Chlamydomonas of Chlorophyta in summer. In contrast, the dominant genus was Mychonastes of Chlorophyta in winter. The diversity index analysis revealed that the eukaryotic phytoplankton community exhibited greater fluctuation in the summer than in the winter. Moreover, analysis of the physiochemical properties of the water samples showed considerable spatial and temporal differences in the water quality. This paper focusses primarily on analysing the influence of the physiochemical properties of water on the eukaryotic phytoplankton community. In particular, the effects of the major physicochemical properties of water on the community evolution of eukaryotic phytoplankton classes were evaluated using the redundancy analysis method. The findings demonstrated that total phosphorus (TP), PO4--P, NH4+-N, and total nitrogen (TN) were the primary influencing factors in summer, whereas NO3--N, DO, and water temperature (WT) were the major influencing factors in winter. Subsequently, the Mantel test revealed that the phylum level of the eukaryotic phytoplankton community was significantly correlated with WT, DO, NH4+-N, TN, TP, and Chlorophyll a. Variance partitioning analysis indicated that seasonal factors accounted for a large proportion of the variation in the eukaryotic phytoplankton community, reaching 48.4%. Subsequently, co-occurrence network analysis demonstrated that most families of eukaryotic phytoplankton were facilitated mutually, with the proportion of promotion being 94.1%. This study provides insight into the crucial factors that influence the phytoplankton communities and a reasonable control direction for the positive evolution of the eukaryotic phytoplankton community in the western half of Chaohu Lake.

This migratory species breeds in eastern Russia and mostly overwinters in Hokkaido, Japan, and the southern Kuzil islands. Locations of eagles were classified as being river, sea, lake, or other habitat. In autumn, eagles mainly used river habitats, probably because of the availability of abundant post-spawn dead salmon. In winter about one third of eagles continued to be located on rivers, with others on sea coasts and lake sides. During the spring migration and breeding season habitat use by adult eagles probably reflected the variety of habitats in which breeding occurs. At that time, sub-adult eagles were located mainly on the sea coast, probably in places where food supply was sufficient and there were few territorial eagles. In Hokkaido 35% of overwintering eagles used mountain areas for at least some time. It is known that eagles using mountain areas in Japan in winter scavenge upon the carcasses of sika deer Cervus nippon killed by hunters, and are thus exposed to possible lead poisoning. The satellite tracking highlights the importance of several habitats within the range of this species, changes in which could affect its conservation status.																			0030-6053					JAN	2003	37	1					110	114		10.1017/S003060530300019X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S003060530300019X													WOS:000182554500026

Our results showed that for the studied periods (2013 summer/wet and winter/dry seasons) the surface averaged F-CO2 presented similar behaviors, with regular emissions peaks. The mean daily surface averaged F-CO2 showed no significant difference between the seasons (p > 0.01), with values around - 1338 mg C m - 2 day - 1 (summer/wet) and - 1395 mg C m - 2 day - 1 (winter/dry). At diel scale, the F-CO2 was large during the night and morning and low during the afternoon in both seasons. Regarding its spatial distribution, the F-CO2 showed to be more heterogeneous during the summer/wet than during the winter/dry season. The highest F-CO2 were observed at transition zone (-300 mg C m - 2 h - 1) during summer and at littoral zone (-55 mg C m - 2 h - 1) during the winter. The total CO2 emitted by the reservoir along 2013 year was estimated to be 1.1 Tg C year - 1. By extrapolating our results we found that the total carbon emitted by all Amazonian reservoirs can be around 7 Tg C year - 1, which is 22% lower than the previous published estimate. This significant difference should not be neglected in the carbon inventories since the carbon emission is a key factor when comparing the environmental impacts of different sources of electricity generation and can influences decision makers in the selection of the more appropriate source of electricity and, in case of hydroelectricity, the geographical position of the reservoirs.

Bacterial abundance, estimated by epifluorescence microscopy counting, varied from 0.61 to 12.72 .times. 106 cells/mL, confirming the eutrophic status attributed to this lake. Cellular densities were nearly homogeneously distributed in the water column. Mean values for bacterial abundance, obtained from three sampling depths (2, 7, and 14 m) were 3.70, 4.23, and 3.66 .times. 106 cells/mL. In the epilimnion, phytoplankton productivity and community composition, as well as temperature, appeared to control bacterial development. Bacterial biomass varied from 0.5 to 43.5 .times. 10-2 mg C/L. Mean values for the three sampling depths were 8.1, 10.1, and 9.1 .times. 10-2 mg C/L. Although bacterial biomass was significantly correlated with bacterial abundance, oly 45 to 65% of its variation could be explained by abundance. Individual cell biovolumes varied up to sixfold, from 0.014 .mu.m3 in spring and autumn to 0.090 .mu.m3 in summer. The largest bacterial cells and the most elevated bacterial biomass were reached when bacteria were attached to phytoplankton or detrital organic matter, primarily during summer. Mucilaginous phytoplankton, such as Gomphosphaeria and Sphaerocystis, was found to be particularly good substrate available for the development of large and attached bacteria.																			0008-4166	1480-3275				JUL	1989	35	7					706	712		10.1139/m89-115	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/m89-115													WOS:A1989AJ05000006

Salinity, temperature, oxygen, nitrogen-nutrients, silicate, and two groups of phytoplankton and herbivores are represented as dynamic variables. From ''below'' the model is driven by solar radiation, precipitation, wind and tidal exchange and from ''above'' by herbivore mortality. Simulation results are presented and discussed together with actual observations from Lindaspollene. The main seasonal and vertical characteritics of the phytoplankton and herbivore dynamics seem to be well reflected by the model, and realistic seasonal pattens may be produced for several successive years. The most characteristic vertical features are the formation of a summer surface production maximum and a deep chlorophyll maximum. Furthermore, a herbivore biomass which develops in the surface layer divides into a shallow and a deep component during summer and becomes concentrated in the surface layer again in the autumn. The nutricline and the pycnocline develop independently of one another, with consequences for the supply of nutrients to the upper euphotic zone. The bottom-up control exerted by the meteorological forcing, especially the freshwater runoff, seems to be of paramount significance for the observed vertical structure and seaonality of the present fjord system.

A total of 2,532 individuals representing 152 species (winter: N = 140 and summer: N = 91) from 19 orders and 51 families were reported from Jhilmila Lake and its surrounding area. The number of birds was reported to be significantly higher during winter than in the summer season. The species diversity was also higher in winter (Shannon's index (H) = 4.38, Fisher's alpha = 30.67) than in summer (H = 4.21, Fisher's alpha = 34.69) as this area is surrounded by old-growth forest that provides available habitats for forest, grassland- and wetland-dwelling birds. This lake is an example of a wetland present in the Chure area that plays an important role in the conservation of biodiversity along with birds. Hence, we recommend its detailed study in terms of biodiversity and water quality.

J	Gao, X; Zhao, DS				Gao, Xuan; Zhao, Dongsheng			Impacts of climate change on vegetation phenology over the Great Lakes Region of Central Asia from 1982 to 2014	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Dryland ecosystems in the Great Lakes Region of Central Asia (GLRCA) are highly sensitive to climate change due to the climate of spring precipitation. Although shifts in vegetation phenology have been widely attributed to rising temperature, the effects of solar radiation and drought on phenology remain largely unknown. Understanding the mechanisms of vegetation phenology response to climatic factors is essential for assessing the impact of climate change on dryland ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the spatial and temporal variations of vegetation phenology across the GLRCA using a long-term series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and then examined the response of vegetation phenology to climate change within different climate zones by combining with climate data (surface temperature, soil moisture, short-wave radiation, and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI)). The results suggested that the start of growing season (SGS) and the end of growing season (EGS) were significantly earlier regionally by -0.143 days/year and -0.363 days/year, respectively. Because of changes in SGS and EGS, length of growing season (LGS) across the GLRCA was shortened at a rate of -0.442 days/yr, which was mainly attributed to advanced EGS. Additionally, SGS of vegetation was negatively correlated with surface temperature but positively correlated with soil moisture and SPEI. These results indicated that surface temperature was a major determinant of advanced spring phenology, while increased soil moisture and mitigated drought would delay spring phenology. The response of autumn phenology to surface temperature and short-wave radiation varied across different climate zones. In arid climate zone, autumn phenology was obviously advanced with the increase of surface temperature and short-wave radiation. In cold climate zone, higher surface temperature and short-wave radiation postponed autumn phenology. Meanwhile, the thermal growing season did not accurately characterize the actual vegetation growing season because GLRCA phenology was different from most of Northern Hemisphere.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				NOV 1	2022	845								157227	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157227	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157227		JUL 2022						35809736					WOS:000831321900007

Phytoplankton dynamics in relation to physicochemical conditions in large, stratified Lake Charzykowskie (Northern Poland)	OCEANOLOGICAL AND HYDROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES												The comparison of the latest and previous data on the structure of phytoplankton and chlorophyll a concentration in Lake Charzykowskie indicated long-term changes and fluctuations. The main objective of this study was to assess the phytoplankton communities in the lake with reference to hydrochemical conditions. Detailed hydrobiological studies were carried out in 2014-2015 to explain the improvement in the trophic status of the lake observed in 2008-2009. The research has shown that the phytoplankton community structure does not change significantly during the limnological cycle. The spring/autumn season is characterized by the highest contribution of diatoms and cryptophytes. Massive development of dinoflagellates was observed during the summer. Relative abundance of cyanobacteria (Aphanizomenon, Dolichospermum and Microcystis) was significantly lower compared to the previous years. In August 2014, cyanobacteria accounted for 100% of the total phytoplankton at site 2. In the following year, cyanobacteria represented only 13% in the summer phytoplankton. The current research has confirmed the favorable trophic changes in the phytoplankton of the lake. Unfortunately, very poor oxygen conditions will continue to affect the trophic status of the lake through mobilization of the internal nutrient supply. The current conditions of the lake require further monitoring of changes in the ecosystem.

We examined this question by measuring methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes in six forest and open land ponds on grasslands in Denmark during summer and winter. We used floating chambers with do-it-yourself sensors and automated headspace venting, allowing for 7404 hourly measurements. We found highly variable gas fluxes within ponds and between seasons and pond types. Ebullitive CH4 fluxes were more variable than diffusive CH4 fluxes. Ebullition was absent when total CH4 fluxes were lowest (15 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)), dominant (> 90%) at the highest fluxes (> 400 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)), and increased with water temperature. In summer, a minor daily increase in diffusive fluxes was found on days with high wind speed, while CH4 ebullition remained constant. CO2 fluxes paralleled the day-night balance of photosynthesis and respiration. Mean CH4 ebullition in open and forest ponds exceeded CH4 diffusive fluxes 4.1 and 7.1-fold in summer (avg. 22.5 C-degrees) and 2.3 and 2.5-fold in winter (9.6 C-degrees), respectively. CO2 emissions were higher on a molar basis than CH4 emissions, both in summer and winter, while their annual global warming potentials were similar. Mean annual gas emissions from open and forest ponds (1092 and 2527 g CO2e m(-2) y(-1)) are naturally high due to extensive external input of dissolved CO2 and organic carbon relative to pond area and volume.

Effects of winter surface aeration on pelagic zooplankton communities in a small boreal foothills lake of Alberta, Canada	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Winter aeration is often used to prevent fish winter-kill among lakes supporting recreational fisheries and is often used in conjunction with trout stocking as trout are sensitive to hypoxia. We collected limnological data as well as pelagic microcrustacea and rotifers one year before and one year after aeration was initiated in Birch Lake, located in the boreal foothills ecozone of Alberta, Canada. Using a Before-After-Control-Impact design, we compared changes in Birch Lake to those in two nearby and similarly mesotrophic, stocked control lakes (one aerated for more than six years, one unaerated). During winter, surface aeration increased the depth of well-mixed water in Birch Lake, maintaining levels of dissolved oxygen suitable for supporting stocked trout. Linear mixed model analyses indicated that among May-August water quality parameters, only phosphorus concentrations showed a marginally significant treatment x year interaction, increasing only in the unaerated control lake. Aeration did not affect the spring-summer abundance, biomass, or sizes of Birch Lake's zooplankton community. Once aerated, the microcrustacean community in Birch Lake showed partial overlap with the community in the aerated control, although this could not be statistically linked to changes in specific taxa. Ours is the first study to investigate impacts of winter surface aeration on zooplankton communities despite the numerous lakes managed under this strategy.

The main objective of the current study was to assess El-Temsah Lake, Egypt, water quality in 2018 using phytoplankton and physicochemical indices (e. g. species richness, diversity, equitability, and Palmer indices). Spatio-seasonal variability of phytoplanktons, qualitative status and physiochemical parameters assessed in 20 sample sites of El-Temsah Lake during the winter and summer seasons of 2018. Our results indicated that the phytoplankton abundance comprised of 105 species from 69 genera in summer and 101 species from 68 genera in winter. Navicula cryptocephala Kutzing was the predominant species in both seasons, especially in the middle sites of the lake. Phytoplankton quantity negatively relates to pH, temperature, and total dissolved solids but is positively related to nitrate and silicate level according to the Pearson correlation coefficient analysis. Summer season recorded higher diversity, richness, and equitability indices than winter. According to the Shannon diversity and Margalef indices, El-Temsah Lake was in moderate pollution levels. In conclusion, Genus Palmer's Index values at the north sites were in the range of 20 during the summer, implying a high probability of organic pollution of these sites. Thus, immediate action is required instantly to retrieve a good quality of El-Temsah Lake's aquatic ecosystem. The findings of this research offered a reference for analyzing the composition and distribution of phytoplankton communities, nutrient status, and pollution levels in El-Temsah Lake, as well as in other comparable lakes.					; essa, dorya/MIT-0923-2025; Attiah, Abdullah/S-4840-2018; Edokpayi, Joshua/H-5278-2019; salem, zenhom/AFS-7393-2022; Keshta, Amr/AAC-4238-2020; Elshobary, Mostafa/AAW-2427-2020	salem, zenhom/0000-0002-1749-5359; Attiah, Abdullah/0000-0003-1892-4829; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				FEB	2024	159								111721	10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.111721	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.111721		FEB 2024											WOS:001185892700001

The ecological importance of winter temperatures on high-latitude vegetation changes has recently been argued to be largely overlooked in comparison to summer temperatures. The Oymyakon region from eastern Siberia, with its strong continentality of extremely cold winters and moderately warm summers, is ideally suited to study the response of past vegetation to seasonal temperature changes based on long ecological time-series. However, few paleorecords are available from this area. The history of regional glacial activity and potential plant refugia since Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 is not well understood. Here, we present geochemical and plant DNA metabarcoding records retrieved from a sediment core from Lake Ulu in the Oymyakon region, which provides detailed information on glacier and vegetation dynamics over the last 43 cal. ka BP. Our results suggest that glacial fluctuations were primarily driven by summer insolation, and Lake Ulu was likely initiated by glacial retreat during MIS 3. The catchment experienced multiple glacial advance/retreat cycles until the Last Glacial Maximum, and the glaciers fully retreated by 20 cal. ka BP. In addition, a tundra-steppe landscape dominated by Dryas, Papaver, Saliceae, and Anthemideae occupied the catchment for most of the time and began to collapse around 19 cal. ka BP following the expansion of trees and shrubs such as Larix, Betula, Alnus, and Vaccinium. Postglacial plant assemblages in the Oymyakon region exhibit a high sensitivity to summer temperature variations, with minimal impact from winter temperatures. This can be explained by the dominance of summer insolation amplitude, extreme continentality, extended plant growing season, and plant genetic adaptation to cold. Notably, our ancient DNA record show the earliest postglacial expansion of larch in eastern Siberia (around 18.6 cal. ka BP), which is likely related to the presence of local refugia. This implies that the Oymyakon region may be one of the earliest sources for larch recolonization and that more research should be implemented to provide insights into larch expansion and migration, and to better predict the future scenarios for Siberian larch forests.

J	OUTRIDGE, PM; ARTHINGTON, AH; MILLER, GJ				OUTRIDGE, PM; ARTHINGTON, AH; MILLER, GJ			LIMNOLOGY OF NATURALLY ACIDIC, OLIGOTROPHIC DUNE LAKES IN SUB-TROPICAL AUSTRALIA, INCLUDING CHLOROPHYLL - PHOSPHORUS RELATIONSHIPS	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This study provides the most comprehensive physico-chemical and phytoplankton data yet available for Australian dune lakes, which are among the world''s most naturally acidic and oligotrophic freshwaters. Seasoal and spatial variations were examined in Blue Lagoon and Lake Freshwater, two ''water-table window'' lakes in south-east Queensland. Like other dune lakes, they are acidic (minimum pH 4.20 and 4.55, respectively), polymictic water bodies with low concentrations of marine-derived major ions and almost undetectable levels of trace metals. While limnologically similar in winter, during spring-summer Lake Freshwater has significantly higher levels of chlorophyll-.alpha., total phosphorus (TP) and turbidity than Blue Lagoon and other dune lakes, indicating seasonal mesotrophy. The key nutrient is TP, which has recently increased to a maximum of 17 .mu.g .cntdot. l-1, due either to inputs from recreational souces, or to the death and decomposition of littoral vegetation resulting from falling water levels over the last decade. Inorganic nitrogen, though present only in small amounts, does not appear to limit the eutrophication process because of a shift in phytoplankton dominance from the usual desmids and dinoflagellates to N2-fixing blue-green algae. A chlorophyll - TP linear regression derived for dune lakes indicates that at TP < 20 .mu.g .cntdot. l-1 chlorophyll ''yield'' is higher than in other lake types represented by regression from the literature. This may be due to a more efficient utilization of the limited available phosphorus by dune lake algae which have adapted to the naturally oligotrophic environment. The implications of these findings for lake management are discussed.					; Arthington, Angela/I-1689-2019	Arthington, Angela/0000-0001-5967-7954; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL 21	1989	179	1					39	51		10.1007/BF00011928	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00011928													WOS:A1989AL26400004
J	WINGET, RN				WINGET, RN			BRACHYCENTRUS-AMERICANUS AND BRACHYCENTRUS-OCCIDENTALIS (TRICHOPTERA) IN A REGULATED STREAM	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Late instar Brachycentrus americanus larvae were collected just prior to and during normally high spring runoff; adults were collected immediately following runoff; and early instar larvae appeared during the late summer low flow period of Sept. and Oct. B. occidentalis adults were collected prior to normal spring runoff and early instar were first collected following runoff during moderate flows of July and Aug. Both strategies helped these species avoid stresses of high water velocities and sediment scouring often associated with spring runoff. During the study period, yearly high stream flows and maximum sediment movement occurred during summer flushing releases from Electric Lake [Utah, USA], rather than the normal spring runoff period. Increased stream discharges with associated sediment movement that occurred when early instar Brachycentrus larvae were present, appear to have had noticeable negative affects. Whatever the cause, following these occurrences, either species having early instar larvae present during the occurrence, showed noticeable reductions in numbers of larvae. Inorganic suspended sediments associated with these flows could have interfered with feeding, scoured larvae off substrates, hindered respiration, triggered a drift behavior or possibly a combination of these and other factors. Whatever the cause, B. occidentalis numbers were depressed and the distribution of numbers over the various larval body lengths was disrupted following flushes of 1975, 1979 and 1982. B. americanus larvae did not show the same negative responses following these occurrences. It appears that with July-Aug. flushes, summer hatching of B. occidentalis may be a disadvantage in Huntington River. Early spring emergence of B. occidentalis appears to have some advantage during above normal early spring runoff occurrences, such as during 1973. Late summer hatching of B. americanus appears to be the more advantageous under the regulated flow regime [via man-made impoundments] of Huntington River.																			0270-5060	2156-6941					1984	2	4					373	381		10.1080/02705060.1984.9664615	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1984.9664615													WOS:A1984SJ49600007

However, our knowledge about bacterium epidemiology in Apulian (Southern Italy) olive orchards is currently limited to the late spring secondary (olive-to-olive) spread mediated by the spittlebug Philaenus spumarius (L.). Summer dispersal toward wild trees and shrubs is a common trait observed in several spittlebug species that could have important impacts on X. fastidiosa epidemiology. Here, we report preliminary data on presence and abundance of spittlebugs during the year in four different habitats interspersed with cultivated orchards within a natural area in Apulia. In two surveyed habitats, a pine forest and a lake shore, the latter dominated by elm plants, spittlebug adults peaked during the period June-September, with maximum values in July-August on elm. Three spittlebug species, Neophilaenus campestris (Fallen), P. spumarius and Philaenus italosignus Drosopoulos et Remane were evenly collected on pine plants, while the latter was the most abundant on elms. A few individuals were collected on elm throughout the end of the year, while on pines spittlebugs were only collected in summer. The possible implications of our findings for X. fastidiosa epidemiology in both cultivated orchards and natural habitats, together with future research needs are discussed.					de Lillo, Enrico/AAS-8074-2020; cornara, daniele/AAN-2685-2020; Bodino, Nicola/AAF-6103-2020; Santoiemma, Giacomo/J-7169-2019	Bodino, Nicola/0000-0002-7655-5008; Santoiemma, Giacomo/0000-0002-3226-9253													1721-8861	2283-0332				DEC	2021	74	2					173	180																WOS:000706125000002

Coots began migrating into Oklahoma in Mid-Sept., numbers peaked in early to mid-Oct., and a few birds were seen after 1 Nov. Some late migrants appeared in mid-Dec. In spring, coots began migrating in late Feb., numbers peaked in mid-April, and the last birds were seen in mid-May. Generally, adult and juvenile males and juvenile female coots migrated simultaneously in autumn, but adult females completed migration by 1 Nov. A few juveniles and adult males migrated in Dec. Adult coots preceded yearlings in spring. Despite annual and between-lake differences in chronology of autumn migration, most coots migrated before waterfowl hunting seasons in Oklahoma. Coot hunting seasons in mid-latitude states should commence before the general waterfowl season where management goals are to increase hunter interest and the harvest of birds.																			0022-541X	1937-2817					1985	49	1					241	246		10.2307/3801878	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3801878													WOS:A1985ADK9800049
J	Hirano, J; Mikami, T				Hirano, Junpei; Mikami, Takehiko			Reconstruction of winter climate variations during the 19th century in Japan	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												An attempt was made to reconstruct winter climate conditions in Japan for the period 1810/1811 to 1958/1859 on the basis of daily weather records documented in old diaries. Daily weather maps for each winter were drawn using 19th century weather records collected by our research group. Maps were divided into five types by classifying daily snowfall and rainfall distributions and the occurrence frequencies of each weather pattern for the period 1810/1811 to 1858/1859 were analysed. It was found that the occurrence frequencies of winter monsoon weather patterns were high from the late 1820s to the early 1840s. This period almost coincided with a summer cold period in the 19th century. The result implies that strengthening of a cold air mass around Japan occurred in the late 1820s, not only in summer but also in winter. The frequencies of the typical winter monsoon patterns correspond with the freezing dates of Lake Suwa, which have been used as an indicator of winter coldness in previous studies. On the basis of the frequencies of the winter monsoon weather patterns, mean January temperatures for western Japan were estimated. In the time series of estimated temperatures, a cooling period from the late 1820s to the early 1830s was revealed.

CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF EXTRACTABLE ORGANIC MATTER OF AIRBORNE PARTICLES IN URBAN AND RURAL ATMOSPHERES OF NORTHERN ALGERIA	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												The concentrations of extractable organic fraction of atmospheric particulate matter (PK10) were measured in northern Algeria during summer and autumn 2007. Three monitoring campaigns were done in July, September and October in two urban and one rural areas. The chemical analysis shows that the detected organic groups are n-alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), nitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (NPAHs) and highly-polar chemicals including caffeine, nicotine and oxygenated-PAHs. In addition to that, the potential sources of pollution were investigated by analyzing the n-alkane carbon preference index (CPI). Also, the selected diagnostic ratios of PAH and NPAH concentrations were studied. The aerial concentrations of the total n-alkanes did not vary widely over the entire period (144 to 170 ng m(-3)), while total PAHs ranged from 12 to 24 ng m(-3). Despite their recognized semi-volatile properties caffeine and nicotine, chosen respectively as tracers of recreational drink consumption and tobacco smoke, reached surprisingly high concentration in the air both in summer and autumn. Indeed, they accounted together for similar to 12% of the total identified PM components in the Rouiba urban area during summer, and from 37 to 65 % in autumn at all the three sites studied.

ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Seasonal variations of biometric parameters as well as metal and protein concentrations were analyzed in the liver cytosol of indigenous European chub (Squalius cephalus L.). Fish sampling was carried out in the reproductive (spring) and non-reproductive period (autumn) in order to define parameters which are seasonally dependent. The specimens caught in the spring period had higher biometric (liver mass, condition and hepatosomatic indices) and some biochemical parameters (metallothionein (MT) and Mn) that are characteristic for the reproductive period. Contrary, Fe hepatic cytosolic concentrations were significantly lower in specimens from spring than in autumn period. Total cytosolic proteins, Cu and Cd concentrations were not seasonally dependent. Range of constitutive levels was determined for total cytosolic proteins (17.7 to 24.7 mg ml(-1)) from the whole set of data. Constitutive range of seasonally dependent parameters MT (207 to 337 mu g ml(-1)) and Mn (0.11 to 0.19 mu g ml(-1)) is based on the data from non-reproductive period. In order to avoid the interference of reproductive cycle on the level of selected biochemical parameters, it is recommended to perform chub sampling during non-reproductive period.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				OCT	2009	157	1-4					1	10		10.1007/s10661-008-0509-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-008-0509-x								18758978					WOS:000269883900001

Thermal stratification and fish thermal preference explain vertical eDNA distributions in lakes	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Significant advances have been made towards surveying animal and plant communities using DNA isolated from environmental samples. Despite rapid progress, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the "ecology" of environmental DNA (eDNA), particularly its temporal and spatial distribution and how this is shaped by abiotic and biotic processes. Here, we tested how seasonal variation in thermal stratification and animal habitat preferences influences the distribution of eDNA in lakes. We sampled eDNA depth profiles of five dimictic lakes during both summer stratification and autumn turnover, each containing warm- and cool-water fishes as well as the cold-water stenotherm, lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush). Habitat use byS. namaycushwas validated by acoustic telemetry and was significantly related to eDNA distribution during stratification. Fish eDNA became "stratified" into layers during summer months, reflecting lake stratification and the thermal niches of the species. During summer months,S. namaycush, which rarely ventured into shallow waters, could only be detected at the deepest layers of the lakes, whereas the eDNA of warm-water fishes was much more abundant above the thermocline. By contrast, during autumn lake turnover, the fish species assemblage as detected by eDNA was homogenous throughout the water column. These findings contribute to our overall understanding of the "ecology" of eDNA within lake ecosystems, illustrating how the strong interaction between seasonal thermal structure in lakes and thermal niches of species on very localized spatial scales influences our ability to detect species.

Adult mosquitoes were aspirated weekly from shelters in woodlands adjacent to larval sampling sites. An. quadrimaculatus and Cx. erraticus comprised >95% of the total number of mosquitoes collected. An. quadrimaculatus adults exhibited vernal and autumnal peaks of abundance during both years. Cx. erraticus adults exhibited several peaks of abundance in summer and early fall of both years. An. quadrimaculatus initiated blood feeding in May and April 1985 and 1986, respectively. Only unfed females were found in late fall and winter. Cx. erraticus initiated blood feeding earlier than An. quadrimaculatus. In 1985, almost-equal-to 25% of the females in the first collection in May contained a blood meal, whereas in 1986, almost-equal-to 10% of the females in the first collection in April were blood fed. Females of both species ceased blood feeding in late fall. Larvae were sampled on a weekly basis from lake edge, flood plain, and creek edge habitats. Generally, An. quadrimaculatus larvae were most abundant in lake edge and flood plain habitats, whereas Cx. erraticus larvae were most abundant in the creek edge habitat. The population dynamics of An. quadrimaculatus were associated with seasonal changes in the level of Falls Lake. In 1985 and 1986, the level of Falls Lake gradually declined from May to mid-August until heavy rainfall caused a 1-m rise in lake level. Populations of An. quadrimaculatus larvae and adults increased significantly following the rise in the level of Falls Lake. In contrast, the abundance of larval and adult Cx. erraticus decreased with rising lake levels in late August. Water level management should be an effective method for controlling populations of An. quadrimaculatus but not for Cx. erraticus. Blood-fed mosquitoes were tested to identify bloodmeal hosts using both capillary precipitin and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. An. quadrimaculatus (n = 941) predominantly (99%) fed on mammals, principally white-tailed deer and horses. Cx. erraticus (n = 348) exhibited an opportunistic host-feeding pattern; blood meals were taken from mammalian (49%), reptile or amphibian (20%), and avian (31%) hosts.

C.; Zhao, Kaiguang; Romanko, Matthew; Khanal, Sami			Assessment of the Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Cover Crops Using Remote Sensing	REMOTE SENSING												Cover cropping is a conservation practice that helps to alleviate soil health problems and reduce nutrient losses. Understanding the spatial variability in historic and current adoption of cover cropping practices and their impacts on soil, water, and nutrient dynamics at a landscape scale is an important step in determining and prioritizing areas in a watershed to effectively utilize this practice. However, such data are lacking. Our objective was to develop a spatial and temporal inventory of winter cover cropping practices in the Maumee River watershed using images collected by Landsat satellites (Landsat 5, 7 and 8) from 2008 to 2019 in Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Each year, satellite images collected during cover crop growing season (i.e., between October and April) were converted into two seasonal composites based on cover crop phenology. Using these composites, various image-based covariates were extracted for 628 ground-truth (field) data. By integrating ground-truth and image-based covariates, a cover crop classification model based on a random forest (RF) algorithm was developed, trained and validated in GEE platform. Our classification scheme differentiated four cover crop categories: Winter Hardy, Winter Kill, Spring Emergent, and No Cover. The overall classification accuracy was 75%, with a kappa coefficient of 0.63. The results showed that more than 50% of the corn-soybean areas in the Maumee River watershed were without winter crops during 2008-2019 period. It was found that 2019/2020 and 2009/2010 were the years with the largest and lowest cover crop areas, with 34% and 10% in the watershed, respectively. The total cover cropping area was then assessed in relation to fall precipitation and cumulative growing degree days (GDD). There was no apparent increasing trend in cover crop areas between 2008 and 2019, but the variability in cover crops areas was found to be related to higher accumulated GDD and fall precipitation. A detailed understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution of cover crops using GEE could help in promoting site-specific management practices to enhance their environmental benefits. This also has significance to policy makers and funding agencies as they could use the information to localize areas in need of interventions for supporting adoption of cover cropping practice.

J	Liu, XD; Yanai, M				Liu, XD; Yanai, M			Influence of Eurasian spring snow cover on Asian summer rainfall	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												The Eurasian snow cover anomaly in spring has been considered as one of the important factors affecting Asian summer monsoon variability. Using the long time series (1922-98) of Eurasian spring (March-April) snow cover (ESSC) reconstructed by Brown (2000. Journal of Climate 13: 2339) and snow cover (1973-98) and depth (1979-87) data from satellite observation, the influences of ESSC on the all-India monsoon (June-September) rainfall (AIMR) and the summer rainfall over all parts of Asia are examined. It is found that the statistical relation between AIMR and ESSC changes over a multi-decadal time scale. The negative correlation between them has increased markedly since the mid 1970s. The region where the summer rainfall has the strongest and most stable negative correlation with the preceding ESSC is located in northern Mongolia, south of Lake Baikal. The correlation between the summer rainfall and ESSC increases after the data are treated with a low-pass filter, showing that the impact of snow cover may be seen more clearly with the removal of the effect of El Nino-southern oscillation. Comparative analyses for contrasting years with excessive and deficient snow cover show that the anomalies of ESSC occur mainly in northwestern Eurasia. In the years of excessive ESSC anomalies, cooling and a cyclonic circulation anomaly in the lower troposphere appear over the northern part of Eurasia, leading to a Rossby-wave-train-like circulation response, then a weakened East Asia summer monsoon and deficient rainfall with an anticyclonic circulation anomaly south of Lake Baikal.

J	Zohary, T; Fishbein, T; Shlichter, M; Naselli-Flores, L				Zohary, Tamar; Fishbein, Tatiana; Shlichter, Miriam; Naselli-Flores, Luigi			Larger cell or colony size in winter, smaller in summer - a pattern shared by many species of Lake Kinneret phytoplankton	INLAND WATERS												We examined an 8.5-year record (2004-2012) of cell size data for phytoplankton species from Lake Kinneret, Israel, sampled weekly or at 2-week intervals and determined microscopically by the same person. Many of the species abundant enough to be counted year-round showed a typical seasonal cell size pattern that repeated annually: cell diameter was maximal in winter and minimal in summer. This pattern was shared by species from different taxonomic groups including cyanobacteria, chlorophyta, and dinoflagellates. Similarly, in colonial species of diatoms, chlorophyta, and cyanobacteria the number of cells per colony was larger in winter and smaller in summer. We postulated that the seasonal changes in cell or colony size constituted an adaptation that enabled species to overcome temperature-dependent changes in water density and viscosity and adjust their sinking velocities in the different seasons. A series of computations based on Stokes' law supported our hypothesis. If this phenomenon of larger cells or colonies of the same species at lower temperatures is widespread in lake phytoplankton, then (1) phytoplankton biomass estimates should be based on seasonally determined biovolume per species data rather than fixed values; and (2) we would expect to see smaller-sized organisms in the future as global warming changes ambient temperatures.

The data show a sudden decrease in the phosphorus import of over 60% in 1990, resulting in the abrupt change of the trophic state from eutrophic to weakly mesotrophic. Contrary to expectations, the average annual phytoplankton abundance did not decrease but almost doubled on average over the years after 1990. This was primarily due to mostly warmer winters after 1990 causing longer spring overturns, which minimized sedimentation losses, enabled better utilization of the phosphorus reserves, and resulted in higher yields of the diatom-dominated phytoplankton spring mass development. In the summers after 1990, the mass growth of the diatom Fragilaria crotonensis, which in the past used to dominate in this season and effectively transported phosphorus to the sediment by settling, was considerably reduced because of lower P supply and stronger stratification. However, the decrease in the biomass of Fragilaria was overcompensated by the increased abundance of cyanobacteria. They benefitted not only from declining phosphorus competition by Fragilaria but also from higher thermal stability and temperature in the epilimnion. Hence, even higher summer biomasses were observed despite considerably lowered phosphorus import. The analysis of the long-term dataset clearly illustrates the deciding impact of hydrophysical factors on the phytoplankton growth, also under nutrient deficient conditions. The altered mixing and stratification pattern caused by climate change did not only prevent the re-oligotrophication of the reservoir but even enhanced the phytoplankton production. It seems that global warming modifies the interplay between physical and nutrient limitation mechanisms and the limits and models used in the past to classify trophic-state levels have to be verified. The study shows the enormous significance and indispensability of uninterrupted ecological long-term datasets, including reliable data of the ecosystem's organismic structure, for research about the consequences of climate change.																			1434-2944	1522-2632				MAY	2015	100	2					43	60		10.1002/iroh.201401743	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.201401743													WOS:000354223600001

The mid-latitude mesopause temperature decreases similar to 60 K from a winter maximum of similar to 220 K to a summer minimum of similar to 160 K. 'Sudden Mesopause Cooling' Events of similar to 30 K amplitude have been observed during mid-winter, one in January 1994 and two in January/February 1995, which appear to be associated with 'stratospheric sudden warming' phenomena.

We developed a regression model for walleye recruitment in western Lake Erie by considering factors such as first-year growth, size of the spawning stock, the rate at which the lake warmed during the spring, and abundance of gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum. Gizzard shad abundance during the fall prior to spring walleye spawning explained over 40% of the variation in walleye recruitment. Gizzard shad are relatively high in lipids and are preferred prey for walleyes in Lake Erie. Therefore, the high degree of correlation between shad abundance and subsequent walleye recruitment supported the contention that mature females needed adequate lipid reserves during the winter to spawn the following spring. According to the regression analysis, spring warming rate and size of the parental stock also influenced walleye recruitment. Our regression model explained 92% of the variation in recruitment of age-2 fish into the Lake Erie walleye population from 1981 to 1993. The regression model is potentially valuable as a management tool because it could be used to forecast walleye recruitment to the fishery 2 years in advance. First-year growth was poorly correlated with recruitment, which may reflect the unusually low incidence of walleye cannibalism in western Lake Erie. In contrast, first-year growth was strongly linked to age at maturity.

J	Gardarsson, A; Einarsson, A				Gardarsson, A; Einarsson, A			Numbers and production of Eurasian wigeon in relation to conditions in a breeding area, Lake Myvatn, Iceland	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												1. A migratory breeding population of Eurasian wigeon Anas penelope L., was studied over the period 1975-95 on 54 km(2) of freshwater habitat at Lake Myvatn, northern Iceland. Spring numbers of males averaged 1076 (range 526-1887). The sex ratio was 0.97 females per male and the proportion of yearling males averaged 0.21. The mean brood was 3.93 and a mean of 2.83 young per female (range 0.09-5.14) was produced. Production of young was positively related to chironomid abundance and negatively to cold and wet weather. 2. Both sexes seem to be faithful to their winter range, but males are much less faithful to the summer range than are females. The apparent return rate of males is presumably an expression of the return rate of females, which had previously bred locally or been produced at Myvatn. 3. The apparent return rate of old males (2 years or older), mean 0.84 (range 0.58-1.22), was positively correlated with chironomid abundance in the previous summer, which varied greatly. It is suggested that abundant chironomids in late summer may provide a source of highly nutritious food which would increase the probability of wigeon returning to Myvatn or favour the survival of Myvatn wigeon on winter grounds shared with birds originating from other breeding areas. Chironomid numbers showed serial correlation, hence it may be advantageous for the birds to assess the food supply before departure and return accordingly. 4. The apparent return rate of yearling males, mean 0.22 (range 0.06-0.56), was negatively related to the number of young produced in the year before. 5. The density of breeding wigeon at Lake Myvatn was mainly determined by food conditions in the breeding area, as experienced by the adults 1 year previously, and events in the winter range appeared to have less influence. Flyway populations may be limited by a complex set of local and global fluctuations in resources in (i) breeding localities, determining density and production in each, coupled with (ii) staging and wintering localities in each of which local resources would determine density.																			0021-8790					JUL	1997	66	4					439	451		10.2307/5939	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/5939													WOS:A1997XK44400001
J	Öhman, J; Buffam, I; Englund, G; Blom, A; Lindgren, E; Laudon, H				Öhman, J; Buffam, I; Englund, G; Blom, A; Lindgren, E; Laudon, H			Associations between water chemistry and fish community composition: a comparison between isolated and connected lakes in northern Sweden	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The correlation between water chemistry, physical variables and fish community composition was examined in 40 small (<= 30 ha) coastal lakes in northern Sweden. Twenty of the 40 lakes were isolated from other water bodies and 20 were connected to the Baltic Sea. Lakes were fished in summer, using three different methods. Water chemistry was sampled in late winter prior to ice-out and pH was measured additionally in summer. 2. Our central question was whether water chemistry plays a greater role in the composition of fish communities in isolated lakes than in connected lakes, as isolated lakes cannot be recolonised once a species has become extinct. 3. Results indicate that winter anoxia affects community composition only in isolated lakes, whereas acidity is of importance in both connected and isolated lakes. Methane (indicating anoxia), was significantly correlated with variation in fish community composition in isolated lakes, and a group of variables that indicate anoxia (CH4, pCO(2), inorganic carbon and dissolved oxygen) explained 24-34% of the variation. pH alone explained 12% of the variation in community composition for connected lakes and a group of variables indicating acidity (summer and winter pH and ANC) explained 10-20% of the variation in isolated lakes. Lake area was the most important physical variable, being significantly correlated with the variation in fish community composition in connected lakes. 4. In isolated lakes, the presence of pike (Esox lucius), perch (Perca fluviatilis) and roach (Rutilus rutilus) was associated with low CH4. The occurrence of crucian carp (Carassius carassius) and roach was positively correlated with pH, and the crucian carp was apparently also affected by predation by pike and perch. In connected lakes the effect of anoxia was low, probably due to the possibility of recolonisation and pockets of oxygenated water, allowing pike and perch to persist and thereby limiting the distribution of crucian carp.					; Englund, Göran/A-7434-2008; Laudon, Hjalmar/J-3074-2013	Englund, Goran/0000-0001-5634-8602; Laudon, Hjalmar/0000-0001-6058-1466; Buffam, Ishi/0000-0002-2625-6640													0046-5070	1365-2427				MAR	2006	51	3					510	522		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01514.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01514.x													WOS:000235331600010
J	Baldwin, CM; Beauchamp, DA; Gubala, CP				Baldwin, CM; Beauchamp, DA; Gubala, CP			Seasonal and diel distribution and movement of cutthroat trout from ultrasonic telemetry	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Our objective was to track the diel movements and distribution of large Bear Lake cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarki utah in relation to vertical environmental gradients and prey distribution in Strawberry Reservoir, Utah, during summer and autumn 1997. Implanted ultrasonic transmitters provided the depth and general location of the fish, while a differentially corrected Global Positioning System recorded boat positions that were then overlaid on a bathymetric map to determine temporal and spatial habitat use patterns. Tagged cutthroat trout used both nearshore and offshore habitats during both summer and autumn, but they were generally more pelagic during summer and used shallower nearshore zones more extensively in autumn. During early August, large cutthroat trout were restricted to the thermocline (metalimnion; 10-15 m deep) between a hypoxic hypolimnion and a warm epilimnion during all diel periods. When hypoxia affected the lower metalimnion in mid-August, the fish moved up into the upper metalimnion and warmer epilimnion. From mid-August through autumn, fish utilized a much broader range of depths, remaining more active and in deeper water during daylight and less active and near the surface at night, Fish depth and swimming speed varied by season and diel period but were consistently highest during daylight, intermediate during crepuscular periods, and lowest at night. At dawn, fish closely tracked the maximum light available in the water column until the level of illumination was well in excess of the threshold for maximum reaction distances to invertebrate and fish prey. The available light never restricted daylight foraging opportunities at the depths occupied by the fish. Widespread movements among habitats and depths by large, cannibalistic cutthroat trout allowed considerable spatial and temporal overlap with juvenile salmonids over most of the year, except when a temporary nearshore refuge for juvenile salmonids formed during the temperature-oxygen squeeze in early August. Cannibalism on stocked cutthroat trout could potentially be minimized by releasing juveniles in nearshore areas in early August, when adults are restricted to the thermocline in deeper waters further offshore.																			0002-8487					JAN	2002	131	1					143	158		10.1577/1548-8659(2002)131<0143:SADDAM>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(2002)131<0143:SADDAM>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000173412800012

Use of robotic monitoring to assess turbidity patterns in Onondaga Lake, NY	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Selected temporal and vertical patterns of turbidity (Tn) are documented for an eutrophic urban lake, Onondaga Lake, NY, and their diagnostic value in identifying hydrodynamic and metabolic processes and in estimating clarity is established. The analysis is supported by five years (spring to fall) of daily robotic profiling of Tn, temperature (T), and dissolved oxygen, and an array of more temporally limited measurements that included Tn and T levels in the major tributary input of terrigenous solids; lake particle characterizations with a profiling particle counter and a scanning electron microscope coupled with automated image analysis and X-ray microanalysis; and Secchi disc transparency (SD). Major runoff events are demonstrated to cause conspicuous short-term increases in Tn that are manifested as metalimnetic peaks in summer and early fall, associated with the entry of the negatively buoyant primary tributary source as an interflow. The annual occurrence of Tn maxima within the oxycline of the metalimnion in October is documented. Evidence supports the position that this layer is a bacterial plate of oxidizing bacteria that develops seasonally in response to increasing vertical transport of reduced species from the hypolimnion with the approach to fall turnover. A strong relationship between SD and Tn in the upper waters is reported, that is demonstrated to have utility in resolving the dynamics of substantial changes in SD that occur in the lake during clear water phases.

Plankton communities varied seasonally and standing stocks declined downriver, providing evidence of the importance of imports to the river from nearby Lake Ontario. For the time sequence studied, diatoms and cryptophytes dominated the algal flora, while cyclopoid copepods prevailed in the zooplankton community. Seasonally, algal biomass pulsed in spring declining through summer while crustacean zooplankton biomass exhibited low spring concentrations rising to peak standing crop in late July-early Aug. Current velocity increased nearly 5 times downriver reflecting changes in sedimentation of detrital material and drift transport. Modifications of planktonic communities and downriver adjustments in standing stocks appeared to reflect alterations in the river''s physical environment.																			0020-9309						1982	67	1					27	43																WOS:A1982NT20200002

Comparison of American Fisheries Society (AFS) Standard Fish Sampling Techniques and Environmental DNA for Characterizing Fish Communities in a Large Reservoir	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Recently, methods involving examination of environmental DNA (eDNA) have shown promise for characterizing fish species presence and distribution in waterbodies. We evaluated the use of eDNA for standard fish monitoring surveys in a large reservoir. Specifically, we compared the presence, relative abundance, biomass, and relative percent composition of Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides and Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum measured through eDNA methods and established American Fisheries Society standard sampling methods for Theodore Roosevelt Lake, Arizona. Catches at electrofishing and gillnetting sites were compared with eDNA water samples at sites, within spatial strata, and over the entire reservoir. Gizzard Shad were detected at a higher percentage of sites with eDNA methods than with boat electrofishing in both spring and fall. In contrast, spring and fall gillnetting detected Gizzard Shad at more sites than eDNA. Boat electrofishing and gillnetting detected Largemouth Bass at more sites than eDNA; the exception was fall gillnetting, for which the number of sites of Largemouth Bass detection was equal to that for eDNA. We observed no relationship between relative abundance and biomass of Largemouth Bass and Gizzard Shad measured by established methods and eDNA copies at individual sites or lake sections. Reservoirwide catch composition for Largemouth Bass and Gizzard Shad (numbers and total weight [g] of fish) as determined through a combination of gear types (boat electrofishing plus gillnetting) was similar to the proportion of total eDNA copies from each species in spring and fall field sampling. However, no similarity existed between proportions of fish caught via spring and fall boat electrofishing and the proportion of total eDNA copies from each species. Our study suggests that eDNA field sampling protocols, filtration, DNA extraction, primer design, and DNA sequencing methods need further refinement and testing before incorporation into standard fish sampling surveys.																			0275-5947	1548-8675					2017	37	5					1010	1027		10.1080/02755947.2017.1342721	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2017.1342721													WOS:000412447600008
J	Matsuoka, N				Matsuoka, N			Direct observation of frost wedging in alpine bedrock	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Width and temperature of rock joints were automatically monitored in the Japanese Alps. Three years of monitoring on a sandstone rock face shows two seasonal peaks of joint widening in autumn and spring. The autumn events are associated with short-term freeze-thaw cycles, and the magnitude of widening reflects the freezing intensity and water availability. The short-term freezing can produce wedging to a depth of at least 20 cm. The spring events follow a rise in the rock surface temperature to 0 degreesC beneath the seasonal snowcover, and likely originate from refreezing of meltwater entering the joint. Some of these events contribute to permanent enlargement of the joint. Two other joints on nearby rock faces experience only sporadic widening accompanying freeze-thaw cycles and insignificant permanent enlargement. Observations indicate that no single thermal criterion can explain frost weathering. The temperature range at which wedging occurs varies with the bedrock conditions, water availability and duration of freezing.

Seasonal drying influences odonate adults and nymphs in wetlands in an urban mediterranean-climate landscape	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Little is known about odonate ecology and phenology in warm mediterranean climates where most wetlands are intermittent. We identified variables associated with the presence, relative abundance, assemblage composition and body size of odonates in spring and summer, to understand the influence of intermittency and season. We hypothesized that size at eclosion would be smaller in seasonal wetlands in summer due to time stress caused by drying. Nymphs, exuviae and adults were sampled in spring and summer from 22 intermittent and perennial suburban wetlands in south-western Australia. Spatial and environmental variables within and between wetlands were measured and associated with adult and nymph distributions. Exuviae were collected to quantify size at eclosion. As in temperate perennial wetlands, wetland-scale variables (submerged, emergent and terrestrial vegetation, water temperature) were most strongly associated with assemblage composition of adults and nymphs, but landscape-scale variables (distance to nearest patch of native vegetation, distance to nearest large lake) were also associated with adult assemblages. Two abundant dragonfly (Orthetrum caledonicum Libellulidae, Hemicordulia tau Hemicorduliidae) and one damselfly (Xanthagrion erythroneurum Coenagrionidae) species emerged at smaller body sizes in summer than spring, but from both intermittent and perennial wetlands. Consequently, declining photoperiod and warmer summer temperatures, rather than wetland drying, probably caused reduced size at eclosion. Although the influence of vegetation, temperature and photoperiod on odonate assemblages appears similar in temperate and mediterranean climates, odonate phenology differs markedly. Fitness cost of emerging at a smaller adult size may be outweighed by the increased likelihood of successfully reaching emergence in drying waterbodies in summer. More field data on size at eclosion in warm climate regions, and laboratory experiments manipulating temperature and photoperiod, are needed to confirm the generality of patterns shown here.

On average, largest emissions of both gases per unit area occurred in the helophyte zone. Fluxes of CO2 exceeded those of CH4 in both pelagic and littoral zones. In both years, emission peaks occurred in early spring and late autumn, but were considerably higher in 2010, which caused a more than twenty times higher net efflux. Annual differences in carbon emission were mostly accounted for by variable pelagic CO2 fluxes caused by different ice and snow conditions in spring and phytoplankton growth patterns in summer and autumn. On an annual basis, carbon uptake predominated over release in the pelagic zone in 2009, whereas an opposite balance occurred in 2010. An almost continuous emission from the helophyte zone outbalanced the pelagic uptake in 2009, resulting in a positive net efflux from the lake as a whole. In 2010, when the pelagic area was also mostly emitting carbon, the efflux from the helophyte zone constituted 36% of the total. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the pelagic flux of CO2 could be best described by opposite changes in phytoplankton biomass and pH (R-2 = 0.68), whereas the best descriptors for the whole lake methane emission (R-2 = 0.52) were sediment temperature (positive), saturation level of dissolved oxygen and depth (both negative). Strong annual differences in net C emissions of Vortsjarv confirm the necessity of inclusion longer observation period, compared to widely used one year/ice-free period, in cases of lakes in climate zones with large seasonal variabilities. The results also confirm the need for including GHG emissions from helophytes (e.g. Phragmites australis) to the lake's net GHG budget, even if they cover a relatively small area.

In this manuscript, we used high throughput sequencing technology and the water analysis method to analyze the bacterial community characteristics of YPS and the water environment, respectively. The results showed that the concentration of total nitrogen (1.47 similar to 1.84 mg/L) and total phosphorus (0.14 similar to 0.18 mg/L) reached the discharge standard of freshwater pond aquaculture water, and the concentrations of ammonia (0.10 similar to 0.95 mg/L) and nitrite (3.85 similar to 6.68 mu g/L) were lower than those in traditional ponds, which was suitable for the growth of Pelteobagrus fulvidraco. At the phylum level, Actinobacteria (35.68%), Firmicutes (24.58%), Proteobacteria (23.49%) and Bacteroidetes (6.59%) were the dominant phyla. The abundance of genus had obvious seasonal variation characteristics. In spring (April), Limnohabitans (8.01%) was the dominant genus; in early summer (June), Exiguobacterium (23.44%), Planococcus (22.27%), Paenisporosarcina (16.81%) and Planomicrobium (5.85%) were the dominant genera; at the end of summer (August), hgcI_clade (21.84%) and CL500_29 marin_group (4.61%) were the dominant genera; compared with the end of summer, the dominant genera Sporichthyaceae (11.31%) and Sediminibacterium (3.32%) were newly added in autumn (October). The dominant genera in different periods were correlated with dissolved oxygen, water temperature and nitrogen nutrients. With the accumulation of nitrogen nutrients in water, the abundance of metabolic pathways in the bacterial community increased, and the abundance of infectious and immune disease pathways increased. This study provides a theoretical basis for the regulation of YPS.

Such manipulation might be expected to lead to a seasonal variation in abundance and composition of fish and predation pressure on zooplankton, and consequently a seasonal change in the Cladocera populations. In this study, we examined the seasonal dynamics of cladocerans in a subtropical plateau lake in southwestern China, Lake Erh, in which a fishing moratorium was implemented in spring and early summer. Cladocerans showed a bimodal seasonal distribution linked to variations in predation pressure induced by the seasonal fishing moratorium. When predation was low in winter because of cool water temperatures and decreasing fish density, Daphnia galeata appeared in the water column and increased towards spring. The cladoceran peaked in the middle of the fishing moratorium, coinciding with a clear water phase. The feeding rate increased with temperature in the late moratorium, allowing planktivorous fish to strongly suppress large daphnids. Small cladocerans benefited from the reduced competition with large daphnids by increasing their numbers rapidly, which resulted in a second peak of cladocerans in the fishing season.					; pingping, zhao/AAC-9438-2021; Wei, ZhiHong/KPA-7622-2024	Lin, Qiuqi/0000-0002-9643-3665; 													0018-8158					JUN	2013	710	1					73	81		10.1007/s10750-012-1260-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1260-4													WOS:000318170200007

In parallel with the study of picoplankton dynamics (abundance and distribution) in surface waters (0-50 m) of Lakes Geneva, Bourget and Annecy, we used a dilution technique during different seasonal periods in order to assess flagellate- versus virus-induced mortality of heterotrophic bacteria, picocyanobacteria and small eukaryotic phytoplankton. Although it was not always possible to detect a significant vital effect (typically in winter), vital lysis and protozoan grazing could be responsible for tip to 71% of the bacterial mortality (in summer). Viral impact, considered alone, never equalled or exceeded predation fir heterotrophic bacteria, but could for picocyanobacteria, typically in. autumn. In addition, during summer; complex interactions between gazing- and virus-induced mortality of bacteria (e.g synergism versus antagonism) could be highlighted (for instance with bacterial lysis susceptible to enhance picocyanobacterial growth). The temporal variations observed for experimental viral parasitism, and flagellate predation were consistent with the in situ dynamics and statistical relationships found between the targeted communities. This study thus provides new evidence on the critical role played by viruses and small flagellates in the functioning of freshwater microbial food webs and also that these mortality processes vary strongly throughout the seasons.

Evidence of in situ microbial activity and sulphidogenesis in perennially sub-0 A°C and hypersaline sediments of a high Arctic permafrost spring	EXTREMOPHILES												The lost hammer (LH) spring perennially discharges subzero hypersaline reducing brines through thick layers of permafrost and is the only known terrestrial methane seep in frozen settings on Earth. The present study aimed to identify active microbial communities that populate the sediments of the spring outlet, and verify whether such communities vary seasonally and spatially. Microcosm experiments revealed that the biological reduction of sulfur compounds (SR) with hydrogen (e.g., sulfate reduction) was potentially carried out under combined hypersaline and subzero conditions, down to -20 A degrees C, the coldest temperature ever recorded for SR. Pyrosequencing analyses of both 16S rRNA (i.e., cDNA) and 16S rRNA genes (i.e., DNA) of sediments retrieved in late winter and summer indicated fairly stable bacterial and archaeal communities at the phylum level. Potentially active bacterial and archaeal communities were dominated by clades related to the T78 Chloroflexi group and Halobacteria species, respectively. The present study indicated that SR, hydrogenotrophy (possibly coupled to autotrophy), and short-chain alkane degradation (other than methane), most likely represent important, previously unaccounted for, metabolic processes carried out by LH microbial communities. Overall, the obtained findings provided additional evidence that the LH system hosts active communities of anaerobic, halophilic, and cryophilic microorganisms despite the extreme conditions in situ.																			1431-0651	1433-4909				JAN	2015	19	1					1	15		10.1007/s00792-014-0703-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00792-014-0703-4								25381577					WOS:000346657500001
J	Thorne, R; Arain, MA				Thorne, Robin; Arain, M. Altaf			Influence of Low Frequency Variability on Climate and Carbon Fluxes in a Temperate Pine Forest in Eastern Canada	FORESTS												Carbon, water and energy exchanges between forests and the atmosphere depend upon seasonal dynamics of both temperature and precipitation, which are influenced by low frequency climate oscillations such as: El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Arctic Oscillation (AO), Eastern Pacific Oscillation (EPO) and the Pacific-North American (PNA). This study investigated the influence of climate oscillations on the local climate and carbon fluxes in a 75-year old temperate pine (Pinus strobus L.) forest, near Lake Erie in southern Ontario, Canada. Analyses indicated mean winter temperatures were correlated to NAO, AO and EPO, total winter precipitation was influenced by PNA and AO, while total snowfall was correlated with PNA and ENSO. These impacts influenced carbon dynamics of the forest during the winter and spring seasons. The EPO had a significant inverse correlation with winter and spring carbon fluxes, while the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) was significantly correlated with winter respiration. In 2012, an extreme warm event linked to climate oscillations raised temperatures and resulted in a large release of carbon from the forest due to higher ecosystem respiration. As low frequency climate oscillations are important drivers of extreme weather events, affecting their intensity, frequency and spatial patterns, they can cause large changes in carbon exchanges in forest ecosystems in the northeastern parts of North America.

J	Qiu, XP; Huang, TL; Zeng, MZ				Qiu, Xiaopeng; Huang, Tinglin; Zeng, Mingzheng			Differences in phytoplankton dynamics and community structure between a wet year and dry year in the Zhoucun Reservoir	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Rainfall-induced nutrient fluctuations in surface water affect phytoplankton communities and cause algal blooms. To examine this influence in the Zhoucun Reservoir, China, field surveys were performed weekly or biweekly from February 2013 (a wet year) to December 2014 (a dry year). Physical conditions, nutrient levels, and phytoplankton functional groups were investigated during monitoring. Nutrient levels increased in the summer of 2013 (TN: 0.85-2.66 mg/L; TP: 0.037-0.138 mg/L), while nitrogen deficiency occurred in the summer of 2014 (TN: 0.38-0.73 mg/L, TP: 0.044-0.079 mg/L). A cyanobacteria bloom that appeared in the summer of 2013 had the dominant phytoplankton functional groups M and Tc. In the summer of 2014, algal cell density and biomass were much lower than those during the corresponding period in 2013, and the co-dominant phytoplankton groups were F, L-0, Tc, and S2. Non-N-fixing cyanobacteria were not abundant in summer 2013 probably because of the low ratio of NO3- to NH4+, although nitrogen was also deficient. In contrast to these summer trends, little difference was noted between phytoplankton dynamics and community structure in the two winters and two springs, regardless of nutrient conditions. Redundancy analysis indicated that rainfall-induced nitrogen fluctuations were the primary factor causing phytoplankton dynamics to differ between the wet and dry year. The effects of water temperature, stratification, and light on the phytoplankton community were independent of nutrient fluctuations. This study shows that rainfall fluctuations change summer nutrient conditions and that cyanobacteria blooms are likely to occur in wet years in the Zhoucun Reservoir.

J	Moyo, NAG				Moyo, NAG			The feeding habits of Sargochromis codringtonii in Lake Kariba, Zimbabwe	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The food of adult Sargochromis codringtonii in Lake Kariba was dominated by prosobranch snails with pulmonate snails forming an insignificant dietary component. S. codringtonii does not show particular preference for any snail species, feeding on those species that are readily available. Morphometrical analysis of the feeding structures of S. codringtonii showed that the fish is well adapted to handling a molluscivorous diet. The pharyngeal jaws with their flat crowned teeth are well adapted to crushing molluscs. The daily food consumption rate of S. codringtonii was estimated over different seasons. Estimates of food consumption indicate that the fish consumed 13.96% of their dry body weight per day in summer falling to 4.46% in winter. The low consumption of pulmonate snails suggests that S. codringtonii can not be a successful biological control agent against the vectors of schistosomiasis.																			0018-8158					JUL	2004	522	1-3					321	327		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000029966.30531.15	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000029966.30531.15													WOS:000221806500020
J	Andersen, J				Andersen, J.			Winter quarters of wetland ground beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae) in South Scandinavia	JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION												Sites at various distances from eutrophic and mesotrophic lakes and fens on the island A-land in southern Sweden were systematically surveyed in summer (May-August) and autumn (late September-October) to elucidate the hibernation sites of wetland carabid beetles. Thirty-five of 47 wetland species were found in their winter quarters. In areas a parts per thousand currency sign50 m from the lakes and fens, the observed as well as the estimated number of hibernating wetland species was higher in mesic to dry sites than in wet or moist open sites. Very few overwintering beetles were detected far (a parts per thousand yen120 m) from the water. There was no significant difference in the frequencies of macropterous and dimorphic (brachypterous) species and individuals hibernating close to, and more distantly from, water. Individuals of small species hibernated closer to water than larger ones. At least in Scandinavia, there is no convincing evidence that wetland species hibernate far away from water, migrating by flight. A considerable number of the species that were collected in their winter quarters are rare and red- listed in at least one of the Scandinavian countries. Winter quarters situated in mesic and dry meadows and woodland close to lakes and fens had the highest number of red-listed species. Therefore, it is of fundamental importance to protect such sites. Threats to the integrity of the current habitats are logging and various transformations of meadows, e.g. digging and removal of large objects such as stones. Cessation of grazing by cattle may also have a negative effect.																			1366-638X					DEC	2011	15	6					799	810		10.1007/s10841-011-9378-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-011-9378-7													WOS:000296881600005

Nutrient excretion by fish supports a variable but significant proportion of lake primary productivity over 15 years	ECOLOGY												Animals play an important and sometimes overlooked role in nutrient cycling. The role of animals in nutrient cycling is spatially and temporally variable, but few studies have evaluated the long-term importance of animal-mediated nutrient cycling in meeting nutrient demand by primary producers. We quantified the proportion of phytoplankton nutrient (phosphorus, P) demand met by excretion by gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) in a eutrophic reservoir where this species dominates fish biomass. From 2000 to 2014, gizzard shad excretion supported a variable proportion of phytoplankton P demand, averaging 7-27% among years over the growing season (spring and summer). Temporal patterns emerged, as gizzard shad consistently supported a higher proportion of demand during summer (mean 31%) than spring (8%). In spring, the proportion of demand met from gizzard shad excretion was best predicted by gizzard shad population biomass, stream discharge, and temperature. In summer, this proportion was best predicted only by biomass of the young-of-year (YOY) gizzard shad. Thus, variation in YOY shad biomass significantly alters nutrient supply, and future studies should explore the long-term role of animal population dynamics in nutrient cycling. Our study shows that several years of data are needed to perform a critical evaluation of the importance of animals in meeting ecosystem nutrient demand.

Assessment of the water quality, the human health risk, and heavy metal accumulation in Nile tilapia and African catfish collected from the Kitchener Drain-Egypt	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												The water running in Kitchener Drain, the longest in Egypt, is sourced from agriculture and industries with many pollutants such as toxic minerals, chemicals, pesticides, and insecticides. This study assesses the water quality, human health risk, and heavy metal accumulation in Nile tilapia and African catfish from the Kitchener Drain-Egypt over the four seasons. Water and fish samples were collected from the Kitchener Drain during four seasons from April 2021 to March 2022. Markedly higher levels of Fe, Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr, and Mn were detected in the water samples during summer than in winter, spring, and autumn. Further, the presence of heavy metals in the water samples followed the sequence of Fe > Mn > Zn > Pb > Cu > Cr regardless of seasonality. In Nile tilapia, the sequence of heavy metals collected from the Kitchener Drain during the four seasons is Fe > Zn > Cu > Pb > Cr > Mn. In African catfish, all detected heavy metals in the muscle vary significantly during the different seasons and follow the sequence of Fe > Zn > Pb > Cr > Mn > Cu. Consequently, Fe, Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr, and Mn were present in African catfish >Nile tilapia. The estimated daily intakes (EDI) for Nile tilapia followed the sequence of Fe > Zn > Cu > Pb > Mn > Cr and for African catfish Fe > Zn > Pb > Cu > Cr > Mn regardless of seasonality. Based on the target hazard quotients (THQ) and hazard index (HI) of Nile tilapia and African catfish, it is evident that consuming their flesh may cause a health risk. Further, the differences in the levels of detected heavy metals in Nile tilapia and African catfish during the four seasons indicate that these results depend on the fish species and seasonality.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

J	Chen, CY; Folt, CL				Chen, CY; Folt, CL			Ecophysiological responses to warming events by two sympatric zooplankton species	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Under current climate change scenarios, numerous lakes are predicted to experience increases in maximum temperatures and in the timing, frequency and duration of heat waves. To investigate the effects of the magnitude and timing of thermal stress on zooplankton communities we compared the thermal responses and seasonal phenologies of two sympatric species, Epischura lacustris and Daphnia catawba. Thermal responses were measured in the laboratory as differences in demography of field animals at temperatures characteristic of temperate takes in spring, summer and autumn (15-30degreesC). Epischura lacustris had a significantly lower temperature tolerance than D. catawba, which appears to explain differences in their seasonal phenologies. Divergence in thermal tolerances and seasonal phenologies of these sympatric species strongly suggests that the response of the Zooplankton communi, in this lake to warming events will differ greatly with the timing and severity of the thermal stress. Similar effects are to be expected in other lakes containing these species and other zooplankton communities.					; Cheng, Chao-Neng/GXG-0587-2022	Sun, Sunny/0000-0002-3661-4448; Su, Wu-Chou/0000-0003-2953-4105													0142-7873					JUN	2002	24	6					579	589		10.1093/plankt/24.6.579	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/24.6.579								12368701					WOS:000176796300004

Isotopic (δ2Hf) evidence of "loop migration" and use of the Gulf of Maine Flyway by both western and eastern breeding populations of Blackpoll Warblers	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY												Declining numbers of Blackpoll Warblers (Setophaga striata) have been documented at long-term migration monitoring sites as well as in breeding areas. However, the "loop migration" of Blackpoll Warblers makes it difficult to ascribe population change at migration monitoring sites to specific breeding populations. Individuals from all populations across the breeding range of Blackpoll Warblers concentrate in fall along the Atlantic coastline of eastern North America prior to initiating a transoceanic flight to wintering areas. In spring, Blackpoll Warblers return along a different route, moving north into the southeastern United States where birds from eastern and western breeding populations then diverge during migration to reach their respective breeding areas. To monitor breeding populations outside of breeding areas and identify factors potentially affecting those populations, we must be able to identify where birds captured during migration breed and map seasonal variation in population-specific flyways. To "map" population-specific migration movements of Blackpoll Warblers, we used feather deuterium (delta H-2(f)) values and a spatially explicit model to assign molt origins of 289 Blackpoll Warblers moving through sites in the Gulf of Maine (GOM) region and at three locations further west and south (northern Great Lakes area, Pennsylvania, and Florida). The assignment method was validated with feather samples from 35 birds captured during the breeding season at Churchill, Manitoba, Canada. As predicted, the spatial pattern of movement within and between seasons reflected "loop migration." Blackpoll Warblers captured during fall migration in the GOM region included birds from across their breeding range, whereas birds captured during the spring were exclusively from northeastern populations. During fall migration, Blackpoll Warblers captured at two sites west of the GOM were from breeding areas further northwest than those from western Canada that were captured in the GOM. Blackpoll Warblers captured in eastern Florida during spring migration were assigned exclusively to breeding areas in the northeast, suggesting that eastern and western populations diverge soon after entering the United States. Finally, most Blackpoll Warblers sampled at Manomet Bird Observatory originated from breeding populations in Alaska and western Canada that have shown a similar (70-90%) decline over the same period. Our results, therefore, not only document the "loop migration" pattern of Blackpoll Warblers, but, by mapping patterns of connectivity between breeding and non-breeding areas, may help target conservation efforts for breeding populations of Blackpoll Warblers where most needed.

The time at large and movement of 505 recoveries, mostly lake whitefish, Coregonus clupeaformis, and lake trout, Cristivomer namaycush, are analyzed. Most of the tagged fish were caught in the summer commercial fishery; returns during the fall and winter were scarce. The median recapture time was 268 days; the maximum, for a lake trout, was 4027 days. Movement was generally limited; its median was 5 statute miles (8 km). A few fish travelled relatively long distances. There was no overall directional pattern to the movement, but some aggregation of the recaptured fish was noted. The fish populations are regarded as sedentary rather than mobile.																									1963	20	2					319	326		10.1139/f63-028	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f63-028													WOS:A1963WV54200007
J	Lafortune, V; Filion, L; Hétu, B				Lafortune, Violaine; Filion, Louise; Hetu, Bernard			Impacts of Holocene climatic variations on alluvial fan activity below snowpatches in subarctic Quebec	GEOMORPHOLOGY												In the Lake Guillaume-Delisle area of subarctic Quebec, storm-generated alluvial falls have been active sporadically throughout the Holocene. In this study, we propose that the persistence of late-lying snowpatches in fail catchments during Holocene cold episodes promoted alluvial fan activity by lowering the precipitation threshold required to trigger a torrential event. This hypothesis was tested by characterizing the depositional processes responsible for alluvial fail formation below snowpatches, and by reconstructing the Holocene alluvial fail activity. Stratigraphic and sedimentary analyses conducted on seven alluvial fans revealed that they were deposited by torrential activity leading to waterlaid, transient. or hyperconcentrated deposition. The chronology of the storm-generated alluvial fans - based on 22 radiocarbon dates - indicates that torrential activity was enhanced during the cooler Late Holocene (i.e., after ca. 3500 cal. yr BP). Snowier winters and cooler summers were beneficial to nival activity. allowing the persistence of larger snowpatches throughout the summer and fall seasons. Rainfall-induced thaw Of Such snowpatches during rainstorm events is inferred to have contributed to alluvial fan activity by increasing water availability. Three peaks of alluvial activity occurred during the Late Holocene (2950-2750. 1900-1400, and 800-300 cal. yr BP) and are indicative of increased storminess resulting in higher fail activity. Increased fan activity during cooler episodes was concurrent with increased runoff activity in the immediate pronival area. This stresses the importance of nivation below snowpatches and pinpoints the role of nivation in enhancing geomorphological activity during period of cooler and more humid climate in subarctic environments.

Winter Lake Breezes near the Great Salt Lake	BOUNDARY-LAYER METEOROLOGY												Case studies of lake breezes during wintertime cold air pools in Utah's Salt Lake Valley are examined. While summer breezes originating from the Great Salt Lake are typically deeper, of longer duration, and have higher wind speeds than winter breezes, the rate of inland penetration and cross-frontal temperature differences can be higher during the winter. The characteristics of winter breezes and the forcing mechanisms controlling them (e.g., snow cover, background flow, vertical stability profile, clouds, lake temperature, lake sheltering, and drainage pooling) are more complex and variable than those evident in summer. During the afternoon in the Salt Lake Valley, these lake breezes can lead to elevated pollution levels due to the transport of fine particle pollutants from over the Great Salt Lake, decreased vertical mixing depth, and increased vertical stability.

Additionally flux estimates from the period 1986-1990 were compared to those of the period 1981-1985 in order detect possible trends. The results suggest that in coastal regions with high proportions of agricultural land and with low lake percentage, the nutrient losses from agricultural areas mostly enter coastal waters with negligible retention in river channels. The net effect of the various processes in the rivers is small because most of the nutrient losses occur in spring, fall or early winter in connection with high water flows and current velocities, short residence times of water and low intensities of biogeochemical processes. Nitrogen losses from agriculture has probably increased during the 1980s due to increased winter flows and increased use of nitrogen fertilizers. The results indicate that nitrogen loading of the southern and south-western coastal waters of Finland has increased as well.					; Bleeker, Albert/A-1786-2010	Bleeker, Albert/0000-0002-7680-5839; 													0029-1277						1995	26	1					55	72																WOS:A1995QQ86400004
J	Purdy, CW; Straus, DC; Clark, N				Purdy, CW; Straus, DC; Clark, N			Diversity of Salmonella serovars in feedyard and nonfeedyard playas of the Southern High Plains in the summer and winter	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH												Objective-To compare Salmonella isolates cultured from feedyard and nonfeedyard (control) playas (ie, temporary shallow lakes) of the Southern High Plains. Sample Population-Water and muck (sediment) samples were obtained from 7 feedyard playas and 3 nonfeedyard playas in the winter and summer. Procedure-Each water and muck sample was enriched with sulfur-brilliant-green broth and incubated in a shaker at 37degreesC for 24 hours. A sample (100 mL) of the incubated bacterial-enriched broth was then mixed with 100 mL of fresh sulfur-brilliant-green enrichment broth and incubated in a shaker at 37degreesC for 24 hours. After the second incubation, a swab sample was streaked on differential media. Suspect Salmonella isolates were further identified by use of biochemical tests, and Salmonella isolates were confirmed and serovar determinations made. Results-Salmonella isolates were not recovered from the 3 control playas. Seven Salmonella enterica serovars were isolated from 5 of 7 feedyard playas in the summer, and 13 S enterica serovars were isolated from 7 of 7 feedyard playas in the winter. In the summer, 296 isolates were cultured, and 47 were Salmonella organisms. In the winter, 288 isolates were cultured, and 171 were Salmonella organisms. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results indicated that feedyard playas are frequently contaminated with many Salmonella serovars. These pathogens should be considered whenever feedyard managers contemplate the use of water from these playas. Water from feedyard playas should not be used to cool cattle in the summer or for dust abatement.																			0002-9645					JAN	2004	65	1					40	44		10.2460/ajvr.2004.65.40	http://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.2004.65.40								14719700					WOS:000187500100006

Availability of the micronutrient iron is known to influence marine SCML, but iron has not been explored in detail as a factor in the development of freshwater SCML. This study investigates the relationship between dissolved iron and the SCML within the dimictic, ferruginous lake Grosses Heiliges Meer in northern Germany. The occurrence of the SCML under nonferruginous conditions in the spring and ferruginous conditions in the fall are context to explore temporal changes in the phytoplankton community and indicators of primary productivity. Results indicate that despite more abundant chlorophyll in the spring, the SCML sits below a likely primary productivity maximum within the epilimnion, inferred based on colocated dissolved oxygen, delta C-13(DIC), and pH maxima. The peak amount of chlorophyll in the SCML is lower in the fall than in the spring, but in the fall the SCML is colocated with elevated dissolved iron concentrations and a local delta C-13(DIC) maximum. Cyanobacteria and Chlorophyta have elevated abundances within the SCML in the fall. Further investigation of the relationship of iron to primary productivity within ferruginous SCML may help to understand the environmental controls on primary productivity in past ferruginous oceans.

J	Karki, D; Verma, A				Karki, Dhanusha; Verma, Anuya			Assessment of heavy metal contamination within the sediments in some fresh water lakes of Udaipur	EQA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Heavy metal concentrations were assessed in sediment samples collected from three lakes of Udaipur, Rajasthan. The aim of the present investigation was to compare the lakes for season wise addition of pollution load. The assessment of heavy metals was done using Contamination factor (CF), Geo accumulation index (Igeo) and Pollution load index (PLI). In summer CF varied from 0.01 to 7.43 i.e low to very high but in winter season all three lakes represented high CF factor. Likewise Igeo index in the sediments for summer ranged between 0.41 to 14.48 mg/kg i.e uncontaminated to moderate to heavy to extreme levels in sediments of lakes and trends were of the order Mn>Zn>Pb>Ni>Cu>Cd. In winter Igeo index ranged between 1.34 to 19.3 mg/kg which is uncontaminated to extreme contamination in bottom sediments and trends were of the order Mn>Zn>Pb>Ni>Cu>Cd. Pollution load index in winter season represented high value i.e more than 1 in both Dudh Talai and Udai Sagar Lake. The proposed study suggested that heavy metal accumulation in sediments during winter was higher than summer season. This has a very significant relevance where the contaminated sediments have one of the most challenging pollution issues ow-ning to the toxicity persistence and bioaccumulation issues of food web.																			2039-9898	2281-4485					2021	46						37	45		10.6092/issn.2281-4485/13351	http://dx.doi.org/10.6092/issn.2281-4485/13351													WOS:000710022600001

This collapse was preceded by oligotrophication, when phosphorus concentrations declined by 25%. Conservation measures from 2009 to 2015 partially improved the population from 2015, but pikeperch biomass did not reach previous levels. Unsuccessful spawning and low survival of pikeperch fry were suspected as possible reasons. Pelagic trawling for pikeperch younger juveniles in June and older juveniles in August indicated that extreme mortality in the first year of life, rather than limited spawning, was the reason for low pikeperch recruitment. Large interannual differences in pikeperch density were observed in both spring and summer, and the growth was generally low. Pikeperch fry density changed over a trophic gradient with the highest densities in the eutrophic upper reservoir parts, while differences between depths were much less pronounced due to the lack of temperature and oxygen depth stratification in summer. Oligotrophication of the reservoir in recent years is probably partly responsible for the high mortality and slow growth of pikeperch fry that are still zooplanktivorous, resulting in a lower probability of surviving their first winter. Given the changing conditions in the reservoir, measures should be taken to strictly conserve populations to maintain self-sustaining pikeperch populations in the Lipno Reservoir.

J	Kumari, A; Kulshrestha, U				Kumari, Anita; Kulshrestha, Umesh			Trace ambient levels of particulate mercury and its sources at a rural site near Delhi	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY												Atmospheric particle-bound mercury levels were measured in PM10 aerosols (HgP) at a rural site (Mahasar, Haryana) during winter 2014-15 and summer 2015. The PM10 HgP was determined byusing Differential Pulse Anodic Stripping Voltammetry through standard addition methods while the trace metals were determined by using an Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. The mass concentrations of HgP varied from 591 to 1533pg/m(3) with an average of 1009 +/- 306pg/m(3) during the winter, while the mass concentrations of HgP varied from 43 to 826pg/m(3) with an average of 320 +/- 228pg/m(3) during the summer. However, it is difficult to assess whether these levels are harmful or not because there is no standard value available as National Ambient Air Quality Standard. The higher concentrations of HgP during winters were possibly due to favourable local meteorological conditions for the stagnation of particulate matter in the lower atmosphere and the increased emissions from existing natural or anthropogenic sources, regional sources and long-range transportation. Relatively low concentrations of HgP during summer might be due to increased mixing heights as well as scavenging effect because some light to heavy rain events were observed during summer time sampling. However, among other metals determined, the concentration of HgP was the lowest during both the seasons. The study may be useful in assessing the health impacts of PM10 HgP and other metals.

Evaluation of treatment performance for one constructed wetland in a Swedish forest-A case study with emphasis on brownification mitigation	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Brownification refers to the increase in water colour reported in many freshwater systems. Constructed wetlands (CW) are commonly used for pollutant mitigation, including the causes of brownification. This study aimed to investigate the effects of a CW established in a forest area with high colour and low pH on its capability to reduce nutrient and colour. The inflow and outflow colour (mg Pt/L), total organic carbon (TOC), and iron (Fe) were assessed daily over a period of recorded dynamic flows during spring and autumn 2019 (15 and 19 days, respectively). Total nitrogen (Ntot) and phosphorus (Ptot) were also assessed to verify the removal efficiency of this mature constructed wetland. The prevailing hydraulic retention time (HRT) was assessed using conservative tracing. The results showed that the colour, TOC, and Fe were not reduced during the evaluation period. In contrast, while colour did not change (4-8% increase) over the assessed periods, TOC and iron significantly increased by 7.7% and 29.5%, respectively, during spring (4.2% and 10.6% during autumn). As Ntot and Ptot increased by 14.8% and 120%, respectively, during spring (7.4% and 8.8% during autumn), we concluded that constructed wetlands designed for nutrient control offer little potential for the mitigation of brownification, as expressed by colour, under low pH conditions.																			0925-8574	1872-6992				SEP	2023	194								107056	10.1016/j.ecoleng.2023.107056	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2023.107056		JUL 2023											WOS:001046096500001
J	STODDARD, JL				STODDARD, JL			MICRONUTRIENT AND PHOSPHORUS LIMITATION OF PHYTOPLANKTON ABUNDANCE IN GEM LAKE, SIERRA-NEVADA, CALIFORNIA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Nutrient addition experiments conducted during the ice-free seasons of 1983 and 1984 in Gem Lake, an alpine lake in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, indicate that algal biomass is limited by phosphorus, in combination with iron or copper. Phosphorus additions were always required to stimulate growth, but did not do so when phosphorus was the only nutrient added. Simultaneous additions of phosphorus and iron resulted in increased levels of chlorophyll, particulate carbon, particulate nitrogen and particulate phosphorus. Simultaneous additions of phosphorus and copper resulted in increases in chlorophyll, particulate nitrogen and particulate phosphorus, not in particulate carbon. Neither iron nor copper by itself stimulated growth. Particulate N:P ratios from all seasons in Gem Lake suggest that simultaneous micronutrient and phosphorus limitation exists throughout the summer, when nutrient and biomass levels remain low; limitation by phosphorus alone may appear in the fall and spring, when biomass and major ion concentrations increase dramatically.					; Stoddard, John/H-5594-2013	Stoddard, John/0000-0002-2537-6130; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV 16	1987	154						103	111		10.1007/BF00026834	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00026834													WOS:A1987K536700009
J	Jiang, JG; Wu, SG; Shen, YF				Jiang, Jian-Guo; Wu, Sheng-Gui; Shen, Yun-Fen			Effects of seasonal succession and water pollution on the protozoan community structure in an eutrophic lake	CHEMOSPHERE												The purpose of the research is to study the seasonal succession of protozoa community and the effect of water quality on the protozoa community to characterize biochemical processes occurring at a eutrophic Lake Donghu, a large shallow lake in Wuhan City, China. Samples of protozoa communities were obtained monthly at three stations by PFU (polyurethane foam unit) method over a year. Synchronously, water samples also were taken from the stations for the water chemical quality analysis. Six major variables were examined in a principal component analysis (PCA), which indicate the fast changes of water quality in this station I and less within-year variation and a comparatively stable water quality in stations II and III. The community data were analyzed using multivariate techniques, and we show that clusters are rather mixed and poorly separated, suggesting that the community structure is changing gradually, giving a slight merging of clusters form the summer to the autumn and the autumn to the winter. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to infer the relationship between water quality variables and phytoplankton community structure, which changed substantially over the survey period. From the analysis of cluster and CCA, coupled by community pollution value (CPV), it is concluded that the key factors driving the change in protozoa community composition in Lake Donghu was water qualities rather than seasons.

Current State of Lake Kotokel (Eastern Cisbaikalia, Russia): Hydrochemical Characteristics, Water Quality, and Trophic Status	WATER												Lake Kotokel, the largest lake on the eastern shore of Lake Baikal, has historically served as an important fishery and recreational resource. However, it underwent an ecological crisis and a Haff disease outbreak in 2008-2009. Hydraulic engineering interventions were subsequently implemented, and the lake was closed to tourism and fishing for an extended period. This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of Lake Kotokel's water level fluctuations from 1985 to 2022 and evaluates hydrochemical data collected between 2015 and 2024. A comparative assessment of the seasonal variability in Lake Kotokel's condition during 2023-2024 and 2008-2009 was conducted using various water quality indices, including the Russian Specific Combinatorial Water Pollution Index (SCWPI) and Basic Anthropogenic Load Index (ALI), as well as the international National Sanitation Foundation Water Quality Index (NSF-WQI) and Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Water Quality Index (CCME-WQI). Trophic state indices, such as Carlson's Trophic State Index (CTSI) and the Trophic Index (TRIX), were also applied. The analysis revealed a seasonal decline in water quality, transitioning from pure ("excellent") and "light eutrophic" index classifications in spring to polluted ("marginal") and "hypertrophic" index classifications in summer and autumn. This study demonstrated that a combination of unfavorable factors, including significant lake-level fluctuations, prolonged high temperatures during the vegetative period, and the discharge of fracture-vein waters, led to a sharp decline in water quality and an increase in the lake's trophic status. Elevated levels of iron, manganese, COD, pH, and ammonium detected in water samples in 2024, alongside incidents of fry mortality in spring and summer and intense algal blooms, raise concerns as they may signal a potential recurrence of Haff disease in the lake.

It is fed by springs located on its eastern and northern boundaries. These springs discharge groundwater from a volcanic aquifer. Arid conditions dominate in the area, with average precipitation less than 200 mm/year. The tritium content in some groundwater samples shows the contribution of modern recharge to the total groundwater flow. Recharge occurs by infiltration of snowmelt in the austral winter months and to a lesser extent by short but intense precipitation events during the summer. The vertical gradients of rainfall isotopic content (delta O-18, delta H-2) and precipitation points to the recharge zone of the springs being located at the northern area of the lake, above 4,900 m a.s.l. along the slopes of the Tuyajto volcano, whereas recharge to the springs discharging on the eastern area of the lake originates in the adjacent basins of Pampa Colorada and Pampa Las Tecas at altitudes between 4,400 and 4,700 m a.s.l. The water of these springs may contain measurable tritium. The chemical composition of groundwater is the result of meteoric water evaporation processes, high temperature water-rock interaction and dissolution of buried old salt flat deposits. The groundwater flow is shallow, due to the presence of a regional low permeability ignimbrite formation that precludes the formation of deep convective groundwater flow cells due to the high density of brines. At a local scale, the Tuyajto lake behaves as a flow-through system with respect to the regional groundwater flow. The persistence of the springs is essential for the existence of the brine sheet and maintaining the ecological conditions for the waterfowl.

The specific biogenic carbonate records confirm the major shifts already visible in the continuous bulk-carbonate oxygen-isotope record (delta(18)O(Cc)). If corrected for their vital offsets, oxygen-isotope ratios of Pisidium and juvenile P. marchica, both formed in summer, are almost identical to delta(18)O(Cc). This bulk carbonate is mainly composed of encrustations of benthic macrophythes (Chain ssp.), also mainly produced during summer. Adult P. marchica, which calcify in winter, show consistently higher delta(18)O, larger shifts across both transitions, and short positive excursions compared with the summer forms, especially during early Preboreal. Despite such complexity, the delta(18)O of adult P. marchica probably reflects more accurately the variations of the delta(18)O of former lake water because, during winter, calcification temperatures are less variable and the water column isotopically uniform. The difference between normalised delta(18)O of calcite precipitated in winter to that formed in summer can be used to estimate the minimum difference between summer and winter water temperatures. In general, the results indicate warmer summers during the late Allerod and early Preboreal compared with the Younger Dryas. Altogether, the isotopic composition of lake water (delta(18)O(L)) and of the dissolved inorganic carbonate (delta(13)C(DIC)) reconstructed from adult Pseudocandona marchica, as well as the seasonal water temperature contrasts, indicate that the major shifts in the delta(18)O of local precipitation at Gerzensee were augmented by changes of the lake's water balance, with relatively higher evaporative loss occurring during the Allerod compared with the Younger Dryas. It is possible that during the early Preboreal the lake might even have been hydrologically closed for a short period. We speculate that such hydrologic changes reflect a combination of varying evapotranspiration and a rearrangement of groundwater recharge during those climatic shifts. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Tiger Muskellunge Growth, Condition, Diet, and Effect on Northern Pikeminnow at Curlew Lake, Washington	MUSKELLUNGE MANAGEMENT: FIFTY YEARS OF COOPERATION AMONG ANGLERS, SCIENTISTS, AND FISHERIES BIOLOGISTS	American Fisheries Society Symposium				Hugh C Becker Memorial Muskie Symposium: 50 Years of Cooperation - Anglers, Science and Management	MAR 13-15, 2016	Minnetonka, MN	Hugh C Becker Fdn, Muskies Inc, Amer Fisheries Soc, N Central Div, Esocid Tech Comm				Tiger muskellunge (Muskellunge Esox masquinongy x Northern Pike E. lucius) growth, condition, and diet, as well as the effect of stocking on Northern Pikeminnow Ptychocheilus oregonensis, were studied at Curlew Lake, Washington from 2001 to 2006. Curlew Lake (373 ha) was stocked with tiger muskellunge beginning in 1998 to reduce an overabundant Northern Pike minnow population and to create a unique trophy fishery. Historically, Curlew Lake had provided good fishing opportunity for stocked Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, as well as naturally reproducing Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides and Smallmouth Bass M dolomieu. The quality of trout fishing, however, had declined throughout the 1990s, commensurate with anecdotal observations of increased numbers of Northern Pikeminnow in the sport catch. To monitor changes in species relative abundance, the lake was sampled annually in the fall with standardized boat electrofishing surveys. Additionally, the lake was sampled by boat electrofishing monthly, from spring through fall, to collect tiger muskellunge diet samples by gastric lavage. Rainbow Trout and Northern Pikeminnow were the most important prey species for tiger muskellunge in Curlew Lake while Largemouth Bass were a distant third. Diet varied seasonally, with Rainbow Trout being the most important prey during spring, while Northern Pikeminnow was most important in summer. Both Rainbow Trout and Northern Pikeminnow were important in the fall. The relative abundance of Northern Pikeminnow in Curlew Lake significantly declined over the duration of the study. The high proportion of Northern Pikeminnow observed in the tiger muskellunge diet analysis indicates that the reduction can be attributed to the added presence of tiger muskellunge to the community. Therefore, the goal of Northern Pikeminnow population reduction through tiger muskellunge introduction (biological control via predation) has been successful. Continued biannual monitoring of the fish community to assess Northern Pikeminnow abundance should provide the necessary data to refine future tiger muskellunge stocking rates in Curlew Lake.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-46-2				2017	85						135	148																WOS:000422891800014

We examined its distribution, history of invasion, and population dynamics in Missouri reservoirs. Surveys detected the species in 7 of 112 reservoirs in 1992 and 11 of 119 reservoirs in 1993. Analysis of quantitative zooplankton samples from two reservoirs over a 7-year period indicated that D. lumholtzi first reached detectable densities in 1990 and persisted during 1991-1993. Population maxima typically occurred in late summer, with the species absent from the plankton during winter and spring. Based on its current distributional patterns, D. lumholtzi appears to be capable of colonizing most reservoirs in the southern regions of North America.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JAN	1995	52	1					151	160		10.1139/f95-015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f95-015													WOS:A1995RG86000015
J	Keljo, KS				Keljo, Kurt S.			Effects of Hydrologic Pulsing and Vegetation on Invertebrate Communities in Wetlands	LAND												Constructed, mitigation wetlands in the midwestern United States are frequently dominated by a Typha spp. monoculture and their hydrologies are often determined by adjustable control structures. Wetlands provide habitat for multiple macroinvertebrate species, which in turn provide food for other organisms inhabiting the wetlands, such as waterfowl. This study examined the impacts of plant diversity and manipulated hydrology on macroinvertebrate communities. Forty 1-m(2) wetland mesocosms were either planted with a monoculture of Typha spp. or with a more diverse plant community of Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani, Juncus effusus, and Sparganium eurycarpum. They were also assigned to one of four hydrologic regimes: steady state, pulsing, deep spring/shallow fall, and shallow spring/deep summer. After one year, macroinvertebrates were sampled in the mesocosms. Mesocosms with deep spring hydrologies were found to have greater taxon diversity than those with other hydrologies, but Chironomidae biomass was the lowest under the deep spring hydrology. Culicidae and Chironomidae were found in higher numbers in mixed vegetation than in Typha spp. Taxon richness and Chironomid biomass were significantly higher in mixed vegetation mesocosms than in Typha spp. monocultures. Results suggest vegetation diversity and hydrological regimes impact macroinvertebrate communities, with potential implications for constructed wetland design and management.																				2073-445X				SEP	2022	11	9							1554	10.3390/land11091554	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land11091554													WOS:000859783000001

A total of 10 types of actinospores were isolated from the oligochaetes Tubifex tubifex and Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri collected during the survey, which could be classified into the triactinomyxon, raabeia and aurantiactinomyxon groups. The drawings depicting the individual actinospore types are presented on a plate and their characteristic dimensions summarised in tables. The prevalence and seasonality of actinosporean infections observed in the two oligochaete species are illustrated graphically. Infection by actinospores showed pronounced seasonality. In the spring and summer the prevalence of triactinomyxon infection in T. tubifex exceeded 30 and 40%, respectively, while in the autumn it dropped to 6%. In T, tubifex raabeia infection of 3% prevalence was detected only in the summer period. In L. hoffmeisteri the peak of aurantiactinomyxon, raabeia and triactinomyxon infection occurred in the summer with a prevalence of 21, 10 and 8%, respectively. Actinosporean infection in the individual Oligochaeta species showed higher prevalence values than had been reported in the literature, which fact may be explained by the novelty of the examination technique used. Four types of actinospores found in Lake Balaton are identical with the actinospores already described. It cannot be determined with absolute certainty which stages of myxosporeans parasitic in Lake Balaton fishes are identical with the 10 actinospores described.

However, the climatic factors sustaining the "green Sahara" are still a matter of debate. Particularly the role of winter precipitation is poorly understood. Using the stable hydrogen isotopic composition ( delta D, where D stands for deuterium) of high molecular weight (HMW) n -alkanoic acids in a marine sediment core from the eastern Mediterranean, we provide a continuous record for winter precipitation in the Nile river delta spanning the past 18 kyr. Pairing the data with delta D records from HMW n -alkanes from the same core, we show that HMW n -alkanoic acids constantly derived from the delta, while the HMW n -alkanes also received significant contributions from the headwaters between similar to 15-1 ka when fluvial runoff enhanced. This enables us to reconstruct the evolution of Mediterranean (winter) and monsoonal (summer) rainfall in the Nile river watershed in parallel. In the delta, the Heinrich stadial 1 (HS1) evolved in two phases, with a dry episode between similar to 17.5-16.0 ka, followed by wet conditions between similar to 16-14.5 ka. Winter rainfall enhanced substantially between 11-6 ka, lagging behind the intensification of the summer monsoon by ca. 3 kyr. Heavy winter rainfall resulted from a southern position of the Atlantic storm track combined with elevated sea surface temperatures in the eastern Mediterranean, reinforcing local cyclogenesis. We show that during the green Sahara, monsoon precipitation and Mediterranean winter rainfall were both enhanced and infer that the winter rainfall zone extended southwards, delivering moisture to the Sahara. Our findings corroborate recent hypotheses suggesting that winter rains that extended southward were a crucial addition to the northward displacement of the summer monsoon in helping to sustain a green Sahara.

J	Wang, XQ; Chen, RS; Yang, Y				Wang, Xiqiang; Chen, Rensheng; Yang, Yong			Effects of Permafrost Degradation on the Hydrological Regime in the Source Regions of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, China	WATER												Climate warming has intensified permafrost degradation, which could have a variety of implications on the hydrological regime in permafrost regions. In this study, we analyzed the effects of permafrost degradation on the hydrological regime via four hydrological variables for 10 unregulated catchments in the source regions of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers. The results demonstrate that catchments with high permafrost coverage are expected to have an increased winter discharge ratio (proportion of winter discharge contribution to total annual flow), a decreased recession coefficient and a decreased ratio of Q(max)/Q(min) due to permafrost degradation. However, the great storage effects of lakes and wetlands, which could contribute to more groundwater instead of direct surface discharge, may affect the hydrological effects of permafrost degradation and result in the abnormal performance at catchment scale. The correlation analysis between summer precipitation (July-September) and the following winter discharge (December-February) indicates that permafrost degradation may affect the redistribution of summer precipitation towards the following winter discharge via increasing the soil storage capacity and delaying the release of water into streams in permafrost regions. However, unlike the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions, no significant changes for the hydrological regime (four hydrological variables) are detected over the individual periods of records for each catchment. Decreased precipitation in summer seems to reduce the water infiltration to supply the groundwater, which weakens the effects of permafrost degradation on the hydrological regime. This study implies that the storage effects of lakes and wetlands and the changes of summer precipitation patterns should be considered in future permafrost hydrological simulations, which have suggested that a large increase in groundwater discharge to streams will likely occur in response to permafrost degradation due to the warming climate in the ideal scenario.

J	Turoczy, NJ				Turoczy, NJ			Calcium chemistry of Blue Lake, Mt Gambier, Australia, and relevance to remarkable seasonal colour changes	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Calcium speciation and other water quality variables in the Blue Lake, Mt Gambier, Australia, were monitored between August 1999 and August 2000 in order to test previously proposed mechanisms for the seasonal colour changes of this lake. The concentration of calcite was found to be highest in winter when the lake appears grey, and lowest in summer when the lake appears blue. A potential component of the colour change mechanism is therefore identified in which the lake is grey in winter because of non-selective scattering of light by calcite particles, and blue in summer because of the absence of absorbing or scattering impurities.																			0003-9136					DEC	2002	156	1					1	9		10.1127/0003-9136/2002/0156-0001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2002/0156-0001													WOS:000180181000001

Characterization of seasonal groundwater origin and evolution processes in a geologically heterogeneous catchment using geophysical, isotopic and hydro-chemical techniques (Lough Gur, Ireland)	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Lough Gur is a shallow groundwater fed eutrophic lake situated within a small agricultural catchment containing volcanic and karst rock features in mid-west Ireland. Seasonally active conduits linking two spring discharge locations from the lake under high flow conditions were revealed using dye tracing and a terrestrial geophysical survey, highlighting the architecture of the conduit flow path from Lough Gur to its discharge spring. A radon survey combined with a lake geophysical survey identified the locations of in-lake discharge springs and thickness of the lakebed sediments. Falling head hydraulic characterization experiments illustrated the heterogenous nature of lakebed sediments and hydrograph analysis coupled with stable isotopes of water (delta O-18 and delta H-2) revealed significant surface water - groundwater interaction during high flow periods. Significantly, delta O-18 and delta H-2 signatures plot above the global meteoric water line and local meteoric water line indicating hydration of silicate minerals and direct isotope exchange of delta O-18 between water and rock minerals. Groundwater delta O-18 and delta H-2 signatures during low flow periods indicate that recharge sources are influenced by enriched surface waters and precipitation while a wider range of signatures during high flow periods indicates a greater variation of sources. D-excess signatures illustrate rapid rainfall infiltration under high flow conditions, thereby demonstrating the vulnerability of the groundwater, while lake water signatures confirm widespread surface water-groundwater interaction/mixing. Hydrochemical analyses confirm both silicate weathering and carbonate dissolution as primary geochemical processes with Mg/Ca ratios suggesting greater groundwater residence time during low flow periods. Correlations between delta C-13(DIC) and dissolved organic carbon suggest a seasonal switch in the source of DIC to groundwaters between the oxidation of organic matter in summer and dissolution of carbonate minerals in winter. The SI saturation index for calcite (SIC) illustrates calcium carbonate precipitation along with CO2 evasion to be a perennial processes. Finally, the spatial variation for nitrate isotopic signatures (delta O-18(NO3-) and delta N-15(NO3-)) suggests a number of nitrate sources to groundwaters including soil organic nitrogen, manure and/or domestic effluent with indications of denitrification processes under low flow conditions.

Impact of extreme spring temperature and summer precipitation events on flowering phenology in a three-year study of the shores of Lake Issaqueena, South Carolina	ECOSCIENCE												This study aimed to investigate the effects of extreme weather events on flowering around Lake Issaqueena (SC, USA) using plant-flowering data collected with Global Positioning System (GPS)-enabled cameras on a monthly basis in 2012, 2013, and 2014. Six species were identified that flowered before and after a late spring test date (30 April) in at least one study year. Sign tests of the consistency of positive or negative differences in the percentages of test species flowering before the late spring test date between years indicated that these test species shifted towards earlier flowering in 2012 (extreme high monthly temperature), but that the consistency of these shifts was only significant when comparing 2012 to 2013. Nine species were identified that flowered before and after a late summer test date (31 August) in at least one study year. Sign tests of the consistency of positive or negative differences in the percentages of test species flowering before the late summer test date between years indicate that these test species shifted towards later flowering in 2013 after two consecutive months of extreme high precipitation in July and August. Warmer spring temperatures can advance flowering, and extreme summer precipitation events can delay flowering.

Microbial mats were investigated on both a detailed ultrastructural level and at a macroscopic level to determine, on a lakewide scale, the seasonally influenced changes that occurred over the course of a spring to fall growth season. The acceleration of phototrophic activity with warming of the lake water in spring could be followed by increases in dissolved oxygen levels, which quickly reached supersaturation early in the summer. The grazing activity of brine fly larvae (Ephydra hians) was found to have a significant influence on mat growth and development patterns. On an ultrastructural level, several types of filamentous cyanobacteria were the main phototrophic organisms present, even in anaerobic parts of the mats, where they were accompanied by purple bacteria. The dominant cyanobacterium present was a large oscillatoriacean form which, in certain parts of the lake, formed unusual columnar structures that had a very low diversity of microbial species in comparison to mats from other regions of the lake. The microbial community also differed in areas of the lake where less saline groundwater springs emerged from the lake bed.																			0008-4166					FEB	1996	42	2					147	161		10.1139/m96-023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/m96-023													WOS:A1996TX27600008

The remediation resulted in lowered PCB concentration in the sediment, from 5 mu g g(-1) (d.w.) to 0.060 mu g g(-1) (d.w.). PCB concentration in the water decreased over the two years, but varied seasonally. Highest PCB concentrations were recorded in summer. PCB concentration was positively correlated to temperature. Spring and winter values of PCB concentration were positively correlated to water discharge and to suspended matter probably originating from resedimented particles during remediation, PCA analysis of congener patterns in the water supported this conclusion. The seasonality in PCB concentration and congener distribution seemed to gradually become similar to a location upstream of the contaminated lake.																			0044-7447	1654-7209				AUG	1998	27	5					398	403																WOS:000077814700005

Two depths were sampled (15% and 1% of surface PAR). To study the diversity of Synechococcus, we used a classical molecular fingerprinting technique (Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis, DGGE) with ambient samples and sequencing of the prominent bands. The ecorypes selected within the samples from different depths were different in photosynthetic characteristics and grew in a range of nutrient concentrations. The OTUs colonizing different niches in the water column did not show any significant clustering. However, the OTU richness was significantly different at the two depths in spring, reaching the highest values at 15 % of surface PAR. Cluster analysis of DGGE lanes provided evidence of different community compositions between spring and late summer. Sequencing of the most prominent bands showed one spring OTU affiliated to the Synechococcus subalpine cluster I, with 100% similarity to LM94, MW76B2 and AM15#2 (sensu Crosbie et al. 2003a), not present in late summer. Another OTU present both in spring and late summer showed 100% similarity to MH301, a strain near to subalpine cluster II. Our results support the coexistence of ecotypes in the vertical gradients, rapidly acclimating and performing differently in the microhabitats.

Warm spring and summer water temperatures in small eutrophic lakes of the Canadian prairies: potential implications for phytoplankton and zooplankton	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Shallow, polymictic lakes with low heat storage capacity are especially susceptible to warmer spring conditions, predicted for a changing climate. In these lakes, atmosphere to water mass heat transfer is efficient as a result of high wind exposures and large surface areas relative to volumes. We examined effects of warmer water temperatures on phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance and species composition in three small eutrophic lakes (5.2-14.9 ha) of the Canadian prairies in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, over two open-water seasons with contrasting spring weather conditions, i.e. 2005-a "normal" spring and 2006-a warm spring. Warmer spring and summer water temperatures were associated with decreased water transparency, increased phytoplankton biomass, increased relative filamentous cyanobacteria biomass and shifts in dominant genera from Aphanizomenon to Anabaena and Planktothrix. Zooplankton responded strongly; abundance of Daphnia (D. pulicaria, D. ambigua and D. parvula) decreased while rotifers, Skistodiaptomus oregonensis and Bosmina longirostris increased in abundance. Of several factors influencing phytoplankton dynamics, total dissolved nutrients [nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and N:P] and water column stability did not show important changes between years. In contrast, water temperature [described as the metric degree-days (degrees C day)] was related to changes in phytoplankton and % cyanobacteria biovolume. Daphniid abundance showed a significant negative relationship with an increase in filamentous cyanobacteria biomass and, thus we suggest, was indirectly associated with increased water temperatures.																			0142-7873					MAY	2009	31	5					489	502		10.1093/plankt/fbp001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbp001													WOS:000265098100003

To confirm this proposal, eight sampling campaigns were carried out in 2012 and 2013 to investigate the distribution patterns of Hg species in the water column and sediment profiles at four sampling stations in an alpine forest reservoir, southwestern China. The concentrations of total Hg (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) in water samples of DaHong Reservoir varied from 2.8 to 8.2 ng L-1 and 0.06 to 2.9 ng L-1, respectively. The concentrations of these Hg species in the wet seasons (summer and fall) were significantly higher than those in the dry season (winter and spring). Forest field runoff and diffusion of Hg from sediments could be the reasons for elevated concentrations of these Hg species in the wet season. Elevated MeHg concentrations in water samples from the bottom water and water-sediment interface demonstrated an active net Hg methylation in the downstream of DaHong (DH) Reservoir. Dissolved MeHg levels in the pore water of surface sediments and the bottom of downstream were apparently higher than those in the upstream, which indicated that MeHg sources of sediment pore water varied in space. MeHg diffusive fluxes from sediment to overlying water were higher in the wet season than those in the dry season, demonstrating that high temperatures favor Hg methylation processes in sediment.

The tufa carbonate displays a distinct alternation of white and dark layers most probably, representing annually, deposited sparry and microgranular calcite which is formed during the warm and relatively, wet summer and the drier and cooler spring and autumn season with an interruption of tufa,formation during the freezing period. The delta O-18 record of the tufa site comprises probably; 357 years of annually, deposited carbonate about 4,000 wars before present, which indicates the prevalence of wetter climatic conditions in comparison to the present-day situation. This inference is confirmed by palynological data and lake-level reconstructions from a number of sites in the northern foreland of the Qilian Mountains, highlighting the large potential of longer tufa sequences for high-resolution palaeoclimate studies in the future.					zhang, chengjun/HHC-4054-2022; Mischke, Steffen/L-9300-2015	Mischke, Steffen/0000-0003-3821-8497													0705-3797					DEC	2008	31	4					401	407		10.18814/epiiugs/2008/v31i4/005	http://dx.doi.org/10.18814/epiiugs/2008/v31i4/005													WOS:000262890400005

Changes in winter rainfall are critical for regional socioeconomic development, but are difficult to simulate accurately(1) and reconstruct on Quaternary timescales. This is partly because regional hydroclimate records that cover multiple glacial-interglacial cycles(2,3) with different orbital geometries, global ice volume and atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations are scarce. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms of change and their persistence remain unexplored. Here we show that, over the past 1.36 million years, wet winters in the northcentral Mediterranean tend to occur with high contrasts in local, seasonal insolation and a vigorous African summer monsoon. Our proxy time series from Lake Ohrid on the Balkan Peninsula, together with a 784,000-year transient climate model hindcast, suggest that increased sea surface temperatures amplify local cyclone development and refuel North Atlantic low-pressure systems that enter the Mediterranean during phases of low continental ice volume and high concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases. A comparison with modern reanalysis data shows that current drivers of the amount of rainfall in the Mediterranean share some similarities to those that drive the reconstructed increases in precipitation. Our data cover multiple insolation maxima and are therefore an important benchmark for testing climate model performance.

Environmental variability drives phytoplankton assemblage persistence in a subtropical reservoir	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Temporal changes of assemblages may result from environmental variability and reflect seasonal dynamics of their ecosystem. In the subtropics, the hydrological regime is usually characterized by well-defined wet and dry seasons, regulating discharge and influencing a series of environmental variables that affect phytoplankton persistence. Therefore, we may expect that dry seasons are environmentally more stable than wet seasons. We analysed interannual phytoplankton assemblage variability (or, inversely, persistence) in a subtropical reservoir sampled every austral summer and winter during 5 years. We tested (i) if phytoplankton assemblage structure differed between the dry (summer) and wet (winter) seasons; (ii) if assemblage persistence differed between the seasons; (iii) if assemblage persistence was related to environmental stability; and (iv) if assemblage dissimilarity increased over time. Phytoplankton assemblages differed between the summer and winter seasons. Winter indicator species were mostly Bacillariophyceae or Cryptophyceae, whereas Cyanophyceae and Chlorophyceae taxa were more frequent and abundant in summer. Assemblages in the dry season were more persistent among years than those occurring during rainy periods. Similarly, environmental variability tended to be lower among dry than among rainy seasons. The relation between the phytoplankton temporal cycle and the temporal patterns of environmental variability supports our prediction that high environmental stability results in more persistent assemblages. Assemblage dissimilarity increased as sampling years were farther apart, for both seasons. Additionally, assemblages in the rainy periods showed a more pronounced increase in dissimilarity, as their changes among years were less predictable. We found a clear temporal pattern and an increased dissimilarity over time in the phytoplankton assemblage structure. Unravelling these temporal patterns may improve our understanding of phytoplankton temporal dynamics, and may have implications for management and monitoring programs. High dissimilarity of assemblages among years, particularly among rainy periods, can obscure human impacts, and monitoring programs should take this into account.

Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans associated with settling particles in Lake Ontario	CHEMOSPHERE												Sediment traps were deployed at seven sites in the western and central basins of Lake Ontario for calculation of concentrations and down fluxes for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs) to assess ongoing loadings to Lake Ontario from the Niagara River watershed. Traps were deployed at multiple depths (beginning at 20 m) during two seasonal time periods at stations impacted by the outflow of the Niagara River, and stations reflecting deeper water offshore conditions. Settling particles were collected seasonally to assess the influence of physical characteristics of the water column, i.e., isothermal conditions vs. stratified conditions, on concentrations and fluxes of PCDD/Fs. At all stations and for all depth intervals, PCDD/F concentrations were higher in the winter sampling period (range of 3120-10,600 pg g(-1)), compared to the spring - summer - fall time period (range of 320 6900 pg g(-1)). These results indicated bottom sediments in central and western Lake Ontario were more highly-contaminated, compared to contemporary particulate material entering the lake via the Niagara River or resulting from shoreline erosion. However, assessment of PCDD/F congener profiles and ratios also indicated source areas within the Niagara River watershed continued to episodically contribute loadings to Lake Ontario. The results also indicated changes in discharges of PCDD/Fs from sources in the Niagara River result in changes in congener profiles in settling particles, which can be detected by continued monitoring.

Changes in thermal and oxygen stratification pattern coupled to CO2 outgassing persistence in two oligotrophic shallow lakes of the Atlantic Tropical Forest, Southeast Brazil	LIMNOLOGY												Diel variations of temperature, O-2 and CO2 profiles were measured in two oligotrophic shallow lakes situated next to a large preserved area of the Atlantic Tropical Forest (Brazil) in three sampling periods between the rainy season (spring and summer) and the dry winter of 2005. Our hypothesis was that lakes with high dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations by terrestrial inputs might show the persistence of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere over the course of the year, despite changes in the water stratification pattern. In both lakes, temperature, O-2 and CO2 showed a significant stratification in the beginning and end of the rainy season, and destratification in the dry winter. The beginning of the rainy season showed DOC concentrations and CO2 saturation that were significantly higher, but a persistence of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere was observed in all sampling periods. In conclusion, tropical shallow oligotrophic lakes might show events of thermal, O-2 or CO2 stratification and destratification coupled to persistence of CO2 outgassing, possibly subsiding by terrestrial influence.

J	CYRUS, DP; BLABER, SJM				CYRUS, DP; BLABER, SJM			THE FOOD AND FEEDING ECOLOGY OF GERREIDAE, BLEEKER 1859, IN THE ESTUARIES OF NATAL	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The food and feeding ecology of 5 spp. of Gerres [G. acinaces, G. oblongus, G. oyena, G. filamentosus and B. rappi] in the estuaries of Natal, were investigated from 1978-1980. The Kosi system, consisting of an estuary and 3 main lakes was selected as the main study area due to an abundance of Gerres. Four other estuarine systems were sampled. At Kosi polychaetes were important at the estuary, siphon tips (distal .+-. 5 mm) of the bivalve Hiatula lunulata were most commonly taken in Lakes Makhawulani and Mpungwini, while chironomid larvae were important in Lake Nhlange. Ivlev''s electivity test showed that Gerres from other estuaries was similar to that at Kosi, although the proportions of the different prey varied. At Kosi between 3 and 5 spp. occurred sympatrically. Resource segregation was through differences in diet and feeding periodicity and a superabundance of food (H. lunulata siphon tips) during summer and autumn. During winter and spring when food may be limiting, most Gerres leave shelf areas of the Kosi system, only G. acinaces remains in large numers. Little is known of the diet of other fish which feed on benthic invertebrates in Kosi but there is probably little direct competition with Gerreidae, although Acanthopagrus berda and Pomadasys commersonni have been recorded feeding on the siphons of the bivalve Solen corneus, the former in Durban Bay and the latter at Kosi. In areas where the bivalve H. lunulata occurs it is suggested that Gerreidae have developed optimal foraging techniques which enhance resource partitioning.																			0022-1112	1095-8649					1983	22	4					373	393		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1983.tb04760.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1983.tb04760.x													WOS:A1983QP41600001

Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) conducted on spring dataset showed that water temperature, color, and river morphology were primary factors shaping the structure of algal assemblages during the spring post-flood period. CCA on summer and autumn dataset revealed that conductivity and total phosphorus were the most important variables during the base flow period. Cluster analysis carried out on algal assemblages separated all rivers into two main groups that corresponded to the two geomorphological regions of the Lake Ladoga basin: the northern and the southern sub-basins. The separation of the northern and the southern groups were best explained by the pattern of conductivity reflecting geological and land use differences in the watersheds. The values of the Specific Pollution sensitivity Index (IPS) and the Biological Diatom Index (IBD) were higher, indicating better water quality, for rivers of the northern sub-basin than for rivers of the southern sub-basin. Mean values of the IPS and IBD for rivers of the northern and the southern sub-basins varied within the boundaries of a good water quality.

J	Terry, JA; Sadeghian, A; Lindenschmidt, KE				Terry, Julie A.; Sadeghian, Amir; Lindenschmidt, Karl-Erich			Modelling Dissolved Oxygen/Sediment Oxygen Demand under Ice in a Shallow Eutrophic Prairie Reservoir	WATER												Dissolved oxygen is an influential factor of aquatic ecosystem health. Future predictions of oxygen deficits are paramount for maintaining water quality. Oxygen demands depend greatly on a waterbody's attributes. A large sediment-water interface relative to volume means sediment oxygen demand has greater influence in shallow systems. In shallow, ice-covered waterbodies the potential for winter anoxia is high. Water quality models offer two options for modelling sediment oxygen demand: a zero-order constant rate, or a sediment diagenesis model. The constant rate is unrepresentative of a real system, yet a diagenesis model is difficult to parameterise and calibrate without data. We use the water quality model CE-QUAL-W2 to increase the complexity of a zero-order sediment compartment with limited data. We model summer and winter conditions individually to capture decay rates under-ice. Using a semi-automated calibration method, we find an annual pattern in sediment oxygen demand that follows the trend of chlorophyll-a concentrations in a shallow, eutrophic Prairie reservoir. We use chlorophyll-a as a proxy for estimation of summer oxygen demand and winter decay. We show that winter sediment oxygen demand is dependent on the previous summer's maximum chlorophyll-a concentrations.

The annual average areal production, in 1977, was 170 g C .cntdot. m-2 with daily areal productions ranging from 100 to 2800 mg C .cntdot. m-2. Pmax [maximum photosynthesis] for all samples correlated well with chlorophyll a (r = 0.79). No large horizontal trends in areal productivity or Pmax were found in the lake at any time of the year. Pronounced differences with depth in the photosynthetic characteristics of populations within the euphotic zone were common during the stratified season. The 2 large inflowing rivers are important to the productivity of Kootenay Lake as they initiate the spring production peak and supply nutrients to the deeper phytoplankton populations during the summer and fall period.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1983	40	3					319	327		10.1139/f83-047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f83-047													WOS:A1983QH82900009

Significant variation in delta(66)Zn(JMC3-0749L) of 0.9 parts per thousand (where delta(66)Zn(JMC3-0749L) = [{(66)Zn : (64)Zn}(sample)/{(66)Zn : (64)Zn}(JMC3-0749L) - 1] x 1000) was found throughout the seasonal cycle of productivity. The most negative delta(66)Zn(JMC3-0749L) values (down to -0.66 parts per thousand +/- 0.08 parts per thousand) were observed during the productive summer period from June to September, when the Zn in the settling particles was predominantly associated with organic material, and when Zn concentrations in the epilimnion were lowest. This observation is likely explained with preferential uptake of the light Zn isotopes during algal growth. During the other months, the Zn in the sediment traps showed higher delta(66)Zn values, reflecting increasing contributions of anthropogenic or lithogenic components. The average isotopic signature of the settling particles during the autumn-winter-spring period (similar to-0.2 parts per thousand for delta(66)Zn(JMC3-0749L)) was somewhat lower than typical for anthropogenic and natural sources, and this possibly reflects the effect of the preferential adsorption of lighter dissolved Zn isotopes onto the settling particles. We suggest that Rayleigh fractionation plays a minor role in controlling the isotopic composition of the settling particles in the lake. Our work demonstrates the presence of an obvious seasonal cycle in delta(66)Zn, and this suggests that Zn isotopes can be employed to study nutrient utilization and other biogeochemical processes in lakes and other aquatic environments.					; Sigg, Laura/AAI-3504-2020	Sigg, Laura/0000-0002-2210-2951; Weiss, Dominik/0000-0001-8074-9430; 													0024-3590					SEP	2009	54	5					1699	1708		10.4319/lo.2009.54.5.1699	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2009.54.5.1699													WOS:000268325300026

A comparison of this summer to the dry summer of 2012 and the relatively wet summers of 2018 and 2021 was carried out using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Centers for Atmospheric Research reanalysis, the Climate Prediction Center teleconnection indexes, and the blocking archive at the University of Missouri. The summer of 2022 was like that of 2012 which was characterized by a strong 500 hPa height anomaly centered over the western US and plains as well as very little blocking in the East Pacific. The summers of 2018 and 2021 were characterized by more zonal flow over the USA and more blocking in the East Pacific, similarly to the results of an earlier study. The teleconnection indexes for the prior spring and summer were largely similar for the two drier years and opposite for the wetter years. The surface conditions for the drier years were more similar while these were opposite for the wetter years. The integrated enstrophy (IE) used in earlier studies identified a change in the large-scale flow regime in early June 2022, which coincided with a decrease in the precipitation over the study region. However, one key difference was that the spring of 2022 was characterized by blocking more consistent with a wetter summer. This would have made the predictability of the drought of summer 2022 less certain.

The icefish showed diurnal feeding periodicity, with peak feeding in the morning. No food was observed in icefish guts collected at night. Our results indicate that that the icefish was a particulate feeder and light intensity greatly affected its foraging on zooplankton.

Littoral wetlands of urban lakes represent an ecotone between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and are strongly influenced by water levels, environmental conditions, and anthropogenic activities. Despite these littoral zones being potential "hotspots" of CH4 emissions, the status of CH4 emissions therein and the role of physicochemical properties and microbial communities regulating these emissions remain unclear. This study compared the CH4 fluxes, physicochemical properties, and CH4-cycling microbial communities (methanogens and methanotrophs) of three zones (a nonflooded supralittoral zone, a semi-flooded eulittoral zone, and a flooded infralittoral zone) in the littoral wetlands of Lake Pipa, Jiangsu Province, China, for two seasons (summer and winter). The eulittoral zone was a CH4 source (median: 11.49 and 0.02 mg m- 2 h-1 in summer and winter, respectively), whereas the supralittoral zone acted as a CH4 sink (median: -0.78 and -0.09 mg m- 2 h-1 in summer and winter, respectively). The infralittoral zone shifted from CH4 sink to source between the summer (median: -10.65 mg m- 2 h-1) and winter (median: 0.11 mg m- 2 h-1). The analysis of the functional genes of methanogenesis (mcrA) and methanotrophy (po) and path analysis showed that CH4 fluxes were strongly regulated by biotic factors (abundance of the mcrA gene and alpha diversity of CH4-cycling microbial communities) and abiotic factors (ammonia nitrogen, moisture, and soil organic carbon). In particular, biotic factors had a major influence on the variation in the CH4 flux, whereas abiotic factors had a minor influence. Our findings provide novel insights into the spatial and seasonal variations in CH4-cycling microbial communities and identify the key factors influencing CH4 fluxes in littoral wetlands. These results are important for managing nutrient inputs and regulating the hydrological regimes of urban lakes.

For comparison, we also provide some data on the distributions of the plankton during the summer. The whole water column remained oxic during the ice-covered period, although the near-bottom oxygen concentrations were always very low. The heterotrophic nanoflagellates were more abundant in winter than in summer, but ciliates, picoalgae and bacteria were more numerous in summer. In general both zooplankton and phytoplankton had low biomass during the ice-covered period. However, the biomass of the diatom Aulacoseira islandica ssp. islandica was high under the ice in April. The calanoid copepod Eudiaptomus graciloides was the dominant zooplankton species from January to March, but had almost disappeared by the beginning of April and did not increase again until in June. The dominant rotifer species in winter were Keratella cochlearis, Filinia terminalis, and Filinia longiseta in the surface water and Rotaria neptunia near the bottom.

J	Winder, M; Spaak, P				Winder, M; Spaak, P			Carbon as an indicator of Daphnia condition in an alpine lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Carbon-length relationships can be used to indicate the condition of daphnids in natural situations. We examined the Daphnia galeata population of an alpine lake (Oberer, Arosasee, Switzerland), where most individuals display diel vertical migration behaviour (DVM). Normally, migrating daphnids face a trade-off between 'predator safe areas' in the hypolimnion and 'food rich areas' with high predation risk. However, in alpine lakes, with chlorophyll a and POC maxima typically in deeper layers and weak temperature gradients, migrating species are confronted less with this trade-off. We investigated the seasonal changes in carbon content of D. galeata in different depth strata in relation to environmental parameters of the lake. The carbon content of D. galeata was high in spring, but declined considerably in summer and increased slightly in autumn. The low values indicate that D. galeata are food limited for much of the year. The slopes of the regression lines between carbon content and body length varied seasonally, but were not significantly different among depths on a given date. In summer, D. galeata individuals residing in the deep layers during the day had a significantly higher carbon content than individuals in the surface layers. During the rest of the year, the carbon content of individuals was similar among all depth strata. We conclude that migrating D. galeata and individuals remaining in deep layer had better body conditions compared to non-migrating D. galeata in this alpine lake during summer, when migration amplitudes were highest.

We estimated chironomid taxa optima along a trophic gradient (epilimnion TP) and constructed a Chironomidae-TP inference model (using Locally-Weighted Weighted Averaging), which can be used to assess trophic status of boreal lakes. We then tested for bias in CPET assessment due to temporally varying emergence patterns of chironomids and compared classification efficiency of chironomids with species-and genus-level data sets. Time of sampling was shown to have a major effect on the CPET assessment, which was largely due to the shift in emergence from early-emerging cold-stenothermal taxa to late spring/early summer-emerging chironomids. For monitoring and assessment of boreal lakes, two spring samples are recommended, one during the early phase of spring emergence and another sample later in spring or early summer. Species-level data more accurately (81 % correct) predicted correct trophic group for the samples than genus-level data (64 % correct).

Zoobenthic organisms may contribute to this release by excreting nutrients to the overlaying water. Based on experiments and using results from previous experimental studies as well as field monitoring density data from 2007 to 2017, we calculated the annual and seasonal nutrient excretions of the two most common macroinvertebrates (Corbicula fluminea and Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri) in Lake Taihu, China. We compared these rates with the concentrations of NH4-N, total nitrogen (TN), PO4-P and total phosphorus (TP) in the lake water as well as with previous results of release rates from undisturbed sediments collected in the lake. The spatial distribution of nutrient excretion by the two invertebrate species varied markedly among sites and years. Regression analyses revealed significant relationships between total nutrient excretions by these two species and the concentrations of NH4-N, TN, PO4-P and TP in the lake, but with seasonal differences. The relationship was overall strongest in winter, followed by spring, and weakest in summer and autumn. The flux of NH4-N and PO4-P released by the two macroinvertebrate species were equivalent to as much as 50% and 66%, respectively, of the sediment release recorded in lab experiments under undisturbed conditions; however, the percentages would be somewhat lower under field conditions where the sediment is subjected to frequent wind-induced resuspension and fish disturbance, enhancing the release rates. The release declined during the study period due to a reduction in the density of macroinvertebrates, perhaps indicating increasing stocking of fish since 2007. Our results indicate that benthic invertebrates are important contributor to the internal loading in shallow eutrophic lakes. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Therefore, determination of Chl-a threshold is of vital importance to the health of aquatic ecosystems and drinking water security. This research is aimed to investigate the spatial and temporal distributions of Chl-a and microcystin (MC) concentrations using Geographic Information System (GIS) and identify the Chl-a threshold in Lake Taihu based on available guideline values of MCs. Nearly, the same characteristics of spatiotemporal variation of Chl-a and MCs were observed in Lake Taihu. Overall, the lakewide distributions of Chl-a and MCs were highly variable over time and space. The Chl-a concentration in the winter and spring was relatively low, and gradually increasing in summer and autumn, with the maximum concentration observed in August. But the maximum MCs concentration appeared in October, 2 months lagging behind the Chl-a. The highest annual average Chl-a and MCs concentrations were observed in Zhushan Bay, Meiliang Bay, and Gonghu Bay in northwest of Lake Taihu, following by West Zone and Center Zone. Dongtaihu Bay, East Zone, and South Zone always present good water quality. Referring to the guideline value of MCs, the Chl-a threshold was determined as 10-15 mg center dot m(-3) based on the linear regression correlation between Chl-a and MCs. The establishment of Chl-a threshold is useful for eutrophication control, water quality management, and drinking water utilities in developing water safety plans.

The pore water of the sediment was also analyzed for orthophosphate, ammonia and nitrate content. The results give evidence that nutrient phosphorus content of the sediment is increased at the summer periods and with nitrogen content being available during the whole year gives eutrophic behavior in the lake waters. However, the winter rains reduce the phosphorous content during the spring months. The phosphorus is introduced into the lake by agricultural runoffs and by trenches from urban areas. Several isolated events originating from activities of the inhabitants of the small island and the human activities around the lake give rise to temporary pollution of the lake waters.

Size-dependent particle dry deposition velocities were obtained using Williams' model with meteorological inputs from past observations, taking into account the particle growth in the humid region near the air/sea interface. Sensitivity tests show that the model provides deposition velocities comparable with recent reference values. A comparison of the modeled dry deposition fluxes with measurements and GESAMP (Group of Experts on Scientific Aspects of Marine Pollution) suggestions demonstrated that the current Williams' model produced reasonable results. Using the averages of measured concentrations of six metal elements, the dry deposition fluxes for four seasons in the Qingdao area were calculated. The results showed that the deposition fluxes of crustal elements Al, Fe and Mn in spring and winter account for more than 70% of the whole year's deposition, while fluxes of Cu, Pb and Zn in autumn and winter contribute more than 70% of the whole year's deposition.

The aim was to study the temporal variations in the fishes' energy sources. The delta C-13 and delta N-15 ratios of all eight species of fish were higher in summer. Employing the IsoSource mixing model, we identified that the terrestrial plant Carex spp. was the most important primary producer supporting fish biomass in spring when the water level was low; meanwhile, the submerged macrophyte Potamogeton malaianus made consistent contributions to fish. However, in summer, when the water level was high, the submerged macrophyte Ceratophyllum demersum was the most important primary production source for fish. Our study indicated that feeding links in floodplain lakes are complex and modified by hydrologic seasonality.					; Yu, Xiubo/A-5875-2016	YU, Xiubo/0000-0002-8266-2432; 													0270-5060	2156-6941				JUN	2012	27	2					295	303		10.1080/02705060.2012.656714	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2012.656714													WOS:000304454400011

Within the euphotic zone, arsenite [As(III)] increased in spring and fall, and dimethylarsinic acid [DMAA(V)] became the dominant form in summer. Measurable concentrations of monomethyl-arsonic acid [MMAA(V)] and trivalent methylarsenic species [monomethylarsonous acid, MMAA(III), and dimethylarsinous acid, DMAA(III)] also appeared, although they were always minor fractions. The total arsenic concentration in the euphotic zones remained constant in the northern basin throughout the year. However, it was increased by 2-4 times in;he southern basin in summer. The enhancement was caused by the increase of As(V), which was accompanied by the increase of iron, manganese, and phosphorus. The concentration of methylarsenicals per chlorophyll a was lower in the southern basin. These results indicate that the variations of arsenic species in lake water largely depend on biological processes, such as the metabolism of phytoplankton, decomposition of organic matter by bacteria, and microbial reduction of iron and manganese oxides in sediments. Moreover, they show that eutrophication affects the concentration and speciation of arsenic in the lake water.

This contamination is also affecting aquatic life, as fish have the potential to acquire heavy metals in their tissues making them vulnerable. Worldwide lakes are an important source of water for the inhabitants of the area. So, in the present study, we have focused on the Satpara Lake to check the extent of heavy metal pollution and their accumulation in fish to provide baseline data for metal pollution management. Samples were collected from three locations (inflow, center, and outflow sites) during two seasons (summer and winter). Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was applied to analyze heavy metals concentration. Among the metals, Cd, Pb, As, and Fe revealed relatively higher concentrations. The highest concentration of heavy metal found in water and fish was of Cd, i.e., 8.87 mg L-1 and 18.19 mg L-1 in summer season, respectively. Arsenic concentration was also higher than the permissible limits in both water (0.76) and fish (1.17 mg L-1). The water quality assessment showed that in the summer season, the HPI (heavy metal pollution index) value 253.01 was more than 100, indicating the bad quality of water for drinking purposes. However, the HPI value 35.72 was less than 100 in winter. Toxicity hazard calculation of fish in summer seasons gives Hi values greater than 10.0, indicating the acute effect on human health as compared to winter.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL	2023	195	7							901	10.1007/s10661-023-11498-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-023-11498-x								37380756					WOS:001021169600002

Their wide use in human medicine has been favoured by the possibility to purchase them without medical prescription, their low cost and by the absence of opioid-like side effects. At the same time, their administration to domestic and food-producing animals has become a common practice to improve their well-being. Therefore, human and veterinary applications are the main sources of NSAIDs in the environment and the major pathways are excretion and discharge through sewage treatment plants. Although their environmental occurrence is well-known, there is a lack of data regarding their levels in surface waters of Central Italy. In this study, a monitoring campaign was arranged in some of the most important rivers and lakes of Central Italy, characterised by a different anthropic impact, in spring-summer and autumn-winter 2012. A broad range of NSAIDs for human and animal use was analysed through a reliable analytical method based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, appropriately developed and validated. Results have shown the constant presence of all drugs commonly used in human medicine with a composition that mirrored the incidence of seasonal diseases quite well. A veterinary drug (flunixin) was found in Bracciano Lake (Rome district), an important tourist attraction surrounded by farmlands. Salicylic acid is a phytohormone and this explains its presence in all the analyzed samples. All the results collected during the extensive survey have proved that Central Italy is aligned with the rest of Europe since its natural waters have shown low levels of contamination (ngL(-1)) but with a chronic input.

Year-to-year changes in the weather have a profound effect on the seasonal dynamics of zooplankton in lakes. Here, I analyse some zooplankton data from Esthwaite Water in Cumbria and demonstrate that much of the recorded inter-annual variation can be related to regional-scale changes in the weather. 2. The first data set analysed shows the effect of changes in the water temperature on the winter abundance of the calanoid copepod Eudiaptomus gracilis. The highest numbers of Eudiaptomus were recorded when the winters were mild and the lowest when the winters were cold. 3. Winter temperatures in northern and western Europe are now known to be influenced by the atmospheric feature known as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Positive values of the NAO are associated with mild winters and westerly winds and there was a significant positive correlation between the winter abundance of Eudiaptomus in Esthwaite Water and this empirical index of change. 4. The second data set analysed shows the effect of wind-induced mixing on the summer abundance of Daphnia. The highest numbers of Daphnia were recorded in years when the early summer thermocline was deep and the lowest number in years when the thermocline was shallow. 5. One of the most important factors influencing the depth of the early summer thermocline in the English lakes is the position of the north-wall of the Gulf Stream. Southerly movements of the Gulf Stream are typically associated with higher winds, whilst northerly movements are associated with stable conditions. In Esthwaite Water, a significant positive correlation was recorded between the abundance of Daphnia and the depth of the early summer thermocline and significant negative correlations between the same variables and the position of the Gulf Stream. 6. A detailed analysis of the seasonal variations recorded in one calm and one windy year suggest that the main factor responsible for these correlations was the entrainment of nutrients which then stimulated the growth of edible algae. Daphnia numbers were low in 1968 (a 'north' Gulf Stream year which was relatively calm) and high in 1972 (a 'south' Gulf Stream year with intense wind-mixing).																			0046-5070					OCT	2000	45	2					111	121		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00673.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00673.x													WOS:000165086500002

Assessing ecological responses to environmental change using statistical models	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. There is a clear need to improve our ability to assess the ecological consequences of environmental change. Because of the complexity of ecosystems and a need to disentangle the effects of multiple pressures, predictions are often reliant on models and expert opinion. These require validation with observed data; in this respect, long-term data sets are particularly valuable. 2. Innovative statistical methods (nonparametric regression and additive models) are presented for identifying nonparametric ecological trends and changes in seasonality in response to environmental change. These are illustrated through the example of Loch Leven, a shallow freshwater lake. Monitoring data for 35 years are examined, spanning periods of enrichment, ecological recovery and changing climate. 3. Models are developed for phosphorus and nitrogen; temperature and rainfall; Daphnia grazers; and chlorophyll a, with the ecological objectives of examining trends in water quality and the corresponding trends in nutrient availability, grazer abundance and climate. 4. The analysis highlighted a generally decreasing availability of P over the study period, and generally increasing nonparametric trends in nitrate concentration and rainfall. Increasing spring temperatures were also evident, as were significant nonparametric changes in density of summer grazers. 5. Significant reductions are highlighted in spring and summer chlorophyll a, related to the return of Daphnia to the loch. However, no response in chorophyll a to the later declining trends in P is apparent, but seasonality has changed. 6. Synthesis and applications. The analysis highlights the value of nonparametric statistical models for assessing complex ecological responses to environmental change. The models outlined can examine key ecological impacts of climate change, particularly effects on the timing of seasonal events and processes. The models are illustrated using long-term water-quality data from Loch Leven to explore patterns in key environmental drivers and ecological responses affecting freshwater ecosystems. Analysis of chlorophyll a, in particular, highlighted the value of examining the seasonal trends separately, with different trends evident for winter and spring and a changing seasonal pattern.					; Carvalho, Laurence/D-3276-2009	Bowman, Adrian/0000-0002-5729-4631; Carvalho, Laurence/0000-0002-9768-9902													0021-8901	1365-2664				FEB	2008	45	1					193	203		10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01428.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01428.x													WOS:000252558400022

This study focuses on the Yangtze River estuary and surrounding waters, where suspended solids show a strong correlation with active phosphates and silicates. Using GOCI imagery and measured nutrient concentrations, such as active phosphate and silicate, remote sensing models were developed to investigate the seasonal and daily changes in surface water nutrients. The results showed the following key findings: Temporally, active phosphate (PO4-P) and silicate (SiO3-Si) concentrations exhibited distinct seasonal patterns, with the highest values observed in winter (1.692 mu mol/L and 16.386 mu mol/L, respectively) and the lowest in summer (0.503 mu mol/L and 10.645 mu mol/L, respectively). Little difference was found between spring and autumn. Spatially, elevated phosphate and silicate concentrations were found near the northern Jiangsu Shoal, the Yangtze River estuary, and Hangzhou Bay, and decreased towards the outer coastal waters. This suggests that the freshwater inflow from the Yangtze River is an important driver of the observed nutrient patterns. Diurnal variations in phosphate and silicate concentrations were observed in the surface waters of the Yangtze River estuary and adjacent areas. Significant diurnal variations in nutrient concentrations were observed in Hangzhou Bay, the northern part of the Yangtze River estuary and the southern part of the Yangtze River estuary. Slight diurnal variations were observed in the inland channels of the estuary. These results help to facilitate the study of the complex process of spatial and temporal dynamics of nutrients in the coastal waters of eastern China.

Spatiotemporal distribution of some dissolved salts and minerals in Lake Edku connected to Mediterranean Sea: in relation to different pollutant inputs	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Regarding the generally accepted view of the minerals formed in solving the problem of ecosystem pollution, this research aims to track the role of seasonal minerals in overcoming widespread pollution problems in Lake Edku. At eleven locations inside Lake Edku and three locations in the outside the water inlets, some physical and chemical parameters that affect the formation of minerals and salts were detected seasonally. As a result of human activities from 1972 to 2020, the applied remote sensing technology showed a decrease in the area of Edku Lake by 13.3%. The saturation index (SI) of twelve minerals formed in fifty-six seasonal water samples collected from fourteen locations inside and outside the lake was estimated. The saturation index (SI) of anhydrite (ANH), gypsum (GYP), calcium phosphate (CP), magnesium phosphate (MP), calcite (CAL), aragonite (ARG), dolomite (DOL), magnesite (MGS), fluorapatite (FAP), hydroxyapatite (HAP), octacalcium phosphate (OCP), and carbonate-fluorapatite (CFAP) was calculated. The presented SI values of apatite and phosphate minerals including FAP (SI 30.63-65.65), CFAP (SI 28.14-40.02), HAP (SI 24.83-31.81), Ca-3(PO4)(2) (SI 23.99-25.95), OCP (SI 19.96-25.47), and Mg-3(PO4)(2) (SI 15.80-17.46) were high. Palmer-Roger's diagram and piper ternary diagram models reflected the abundance of NaCl in lake water with 30, 40, 46, and 75% in winter, spring, summer, and autumn, respectively. Using correlation matrix, multiple stepwise regression and cluster analysis for statistical analysis, the relationship between sedimentary minerals and outflow and drainage, as well as the role of sedimentary minerals in reducing pollution in the lake area, was outlined.					; El-Said, Ghada/AAN-5376-2021; Moneer, Abeer/ABB-8969-2020	Shaltout, Nayrah/0000-0003-1038-3642; El-Said, Ghada F./0000-0002-6358-5339; Moneer, Abeer/0000-0002-3752-2908; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				MAR 2	2021	193	3							155	10.1007/s10661-021-08935-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-08935-0								33649931					WOS:000625081600004

The level of humification and the relative molecular mass of DOM were remarkably higher in the summer than in the spring (P < 0.01) in both rivers. The SOM model showed that the fluorescence intensity of the spring component was lower than in summer in water bodies with higher levels of non-point source inputs, while the opposite was true for water bodies with lower levels of non-point source inputs. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus promoted autogenous processes in these water bodies. Seasonal variations and differing intensities of non-point source inputs had remarkable effects on urban river waters (R-2 = 0.775, P < 0.001). Non-point source inputs increased the concentrations of humus-like fractions and promoted autogenesis in the water bodies.					dou, yun/LBI-0785-2024; Cui, JiaHui/HCH-6033-2022	jin, xin cheng/0000-0002-9056-2853; 													0273-1223	1996-9732				JUL 1	2023	88	1					266	277		10.2166/wst.2023.187	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2023.187		JUN 2023						37452546					WOS:001009825900001

For this, blood sampling was taken seasonally from 11 male Siberian sturgeons (7 years old) and then steroid hormones including testosterone and 11-keto testosterone were analyzed by using ELISA. The results showed that testosterone had no significant differences during all the seasons (p>0.05) and the maximum level was in autumn. But 11ketotestesterone had significant differences between winter with other seasons (p<0.05). The min and max level of 11ketotestesterone was in autumn and winter, respectively. 11-keto testosterone hormone levels based on sexual maturation stages showed significant difference between stages III and IV with stage II (p<0.05).

Evaluation of seasonal variability in surface water quality of Shallow Valley Lake, Kashmir, India, using multivariate statistical techniques	POLLUTION												Seasonal variation in water quality of Anchar Lake has been evaluated, using two multivariate statistical techniques, namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Cluster Analysis (CA). Water quality data, collected during four seasons, have been analyzed for 13 parameters and ANOVA has shown that pH (F-3= 10.86, P < 0.05), temperature (F-3 = 65, P < 0.05), electrical conductivity (F-3= 32.72, P < 0.05), Calcium (F-3= 36.84, P < 0.05), Magnesium (F-3= 16.52, P < 0.05), nitrate-nitrogen (F-3= 48.06, P < 0.05), ammonical nitrogen (F-3 = 198.75, P < 0.05), and dissolved oxygen (F-3= 4.96, P < 0.05) varied by season, whereas the substantial variations of sodium (F-2= 7.18, P < 0.05), phosphate-phosphorous (F-2= 25.31, P < 0.05), biological oxygen demand (F-2= 11.02, P < 0.05), and chemical oxygen demand (F-2= 37.73, P < 0.05) were based on different sites. CA has grouped the three sampling sites throughout the four seasons into three clusters of similar water quality as relatively Less-Polluted (LP), Medium-Polluted (MP), and Highly-Polluted (HP). In addition, PCA has been applied on the extract to recognize the factors, responsible for water quality variations in four seasons of the year, resulting in four principal components for winter, summer, and autumn, five ones for spring, accounting for 79.58%, 89.07%, 83.34%, and 93.13% of total variance respectively. Thus the factors, responsible for water quality variation, are mainly related to domestic wastewaters, seasonal variation, agricultural runoff, and catchment geology. These results will help decision-makers better understand the influence of various factors on water quality and manage pollution/eutrophication adaptively in Anchar Lake.																			2383-451X	2383-4501				SUM	2017	3	3					349	362		10.7508/pj.2017.03.001	http://dx.doi.org/10.7508/pj.2017.03.001													WOS:000414862900001

Weekly surface water samples were collected and analyzed for three years (2015-2017). A total of 160 species of phytoplankton were distributed across eight divisions. Diatoms were dominant in all seasons except summer and their seasonal equivalents. All seven indices-Shannon, equitability, Simpson, Menhinick, evenness, dominance, and Berger-Parker-presented a clear trend in September, which may be attributed to rainfall in July. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was employed to analyze the relationship between the occurrence and the abundance of phytoplankton species and environmental factors. The results showed that WTE, TP, PO4-P, and rainfall were negatively correlated with Ulnaria acus, Asterionella formosa, and Stephanodiscus hantzschii, whereas Scenedesmus sp. and Merismopedia tenuissima presented positive correlations. Microcystis demonstrated positive correlations with TOC, NH3-N, and HRT, and appeared primarily in the summer and fall of 2015, a dry season. According to the Palmer pollution index, which is calculated based on phytoplankton species, Lake Paldang showed no signs of pollution for the top 99.8% of phytoplankton species, but was evaluated as organically polluted for overall phytoplankton, especially in spring and summer.

The abundance of picocyanobacteria (Pcy) fluctuated from 1.2x10(4) to 8.1x10(5) cells mL(-1) and the average abundance and biomass were 2.0x10(5) cells mL(-1) and 0.094 mg L-1, respectively. Pcy development was characterised by maxima in spring and summer. The summer maximum was twice the spring Pcy numbers. Eukaryotic APP (E-APP) were also present but in low numbers and their annual average contribution to the total APP community was only about 0.3% in abundance and about 3% in biomass. The spring Pcy community was dominated by single-celled cyanobacteria (S-Pcy) and in summer by colonial forms (C-Pcy). Throughout the sampling period, C-Pcy constituted on average 55% of the total Pcy and up to 90% in summer. C-Pcy abundance was significantly and positively correlated with water temperature (r=0.40, p=0.023, n=32). S-Pcy exhibited a distinct seasonal variation in FDC, ranging from 10% to 35%. Most FDC values above 30% were recorded from late May to mid July.

This study focused on the sudden extinction of the submerged plants in Caohai Lake, Guizhou, and employed long-term data and a whole-lake water level manipulation experiment to explore the impacts of nutrients and water level changes on the decline in submerged plants. The results indicated that over the past 40 years, the total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen in the water did not change significantly, while the total phosphorus showed a significant decreasing trend. In recent years, however, the water level rose. The biomass of submerged plants continuously increased until a sudden large-scale extinction occurred in 2021; chlorophyll a also significantly increased. It is speculated that the large-scale extinction of the submerged plants was caused by water level fluctuations rather than eutrophication. After the restoration of the natural hydrological regime of low water levels in winter and spring and high levels in summer and autumn, the submerged plants gradually recovered, with the biomass increasing to 922.6 g/m2 in 2023. The structural equation modeling indicated that the water depth and bottom light availability were the main drivers for the changes in the submerged plants. However, in lake protection and management, more attention is often paid to controlling nutrients, while other influencing factors are neglected. These findings confirm the importance of water levels in the decline in and restoration of submerged plants in shallow lakes, suggesting a focus on water level management in lake protection and aquatic vegetation restoration.

Loeske was studied in an acidic low-productivity lake in NW Poland. Individuals were counted on 4 experimental plots, 1 x 1 m each, at a depth of 2.5 m. The studies were conducted for 36 months, every 30 days, by SCUBA diving. Over the three years the seasonal changes in water pH, conductivity, HCO(3)(-) concentration, sediment hydration and pH were not statistically significant (P>0.05), and light intensity was higher in winter than in summer. Over the three years 4 consecutive stages of population development were observed: regeneration, stabilisation of abundance (fluctuations), regression and repeated regeneration. These stages appeared and lasted at different temperatures and light intensity. The greatest monthly increase in abundance took place in summer and lasted until the beginning of autumn under conditions of high temperature and relatively low light intensity. Long-term abundance variations were strongly correlated with the appearance of filamentous algae, less strongly with the dynamics of the dominant species (Sphagnum denticulatum), and the least with water temperature, light intensity, water and sediment pH, conductivity and HCO(3)(-) concentration. As a result of a massive bloom of these algae, light intensity decreased in the water, Warnstorfia shed its leaves, and then the entire population disappeared. In winter that year it began to regenerate from vegetative propagules (leafless shoots), which were the remains of individuals growing before the filamentous algae appeared. In softwater lakes such massive algal blooms are a common phenomenon which limits light transmission to the substrate and as a result leads to changes in the submerged vegetation structure, especially that of bryophytes.

J	Yang, Y; Chen, C; Yao, K; Grossart, HP				Yang, Yang; Chen, Chen; Yao, Kai; Grossart, Hans-Peter			Seasonal dynamics of free-living (FL) and particle-attached (PA) bacterial communities in a plateau reservoir	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												In terms of lifestyle, bacterioplankton can be classified as free-living (FL) and particle-attached (PA) forms, and both play essential roles in biogeochemical cycling in aquatic ecosystems. Structure, distribution, and community assembly of FL and PA bacteria in plateau riverine waterbodies are largely unknown. Therefore, we explored the seasonal dynamics of FLand PA bacterial communities in the Wujiangdu reservoir, Yungui Plateau using 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing. Results revealed there was a significant environmental heterogeneity in Wujiangdu reservoir seasonally. The dominant phylum was Actinomycetota for FL and Pseudomonadota for PA bacteria. Species richness and diversity was higher in autumn and winter compared to spring and summer. In general, PA diversity was greater than FL, but with some temporal variations. Species turnover was the major contributor to beta-diversity of both FL and PA lifestyles, and significant differences were noticed between FL and PA bacterial community composition. Distinct co-occurrence network patterns implied that more connections exist between FL bacteria, while more complex PA networks were in parallel to their greater diversity and stronger interactions in biofilms on particles. Dispersal limitation was the major driving force for both FL and PA bacterial community assembly. Deterministic processes were of relatively low importance, with homogeneous selection for FL and heterogeneous selection for PA bacteria. Temperature was the most important environmental driver of seasonal bacterial dynamics, followed by nitrate for FL and Secchi depth for PA bacteria. This study allows for a better understanding of the temporal variability of different bacteria lifestyles in reservoirs in the vulnerable and rapidly changing plateau environment, facilitating further microbial research related to global warming and eutrophication.

Its maximum lipid concentration of 67% of dry mass-consisting largely of wax esters-is the highest reported for freshwater zooplankton and is among the highest reported for marine polar species. The high lipid concentration of L.macrurus runs counter to the paradigm that high wax ester concentrations are found in herbivorous, but not in carnivorous, polar species. Lipids are drawn down to extremely low levels (10% of dry mass) during the reproductive period, November-May. Reproduction in this univoltine species appears to be timed so that the new generation develops during the high abundance of prey (crustacean microzooplankton and net phytoplankton) in spring. A high wax ester content may allow egg production to start in winter when the prey concentration is low. In contrast to many polar species, the new generation moves through all copepodid stages to adult without diapausing. Copepodid 5 females have a low lipid concentration, and lipids are slowly built up in new generation adults during summer and fall before reproduction commences. This lipid and life cycle strategy may have given L.macrurus an advantage over potential freshwater competitors, such as the arctic freshwater cyclopoid copepod Cyclops scutifer, in the hypolimnia of glaciated lakes.

Human population densities are forecast to increase in portions of the region at the same time that climate is expected to be changing. Consequently, the effects of humans and climatic change are likely to affect freshwater ecosystems within the region interactively. The general climate, at present, is humid continental, and the region receives abundant precipitation. Climatic projections for a 2 x CO2 atmosphere, however, suggest warmer and drier conditions for much of this region. Annual temperature increases ranging from 3-5 degrees C are projected, with the greatest increases occurring in autumn or winter. According to a water balance model, the projected increase in temperature will result in greater rates of evaporation and evapotranspiration. This could cause a 21 and 31% reduction in annual stream flow in the southern and northern sections of the region, respectively, with greatest reductions occurring in autumn and winter. The amount and duration of snow cover is also projected to decrease across the region, and summer convective thunderstorms are likely to decrease in frequency but increase in intensity. The dual effects of climate change and direct anthropogenic stress will most likely alter hydrological and biogeochemical processes, and, hence, the floral and faunal communities of the region's freshwater ecosystems. For example, the projected increase in evapotranspiration and evaporation could eliminate most bog ecosystems, and increases in water temperature may increase bioaccumulation, and possibly biomagnification, of organic and inorganic contaminants. Not all change may be adverse. For example, a decrease in runoff may reduce the intensity of ongoing estuarine eutrophication, and acidification of aquatic habitats during the spring snowmelt period may be ameliorated. Recommendations for future monitoring efforts include: (1) extending and improving data on the distribution, abundance and effect of anthropogenic stressors (non-point pollution) within the region; and (2) improving scientific knowledge regarding the contemporary distribution and abundance of aquatic species. Research recommendations include: (1) establishing a research centre(s) where field studies designed to understand interactions between freshwater ecosystems and climate change can be conducted; (2) projecting the future distribution, activities and direct effects of humans within the region; (3) developing mathematical analyses, experimental designs and aquatic indicators that distinguish between climatic and anthropogenic effects on aquatic systems; (4) developing and refining projections of climate variability such that the magnitude, frequency and seasonal timing of extreme events can be forecast; and (5) describing quantitatively the flux of materials (sediments, nutrients, metals) from watersheds characterized by a mosaic of land uses.

Contrary to expectations, however, growth occurs in some reservoirs with intense temperature oxygen stratification in which hypoxia forces striped bass into temperatures well above their preferred range. One potential explanation for this apparent contradiction is that high forage availability may mediate the energetic costs of exposure to warm summer temperatures in some systems. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the relative influence of thermal experience and food consumption on growth of striped bass in Badin Lake and Lake Norman, North Carolina, using bioenergetics model simulations. Badin Lake is eutrophic with striped bass restricted by hypoxia to warm temperatures in the summer, but striped bass experience modest positive growth over the summer and substantial annual growth. Lake Norman is oligotrophic and striped bass are restricted to warm temperatures by hypoxia for a shorter period, but they experience almost no summer growth and minimal annual growth after age 3. Model simulations showed that Badin Lake striped bass ages 1-4 achieved high food consumption rates during the summer that continued into the fall as temperatures cooled, allowing for rapid fall growth. Lake Norman striped bass ages 1-5 experienced lower consumption rates over the summer and fall. Consumption was not sufficient to allow larger striped bass to allocate energy to growth over the summer, and these fish did not experience any season with a combination of cool temperatures and high food consumption. Habitat exchange simulations modeled how much the growth of a particular size fish in one reservoir might change if it had experienced the temperatures or food consumption of a similar sized fish in the other reservoir. These simulations showed that the relative effect of food consumption on striped bass growth was three times that of exposure temperature in the first year of the study and 37 times that of temperature in the second year. Poor striped bass growth and condition is not, therefore, linked solely to poor physical habitat. Rather, management of reservoir striped bass populations will be improved by balancing demand for and availability of prey resources for striped bass, and this balance will be especially important in reservoirs where summer hypoxia forces fish into warm temperatures that increase metabolic costs.

Syndonia			The Effects of Snow, Soil Microenvironment, and Soil Organic Matter Quality on N Availability in Three Alaskan Arctic Plant Communities	ECOSYSTEMS												Climate warming in The Arctic may lead to a shift from graminoid to shrub dominance, which may, in turn, alter the structure and function of the ecosystem through shrub influences on the abiotic and/or biotic controls over biogeochemical cycles of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). In Arctic tundra, near Toolik Lake, Alaska, we quantified net N-mineralization rates under ambient and manipulated snow treatments at three different plant communities that varied in abundance of deciduous shrubs. Our objective was twofold: (1) to test whether the amount of snow that can accumulate around Arctic deciduous shrubs maintains winter soil temperatures high enough to stimulate microbial activity and increase soil N levels (effect of soil microclimate) and (2) to compare the relative effects of snow versus shrubs on N availability via effects on the main drivers of N-mineralization: SOM quality versus microclimate. Winter snow addition had a positive effect on summer, but not winter, N-mineralization rates. Soil organic matter quality had a nine times larger effect on N-mineralization than did soil microclimate in the summer season and only SOM quality had a detectable effect on N-mineralization in the winter. Here we conclude that on a short time scale, shrub interactions with snow may play a role in increasing plant available N, primarily through effects on the summer soil microenvironment. In addition, differences in SOM quality can drive larger differences in net N-mineralization than changes in soil microclimate of the magnitude of what we saw across our three sites.

Later, age-0 ciscoes feed on zooplankton (cladocerans), although surface insects are also eaten. Whitefish feed on a wider range of food items including zooplankton, surface insects, chironomid larvae and pupae, cyprinid larvae,and benthic cladocerans. Cisco grew from 1.0 to .apprx. 11 cm, and whitefish from 1.6 to .apprx. 12 cm, during the first summer and autumn.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				APR 2	1986	15	4					309	314																WOS:A1986C291000007

Seasonal variations of halite saturation in the Dead Sea	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Hypersaline lakes and seas were common in the past, precipitating thick evaporitic salt deposits. The only modern analogue for the paleolimnology of deep salt-saturated aquatic environments exists in the Dead Sea. In this study, we present new insights from the Dead Sea on the role of seasonal thermohaline stratification and water balance on the seasonal and depth variations of the degree of saturation of halite (salt) and the rate of halite growth along the water column. We developed methodologies to accurately determine the empirical degree of halite saturation of the lake based on high accuracy densitometry, and to quantify halite growth rate along the water column. During summer, the epilimnion is undersaturated and halite is dissolved, whereas during winter the entire water column is supersaturated and crystallizes halite. This result is not trivial because the variations in the water balance suggest the opposite; summer is associated with higher loss of water by evaporation from the lake compared to the winter. Hence, the thermal effect overcomes the hydrological balance effect and thus governs the seasonal saturation cycle. The hypolimnion is supersaturated with respect to halite and crystallizes throughout the year, with higher super saturation and higher crystallization rates during winter. During summer, simultaneous opposing environments coexistan undersaturated epilimnion that dissolves halite and a supersaturated hypolimnion that crystallizes halite, which results in focusing of halite deposits in the deep hypolimnetic parts of the evaporitic basins and thinning the shallow epilimnetic deposits.					; Lensky‬‏, Nadav/AAL-7950-2021	, Nadav/0000-0002-4726-1668; Sirota, Ido/0000-0001-5014-4369; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				SEP	2016	52	9					7151	7162		10.1002/2016WR018974	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016WR018974													WOS:000386977900025

First Records of the Invasive New Zealand Mudsnail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) in the Potomac River Basin	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												The distribution of invasive Potamopyrgus antipodarum (New Zealand Mudsnail [NZM]) is relatively limited in eastern North America, with populations known in the Great Lakes basin and scattered locations in several Atlantic Slope drainages. Herein, we report the first documented occurrence of NZM in the Potomac River basin, based on collections at 2 adjacent sites in Falling Spring Branch, Franklin County, PA.

The Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires the definition of different types of water bodies which are of relevance when assessing their ecological status. The main aim of this study was to define of the types of Portuguese reservoirs located in the North and Centre of Portugal and to assess their ecological status using phytoplankton as water quality indicators. In this study, sampling was carried out in 34 reservoirs during four seasons (spring, summer, autumn and winter), through a period of 8 years (1996-2004). Two groups of reservoirs could be distinguished, from the multivariate statistical analysis based on environmental variables and on phytoplankton assemblages: G1, lowland reservoirs located in the main rivers (Douro and Tagus), with a very low residence time, characterized by higher water mineral content (hardness and conductivity), higher concentrations of nutrients (namely, nitrates), dominated by Bacillariophyta and Chlorophyta and characterized by the presence of tolerant of poor environmental conditions species, mainly associated with meso and eutrophic states of water bodies; G2, deeper high altitude reservoirs, largely located in tributaries, with high residence time, presenting a specific species composition under reference conditions, with higher species richness. The transition from deeper and colder reservoirs (reference sites) to shallow and warmer reservoirs (impaired sites), was evident in G2, contrarily to G1, and was mostly positively correlated to organic pollution and mineral gradients. The results presented here are fundamental for the development of a routine for monitoring ecological status according to the WFD. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Seasonal changes of fertilizer impacts on agricultural drainage in a salinized area in Adana, Turkey	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Seasonal changes in the impacts of fertilizer on the composition of agricultural drainage water were examined by analyzing the Sr-87/Sr-86 isotope ratio and chemical composition of drainage water samples. Samples of drainage water were taken from the main drainage canals of the Lower Seyhan Irrigation Project, at sites designated as D10, D11, and D12. Plots of Sr-87/Sr-86 vs. 1/Sr indicated that the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio of drainage water was positively related to those of fertilizer and irrigation water. The origins of Sr in two of the end-components were fertilizer and irrigation water. The data from the end-drain in winter suggested that the origin of Sr in the third end-component was fossil seawater. Analysis of a mixing model incorporating these three end-components showed that the origins of Sr in drainage differed markedly between summer and winter. Fertilizer made the greatest contribution to Sr in drainage water both in summer and winter, contributing 38-72% of total Sr in summer and 64-87% of total Sr in winter. In summer, fertilizer contributed 72% of total Sr in drainage water in D12, 44% in D10, and 38% in D11. This result implies that fertilizer was applied excessively at the D12 site. In winter, seawater accounted for 10% of Sr in drainage water in D12, whereas it accounted for 19-27% of Sr in drainage water in D10 and D11. Therefore, at least 70% of the salt in drainage water originates from fertilizer and irrigation water. At this study site, the salt originating from seawater is replaced by that from fertilizer and irrigation water, due to intensive agricultural management. The study site is a delta that lay on the ocean subsurface at least 3000 years ago, and therefore, was originally a primary salinization area. This result suggests that anthropogenic secondary salinization progressed over time via fertilizer and irrigation applications. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The capture and removal of particles rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, and other nutrients at the bottom of lakes is of great significance for improving the management and eutrophication status of lakes. This study investigated the feasibility of applying lake bottom trap technology in seven different locations in Lake Chaohu, which is the fifth largest freshwater lake in China. The results showed that the trap in the western part of Lake Chaohu had the highest sedimentation rate and could capture most of the nutrients. The sedimentation rates were higher in spring and summer than in autumn and winter. The bottom trap effectively collected and preserved chlorophyll a, organic matter, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus. The trap per meter length (15-20 m wide) could catch 20.7-27.6 m3 of particles rich in nutrients with a water content of 50-70%, organic matter content of 281.9-375.8 kg, total nitrogen content of 24.5-32.6 kg, and total phosphorus content of 10.5-14 kg. The proposed bottom trap had little impact on the benthic organism system of the lake. The bottom trap technology used in this study could solve the problem of nitrogen, phosphorus, and algae accumulation in lakes and reservoirs, broaden the utility of lake hydrodynamics in environmental pollution control, and provide new ideas and strategies for the control and management of cumulative pollution in shallow lakes and reservoirs.					; hu, weiping/LIH-2020-2024	zhang, yihui/0000-0002-5463-7950; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				DEC 15	2021	300								113798	10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113798	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113798		SEP 2021						34562819					WOS:000704796800007

The fog samples were collected using an active fog collector and droplet size distribution was measured with a droplet size spectrometer (FM-100). The visibility (VIS)-liquid water content of fog (LWC) relationship differed between summer and autumn. Large fog droplets decreased in autumn and the calculated LWC from FM-100 measurements (LWCobs) were lower than those in summer at the same VIS. Two empirical curves between LWCobs and VIS were obtained and used for better estimation of fog deposition. Fog deposition was calculated from LWC empirically derived from past VIS data and deposition velocity (V-d) estimated using wind speed and vegetation parameters. The mean pH of fog water was 4.6 and the percentage of samples of pH 4.0 or more was 93%. Compared to previous literature of exposure experiments of acid mist on plants, fog acidity in this study did not seem to injure plant leaves. The water input via fog deposition accumulated for each growing season was estimated at 107-140 mm, corresponding to 18-23% of the precipitation in the same period. Nitrogen deposition via fog deposition in a plant growing season was estimated at 26-30 meq m(-2) (3.6-4.2 kg N ha(-1)). As a long-term trend, NO3- concentration in fog water decreased significantly. However, the long-term trends of fog and nitrogen depositions were not clear. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Walna, B; Siepak, M				Walna, Barbara; Siepak, Marcin			Heavy metals: their pathway from the ground, groundwater and springs to Lake Greckie (Poland)	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The migration pathways of heavy metals derived from an area previously in agricultural use was investigated in the Wielkopolski National Park (mid-western Poland). The heavy metals involved (Cd, Cu, Cr, Pb, Ni and Zn) were determined in groundwater, the springs that feed Lake Greckie and the lake itself. In order to show how the heavy metals may be set free and what is their biological availability, soil and sediment samples were subjected to single-stage extraction, using 0.01 M CaCl2, 0.02 M EDTA, 0.005 M DTPA, 0.1 M HCl, 1 M HCl and de-ionised water. Varying metal concentrations were recorded in the water samples during the study period (from November 2009 to July 2010), usually with higher values in winter and lower ones in summer. The seasonal changes may be ascribed to natural processes taking place in the ground- and surface waters of Lake Greckie. On the other hand, the concentration levels (mostly of Cd, Pb and Cr) are indicative of anthropogenic activity. It should be mentioned in this context that the highest metal concentrations were found in the soil layer. The concentrations were also found to exceed both the Polish and the World Health Organization water-quality standards. It appears that the soils are highly contaminated, mostly with cadmium. The long-lasting effect of acid precipitation in the area makes it possible for immobile forms to become mobile, thus facilitating further migration into the environment.					; Walna, Barbara/G-8011-2011; Siepak, Marcin/L-4283-2019	Siepak, Marcin/0000-0002-6364-874X; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				MAY	2012	184	5					3315	3340		10.1007/s10661-011-2191-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-011-2191-7								21720865					WOS:000303381300053
J	Vodacek, A				Vodacek, Anthony			Linking year-to-year Cladophora variability in Lake Ontario to the temperature contrast between nearshore and offshore waters during the spring	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Images from thermal satellite sensors clearly show the spatial and temporal characteristics of surface temperature distributions during the spring heating period in Lake Ontario. The satellite information combined with summertime beach closure data at Ontario Beach, Rochester, NY, shows that there is a correlation of the percent of summer beach closings caused by accumulation of algae (primarily Cladophora) with the cumulative temperature contrast between nearshore and offshore waters during the spring heating period. The physical conditions created by a rapid warming of the nearshore water during the spring warming period appear to generate conditions favorable to Cladophora growth in the summer. The results of this study suggest that satellite thermal observations of Lake Ontario in the spring can be used to better understand year-to-year variability of Cladophora growth as well as potential reactions to climate change.

J	Kirillin, G; Wen, LJ; Shatwell, T				Kirillin, Georgiy; Wen, Lijuan; Shatwell, Tom			Seasonal thermal regime and climatic trends in lakes of the Tibetan highlands	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The hydrology of the lake-rich Tibetan Plateau is important for the global climate, yet little is known about the thermal regime of Tibetan lakes due to scant data. We (i) investigated the characteristic seasonal temperature patterns and recent trends in the thermal and stratification regimes of lakes on the Tibetan Plateau and (ii) tested the performance of the one-dimensional lake parameterization scheme FLake for the Tibetan lake system. For this purpose, we combined 3 years of in situ lake temperature measurements, several decades of satellite observations, and the global reanalysis data. We chose the two largest freshwater Tibetan lakes, Ngoring and Gyaring, as study sites. The lake model FLake faithfully reproduced the specific features of the high-altitude lakes and was subsequently applied to reconstruct the vertically resolved heat transport in both lakes during the last 4 decades. The model suggested that Ngoring and Gyaring were ice-covered for about 6 months and stratified in summer for about 4 months per year with a short spring overturn and a longer autumn overturn. In summer the surface mixed boundary layer extended to 6-8m of depth and was about 20% shallower in the more turbid Gyaring. The thermal regime of the transparent Ngoring responded more strongly to atmospheric forcing than Gyaring, where the higher turbidity damped the response. According to the reanalysis data, air temperatures and humidity have increased, whereas solar radiation has decreased, since the 1970s. Surprisingly, the modeled mean lake temperatures did not change, nor did the phenology of the ice cover or stratification. Lake surface temperatures in summer increased only marginally. The reason is that the increase in air temperature was offset by the decrease in radiation, probably due to increasing humidity. This study demonstrates that air temperature trends are not directly coupled to lake temperatures and underscores the importance of shortwave radiation for the thermal regime of high-altitude lakes.

J	Little, AS; Tonn, WM; Tallman, RF; Reist, JD				Little, AS; Tonn, WM; Tallman, RF; Reist, JD			Seasonal variation in diet and trophic relationships within the fish communities of the lower Slave River, Northwest Territories, Canada	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Increased industrial activities on the Peace and Athabasca River systems have raised concerns about cumulative impacts on fish and water resources downstream, in the Slave River of Alberta and the Northwest Territories, Canada. Because very little information was available on the fish communities in this system, we examined spatial and temporal patterns of diet for nine species (four piscivores and five invertebrate feeders) from three different types of habitat along the lower Slave River system and assessed trophic relationships within the communities. All actively feeding species exhibited seasonal variations in diet within and among the study areas. Dietary overlap was generally low throughout all seasons and locations. In the lower Slave River and is major tributary, the Salt River, substantial dietary overlap between piscivores (particularly walleye, Stizostedion vitreum), and invertebrate feeders occurred in the spring. In the summer no overlap occurred as walleye shifted to a more piscivorous diet, attaining a moderate degree of overlap with northern pike, Esox lucius. Compared with the Slave River, which is a large but homogeneous system upstream of its delta at Great Slave Lake, there was a greater diversity of actively feeding invertebrate feeders in the Salt River. Three of the latter were benthic feeders exhibiting moderate degrees of diet overlap during spring and summer. During the fall, few fish were feeding. Most fishes in the lower Slave River system are generalist, opportunistic feeders, consuming a number of different prey, the importance of which varies spatially and seasonally as the abundance of these prey varies in the environment.

J	Hausmann, S; Pienitz, R				Hausmann, Sonja; Pienitz, Reinhard			Seasonal climate inferences from high-resolution modern diatom data along a climate gradient: a case study	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												This study represents a step towards developing seasonal climate inferences by using high-resolution modern data sets. The importance of seasonal climate changes is highlighted by the instrumental record of a meteorological station close to our study site (lac du Sommet in the Laurentian Mountains, Quebec, Canada): Between 1966 and 2001, May temperatures increased significantly by 3.1 degrees C (r = 0.41, n = 35, p < 0.01) but annual mean temperatures only by 0.6 degrees C (r = 0,21, n = 35, p > 0.05). Comparison of this instrumental record with fossil diatom assemblages in a sediment core from lac du Sommet showed that axis one of a principal component analysis (PCA) of the fossil diatoms was best correlated with wind velocity in June (r = 0.62, n = 19, p < 0.005) and that past diatom production was significantly enhanced in periods with colder July temperatures (r = -0.77, n = 19, p < 0.0005) and higher wind velocity in June (r = 77, n = 19, p < 0.0005). The strong impact of the spring and summer conditions on overall diatom composition and productivity suggests that seasonal lake responses to climate are more important than annual mean temperatures. However, the seasonal dynamics of diatom communities are not well understood, and seasonality is rarely inferred effectively from lake sediment studies. Our research presents a pilot study to answer a twofold question: Is it possible to identify diatom communities which are typical for warmer or colder seasonal climate using sediment traps, and if it is, can this knowledge be used to infer seasonal climate conditions from fossil diatom assemblages? To address these questions, the seasonal dynamics of diatom communities and water chemistry were studied using sediment traps and water samples at biweekly intervals in four lakes distributed along an altitudinal gradient in the Laurentian Mountains from May through October 2002. Date of ice break-up was significantly related to the diatom assemblages taken in spring and uncorrelated to other significant environmental variables. Summer water temperature, circulation of the water column and pH explained a significant part of the biological variance in summer, and total nitrogen (TN) explained most of the biological variance in autumn. To infer these variables, weighted averaging partial least squares models were applied to the seasonal data sets. Inferred ice break-up dates were significantly correlated with number of days below 0 degrees C in April (r = 0.52, n = 19, p < 0.025), inferred circulation of the water column was significantly related to measured wind velocity in June (r = 0.64, n = 19, p < 0.005), inferred summer water temperature and inferred pH was significantly related to measured July air temperature (r = 0.50, r = -53, n = 19, p < 0.025) and inferred TN autumn concentrations had an inverse relationship to August temperatures (r = -0.53, n = 19, p < 0.01). This comparison of the historical record with diatominferred seasonal climate signals, based on the comparison of fossil diatom assemblages with modern sediment trap data of high temporal resolution, provides a promising new approach for the reconstruction of seasonal climate aspects in paleolimnological studies.					; Hausmann, Sonja/E-5152-2011	Pienitz, Reinhard/0000-0002-3613-1673; Hausmann, Sonja/0000-0002-5411-5298; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				JUL	2007	38	1					73	96		10.1007/s10933-006-9061-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-006-9061-2													WOS:000247530100005

Regional and seasonal variations were studied during the ice-free season of 1986. The concentration of total Hg was usually in the range of 2 to 10-mu-g m-3. Hg concentrations were highly correlated to the concentration of humic matter measured as water color. Hg concentrations were about twice as high in acidic lakes (pH 5) than in circumneutral lakes, which is attributed basically to the acidity of humic compounds acting as Hg carriers in boreal waters. Significant seasonal variations were caused by hydrological processes. During periods of high water flow, Hg concentrations increased dramatically, especially in humic lakes. Between spring and autumn, chemically reactive Hg compounds were gradually replaced by more inert species. Hg/C ratios were higher than in surface runoff from forest watersheds, indicating a significant impact of direct deposition of Hg on lake surfaces during summer. Regional differences were small despite differences in Hg contamination.

The First Results of Monitoring the Formation and Destruction of the Ice Cover in Winter 2014-2015 on Ilmen Lake according to the Measurements of Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar	IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS												The launch of the Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) opens up new opportunities for studying and monitoring the land and inland waters. It is the first time radar with a swath (+/- 65A degrees) covering regions with cold climate where waters are covered with ice and land with snow for prolonged periods of time has been used. It is also the first time that the remote sensing is carried out at small incidence angles (less than 19A degrees) at two frequencies (13.6 and 35.5 GHz). The high spatial resolution (4-5 km) significantly increases the number of objects that can be studied using the new radar. Ilmen Lake is chosen as the first test object for the development of complex programs for processing and analyzing data obtained by the DPR. The problem of diagnostics of ice-cover formation and destruction according to DPR data has been considered. It is shown that the dependence of the radar backscatter cross section on the incidence angle for autumn ice is different from that of spring ice, and can be used for classification. A comparison with scattering on the water surface has shown that, at incidence angles exceeding 10A degrees, it is possible to discern all three types of reflecting surfaces: open water, autumn ice, and spring ice, under the condition of making repeated measurements to avoid possible ambiguity caused by wind.

The Seasonal Recolonization of Dairy Farms by Stomoxys calcitrans (Diptera: Muscidae) in South Central Ontario, Canada	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY												Stable fly (Diptera: Muscidae) populations in south central Ontario, Canada, first occur on dairy farms in late spring, grow exponentially throughout the summer, and are forzen back each autumn. We examined the extent of overwinter persistence or 22 dairy farms in a 55-by 60-km region north of Lake Ontario that spans four climatic zones. Our overwintering sampling of larval habitat identified three farms loacted in the southern section of the study region as potential overwintering refugia. Using sticky trap catches to identify the timing of first spring appearance at each farm, we then tested two models of how local farm populations are reestablished annually: 1) stable flies disperse from local climatic refuges and colonize neighboring farms (the local source model): and 2) stable flies are carried into the study region by frontal weather systems (the distant source model). The timing of when stable flies first occured at these farms supported a local source of dispersing colonists from a small proportion of local refuge farms. We discuss our results in terms of how yearly fluctuation in climate would affect refuge farm density in the region and how this in turn would shift the recolonization dynamic. Implications for controlling stable flies also are discussed.																			0022-0493					APR	2009	102	2					788	798		10.1603/029.102.0241	http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/029.102.0241								19449662					WOS:000264899500042

Future precipitation increases are projected to peak in the northeast and to mainly occur in winter, but uncertainties underscore the need for reconstructions of long-term spatial and temporal variations in precipitation amounts and seasonality. We use lipid biomarkers from four sedimentary lake records along a climatic gradient from western to northeastern Svalbard to reconstruct Holocene water cycle changes. We measured the leaf wax hydrogen isotopic composition of long-chain (terrestrial) and mid-chain (aquatic) n-alkanoic acids, reflecting delta H-2 of precipitation (delta H-2(precip)) and lake water (delta H-2(lake)), respectively. delta H-2(precip) values mainly reflect summer precipitation delta H-2 and evapotranspiration, whereas delta H-2(lake) values can reflect various precipitation seasonality due to varying lake hydrology. For one lake, we used the difference between delta H-2(precip) and delta H-2(lake) (epsilon(precip-lake)) to infer summer evapotranspiration changes. Relatively H-2-enriched delta H-2(precip) values and higher epsilon(precip-lake) in the Early and Middle Holocene suggest warm summers with higher evapotranspiration, and/or more proximal summer moisture. After c. 6 cal. ka BP, H-2-depleted delta H-2(precip) values and lower epsilon(precip-lake) indicate summer cooling, less evapotranspiration, or more distally derived moisture. Early to Middle Holocene decrease in delta H-2(lake) values in two northern Spitsbergen lakes reflects an increase in the proportion of winter relative to summer precipitation, associated with regional warming and increased moisture supply, which may be due to increased distal moisture supply and/or reduced sea ice cover. Our northern Svalbard delta H-2(lake) records suggest great Late Holocene climate variability with periodic winter precipitation increases or decreases in summer precipitation inflow to the lakes. We find that Holocene summer precipitation delta H-2 values mainly follow changes in summer insolation and temperature, whereas the seasonal distribution of precipitation is sensitive to catchment hydrology, regional ocean surface conditions, and moisture source changes.

Modeled chlorophyll a concentrations agree well with data from the 8-y time period considered. In particular, the interannual variation in the timing of phytoplankton growth is adequately simulated by the model. The onset of phytoplankton blooms in Upper Lake Constance is not sensitive to variations in the photosynthetically active radiation, the sinking velocity of the algae, or the effect of water temperature on biological process rates, but is primarily determined by turbulent diffusion (i.e., by the transition from strong mixing in winter and early spring to weak mixing). The transition in mixing conditions and thus also the beginning of phytoplankton population growth correlates with the build up of the first slight temperature stratification. Simulations performed without consideration of phytoplankton loss due to grazing overestimate algal biomass soon after the onset of algal growth. Including grazing by zooplankton substantially improves the agreement between model and data and suggests that ciliate grazing in particular leads to a significant reduction of phytoplankton abundance in spring after the start of the algal bloom.

J	Feng, TJ; Peng, R				Feng, Tangjun; Peng, Ran			Outdoor thermal comfort and the cooling effect in different layouts of shaded spaces: A study of Guangzhou, China	ENERGY AND BUILDINGS												This study aims to identify outdoor thermal comfort and the cooling effect among different layouts of shaded spaces for the humid subtropical (Cfa) climatic zones in Guangzhou, China. Six shaded spaces with one unshaded space were investigated by using meteorological measurements and questionnaire surveys during summer and winter. Outdoor thermal benchmarks were determined with Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) and compared with other climatic zones. The thermal comfort calendar for shaded spaces was proposed and the thermal adaptation behaviors were summarized. Results showed that: 1) Deciduous tree array provided the best cooling effect of 4.7 degrees C (Ta) and 11.3 degrees C (PET) in summer, and 4.6 degrees C (Ta) and 8.0 degrees C (PET) in winter (warm period). 2) the single row of evergreen trees was deemed as the most comfortable space during summer and winter, despite receiving low thermal sensation votes for "neutral" in summer. 3) Air temperature and global temperature were the main factors influencing outdoor thermal comfort. 4) The neutral PET, the PET range, the PET acceptability range and the preferred PET in Guangzhou were 18.4 degrees C, 11.9-24.8 degrees C, 8.3-22 degrees C and 18.2 degrees C, respectively. 5) All shaded spaces were "moderate heat stress" after 12:00 or warmer in summer, and lake pavilion experienced "moderate heat stress" from 10:00 to 14:00 on sunny days in the winter warm period. These results could help urban designers and planners gain insights into the outdoor thermal comfort and adaptive behaviors of Guangzhou people, evaluate the varying cooling effect in different layouts of shaded spaces, and select suitable thermal benchmarks and appropriate configurations to create thermally comfortable outdoor shaded spaces in humid subtropical urban parks.

J	TESSIER, AJ				TESSIER, AJ			COMPARATIVE POPULATION REGULATION OF 2 PLANKTONIC CLADOCERA (HOLOPEDIUM-GIBBERUM AND DAPHNIA-CATAWBA)	ECOLOGY												The abundance of two planktonic grazers (Holopedium gibberum and Daphnia catawba) fluctuated seasonally in a nonparallel manner in Lake Lacawac, Pennsylvania. Holopedium gibberum was abundant in early and midsummer, while D. catawba was common only in spring and late summer. I sought to explain this seasonal succession by identifying seasonal factors which regulate each population. I monitored population abundance, individual energy reserves (lipid content), egg production, and body size distributions in plankton samples from April to October in three years. Food resources and vertebrate predator abundance was also examined seasonally. Results of experimental manipulations of food availability and predators, conducted seasonally in both small (6.4-L) and large (6000-L) enclosures, supported interpretations drawn from descriptive data. Contrasting seasonal abundance patterns of the species are explained by differences in the intensity of food stress and predation affecting each species. Food supply restricted population growth of H. gibberum at most times. In the spring of each year, starvation was a major cause of mortality; during individual energy reserves and fecundity were near zero for H. gibberum. Predation losses were negligible for adult H. gibberum, but neonate (smallest age class) mortality by fish was occasionally large. Daphnia catawba experienced a seasonal change in the intensity of regulating factors; food supply restricted population growth only in spring and late summer, but predation controlled growth during summer. During late summer, predation on D. catawaba was reduced and its population abundance increased sharply. Experimental removal of fish caused a comparable increase of D. catawba during midsummer. At peak animal densities in late summer, both species were food stressed. Life table experiments conducted at this time suggest that competition for food occurs between D. catawba and H. gibberum, and results in a reduction of H. gibberum density.																			0012-9658	1939-9170				APR	1986	67	2					285	302		10.2307/1938573	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1938573													WOS:A1986A631500001
J	Yang, P; Liu, XH; Xu, B				Yang, Ping; Liu, Xuehua; Xu, Bing			Spatiotemporal pattern of bird habitats in the Poyang Lake based on Landsat images	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China and possesses unique wetland and plentiful biological resources. Because of the dual influence of the Five Rivers and Yangtze River, the water level of Poyang Lake changes seasonally, which has important influence on the local ecosystem. A better knowledge of the spatiotemporal pattern of water body and bird habitats is important for bird diversity conservation and wetland management. In this study, we collected six Landsat images in both winter and summer seasons from 1995 to 2009. These images were processed in both ERDAS Imagine 9.1 and ArcGIS 9.3 by image registration, geometric rectification and classification based on image characteristics and field survey data. The bird habitats in Poyang Lake wetland were classified into six types as shoal water, middle-depth water, deep water, grassland, sand land and mudflat. The results showed: (1) In winter seasons, grassland, mudflat and shoal water were the three main bird habitats in winter (totally around 70 %); water body area increased 13.6 % from 1995 to 1999 and then decreased 11.8 % from 1999 to 2007, and the mudflat decreased all the time from 1995 to 2007. (2) In summer seasons, water area occupied more than 60 % of the whole area; due to high water level, most plants were submerged and not suitable for bird feeding; shoal water area and grasslands were the two main bird habitats in summer. Compared with changes in summer seasons, all bird habitats changed obviously in winter seasons. Based on our research, we suggests that it is important to monitor the change in water level, area of water body, area of grassland and mudflat in future research by incorporating related precipitation data, water station record, multispectral and multi-temporal remote sensing images in the Poyang Lake since these habitats are key for migrating birds.

Resolving this controversy is critical for understanding the underlying mechanisms of climate change and evaluating global warming on a longer timescale. Here we present a quantitative summer temperature reconstruction based on branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers analyzed from a sedimentary sequence retrieved from the volcanic lake Kielguo crater lake in Northeast (NE) China. Our record revealed that the summer temperature in NE China followed a rough cooling trend during similar to 10-2.2 cal ka BP and increased after similar to 2.2 cal ka BP. The warmest period appeared at similar to 10-8.8 cal ka BP with similar to 15.8 degrees C, and the coldest time occurred at similar to 2.3 cal ka BP with similar to 13.4 degrees C. Compared with other temperature records from NE China, we conclude that the summer and winter temperature change trends in NE China were probably controlled by the summer and winter insolation respectively, and the ice volume. The mean annual temperature changes in NE China resulted from the superposition of summer cooling and winter warming during the Holocene, and the decrease in ice volume forcing the increase in mean annual temperatures before similar to 7-6 cal ka BP. The switch in mean annual temperature changes was probably linked with the collapse of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets.

Sediment samples obtained by Van Veen Grab from four stations, including, Turkaman, Amirabad, Fereydunkenar and Noushahr along the south part of the Caspian Sea, during fall of 2015 and april, summer and winter of 2016. The concentrations of metal were ranged from 21.63 mu g/g to 55.45 mu g/g for nickel and from 58.23 mu g/g to 146.27 mu g/g for vanadium in sediments samples collected from all stations. There was significant difference in metals concentration between different stations along the Caspian Sea (P < 0.05), and the highest mean concentration of metals was absorbed in Fereydunkenar estuary, followed by Amirabad, Turkaman and Noushahr, respectively. The results showed that there were significant differences between metals pollution during four seasons (P < 0.05), and the highest concentration of metals were absorbed in dry season (summer) and the lowest concentration in wet season (winter). There was a positive correlation between nickel and vanadium concentration in sediment samples, and the Pearson correlation was (r = 0.67) between nickel and vanadium in sediment samples. The positive correlation between heavy metals can be related to same source of both metals in the environment. Based on our results, anthropogenic activities such as oil industry and agriculture activities are the main sources of pollution in the coasts along south part of Caspian Sea.

J	KELLOGG, CE				KELLOGG, CE			MUSKRAT PELTS - SECTIONAL AND SEASONAL EFFECTS ON GRADES	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Pelts from muskrats (Ondatra zibethica) trapped over a 3-yr. period on several selected National Wildlife refuges in various parts of the U. S. were graded by experts of 2 fur auction companies. There were 204 grades according to size, quality of fur and skins, damage, condition of pelt, and kits. Skins were segregated by semi-monthly periods for the entire trapping season. The terms "spring", "winter", and "fall" are fur-trade terms that reflect the degree of primeness, or relative freedom from pigment on the flesh side of the skin. In the northern areas the % of "fall" skins is quite high until the last 2 weeks of Dec. and the "spring" skins do not exceed 50% until about Feb. 1. The Louisiana section has only a slight fluctuation throughout the trapping season. There is some variation of these primeness grades from one season to the next. In grading for size, a quick estimate must be made of relative square inches of surface and note must be taken as to whether the skin is uniformly and naturally stretched. A XXXL skin from Louisiana is not as large as a XXXL from one of the northern states. The names of sections of the country where skins are produced indicate fur quality to fur tradesmen and similar descriptions as to amt. and quality of fur indicate possibly 2 widely different types of skins when taken from widely different areas. Damage to muskrat skins increases sharply after Map. 1 (initiation of breeding season) and in some cases amounts to as much as 50%. Percentage of "kits and mice" (skins from very young animals) is somewhat larger in the fall except in Louisiana where it is constant. On basis of value of each grade, weighted average per-skin values, by semi-monthly periods for an entire trapping season (11,433 skins) at Tule Lake Refuge (Calif.) shows that these values after Jan. 1 were within 3% of the highest average value for any weekly period during the remainder of the trapping season. The large % of damaged skins during the spring was responsible for this lower price. The conclusion to be drawn is that at Tule Lake (Calif.) delaying trapping beyond the middle of Jan. adds nothing to pelt values during seasons similar to that of 1943-44.																			0022-541X	1937-2817					1947	11	2					153	161		10.2307/3795560	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3795560													WOS:A1947XS08400006

However, little is known about the role of ammonia-oxidizing Archaea (AOA) and Bacteria (AOB) in lacustrine ecosystems. In this study, the photic zone of three contrasted freshwater ecosystems located in France was sampled during two periods: winter homothermy (H) and summer thermal stratification (TS), to investigate the distribution of planktonic AOA and AOB. We showed that AOB were predominant in nutrient-rich ecosystems, whereas AOA dominated when ammonia concentrations were the lowest and during winter, which could provide a favorable environment for their growth. Moreover, analyses of archaeal libraries revealed the ubiquity of the thaumarchaeal I.1a clade associated with higher diversity of AOA in the most nutrient-poor lake. More generally, this work assesses the presence of AOA in lakes, but also highlights the existence of clades typically associated with lacustrine and hot spring ecosystems and specific ecological niches occupied by these microorganisms.

However, the spatio-temporal variability of denitrification rates and its controlling factors in sediments of large shallow lakes are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the controlling factors on the temporal and spatial variability of denitrification rates in Meiliang Bay in Taihu Lake, China, to determine the contribution of denitrification on the total lacustrine nitrogen budget. Materials and methods We collected 18 intact monthly sediment cores and an additional 36 seasonal sediment cores from January 2013 to January 2014. Cores were collected from the inner and outer sections of Meiliang Bay for analysis of denitrification rates and sediment properties. We also collected in situ surface water samples for water quality analysis. Denitrification rates at the sediment-water interface (SWI) were measured using acetylene inhibition techniques and intact sediment core incubation. We used a t test to determine the differences in water quality and sediment properties between the two sites and a one-way ANOVA to identify seasonal differences in denitrification rates, water quality, and sediment properties. We also applied Pearson's correlation, distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA) and random forest model to identify the relationships between denitrification rates and environmental factors. Results and discussion Denitrification rates ranged from 0.76 to 40.94 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1) and 0.13 to 52.55 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1), with annual mean values of 19.97 and 17.15 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1) for the Inner and Outer Bay, respectively. Sediment denitrification rates in the Inner and Outer Bay showed similar seasonal variability, with the highest values in spring and summer and the lowest values in autumn. Nitrate addition was shown to significantly increase denitrification rates in summer and autumn (P < 0.05); however, carbon addition showed no significant influence on denitrification rates in the four seasons. Our results imply that denitrification rates were nitrate-limited in summer and autumn. Distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA) and random forest model showed that denitrification rates were mainly determined by nitrate, temperature, and chlorophyll a (Chla), and that nitrate in the water column was the most important predictor of denitrification rates. Conclusions In general, denitrification rates showed significant seasonal variability in Meiliang Bay due to the co-regulation of both water temperature and nitrate concentrations. The dominance of each controlling factor on denitrification rates varied in different seasons. Based on our calculations, nitrogen removal by denitrification accounted for approximately 10.7% of the total nitrogen input to Taihu Lake. Therefore, we suggest the need for effective measures to reduce external nitrogen inputs of to Lake Taihu to prevent on-going eutrophication.

J	Jasser, I; Arvola, L				Jasser, I; Arvola, L			Potential effects of abiotic factors on the abundance of autotrophic picoplankton in four boreal lakes	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The seasonality of autotrophic picoplankton (APP) in four boreal lakes of varying trophic state and light availability was studied. Red-fluorescing cyanobacteria (CyAPP) dominated the APP in three lakes, but in the fourth, most humic lake, Valkea Kotinen, eukaryotic picoalgal cells (EuAPP) predominated. The most productive, least humic, and stratified lake (Ormajarvi) was the only one in which low numbers of orange-fluorescing cyanobacteria were present in winter (7 x 10(2) cells ml(-1)) and early spring (1 x 10(2) cells ml(-1)) under the ice cover. The numbers of CyAPP did not correspond to the trophic status of the lakes. The highest average and maximal numbers of CyAPP were recorded in shallow and moderately productive Jylisjarvi (6.2 x 10(5) cells ml(-1)) while the lowest number (8 x 10(4) cells ml(-1)) was recorded in the deepest lake, Paajarvi, with fairly similar water quality. Light availability and water temperature seemed to be more important abiotic factors in regulating CyAPP and EuAPP density than nutrient concentrations. In the deepest lakes, light and temperature correlated very strongly with density of CyAPP in spring, while in the shallowest lake this correlation only occurred in autumn. Although light and temperature were occasionally significantly correlated with EuAPP cell density, no common trend throughout all the seasons (as seen for prokaryotic APP) was found.

The phytoplankton growth rate ranged between 0.71 +/- 0.11-2.86 +/- 0.10 day(-1) and 0.62 +/- 0.01-1.45 +/- 0.02 day(-1), whereas MZP grazing rates ranged from 1.59 +/- 0.11-2.92 +/- 0.12 day(-1) to 1.48 +/- 0.05-2.15 +/- 0.33 day(-1) during the summer and winter seasons respectively. Experimental results showed that the phytoplankton growth rate was lower than the MZP grazing rate in both seasons, indicating constant grazing pressure on the prey community. Also, MZP was capable of grazing more than 100% of daily primary production and 46-95% of daily phytoplankton standing stock. The Southern Sector of the lagoon was under high grazing pressure due to low phytoplankton biomass and high MZP abundance during the study period. Grazing pressure was higher in the Central Sector and Outer Channel during the winter and in the Northern Sector (NS) during the summer. The observed results highlight MZP as a potential consumer for phytoplankton primary production. The positive correlation between phytoplankton growth rate and grazing rate (R = 0.820, P < 0.05) represents MZP as a major control of phytoplankton growth in both summer and winter. The high growth rate of phytoplankton during the summer season was balanced by the MZP grazing. All the sectors exhibited seasonal variations in grazing pressure depending on phytoplankton abundance and salinity conditions. From our study, we can conclude the top-down control of phytoplankton biomass by MZP in the Chilika Lagoon due to the high grazing rate.

In the present research, chemical speciation of Fe and Mn in sediments from the lake was studied based on the sequential extraction procedure developed by Tessier et al.. The results obtained from the study are as follows. The average values of total Fe were 47617 mg/kg and 70325 mg/kg in sediments from the lake in summer and winter respectively, and its speciation consisted mainly of residual and Fe-Mn oxides fractions. The amounts of total Fe and the distribution of its speciation in the sediments should be affected by effluents from a large quantity of deserted coal mines in the lake basin in summer and winter. The average values of total Mn were 7996 mg/kg and 1753 mg/kg in summer and winter respectively, and its speciation is primarily comprised of carbonate and Fe-Mn oxides fractions. The amounts of total Mn and its distribution in different fractions in the sediments were believed to be primarily influenced by effluents from those deserted coal mines in summer and by the condition of redox interface in winter.					; Xianfei, Huang/AAX-6753-2021	Huang, Xianfei/0000-0003-4474-459X; Hu, Jiwei/0000-0001-5900-7459													0094-243X		978-0-7354-0798-5				2010	1251						392	395		10.1063/1.3456361	http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.3456361													WOS:000288403600097

Loeske, was first reported forming a carpet beside a water pool in Ny-Alesund (78 degrees 56'N), Svalbard in 1959. Fifty years later, in 2008, it was found growing as an aquatic in a pool. The moss is sensitive to seasonal changes and exhibits a pattern of seasonal growth: summer stems with densely arranged leaves and lateral branches, and winter growth with short-leaved stems and no lateral branch. The mean daily increase in stem length is 0.68 mm in summer and 0.07 mm in winter. The longest specimens were up to 8 years old. The growth of the moss reflects closely seasonal temperature and growth conditions. World distribution is discussed and global distribution mapped.

This in situ measuring spectrofluorometer, which can be used to perform chlorophyll analysis and integrated algal class determination, provides a realistic estimation of the abundance and dynamics of the cyanobacterial population that is known to produce the hepatotoxic heptapeptides microcystin RR and LR. Data provided from in-line measurements using the probe and from R rubescens cell counts obtained by discrete sampling were closely correlated (r = 0.899, p < 0.01), as were in-line data and spectrophotometric total chlorophyll a measurements (r = 0.775, p < 0.01). A survey conducted from December 1999 to May 2001 revealed that P. rubescens exhibits a deep maximum level (typically between 10 and 15 m) in spring and summer (reaching concentrations of up to 20 mug equivalent chl a 1(-1), i.e. 27 000 cells ml(-1)), whereas it spreads from the surface either to the top of the thermocline or to the bottom of the lake, in autumn and winter respectively. We propose that the probe could be used as a powerful tool for assaying the occurrence and dynamics of microalgal blooms, typically toxic cyanobacteria, that call for accurate and rapid monitoring to assess the health of the ecosystem and to alert the authorities about potential risks regarding pumping and use of the lake water for drinking-water production purposes.					; Leboulanger, Christophe/W-9859-2018; Jacquet, Stéphan/AAJ-7846-2021	JACQUET, Stephan/0000-0001-6017-3892; Humbert, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-1519-5651; Leboulanger, Christophe/0000-0001-5836-4294; 													0948-3055					NOV 27	2002	30	1					83	89		10.3354/ame030083	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame030083													WOS:000179823500008

Methane and nitrous oxide measured throughout Lake Erie over all seasons indicate highest emissions from the eutrophic Western Basin	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Eutrophication has been linked to increased greenhouse gas emissions from inland waters. Phytoplankton blooms in Lake Erie have increased since the 1990s, although its greenhouse gas emissions are not well characterized. We measured CH4 and N2O concentrations and diffusive fluxes in four seasons around the entire lake, and CO2 fluxes in one summer season. Lake Erie is a source of CH4 all year across the lake, concentrated in spring and summer in the Western Basin. Methane emissions ranged from 0.03 to 14.87 mg C m(-2) d(-1). Methane is predominantly biogenic, and natural gas leaks are an insignificant source. While Lake Erie is an overall N2O source, it is an N2O sink in winter and occasionally during summer. Emissions of N2O ranged from -0.08 to 1.22 mg N m(-2) d(-1). We also measured CO2 fluxes in summer only, when Lake Erie is a small atmospheric CO2 sink. While areal fluxes of CH4 and N2O are similar to those observed elsewhere, total fluxes from Lake Erie are higher due to its surface area. Lake Erie emits similar to 6300 (+/- 19%) metric tons of CH4-C yr(-1) and similar to 600 (+/- 37%) metric tons N2O-N yr(-1): almost 500,000 metric tons CO2-eq yr(-1) total. This is the first comprehensive dataset of CH4 and N2O concentrations and diffusive emissions in a very large lake. More measurements and monitoring are needed to determine whether increased eutrophication in the Great Lakes is tied to increased emissions of these powerful climate forcers in a possible positive feedback to climate warming.

J	Köhler, J; Hoeg, S				Köhler, J; Hoeg, S			Phytoplankton selection in a river-lake system during two decades of changing nutrient supply	HYDROBIOLOGIA					11th Workshop of the International-Association-of-Phytoplankton-Taxonomy-and-Ecology (IAP)	AUG 15-23, 1998	SHREWSBURY, ENGLAND	Int Assoc Phytoplankton Taxon & Ecol				Phytoplankton dynamics in Lake Muggelsee, a eutrophic and polymictic lake in Berlin, and in the inflowing lowland River Spree have been comprehensively investigated during the last two decades. Zooplankton dynamics, nutrient supply, light climate, duration of ice cover and of summer stratification have also been regularly measured to help to explain phytoplankton development. The first period (1978-1990) was characterised by high nutrient loads and dominance of cyanobacteria from spring to autumn. Since then, loads of phosphorus and nitrogen have been lowered by 40-50%. Oscillatoria-like cyanobacteria (Limnothrix redekei, Planktothrix agardhii) were favoured under hypertrophic conditions in both the polymictic lake and the river, but they have disappeared nearly completely after nutrient reduction. Development of these species depended on meteorological conditions and nutrient supply in spring rather than on seasonal averages of nutrient concentrations. Diatoms have became dominant and chlorophytes have increased their share of the biomass since the nutrient load was reduced. Species composition changed even within the algal groups. Retention time of water and duration of thermal stratification of the water column modified phytoplankton structure. Mobile algae like Microcystis or Ceratium occurred in the lake during stratification periods. Otherwise, species composition in the shallow, polymictic lake was very similar to that in the inflowing lowland river. Species with high starting biomass, fed by high riverine import, resting stages or perennation were selected in this flushed system.

Seasonal variations in the fatty acid profiles of the liver and muscle of Squalius cephalus (Teleostei: Cyprinidae) living in Todurge Lake (Sivas, Turkiye)	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES												In this study, seasonal variations in the fatty acid profiles of the liver and muscle of Squalius cephalus from Todurge Lake were determined by Gas Chromatography (GC). C22:6 n-3, C20:5 n-3, C20:4 n-6, C18:1 n-9, C18:1 n-7, C16:1 n-7, C18:0 and C16:0 were the principal fatty acids showing the highest levels in the muscle and liver of Squalius cephalus in all seasons. Although C22:6 n-3, which is regarded as the most important polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), were found to be high in the spring (17.37%) and summer (20.45%) in the liver, the percentages of this acid changed between 15.10% (winter) and 17.77% (spring) in the muscle. In all seasons, total unsaturated fatty acids (n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated plus monounsaturated fatty acids) of the muscle tissue were found to be between 60-70%. Based on these results, S. cephalus is a good food resource in terms of feeding with unsaturated fatty acids in all seasons, especially C22:6 n-3.

Migration and Winter Movements of Double-crested Cormorants Breeding in Georgian Bay, Ontario	WATERBIRDS												Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) breeding in the Great Lakes and wintering in the southeastern United States were implanted with satellite transmitters to assess their movements. During 2007 and 2008, 26 cormorants from Georgian Bay, Ontario, Canada, were tracked in order to, variously, identify staging areas, characterize migration routes, winter habitat use, and home range size, assess philopatry of returning breeders, and test for a relationship between winter habitat use and arrival at the breeding ground. Females left summer areas earlier and spent more time in staging areas than did males. However, both sexes left the staging areas and arrived in the wintering grounds at approximately the same time. There was no difference in latitude between wintering males and females, or in winter residency time (n = 136 days for both sexes). The predominant winter habitat types were lakes and coasts with only seven of 26 (26.9%) birds wintering on aquaculture sites. Contrary to expectations, winter home ranges of birds on aquaculture sites ((x) over bar = 2760 km(2)) were significantly larger than birds on non-aquaculture sites ((x) over bar = 81 km(2)). A carryover effect of aquaculture was not detected; winter residency time was similar for birds on both aquaculture and natural winter habitats, with birds front both habitats returning north at the same time. Fidelity to the previous summer's location was observed in 15 of 20 returning individuals. Received 8 November 2009, accepted 16 February 2010.

J	Samad, MS; Bertilsson, S				Samad, Md Sainur; Bertilsson, Stefan			Seasonal Variations in Abundance and Diversity of Bacterial Mathanotrophs in Five Temperate Lakes	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Lakes are significant sources of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. Within these systems, methanotrophs consume CH4 and act as a potential biofilter mitigating the emission of this potent greenhouse gas. However, it is still not well understood how spatial and temporal variation in environmental parameters influence the abundance, diversity, and community structure of methanotrophs in lakes. To address this gap in knowledge, we collected water samples from three depths (surface, middle, and bottom) representing oxic to suboxic or anoxic zones of five different Swedish lakes in winter (ice-covered) and summer. Methanotroph abundance was determined by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction and a comparison to environmental variables showed that temperature, season as well as depth, phosphate concentration, dissolved oxygen, and CH4 explained the observed variation in methanotroph abundance. Due to minimal differences in methane concentrations (0.19 and 0.29 mu M for summer and winter, respectively), only a weak and even negative correlation was observed between CH4 and methanotrophs, which was possibly due to usage of CH4. Methanotrophs were present at concentrations ranging from 105 to 106 copies/l throughout the oxic (surface) and suboxic/anoxic (bottom) water mass of the lakes, but always contributed less than 1.3% to the total microbial community. Relative methanotroph abundance was significantly higher in winter than in summer and consistently increased with depth in the lakes. Phylogenetic analysis of pmoA genes in two clone libraries from two of the ice-covered lakes (Ekoln and Ramsen) separated the methanotrophs into five distinct clusters of Methylobacter sp. (Type I). Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the pmoA gene further revealed significant differences in methanotrophic communities between lakes as well as between winter and summer while there were no significant differences between water layers. The study provides new insights into diversity, abundance, community composition and spatial as well as temporal distribution of freshwater methanotrophs in low-methane dimictic lakes.

Microscale Characterization of Sulfur Speciation in Lake Sediments	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Prairie pothole lakes (PPLs) are naturally sulfur-enriched wetlands in the glaciated prairie region of North America. High sulfate levels and dynamic hydrogeochemistry in combination render PPLs a unique environment to explore the speciation of sedimentary sulfur (S). The goals of this research were to define and quantify the solid-phase S pools in PPL sediments and track seasonal dynamics of S speciation. A quantitative X-ray microprobe method was developed based on S Is X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy and multienergy X-ray fluorescence mapping. Three S pools pyritic S, reduced organic S (organic mono- and disulfide), and oxidized S (inorganic sulfate, ester sulfate, and sulfonate) were identified in PPL sediments. No significant seasonal variation was evident for total S, but S speciation showed a seasonal response. During the spring summer transition, the reduced organic S decreased from 55 to 15 mol %, with a concomitant rise in the oxidized S. During the summer fall transition, the trend reversed and the reduced organic S grew to 75 mol % at the expense of the oxidized S. The pyritic S, on the other hand, remained relatively constant (similar to 22 mol %) over time. The seasonal changes in S speciation have strong potential to force the cycling of elements such as mercury in prairie wetlands.

In only a few streams are brook trout abundant in lower stream reaches that are accessible to adult Pacific salmonids migrating from the lake. Consequently, because of the rarity of native brook trout populations in these lower stream reaches it is important to understand how they use stream habitat in sympatry with juvenile Pacific salmonids which are now naturalized in several Lake Ontario tributaries. In this study, we examined the seasonal (spring, summer, and fall) habitat use of brook trout and juvenile steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in Hart Brook, a tributary of eastern Lake Ontario. We found interspecific, intraspecific, and seasonal variation in habitat use. Subyearling steelhead were associated with faster water velocities than subyearling brook trout and, overall, had the least habitat similarity to the other salmonid groups examined. Overyearling brook trout and yearling steelhead exhibited the greatest degree of habitat selection and habitat selection by all four salmonid groups was greatest in summer. The availability of pool habitat for overyearling salmonids may pose the largest impediment to these species in Hart Brook.																			0270-5060	2156-6941					2016	31	2					239	249		10.1080/02705060.2015.1123655	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2015.1123655													WOS:000384270200008

Many diversion projects aimed at diverting water from the Yangtze River or other rivers. This study, using one of the lakes receiving Yangtze River water as a case study, illustrated how nutrient, O-2, and N-2 fluxes across the sediment water interface (SWI) changed with increasing nitrate loads during in situ benthic chamber incubation. Increasing nitrate loads in the overlying water caused complex changes in the SWI fluxes. Furthermore, responses of the SWI fluxes to increasing nitrate loads were largely driven by season. Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), ammonium (NH4+), CO2, and N-2 fluxes increased with enhanced nitrate loads, likely induced by stimulated anaerobic mineralization. DIC had a stronger response to nitrate additions in late summer versus in winter. Nitrate influxes were enhanced by increasing nitrate loads in winter and showed a similar but stronger response in summer, with a shift from sediment release to influx. Sediment oxygen consumption decreased with increasing nitrate loads in both late summer and, especially, winter. Nitrate addition may have changed the proportions of aerobic and anaerobic respiration, i.e., nitrate competed with O-2 as an electron acceptor. With increasing nitrate loads, anaerobic respiration was strengthened in the dark benthic chamber. Water diversion from the heavily polluted Yangtze River to Lake Dazong may be disadvantageous for controlling eutrophication, especially during the summer. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The contamination of antibiotics and ARGs occurring in important living and agricultural regions has aroused wide concern worldwide, especially in lake basins. The Dongting Lake basin is one of the important aquaculture and livestock areas in China, which is accompanied by a large amount of antibiotic use and discharge. However, the occurrence characteristics of antibiotics and ARGs in a multi-environment medium are still unclear. In this study, surface water and sediment samples in East Dongting Lake were collected by season, antibiotics and ARGs were quantitatively analyzed, and the risk quotient method was used to evaluate the ecological risk of antibiotics in surface water. 1) The concentration of antibiotics in the surface water of East Dongting Lake ranged from ND to 943.49 ng/L, with the maximum average concentration of 20.92 ng/L in spring. The concentration of antibiotics in sediments ranged from ND to 177.43 ng/g, with the maximum average concentration of 16.38 ng/g in fall. Ofloxacin (OFL) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) were the main antibiotic pollutants in East Dongting Lake Basin. 2) sul1 and sul2 were the dominant ARGs in East Dongting Lake Basin. For spatial change, the total abundance of ARGs upstream was higher than that downstream. For seasonal change, the surface water and sediment were characterized by spring > summer > fall. 3) OFL and sulfamethoxazole might pose a significant high risk to aquatic organisms both in three seasons, and the ecological risk of antibiotics in East Dongting Lake is more significant at low temperatures than high. This study could provide important data information of the occurrence and concentration of antibiotics and ARGs in East Dongting Lake Basin.

The concentration of acetate in the interstitial water fell from about 100 .mu.M (immediately after sedimentation of the spring diatom bloom) to a relatively constant value of about 20 .mu.M in late summer, during which acetate utilization appeared to be balanced by production. Addition of chloroform and molybdate caused an accumulation of cold acetate in large sediment cores and of [14C]acetate in small cores to which [14C]bicarbonate was added. In both cases chloroform caused the greater accumulation, implying that acetoclastic methanogens were the more active consumers. The conversion of 14CO2 to [14C]acetate was inversely related, with depth, to its conversion to 14CH4. Methanogenesis from CO2 decreased during late summer, whereas acetogenesis and acetoclastic methanogenesis increased over the same time period. The production of acetate from CO2 was generally equivalent to less than 10% of the acetate C utilized but could be as high as 25% of that value. H2 consumption by acetogens could be as high as 50% of that utilized in methanogenesis. The role of acetogenic bacteria in anaerobic processes may therefore be of greater significance in lakes such as Blelham Tarn than in more eutrophic systems.																			0099-2240	1098-5336					1985	49	4					944	948		10.1128/AEM.49.4.944-948.1985	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.49.4.944-948.1985								4004224					WOS:A1985AFA8400039

Seasonal population characteristics and gut contents of the invasive mysid, Hemimysis anomala, in Milwaukee Harbor, Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The invasive mysid, Hemimysis anomala, is abundant along harbor breakwalls in Lake Michigan, forming large swarms, but we know little of its population dynamics or diet in these novel environments. We examined abundance, body length, and sex/developmental stage in animals collected using lighted funnel traps in Milwaukee Harbor, WI, from summer 2021 to spring 2022. We applied novel immunochemical analysis to examine gut contents using purified polyclonal antisera raised against nine putative zooplankton prey (Bosmina longirostris, Bythotrephes longimanus, Cercopagis pengoi, Daphnia galataea mendotae, Daphnia pulex, Dreissena veliger larvae, Keratella cochlearis, Leptodiaptomus ashlandii, and Limnocalanus macrurus). Population dynamics differed from those described in other Great Lakes; mid-late summer populations were dominated by juveniles (< 6 mm), and small (similar to 7 mm) adult males (80-90 %) with few reproductive females (5-10 %). Males did not die after reproducing and adults grew through winter (0.011-0.015 mm d(-1)), reaching 10-12 mm by early spring. Immunochemical gut analyses showed Hemimysis to be generalist feeders, consuming all nine species tested. Most trapped individuals (58 %) had empty guts, suggesting that Hemimysis cleared their guts before recovery. No differences in diet were seen among sexes/developmental stages, or across seasons. We also compared Hemimysis directly sampled from pelagic swarms, to those recovered from benthic traps. There were no differences in size or sex/developmental stage of individuals between traps and swarm populations, refuting the idea that swarming serves a reproductive function, but there were differences in prey found in guts between individuals in swarms and from traps, suggesting swarming is associated with feeding.

J	Lundeen, ZJ; Brunelle, A				Lundeen, Zachary J.; Brunelle, Andrea			A 14,000-year record of fire, climate, and vegetation from the Bear River Range, southeast Idaho, USA	HOLOCENE												The vegetation and fire history of the Bear River Range (BRR), Southeast Idaho has been reconstructed from pollen, plant macrofossils, and macroscopic charcoal from lacustrine sediments. Overall, the BRR record shows independent responses of vegetation and fire regime to climate variation. The reconstructions suggest strong seasonal bias from the proxies evaluated, with the pollen record most sensitive to insolation-driven summer temperature trends, and the charcoal-based fire record more sensitive to winter snowpack variability. Together, the proxies suggest that the early Holocene experienced larger than average snowpacks but very warm summers. Warmer than modern summer temperatures were maintained through much of the mid-Holocene, but snowpacks decreased dramatically, creating the most extreme xeric conditions in the Holocene between similar to 7100 and 6000 BP. After 6000 BP, summers began to show a consistent cooling trend. Winter precipitation remained low until similar to 4400 BP, after which higher than average snowpacks are indicated until 2000 BP. Pollen and charcoal data relationships at similar to 8800 BP and from 1800 to 800 BP suggest periods with anomalously wet summers that created a unique fire regime during those intervals.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				JUN	2016	26	6					833	842		10.1177/0959683615622545	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683615622545													WOS:000376305700001
J	Tryfon, E; MoustakaGouni, M; Nikolaidis, G				Tryfon, E; MoustakaGouni, M; Nikolaidis, G			Planktic cyanophytes and their ecology in the shallow Lake Mikri Prespa, Greece	NORDIC JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Cyanophytes dominated the phytoplankton of shallow Lake Mikri Prespa during the period May 1990 to September 1992 (76.5 and 52.0% of the total phytoplankton biomass in 1990-1991 and 1991-1992, respectively). Biomass peaks were observed in autumn (from 5.2 to 34.5 g m(-3)) when low dissolved inorganic nitrogen, high phosphate phosphorus and low Z(eu) to Z(mix) ratio prevailed. The dominant species were Microcystis aentginosa and M. wesenbergii. These represented 64 and 86% of the cyanophyte biomass in 1990-1991 and 1991-1992, respectively and revealed similar patterns of seasonality forming biomass peaks in late summer - autumn. Small chroococcalean cyanophytes (< 2 mu m) showed also similar temporal distributions. Of the filamentous cyanophytes, the most important species was Anabaena lemmermannii var. minor which formed peaks in late summer and autumn (2.6 and 1.1 g m(-3) in 1990 and 1992, respectively). Rainfall and the N:P ratio were probably the main factors influencing the seasonality of all of the filamentous cyanophytes in the lake. Cyanophytes, tended to increase at temperatures higher than 16 degrees C and at inorganic nitrogen concentrations lower than 100 mu g l(-1). The frequent mixing of the water column did not seem to prohibit the substantial increase of the group.

The ecosystem stability obviously changes with the water quality and the season, especially in summer and autumn. The purpose of this study was to establish a stability evaluation system for an artificial lake ecosystem and verify the system applicability using Lake Luxe as a case study. The system was established by the following three steps: (1) select reference period; (2) establish seasonal and annual evaluation methods by determining the ecological units by an ecological checklist (the populations and communities of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and benthos) and then calculating the seasonal stability indices (SIs) and annual stability indices (SIy) of each ecological unit; calculating each seasonal or annual ecosystem stability index using these calculated SI and ecological units attributes; and calculating the ecosystem stability index for many years; (3) obtain the evaluation results. The results obtained by the seasonal evaluation method showed that the ecosystem community structure was unstable in spring and the total ecosystem biomass was unstable in summer. The redundancy analysis results between phytoplankton stability values and environmental variables showed that dissolved oxygen (DO), total nitrogen (TN), and chlorophyll a (Chla) were the main driving variables that could be used as indicators for the sustainable management of artificial lakes.																			1015-1621	1420-9055				JAN	2019	81	1							3	10.1007/s00027-018-0600-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-018-0600-5													WOS:000448944600003

The Daqing River, which is the largest pollutant contributor to the Dianchi Lake, one of the most eutrophic freshwater lakes in China, was taken for the case study. It was found that the SBCOP had higher adaptability and better performance in the reduction of COD, TN, and TP, which made it applicable for the treatment of polluted river water entering the Dianchi Lake. Nitrification rate was observed to be greatly affected by the influent temperature. During each season, the nitrification in the SBCOP was higher than that in the IBCOP. TN removal efficiency in the SBCOP was higher than that in the IBCOP during the winter and spring but poorer during the summer, possibly due to the inhibition of denitrification by higher dissolved oxygen level in the summer. Moreover, symbiotic algae-bacteria growth may be conducive to the removal of pollutants.

Anatomy of Summertime Upslope Events in Northeastern Colorado: Ammonia (NH3) Transport to the Rocky Mountains	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The Transport and Transformation of Ammonia (TRANS2Am) airborne field campaign occurred over northeastern Colorado during the summers of 2021 and 2022. A subset of the TRANS2Am flights investigated easterly wind conditions capable of moving agricultural emissions of ammonia (NH3) through urban areas and into the Rocky Mountains. TRANS2Am captured 6 of these events, unveiling important commonalities. (1) NH3 enhancements are present over the mountains on summer afternoons when easterly winds are present in the foothills region. (2) The abundance of gas-phase NH3 is 1 and 2 orders of magnitude higher than particle-phase NH4 + over the mountains and major agricultural sources, respectively. (3) During thermally driven circulation periods, emissions from animal husbandry sources closer to the mountains likely contribute more to the NH3 observed over the mountains than sources located further east. (4) Transport of plumes from major animal husbandry sources in northeastern Colorado westward across the foothills requires similar to 5 h. (5) Winds drive variability in the transport of NH3 into nearby mountain ecosystems, producing both direct plume transport and recirculation. A similar campaign in other seasons, including spring and autumn, when synoptic scale events can produce sustained upslope transport, would place these results in context.

J	DICKMAN, M; STEWART, K; SERVANTVILDARY, M				DICKMAN, M; STEWART, K; SERVANTVILDARY, M			SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY OF SUMMER PHYTOPLANKTON AND WATER CHEMISTRY IN A LARGE VOLCANIC SPRING-FED LAKE IN NORTHERN ICELAND	ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Myvatn, Iceland, is the only lake in the world where diatomite is dredged commercially. Although we anticipated an enormous production of planktonic diatoms at the peak of the summer production cycle in mid-July, upon analysis of our samples, we realized that less than 5% of the phytoplankton standing crop was composed of diatoms. Benthic, rather than planktonic diatom species, appeared to be the key primary producers in the lake. The phytoplankton assemblage was dominated by Chlorophyta (green algae), Cyanophyta (blue-green algae), and Chrysophyta (yellow-green algae). The relative absence of planktonic diatoms in this shallow lake (mean depth less than 2.5 m) was associated with the presence of dense stands of macrophytes, which appeared to limit local turbulence. The spatial heterogeneity in phytoplankton abundance and species composition was correlated with the spatial distribution of nutrients in this volcanic spring-fed lake. Phytoplankton abundance was highest where warm spring waters from the north basin flowed into the eastern channel and mixed with the cold spring nutrient-rich waters coming from the southeastern comer of the lake. Intermediate nutrient levels were found in the center of the lake where relatively high phytoplankton standing crops of chrysophytes (Chrysochromulina and Dinobryon), cyanophytes (Anabaena and Gloeocystis), and colonial chlorophytes (Sphaeorocystis, Oocystis, and Pediastrum) developed during the annual phytoplankton production peak. During this mid-summer peak in primary production, nitrogen, rather than phosphorus appeared to be the ''limiting'' nutrient.																			0004-0851					AUG	1993	25	3					228	239		10.2307/1551819	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1551819													WOS:A1993LU32400011
J	Levine, SN; Shambaugh, AD; Pomeroy, SE; Braner, M				Levine, SN; Shambaugh, AD; Pomeroy, SE; Braner, M			Phosphorus, nitrogen, and silica as controls on phytoplankton biomass and species composition in Lake Champlain (USA-Canada)	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The long-standing assumption that the phytoplankton in Lake Champlain are phosphorus limited was tested through measurement of physiological indicators of phosphorus status (alkaline phosphatase activity and orthophosphate turnover time) and enrichment experiments conducted four times during the growth season. Phosphorus addition to experimental carboys incubated 4-5 days in situ substantially increased phytoplankton biomass relative to controls in June, but had only a mild impact in July and September, and no effect in May. Nitrogen addition augmented biomass in one of four experiments (in June), while silica had no impact at anytime. In summer and fall, addition of N and P in combination always yielded more phytoplankton biomass than singular P addition. In spring, even combined addition of N, P, and Si failed to stimulate phytoplankton growth. The phytoplankton groups responding to fertilization were largely the same as those that flourished in controls (diatoms and green algae), suggesting that enclosure was a more powerful determinant of species composition than nutrient inputs. Orthophosphate turnover times and levels of alkaline phosphatase activity in the lake indicated spatial and temporal variability in phytoplantkon P status, with P sufficiency as common as P deficiency. We conclude that multiple interacting factors influence the abundance and species composition of phytoplankton in Lake Champlain. In spring, phytoplankton growth is not limited by N, Si, or P, but by some factor yet to be determined (perhaps light or temperature). In summer, P is the principal limiting nutrient, but N exerts an influence that deserves further investigation.																			0380-1330						1997	23	2					131	148		10.1016/S0380-1330(97)70891-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(97)70891-8													WOS:A1997XK45800002

Gizzard shad put a freeze on winter mortality of age-0 yellow perch but not white perch	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Four decades of observations on the limnology and fishes of Oneida Lake, New York, USA, provided an opportunity to investigate causes of mortality during winter, a period of resource scarcity for most juvenile fishes, in age-0 yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and age-0 white perch (Morone americana). This time series contains several environmental (e.g., winter severity) and biological (e.g., predator abundance) signals that can be used to disentangle multiple effects on overwinter mortality of these fishes. A multiple regression analysis indicated that age-0 yellow perch winter mortality was inversely related to fish length in autumn and to the abundance of alternative prey (gizzard shad [Dorosoma cepedianum] and white perch). However, no length-selective predation of yellow perch by one of the main predators, adult walleye (Sander vitreus), was detected. In contrast, white perch mortality was directly associated with total predator biomass and abundance of white perch in autumn,. and inversely related to yellow perch abundance as a potential buffer species, but not to the abundance of gizzard shad. Winter severity was not a significant predictor of mortality for either perch species. Predicted winter starvation mortality, from a model described in the literature, was much lower than observed mortality for yellow perch. Similar models for white perch were correlated with observed mortality. These results collectively suggest that predation is the main mechanism shaping winter mortality of yellow perch, while both predation and starvation may be important for white perch. This analysis also revealed that gizzard shad buffer winter mortality of yellow perch. Although winter duration determines the northern limit of fish distributions, in mid-latitude Oneida Lake and for these species, predator-prey interactions seem to exert a greater influence on winter mortality than starvation.																			1051-0761	1939-5582				AUG	2006	16	4					1487	1501		10.1890/1051-0761(2006)016[1487:GSPAFO]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/1051-0761(2006)016[1487:GSPAFO]2.0.CO;2								16937813					WOS:000239726700020

Stable Water Isotopes Reveal Effects of Intermediate Disturbance and Canopy Structure on Forest Water Cycling	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Forests play an integral role in the terrestrial water cycle and link exchanges of water between the land surface and the atmosphere. To examine the effects of an intermediate disturbance on forest water cycling, we compared vertical profiles of stable water vapor isotopes in two closely located forest sites in northern lower Michigan. At one site, all canopy-dominant early successional species were stem girdled to induce mortality and accelerate senescence. At both sites, we measured the isotopic composition of atmospheric water vapor at six heights during three seasons (spring, summer, and fall) and paired vertical isotope profiles with local meteorology and sap flux. Disturbance had a substantial impact on local water cycling. The undisturbed canopy was moister, retained more transpired vapor, and at times was poorly mixed with the free atmosphere above the canopy. Differences between the disturbed and undisturbed sites were most pronounced in the summer when transpiration was high. Differences in forest structure at the two sites also led to more isotopically stratified vapor within the undisturbed canopy. Our findings suggest that intermediate disturbance may increase mixing between the surface layer and above-canopy atmosphere and alter ecosystem-atmosphere gas exchange.

J	Noordhuis, R; van der Molen, DT; van den Berg, MS				Noordhuis, R; van der Molen, DT; van den Berg, MS			Response of herbivorous water-birds to the return of Chara in Lake Veluwemeer, the Netherlands	AQUATIC BOTANY												Water-birds were almost absent from Lake Veluwemeer during the 1970s and 1980s, due to low food availability related to eutrophication. Several restoration measures have resulted in the recolorlization of the lake by Chara spp. during the 1990s. Bird numbers in autumn and winter have increased along with charophyte biomass. Linear regression analysis was used to relate bird numbers to the abundance of their potential food sources Chara, pondweeds, filamentous macro-algae (FA) and zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) within the depth range available to each species. Numbers of mute swan (Cygnus olor), pochard (Aythya ferina), tufted duck (A. fuligula), coot (Fulica atra) (R(2) greater than or equal to 0.98), gadwall (Anas strepera) (R(2) = 0.78), Bewick's swan (Cygnus columbianus) (R(2) = 0.79), red-crested pochard (Netta rufina) (R(2) = 0.76) and pintail (Anas acuta) (R(2) = 0.38) showed significant correlations with these food sources. Chara biomass explained most of the variance in all species except for gadwall. Both bird numbers and their duration of stay were closely associated with the presence of Chara. Grazing pressure was low during spring and summer and Chara colonized the lake in spite of consumption. It is argued that birds did not slow down colonization of the lake by Chara during the 1990s, but may have accelerated succession from pondweeds Potamogeton spp. to charophytes. As more birds foraged on Chara compared to any other food resource, the preservation of large areas of Chara is of great importance to the water-bird community in Lake Veluwemeer.

This conclusion is supported by dissolved inorganic nutrient ratios, seston elemental composition, nutrient enrichment bioassay experiments, and blooms of N2-fixing algae. However, the degree of N limitation expressed during the three years varied considerably. A comparison of interannual patterns of N limitation with weather data collected at the lake suggests that differences among years can be attributed to climatic variations. Our study indicates that climatic variations affect N availability by altering the timing of winter deep mixing, varying the potential for upwelling during spring, and varying the rate of spring warming of surface waters. Summer wind patterns also appear to be an integral factor controlling initiation, development, and collapse of the annual bloom of Nodularia spumigena, a N2-fixing blue-green alga. The results of this study emphasize the need to consider climatic variations in assessing the general nutrient status of lakes.																			0706-652X					APR	1994	51	4					862	872		10.1139/f94-085	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f94-085													WOS:A1994NR09800011

Kolby			Atmospheric teleconnection influence on North American land surface phenology	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Short-term forecasts of vegetation activity are currently not well constrained due largely to our lack of understanding of coupled climate-vegetation dynamics mediated by complex interactions between atmospheric teleconnection patterns. Using ecoregion-scale estimates of North American vegetation activity inferred from remote sensing (1982-2015), we examined seasonal and spatial relationships between land surface phenology and the atmospheric components of five teleconnection patterns over the tropical Pacific, north Pacific, and north Atlantic. Using a set of regression experiments, we also tested for interactions among these teleconnection patterns and assessed predictability of vegetation activity solely based on knowledge of atmospheric teleconnection indices. Autumn-to-winter composites of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) were strongly correlated with start of growing season timing, especially in the Pacific Northwest. The two leading modes of north Pacific variability (the Pacific-North American, PNA, and West Pacific patterns) were significantly correlated with start of growing season timing across much of southern Canada and the upper Great Lakes. Regression models based on these Pacific teleconnections were skillful predictors of spring phenology across an east-west swath of temperate and boreal North America, between 40 degrees N-60 degrees N. While the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) was not strongly correlated with start of growing season timing on its own, we found compelling evidence of widespread NAO-SOI and NAO-PNA interaction effects. These results suggest that knowledge of atmospheric conditions over the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans increases the predictability of North American spring phenology. A more robust consideration of the complexity of the atmospheric circulation system, including interactions across multiple ocean basins, is an important step towards accurate forecasts of vegetation activity.

J	Lazzaretti-Ulmer, MA; Hanselmann, KW				Lazzaretti-Ulmer, MA; Hanselmann, KW			Seasonal variation of the microbially regulated buffering capacity at sediment-water interfaces in a freshwater lake	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The consequences of microbial mineralization activities on the water chemistry of the sediment-water interface was studied at two sampling sites in the southern basin of the eutrophic Lake Lugano (Lago di Lugano). Water samples were collected with the aid of dialysis pore water samplers during three seasonally different time periods: in spring, after complete mixing of the water column had occured, and in summer and fall, while the water masses were stratified. The concentration profiles of dissolved inorganic carbon, methane, acid-neutralizing capacity, pH and total dissolved calcium in the interstitial water showed strong seasonal as well as spatial variations as deep as 10 to 15 cm below the sediment surface. Gradients of dissolved inorganic carbon and of methane indicate intense release of CO2 and methane respectively in the deeper layers of the sediment. During thermal stratification, fluxes of dissolved calcium from the sediment into the lake and release of calcium from sediment surface layers are suggested by the slope of the calcium gradients. In contrast, the gradients of total dissolved magnesium in the sediment as well as in the sediment-near water showed no significant seasonal variation at both sampling sites. The changes in acid-neutralizing capacity and pH in the top sediment layers are consequences of intense microbial mineralization processes, which occur in the sediment surface layers and in the hypolimnion adjacent to it. Larger fluctuations between spring overturn and fall stratification are partially buffered by calcium carbonate dissolution.																			1015-1621						1999	61	1					59	74		10.1007/s000270050052	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s000270050052													WOS:000078830900004

The lake underwent strong eutrophication during this period. The response of annual average phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll-a to the increase of phosphorus concentration from 10 to > 100 mug l-1 was moderate (7-fold increase). This is caused by light limitation of the system because of the high inorganic turbidity of the lake. Analyses of the spring, summer and autumn seasons at the generic and higher taxonomic levels show significant changes in composition of the phytoplankton community. Diatoms were more important during the pre-eutrophication phase while Chlorophyceae became most prominent during the peak of the eutrophication process. Blue-green algae, including Microcystis, became more apparent after this period. The abundance of some groups or genera, e.g. Euglena, was linked to the decline and re-appearance of submerged macrophytes in the lake. Abiotic and biotic interactions as causes for the observed changes are discussed.					; Padisak, Judit/B-4514-2008; Dokulil, Martin/J-3464-2019	Dokulil, Martin/0000-0002-6369-1457; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB 25	1994	275						125	137		10.1007/BF00026705	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00026705													WOS:A1994NB19800012

The TEX86-derived temperature showed an intense cooling in the last glacial period, whereas U-37(K)-derived spring sea surface temperature (SST) and foraminiferal Mg/Ca-derived summer SST showed a much smaller-scale cooling. The difference between the TEX86- and Mg/Ca-derived temperatures was around 14 degrees C from 19 to 16 ka and abruptly decreased to around 5 degrees C from 16 to 13 ka. This suggests a strong winter cooling of the surface water during the last glacial period. TEX86-,U-37(K')-, and Mg/Ca-derived temperatures were lowest at 18-17 ka, implying that the formation of cold water was maximized during that period. These results show that the cold water mass developed in the northern Okinawa Trough during the last glacial and the Kuroshio branch did not fully enter the northern margin of the Okinawa Trough.

It was determined that the GSI values reached maximum in May and started decreasing after this month; the liver glycogen and condition factor values started decreasing after May when gonadal development is maximum. This decrease continued until June and then started increasing again. It was also determined that blood glucose values reached maximum when energy requirement is high and start to decrease after May when reproduction starts. In the summer, it was determined that glycogen and glucose reserves were at low levels when temperature is high. But they were at high levels at autumn and winter when the temperature is lower. Glycogen and glucose reserves generally showed parallel changes with oxygen reserves.

MDA concentrations were measured in the intestine in the spring and autumn of 2012 and in the gills in autumn. The aims of the study were to establish the type of contamination which provokes a more pronounced MDA increase, as well as the organ which more reliably reflects the occurrence of oxidative stress. MDA levels in the intestine in spring amounted to 3.29-155.8 nmol g(-1) and in autumn to 4.85-111.1 nmol g(-1), whereas MDA concentrations in the gills in autumn were 7.69-147.5 nmol g(-1). Stronger influence of organic contamination on development of oxidative stress was observed in both organs, as seen from higher median MDA concentrations in autumn in fish from the highly pesticide-contaminated Bregalnica River (gills 78.4 nmol g(-1); intestine 23.5 nmol g(-1)) compared to the highly metal-contaminated Zletovska River (gills 15.9 nmol g(-1); intestine 17.4 nmol g(-1)). The response of the gills to contamination was twice stronger than that of the intestine. The majority of fish from the pesticide-polluted river had increased MDA in the gills, in contrast to only sporadically increased MDA in the intestine. Our results indicated that development of oxidative stress strongly depends on the selected fish organ and that the gills seem to be a better choice for monitoring oxidative stress than the intestine, due to their continuous and direct exposure to polluted river water.					; Valić, Damir/AAJ-1602-2021; Mihaylov, Vassil/F-4028-2017; Marijić, Vlatka/AAE-5365-2021	Dragun, Zrinka/0000-0002-1289-0114; Rebok, Katerina/0000-0002-8622-0316; Jordanova, Maja/0000-0002-6272-0738													0944-1344	1614-7499				JUL	2017	24	20					16917	16926		10.1007/s11356-017-9305-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-9305-x								28577140					WOS:000405580000032

Eared Grebes numbers averaged similar to 250,000 daily during the spring migration (April and May). During summer and winter, few Eared Grebes were on GSL, but they reappeared during the fall staging period when Eared Grebe numbers averaged 968,000 in September, 320,000 in October, and 524,000 in November. Our aerial counts underestimated the total number of Eared Grebes on GSL but still provided an accurate index for how their numbers vary throughout the year. From 2012 through 2021, 582 Eared Grebes were collected from GSL for another study, but the carcasses were analyzed for this study to determine morphological changes related to migration. Males outnumbered females, and adults were 4 times more common than juveniles. Males weighed 7% more than females, while adults and juveniles did not differ in mass. When Eared Grebes first arrived on GSL during August, they weighed 330-350 g, but mean body mass increased to 525 g by 16 October. In December, mean body mass declined to 474 g, liver mass by 72%, stomach mass by 56%, and stomach contents by 87% to reduce wing loading during migration. The morphological changes that we observed on GSL were similar to those observed among Eared Grebes on Mono Lake, California.

Mesocosm experiment driven modeling zooplankton seasonal dynamic approach in the trophic cascade	WATER RESEARCH												Eutrophication leads to algae blooms and reduces the transparency of water bodies, which seriously affects water quality and ecosystem equilibrium, especially in shallow water body ecosystems (SWE). Controlling foodwebs by manipulating fish and macrophytes provides a feasible method to mitigate the effects of eutrophication. The response of zooplankton as the primary consumer to biomanipulation is mostly conceptualized and lacks detailed observation. Mesocosm experiments that altered the biomass of planktivorous fish and macrophytes were set up and their boundary conditions were extended into a series of scenarios for modeling biomanipulation. Thus, this study utilizes a one-dimensional lake ecosystem model Water Ecosystems Tool (WET) which considered each zooplankton group: rotifers, cladocerans, and copepods, to predict the seasonal dynamic effects of biomanipulation on zooplankton in SWE, and the model results are analyzed in comparison with the mesocosm results. Observed data from mesocosm experiments set up in a temperate pond, including water temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll a (Chl a), macrophytes, zooplankton, and fish, were used to calibrate and validate the models. The modeled results showed that in spring and summer zooplanktivorous fish removal would increase all three categories of zooplankton and consequently cause a decrease of phytoplankton, whilst an increase in fish biomass would increase phytoplankton, and concomitantly water turbidity. However, in autumn, rotifers and phytoplankton increased in response to fish removal, but cladocerans and copepods decreased, 27% and 41%, respectively. Across all three vegetated seasons, increasing the biomass of macrophytes revealed a similar pattern: all three categories of zooplankton increased and phytoplankton subsequently decreased. Our study proposes a "fish-zooplankton-macrophytephytoplankton" trophic cascade and quantitatively predicts the dynamics of each zooplankton group under biomanipulation through this pathway, and provides support for establishing macrophyte beds and removing zooplanktivorous fish (in spring and summer) as an effective approach to mitigate eutrophication.					; Spoljar, Maria/AAZ-8174-2020; Zhang, Chen/G-9555-2016; Kuczyńska-Kippen, Natalia/AAC-1955-2022; Fressl, Jelena/AAE-8881-2022; Tomljanović, Tea/ACO-2621-2022	Spoljar, Maria/0000-0003-1006-8300; Zhang, Chen/0000-0003-3212-4270; Kuczynska-Kippen, Natalia/0000-0002-0513-9461; 													0043-1354	1879-2448				SEP 1	2023	243								120364	10.1016/j.watres.2023.120364	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2023.120364		JUL 2023						37473510					WOS:001048603600001

Analysis of the principal meteorological variables showed significant nearshore and midlake differences especially after the period of ice break-up in June to mid-July In one case, high winds generated wind stresses up to 0.45 N m(-2) and significant wave heights up to 4 m. Thermal structure varied between nearshore and midlake regions. High winds significantly disrupted developing thermal stratification in early spring by deepening the midlake upper mixed layer from 5 to 20 m depth. Evaporation was highly episodic, varied up to eight times between nearshore and offshore stations. During spring, much of the energy receipt was used to heat the lake. During summer, the total surface heat flux was significantly affected by the episodic evaporative flux. Heat content analyses showed that rapid lake heating occurred from lune to early August (approximately 3.395 x 10(17) J d(-1)) followed by gradual heat loss from mid-August through to the end of December (approximately 1.730 x 10(17) J d(-1)). The annual range of heat content was 2.543 x 10(19) J.

Variability of hydrological connectivity and fish dynamics in a wide subtropical-temperate floodplain	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Fish are subject to diverse stimulus in floodplain rivers resulting from interactions between environmental factors. In such complex and interconnected ecosystems, fish assemblages are thus highly dynamic across space and time. Here, we analysed fish assemblage structures in lotic/lentic habitats of a geomorphic unit of the Middle Parana River during summer, autumn, and winter of seven consecutive years. We observed that three main factors trigger significant structural changes: seasonality, habitat characteristics, and floodplain connectivity. The last one appears to have a determinant role on fish structures. Processes of connection/isolation of floodplain environments produced significant variations in fish abundance and species richness. Main results showed that some ecological processes can be largely explained by connectivity variations, such as fish dispersal in the floodplain, fish concentration in remnant floodplain lakes, and migrations back to permanent floodplain water bodies. This study provided a quantitative measurement of connectivity to understand fish dynamics in a giant floodplain and highlights the importance of similar investigations to preserve the fish fauna in these rather unique ecosystems.					; Blettler, Martin/K-3795-2017	Abrial, Elie/0000-0003-4563-5512; Blettler, Martin/0000-0001-5837-5241; Rabuffetti, Ana Pia/0000-0003-0106-0876; Paira, Aldo Raul/0000-0002-9948-6711													1535-1459	1535-1467				NOV	2019	35	9					1520	1529		10.1002/rra.3517	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.3517													WOS:000497790000013

We analyze the climate simulated by CCM3/IBIS with fixed vegetation conditions and we compare it to the climate simulated by the standard CCM3, which includes the LSM (land surface model) land-surface package. Important differences between the two models include simple parametrizations of lakes, wetlands and crops in CCM3/LSM not taken into account in CCM3/IBIS. CCM3/IBIS and CCM3/LSM share common biases (compared to observations) in the temperature field in boreal winter and in the precipitation field annually, making the atmospheric model the most probable cause of those biases. The models differ in the temperature field and surface energy balance in the Sahara annually and in the mid-to high latitudes from spring through fall. CCM3/IBIS simulates global annual air temperatures that are on average 1.7 degreesC higher than CCM3/LSM and 0.5 degreesC higher than the observed climatology. Differences in albedo and/or snow parametrization explain most of the Sahara and high-latitude temperature disagreement. Our sensitivity study with CCM3/LSM shows that the presence of lakes and wetlands in CCM3/LSM can account for about half of the difference in temperature in summer over the lake and wetland regions of the mid-latitudes. A second sensitivity study shows that higher surface roughness length in CCM3/IBIS can also explain part of the difference in summer surface temperature in the mid-latitudes. Surface roughness length affects the surface temperature through a feedback mechanism linking surface wind speed, planetary boundary layer height, low level cloudiness and radiation.

J	ASSOULINE, S				ASSOULINE, S			ESTIMATION OF LAKE HYDROLOGIC BUDGET TERMS USING THE SIMULTANEOUS SOLUTION OF WATER, HEAT, AND SALT BALANCES AND A KALMAN FILTERING APPROACH - APPLICATION TO LAKE KINNERET	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The Lake Kinneret hydrologic budget includes two unknown terms: evaporation losses Q(e), and inflow from hot saline springs which represent the groundwater component, Q(s). This last term affects also the salt budget as well as the energy budget of the lake, which is, in turn, the basis for evaporation estimates. A new approach consisting of the simultaneous solution of the water, heat, and salt balance equations is presented to evaluate Q(e) and Q(s). This approach gives a better estimation of evaporation, since it accounts for the net energy advected to the lake. Neglecting this term led to overestimation of evaporation during the dry winter of 1991 and to underestimation during the whole year of 1992, which was particularly rainy. The maximal monthly error occurred for both years in February: +55% for 1991, and -29% for 1992. The application of the approach to the period of 1988-1991 shows that the annual hydrograph of the saline springs system is characterized by two distinct periods of high discharge during each year. The first period, in winter, seems to be related to the structure and timing of the rainfall season. The second occurs generally at the beginning of the summer, after the rainfall season has ended. The overall trend for the period is declining peaks and annual discharges, which is consistent with the hydrologic impact of a 3-year drought since 1989. The measured, as well as the estimated, components of the water balance equation are subject to uncertainty. The formulation of the balance equation in terms of a state-space system and the application of the Kalman filter (KF) allows quantifying the effect of this uncertainty on the different components. Therefore for given noise statistics and a priori data, it is possible to determine the optimal linear estimates of the estimated components and to compare them to the values resulting from the simultaneous solution approach. The method was applied on monthly water budgets for a period of 60 months. The effect on evaporation varies within a range of +/-5%. The estimate of runoff from the ungauged part of the direct watershed was generally increased by the KF, especially during the rainy winter of 1988. The effect on this estimate varies within a range of +/-12%. The component that was affected the most is the estimated discharge from the saline springs system (+/-15%). The KF increases by 15% the winter peak of 1988 and decreases all the discharges estimates for the dry years, especially those of 1990. Therefore the stochastic approach strengthens the agreement between the trends in the estimated values and in the climatic conditions during the period studied,																			0043-1397	1944-7973				SEP	1993	29	9					3041	3048		10.1029/93WR01181	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/93WR01181													WOS:A1993LW05700009

Feeding ecology and prey selection of sand smelt, Atherina boyeri Risso, 1810 in Eirdir Lake (southern Anatolia, Turkey)	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												Feeding ecology and prey selection of sand smelt (Atherina boyeri, Risso, 1810) were investigated by taking monthly samples (January to December 2010) at four stations of Lake Eirdir, (Turkey) using gill nets (mesh sizes 10-100mm) and purse-seines (mesh size 6mm). A total of 49 out of 612 analysed stomachs were empty (8.01%); stomach contents included eight major prey categories: zooplankton, phytoplankton, Arachnida, Arthropoda, Insecta, fishes as well as unidentified organisms and remains. Dominant prey items included cladocerans (Bosmina longirostris [% N=67.92], Alona quadrangularis [% N=5.06]), copepods (Nitokra hibernica [% N=9.30], Mesocyclops leuckarti [% N=3.35]), and arthropoda (Corophium curvispinum [% N=3.46]). The importance of Insecta, Arthropoda, fishes, and unidentified eggs increased in the diet with increasing size of the sand smelt, whereas the contribution of Cladocera and Copepoda decreased. Sand smelt strongly preferred B.longirostris (selectivity index V=0.639, (2)=81.689, p<.01), N.hibernica (V=0.205, (2)=8.429, p<.01), and A.quadrangularis (V=0.159, (2)=5.039, p<.01) despite their low abundance in the environment. Atherina boyeri (V=-0.699, (2)=97.812, p<.01), Aphanius anatoliae (V=-0.328, (2)=21.463, p<.01), Insecta (V=-0.229, (2)=10.497, p<.01), and Keratella cochlearis (V=-0.265, (2)=14.009, p<.01) were the most abundant prey in the environment, however they were negatively selected by sand smelt. Knipowitschia caucasica, Asplanchna priodonta, Trichocerca sp., Lecane sp., and Acaridae also inhabit the lake, but were not found in the sand smelt food items. Cladocerans dominated during autumn and winter, arthropods, copepods, rotifers and phytoplankton in spring, whereas Insecta and fishes were dominant in summer.

Effective management strategies need an accurate evaluation of the water quality parameters, and inferences extracted from the data should be based on the most appropriate statistical methods. Conventional water quality indices (WQI) being related to a large number of water quality parameters results in significant variability and analytical costs. The focus of this study was to develop a remodeled water quality index (WQI(min)) based on the localized trends in water quality and demonstrate it to understand water quality variations of Dal Lake (a freshwater lake in the Himalayan region). Spatio-temporal changes and trends of 14 water quality parameters were investigated that were arbitrated from the samples collected at 11 sampling locations during the water quality monitoring across the Dal Lake from September 2017 to August 2020. The results signify that the general mean WQI value was 81.9, and seasonal average WQI values ranges from 79.44 to 84.55. The water quality showed seasonal variance, with lowest values in summer, succeeded by autumn and winter, and highest in spring. Moreover, the results from stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that the WQI(min) significantly correlates with six water quality parameters (ammonia, dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand, temperature, turbidity, and nitrate) in Dal Lake. The WQI(min) model predicted the water quality of the Dal Lake with a coefficient of determination (R-2) value of 0.96, root mean square error (RMSE) value of 4.1, and percentage error (PE) of 5.3%. The developed WQI(min) model can be applied as a cost-effective and efficacious approach to determine the water quality of fresh surface water bodies.

J	Baldwin, CM; Beauchamp, DA; Van Tassell, JJ				Baldwin, CM; Beauchamp, DA; Van Tassell, JJ			Bioenergetic assessment of temporal food supply and consumption demand by salmonids in the Strawberry Reservoir food web	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												This study quantified temporal, spatial, and ontogenetic trophic interactions in Strawberry Reservoir to determine whether salmonid sport fish production was limited by food supply or predation. We combined field data on growth, diet composition, distribution, abundance, survival, and thermal experience with species-specific bioenergetics models for salmonids in Strawberry Reservoir to quantify monthly consumption of all prey fish, Daphnia, and macroinvertebrates. Fish prey represented a minor fraction of the annual diet of large cutthroat Oncorhynchus clarki and rainbow trout O. mykiss, but acute episodic piscivory associated with stocking of juvenile cutthroat trout in autumn could account for the low (1%) initial survival of these hatchery cohorts in recent years. Daphnia and other macroinvertebrates were important to all species and size-classes of salmonids. Model simulations suggested that salmonid consumption represented 5-30% of the Daphnia biomass during the June-October growing season in 1996-1997, but planktivorous demand exceeded Daphnia biomass in late winter. The bottleneck in prey supply during late winter and early spring suggests that Daphnia may not be able to support community consumption during this period if planktivore populations increase, either as a result of the expanding cyprinid populations or as a result of increased salmonid stocking or recruitment. Defining the role and impact of piscivorous and planktivorous trophic interactions provided information for management decisions regarding stocking strategies, recruitment, carrying capacity, and other food web processes.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAR	2000	129	2					429	450		10.1577/1548-8659(2000)129<0429:BAOTFS>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(2000)129<0429:BAOTFS>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000088635900008

Diet overlap of non-native alewife with native yellow perch and spottail shiner in nearshore waters of southwestern Lake Michigan, 2000-2007	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Lake Michigan has experienced many ecological changes as a result of introductions of non-native species. Arguably the most significant was that of alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), yet studies on diet overlap with native species are lacking. We analysed diet trends of alewife, spottail shiner (Notropis hudsonius) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) collected in summer and fall 2000-2007 near Waukegan, IL, in 3-10 m depths. Mean percentage composition by dry weight for 23 prey taxa was used in multivariate analysis to test whether diet differed across species and size classes. We also tested whether zooplankton and benthic invertebrate community composition changed over time. Fish diets were similar over all years but differed seasonally. In summer, diets of large alewife were similar to both small alewife and small yellow perch, with Bosminidae, chironomid larvae and copepods as primary common prey. During fall, alewife and yellow perch size classes exhibited strong intraspecific diet overlap, while there was low diet overlap between species. Primary distinctions between species' diets in fall were higher consumption of amphipods by yellow perch and dreissenids by spottail shiners compared to alewife, which consumed higher proportions of zooplankton. Overall, high yellow perch diet overlap with alewife during summer and with their larger conspecifics during fall could lead to negative implications for yellow perch growth before the critical overwintering period. Detailed insights into diet overlap and prey availability are critical first steps in understanding competitive interactions between native and non-native fish that dominate the nearshore community in southwestern Lake Michigan.

J	Storen, EN; Kolstad, EW; Paasche, O				Storen, Eivind N.; Kolstad, Erik W.; Paasche, Oyvind			Linking past flood frequencies in Norway to regional atmospheric circulation anomalies	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Analysis of two continuous, high-resolution palaeo-flood records from southern Norway reveals that the frequency of extreme flood events has changed significantly during the Holocene. During the early and middle Holocene, flood frequency was low; by contrast, it was high over the last 2300 years when the mean flood frequency was about 2.53.0 per century. The present regional discharge regime is dominated by spring/summer snowmelt, and our results indicate that the changing flood frequency cannot be explained by local conditions associated with the respective catchments of the two lakes, but rather long-term variations of solid winter precipitation and related snowmelt. Applying available instrumental winter precipitation data and associated sea-level pressure re-analysis data as a modern analogue, we document that atmospheric circulation anomalies, significantly different from the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), have some potential in explaining the variability of the two different palaeo-flood records. Centennial-scale patterns in shifting flood frequency might be indicative of shifts in atmospheric circulation and shed light on palaeo-pressure variations in the North Atlantic region, in areas not influenced by the NAO. Major shifts are found at about 2300, 1200 and 200 years ago (cal. a BP). Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Simulations with a simple dynamic model indicated that reduced ice cover and increasing water temperatures resulted in a more intense and earlier bloom independently of phosphorous concentrations. However, whereas the collapse of the bloom was caused by silicate limitation under high phosphorus supply, it was caused by Daphnia grazing under reduced phosphorus supply. This switch from a bottom-up to a top-down driven collapse of the diatom spring bloom explains why, despite similarly mild winters, the bloom was observed earlier under high than under reduced phosphorus supply in the lake studied. Thus, an assessment of possible changes in nutrient loading is crucial when anticipating how phytoplankton could evolve under future climate warming.

J	Franchini, F; Lepori, F; Bruder, A				Franchini, Filippo; Lepori, Fabio; Bruder, Andreas			Improving estimates of primary production in lakes: a test and a case study from a peri-alpine lake (Lake Lugano)	INLAND WATERS												Although primary production (i.e., the carbon fixed by autotrophs through photosynthesis) is assessed extensively by limnologists, its measurement presents methodological challenges. The objectives of this study were to (1) address some of these challenges by proposing an improvement to current mathematical models used to calculate cumulative (e.g., seasonal or annual) production rates from instantaneous (e.g., hourly) production values, and (2) explore the response of primary production to 3 decades (1983-2014) of nutrient management in Lake Lugano (Switzerland and Italy) as a case study. Objective 1 was prompted by difficulties in estimating the photosynthetic parameters P-max(b), the maximum photosynthetic potential, and I-opt, the optimum light intensity, in days without photoinhibition. We developed a model extension to simulate these parameters from irradiance and total phosphorus (TP). To this end, we adapted equations previously used in marine studies and calibrated and tested them against values of primary production measured using the carbon-14 (C-14) light-and-dark bottle method during 1983-2014. A Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.53 and a ratio between the root mean square error and the standard deviation of the observed values (RSR) of 0.68 indicated a satisfactory performance of our model extension. Therefore, we suggest that our modelling approach presents a step toward a more precise quantitative estimate of primary production. Concerning objective 2, in Lake Lugano, annual rates of primary production (measured as C) declined by 21.26 mg m(-2) d(-1) from 1983 to 2014. The environmental drivers included TP in spring, summer, and autumn, and water temperature in winter. These results suggest that primary production in Lake Lugano was limited mainly by TP availability and therefore seemed to be responding to nutrient management.					; Bruder, Andreas/AFC-9051-2022; Lepori, Fabio/F-8966-2012	Lepori, Fabio/0000-0002-6438-9452; Franchini, Filippo Luciano Charly/0000-0002-6069-6682; Bruder, Andreas/0000-0002-4591-491X													2044-2041	2044-205X					2017	7	1					77	87		10.1080/20442041.2017.1294351	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2017.1294351													WOS:000405859800009

Model algorithms to simulate water quality variables such as chlorophyll a, dissolved organic matter, suspended matter, and Secchi depth are sensitive to the variations of this variable. The penetration depth for Taihu Lake in China, a shallow and turbid lake, was calculated by using a multiple scattering model, and in situ optical measurements were carried out during May and October 2010. The results show that: 1) the penetration depth generally increased from west to east during spring and from southeast to northwest during autumn, reflecting the prevailing wind direction and; 2) there was strong dependence of the penetration depth on the concentration of suspended matter.					ouyang, xiaoran/LVA-0223-2024														0254-4059	1993-5005				JUL	2013	31	4					907	916		10.1007/s00343-013-2284-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-013-2284-y													WOS:000321629400023
J	Zeng, ZX; Sun, JQ				Zeng, Zixuan; Sun, Jianqi			Enhanced relationship between February Aleutian low and spring extreme consecutive dry days in the Yangtze-Huai River region in recent two decades: roles of Bering Sea ice and stratospheric polar vortex	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												This study analyzes the interannual relationship between preceding winter Aleutian low (AL) and spring extreme consecutive dry days (extreme-CDDs) in the Yangtze-Huai River region (YHR) during 1979-2019. The results show that, independent from the El Nino-Southern Oscillation variability, a weakened AL in February is accompanied by more spring extreme-CDDs in YHR. Additionally, such a relationship shows a remarkable decadal enhancement after the late-1990s, in which the changes in the Bering Sea ice (BSI) and stratospheric polar vortex (SPV) play bridging roles. On the one hand, the weakened AL could lead to decreased BSI in spring during the whole period by inducing anomalous warm-moist air transport and the resultant radiation effect. After the late-1990s, the decreased BSI could cause a stronger anomalous high over Lake Baikal in spring by exciting an eastward propagated atmospheric wave train, favoring downward motions and more extreme-CDDs in YHR. On the other hand, after the late-1990s, the weakened AL could induce an intensified SPV persisting from late February to early spring by inhibiting the upward propagation of planetary wave. The SPV signal could in turn propagate downward to the troposphere, also contributing to anomalous high over Lake Baikal in spring and more extreme-CDDs in YHR. In contrast, the stratosphere-troposphere interaction associated with anomalous AL is weak before the late-1990s. Through the above-mentioned physical processes, the February AL could have a significantly lagged impact on spring extreme-CDDs in YHR after the late-1990s, consequently providing valuable prediction source for the variability of spring extreme-CDDs in YHR.					; Sun, Jianqi/A-7084-2016	Zeng, Zixuan/0000-0002-0054-3449; 													0930-7575	1432-0894				DEC	2023	61	11-12					5131	5146		10.1007/s00382-023-06844-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-023-06844-1		JUL 2023											WOS:001023998500002

Surge movement produced the highest recorded Karakoram glacier surface flow rate using feature tracking (similar to 18 +/- 0.5 m d(-1)) and resulted in a glacier frontal advance of 1495 +/- 47 m. The surge speed was less than reports of earlier Hasanabad advances during 1892/93 (9.3 km) and 1903 (9.7 km). Surges also occurred in 1973 and 2000-2001. Recent surges and lake evolution are examined using feature tracking in satellite images (1990-2019), DEM differencing (1973-2019), and thermal satellite data (2000-2019). The recent active phase of Shispare surge began in April 2018, showed two surface flow maxima in June 2018 and May 2019, and terminated following a GLOF on 22-23 June 2019. The surge likely had hydrological controls influenced in winter by compromised subglacial flow and low meltwater production. It terminated during summer probably because increased meltwater restored efficient channelized flow. We also identify considerable heterogeneity of movement, including spring/summer accelerations.					; Kumar, Amit/J-7539-2019; Govil, Himanshu/AAP-4403-2020; Chand, Pritam/H-5804-2016; Verma, Akshaya/AGO-4801-2022; Bhambri, Rakesh/AAI-2997-2020	Chand, Pritam/0000-0001-7388-0393; Haritashya, Umesh/0000-0001-9527-954X; Kumar, Amit/0000-0003-4827-5137; Govil, Himanshu/0000-0002-3433-8355; Bhambri, Rakesh/0000-0002-4777-894X; Verma, Akshaya/0000-0001-8876-9807													2045-2322					MAR 13	2020	10	1							4685	10.1038/s41598-020-61277-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-61277-8								32170170					WOS:000563438900013

This method allowed the examination of the stable part of the environment-rotifer relationship, and also, of the variations of this relationship through time and space. The inter-structure factor map obtained by the STATICO method showed that the relationship between the 9 environmental variables and the abundance of the 45 considered rotifer species was strongest in spring, and moderately strong in winter and summer. The pollution gradient (resulting from nutrient salts) was stronger during these seasons, which is linked to a resistant and very sensitive species gradient.

WINTERING ECOLOGY OF ADULT NORTH AMERICAN OSPREYS	JOURNAL OF RAPTOR RESEARCH												North American Ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) typically migrate long distances to their wintering grounds in the tropics. Beyond the general distribution of their wintering range (i.e., the Caribbean, South America, and Central America), very little is known about the wintering ecology of these birds. We used satellite telemetry to determine the duration of wintering period, to examine the characteristics of wintering areas used by Ospreys, and to quantify space use and activity patterns of wintering Ospreys. Adult Ospreys migrated to wintering sites and exhibited high wintering site fidelity among years. Overall, Ospreys wintered on river systems (50.6%) more than on lakes (19.0%), and use of coastal areas was (30.4%) intermediate. Ospreys remained on their wintering grounds for an average of 154 d for males and 167 d for females. Locations of wintering Ospreys obtained via GPS-capable satellite telemetry suggest these birds move infrequently and their movements are very localized (i.e. <5 km from selected roosting areas). Sizes of home ranges and core-use areas for wintering Ospreys averaged 12.7 km(2) and 1.4 km(2), respectively. Overall, our findings suggest wintering adult North American Ospreys are very sedentary, demonstrating a pattern of limited daily movements and high fidelity to a few select locations (presumably roosts). We suggest this wintering strategy might be effective for reducing the risk of mortality and maximizing energy conservation.

However, the changing patterns of the inflow sources of the lakes, i.e., rainfall and the melt water of snow and glaciers, and their response to climate change remain uncertain because obtaining accurate precipitation and melt water discharge is difficult due to the complex topography, spatial variability, and scarce stations of the alpine area. A distributed hydrological model, J2000, was employed in this study to simulate runoff component variations of the Yamzho Yumco Lake glaciated basin during 1974-2019. Except for observed daily runoff from two tributaries, a High Asia Refined (HAR) high-resolution reanalysis of precipitation data was combined with field precipitation gradient observation and snow cover area validation, all performed simultaneously to reduce the uncertainty of inflow components in the model. Results showed that the average runoff into the lake during 1974-2019 was 5.5 +/- 1.4 x 10(8) m(3)/10a, whereas rainfall runoff, glacier melt runoff, snowmelt runoff, and baseflow contributed to 54.6%, 10.8%, 1.8%, and 32.7% of total runoff in mean, respectively. Seasonal runoff in spring, summer, autumn, and winter accounted for 6.7%, 60.6%, 23.9% and 8.8% of annual total runoff, respectively. In glacial areas, the reduction in total runoff after removing the precipitation trend was 1.4 times than that of temperature, and in non-glacial areas, the reduction in total runoff after removing the precipitation trend was 1.6 times than the increase in total runoff after removing the temperature trend. The proportion of rainfall runoff increased at a rate of 1.0%/10a, whereas the proportion of melt runoff decreased at a rate of 0.07%/10a during the study period.					; Xiang, Yuxuan/AAS-2792-2021; Wang, Li/JHU-1855-2023; tang, handuo/HSA-8429-2023; Zeng, Chen/L-8924-2019; ZHANG, Hongbo/S-7439-2016; zhang, fan/E-2398-2018	, Chen/0000-0001-7431-0915; Wang, Li/0009-0001-0657-895X; zhang, fan/0000-0002-6714-9534														2073-4441				FEB	2023	15	3							490	10.3390/w15030490	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15030490													WOS:000930353900001
J	WISHART, RA				WISHART, RA			MOLT CHRONOLOGY OF AMERICAN WIGEON, ANAS-AMERICANA, IN RELATION TO REPRODUCTION	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												The moult chronology of American Wigeons (Anas americana) during their annual cycle in southwestern Canada was as follows: First-winter birds progressed asynchronously through the prealternate 1 moult but arrived on the breeding grounds in alternate 1 plumage. Adult males normally completed most of the prealternate moult by October. From January through April, adults underwent a partial moult of body contour feathers, which was more extensive in females than males. Males did not resume moult (prebasic) until after breeding, and most of it occurred following a moult migration to larger lakes and marshes in June and July. There, regimes were moulted simultaneously followed quickly by the prealternate moult before fall migration. Females underwent much of the prealternate moult (including down feathers) in late winter and during spring migration. Moult ceased during nesting in May and the prebasic moult did not occur until either nests failed (late June) or broods were abandoned (late July-August). Some females moulted on the breeding grounds, whereas others migrated to the same areas used by males. The moult chronology of individuals and sexes varies in relation to differences in their reproductive cycle.																			0008-3550						1985	99	2					172	178																WOS:A1985ARF7400006

DOC concentrations, stable carbon isotope values (delta C-13(DOC)), dissolved carbohydrates, and specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA(254)) were analyzed along with several environmental factors: water temperature, electrical conductivity (EC), chlorophyll a, and bacterial abundance. The highest DOC concentrations were observed in January 2013 at all sampling sites except at lake center. DOC concentrations decreased along both transects from the tributaries to the lake center in January 2013. In addition, the evidence from the positive correlation between DOC and EC in Lake Taihu suggests the input of river water into the lake. The variation in DOC concentration can be explained by temperature-dependent bacterial utilization of organic compounds. The delta C-13(DOC) values ranged from -26.9 parts per thousand to -23.4 parts per thousand in Lake Taihu and its tributaries, suggesting an influence of autochthonous sources and microbial utilization. There was no significant relationship between the ratio of total dissolved carbohydrates to dissolved organic carbon (TCHO/DOC) and bacterial abundance, indicating a complex bacterial metabolic effect on carbohydrates. The spectroscopic character of DOC shifted toward less humic material from autumn to winter and correlated positively with bacterial abundance, suggesting that humic substances might serve as a substrate for bacteria in Lake Taihu and its tributaries. These results demonstrate that DOC may originate from autochthonous and allochthonous sources and that the quantity and quality of DOC changes considerably during autumn and winter, with important effects on bacterial abundance.

Total meiobenthic abundance ranged from 69,700-1,300,000/m2 and total biomass ranged from 0.03-0.87 g/m2. Nematodes accounted for 80% of all individuals and 66% of the biomass. Most of the major groups peaked in late spring/summer, but some peaked in early spring and fall. With the exception of nematodes, mean annual densities varied from 2-fold to 12-fold at a given station. Harpacticoids, tardigrades and ostracods tended to be more abundant at the deep depths, while cyclopoids and cladocerans were less abundant. The abundance of nematodes and rotifers was not consistently related to sampling depth. Temporal and spatial variation in many of the groups appeared related to changes in the amount of bottom detritus. The overall macrobenthos:meiobenthos biomass ratio was 15:1 and ranged from 5:1-45:1 on an annual basis.																			0380-1330						1983	9	4					530	547		10.1016/S0380-1330(83)71926-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(83)71926-X													WOS:A1983RS94500010

Diet and feeding habits of Economidichthys pygmaeus (Perciformes: Gobiidae) in Lake Pamvotis, NW Greece	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												The purpose of the study was to define the diet composition, feeding preferences, seasonal, size and sex related changes in diet, feeding strategy and diel cycle of Economidichthys pygmaeus. Important features of the overall feeding patterns of the goby include (i) feeding activity, (ii) bottom habits and (iii) consumption of food items to identify the dietary breadth. Stomach contents of 533 specimens, 13.4248.65 mm total length (TL), collected by hand net (2 mm mesh size) from October 2006 to September 2007 were analyzed. The percentage of 76 empty stomachs (14.26%) did not vary significantly with season. The food composition suggested that the goby is a carnivorous fish. Prey items identified in the stomachs belonged to four major groups: Crustaceans, Insects, Mollusca and Plants. Copepods were the most important (%IRI = 57.51), especially in fish larger than 23 mm TL. Chironomids (%IRI = 43.23) constituted the main prey for fish <23 mm TL. Diet composition showed little seasonal variation. Copepoda dominated the diet in autumn and winter (43.4%; 82.4%) and were replaced by Chironomidae larvae in spring (39.7%) and summer (47.7%). During the reproductive season, large males show a narrow food spectrum as opposed to large females, reflecting the different activity pattern exhibited by males and females during the breeding season, since the former supports parental care. According to the modified Costello graphical method, specialist individuals form the goby population that feeds on two preferential prey types (e.g. Copepods, Chironomids). Nevertheless, they consume some occasional prey (e.g. Cladocera, Insects, Gastropods). The species foraged chiefly at night and early morning, during lower light intensity. The highest feeding activity recorded at night (02.00 hours) and during early morning (08.00 hours) could be related to the cryptic behaviour displayed by the species.

The sources of this aboveground vegetation sulfate include dry deposited aerosols and SO2, and mineralized plant organic S. Delta-S-34 data indicate that atmospheric S dominates the upland forest ecosystems of southern and central Ontario, with little S isotope fractionation. Seasonal delta-S-34 variations in precipitation sulfate may be due to mixing of bacteriogenic and anthropogenic S. Delta-O-18 and concentration data indicate that oxidation of dry-deposited SO2 and mineralization of organic S on vegetation surfaces may contribute one third or more of throughfall sulfate in summer and autumn, but less in late spring, perhaps due to foliar uptake of S during this season. Oxidized SO2 or mineralized organic S contributes one third or more of stemflow sulfate during these seasons.

Here we explore the intra-seasonal variability of autumn rainfall in the YRD and pre-evolution of related atmospheric circulations, which can help to improve intra-seasonal rainfall prediction skills in the autumn season. Intra-seasonal variability of autumn rainfall over the YRD exhibits two dominant timescales, a quasi-biweekly oscillation (QBWO) cycle associated with tropical cyclones, and an intra-seasonal oscillation (ISO) cycle controlled by large-scale atmospheric circulation. Considering the more stable and robust ISO than QWBO, the ISO is primarily addressed here. Two dominant ISO modes in autumn rainfall are identified by using an empirical orthogonal function analysis. The first ISO mode is characterized by a monopole with regional consistent rainfall anomalies (MP mode), whereas the second ISO mode has a meridional dipole structure with opposite rainfall anomalies over the south and north part of YRD (DP mode). These two ISO modes are modu-lated by the ISO propagation of atmospheric circulation in key areas, including the Bay of Bengal, the western North Pacific, and the Okhotsk Sea, from 25-day to 10-day lead when the rainfall mode is enhanced. The MP mode (regional enhanced rainfall) is related to regional active moist convection, strong western Pacific sub-tropical high (WPSH) and active cold air invasion via Lake Baikal. The DP mode (moist in the south and dry in the north) is accompanied by north-south convective dipoles, weak WPSH and inactive cold air outbreaks.					wei, xiaoli/AAO-7139-2021; Li, Jiayao/KJL-0230-2024; Ma, Yue/HOA-9225-2023	Yang, Hanwei/0000-0003-2801-1329; 													0169-8095	1873-2895				NOV	2022	278								106363	10.1016/j.atmosres.2022.106363	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2022.106363		JUL 2022											WOS:000842838500001

Ryan			Long-term changes in the autumn migration phenology of dabbling ducks in southern Ontario and implications for waterfowl management	WILDLIFE BIOLOGY												Delays in waterfowl autumn migration have been widely reported by hunters and ornithologists throughout North America. The implications of such delays are vast, with potential effects on the efficacy of population management, reduced social and economic opportunities, and reduced resource availability by overuse and over-grazing in key staging areas. In this study, we tested for changes in autumn migration timing for six abundant species of dabbling ducks in southern Ontario, Canada. We applied generalized linear mixed models to test for effects of year and climate indices El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on the Julian date of peak abundance as observed during aerial surveys conducted throughout the lower Great Lakes. Our analyses revealed delays of 11-18 days between 1968 and 2011 for four of six focal species: mallard, American black duck, American wigeon and gadwall. La Nina and El Nino events had no effect on migration timing for American black duck, American green-winged teal or American wigeon, while an increase in the annual NAO index resulted in a delayed migration for American wigeon. There was an NAO:ENSO interaction for mallard and gadwall migration; an increase in NAO advanced peak migration dates during La Nina events. However, an increase in NAO delayed migration for gadwall during the neutral phase of the ENSO and delayed migration for both species during El Nino events. Blue-winged teal and American green-winged teal showed no change in migration timing. Given that climate forecasts indicate continued positive-value phases, the autumn migrations for mallard, American black duck, gadwall and American wigeon may become increasingly delayed. Wildlife managers should use all available data, including from standardized aerial surveys, citizen science and climate models to inform and direct adaptive population management, hunting regulations, wildlife emergency response and habitat conservation.					; Roy, Christian/LWI-1524-2024	Roy, Christian/0000-0002-5599-6234; 													0909-6396	1903-220X					2020	2020	2							wlb.00668	10.2981/wlb.00668	http://dx.doi.org/10.2981/wlb.00668													WOS:000551432400022
J	Walker, D				Walker, D			Some physical and chemical features of two upland crater lakes in tropical north-eastern Australia	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Lakes Barrine and Eacham, similar to 1.0 and 0.5 km(2) area, 67 and 63 m depth respectively, lie at similar to 740 m a.s.l., similar to 17 degrees S in north-eastern Australia. Seasonal changes in their volumes modelled from meteorological data correspond well with observations at Eacham. Temperature profiles through 6 years show summer stratification with a metalimnion at 20-30 m; in winter, near isothermy is usually attained. At Barrine, thermal stability varies between winter and summer (<500 and >4000 g-cm cm(-2) respectively). Mixing is related to low ground temperatures during periods of generally low thermal stability; exceptionally it penetrates to >60 m. Oxygen saturation decreases from the surface to similar to 20% at the base of the euphotic zone (15-21 m) but oxygen is carried lower by mixing after which anoxia commonly rises to similar to 40 m. At Barrine, Fe-reducing redox (<200 mV) usually occurs below 50 m, but during mixing this boundary falls to within 1 m of the mud-water interface. The Barrine solution is dilute (total dissolved solids 55-58 mg L-1), and that of Eacham is more so. A concentrated monimolimnion has developed in the lowermost 2-3 m at Barrine but not at Eacham. Sedimentation at the middle of each lake results from the continuous deposition of open-water products punctuated by the redistribution of coarser detritus from the 'shallows' at times of deep mixing. The resultant laminations are preserved only at Barrine, protected by the chemical stability of the monimolimnion.																			1323-1650	1448-6059					1999	50	2					159	177		10.1071/MF97261	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF97261													WOS:000078908200009

We explored the seasonal structure and abundance of bacterial assemblages in SML (bacterioneuston) and underlying water layer (ULW) (bacterioplankton) in eutrophic marine Rogoznica Lake and more oligotrophic coastal area of the adjacent Adriatic Sea. SML and ULW in each site were similar in pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen, oxygen saturation, and temperature. Rogoznica Lake was colder in winter and warmer in summer compared to the Adriatic Sea. Regarding nutrients, SML and ULW were notably different environments. SML was consistently enriched in nitrate, nitrite, orthophosphate, and total organic carbon than ULW in both investigated environments. Except in spring in Rogoznica Lake, bacterial abundance in SML was also significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in ULW. Both layers and sites show prominent seasonal variability. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing of DNA and cDNA revealed a considerable difference in bacterial assemblage structure, although study sites were < 200 m apart. Heterotrophs were predominant in both layers with pronounced spatial and temporal structural differences, except in autumn in Rogoznica Lake when, autotrophs became the dominant fraction under oxygen-deprived conditions. All these variations were driven by in situ conditions, the most important ones being total organic carbon and temperature (and additionally dissolved oxygen in Rogoznica Lake). This is especially important in terms of ongoing eutrophication, warming and deoxygenation, noticed not only in the Adriatic Sea and Rogoznica Lake but globally as well. Therefore, further structural and physiological changes in bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton assemblages can be expected.					; Dupcic Radic, Iris/HKV-5854-2023; Dupčić Radić, Iris/HKV-5854-2023; Čanković, Milan/AAE-8702-2020; ciglenecki, irena/N-8792-2013	Cankovic, Milan/0000-0002-1679-8147; Ciglenecki, Irena/0000-0002-1873-6193; Dupcic Radic, Iris/0000-0001-8566-5631; 													0095-3628	1432-184X				NOV	2022	84	4					996	1010		10.1007/s00248-021-01934-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-021-01934-1		NOV 2021						34817641					WOS:000722138100001
J	Borgstrom, R; Museth, J				Borgstrom, R; Museth, J			Accumulated snow and summer temperature - critical factors for recruitment to high mountain populations of brown trout (Salmo trutta L.)	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												In lake Krokavatn, 1236 m a.s.l., only six strong year-classes of brown trout appeared during the period 1970-2003. Eleven year-classes were missing during the same period. The observed recruitment failure depended significantly on the accumulated snow depth in April, whereas the mean August temperature in the year of birth was significant for the appearance of strong year-classes. Size of the young-of-the-year (YOY) trout at onset of the winter seemed to be crucial for survival. Also little snow and low temperatures during the winter may have led to recruitment failure, as small nursery streams may freeze completely under such conditions, as happened during the winter of 1995/1996. Thus, the recruitment to brown trout populations in western high mountain areas of Norway seemed to be strongly affected by accumulated snow depth and summer temperatures. A climate change with more winter precipitation, as predicted for the present century, may therefore be detrimental to recruitment. However, warmer summers may increase recruitment to levels that lead to overpopulation, but also to establishment of brown trout populations at higher elevations than today.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				DEC	2005	14	4					375	384		10.1111/j.1600-0633.2005.00112.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2005.00112.x													WOS:000233141700008

Currently, research on the relationship between wetland landscape and water regime was mostly focused in autumns and winters in Poyang Lake, and lack of research in springs. Based on the nine high-resolution spring remote sensing images during 2000-2010, the classification characteristics of wetland landscape and spatial distribution pattern of vegetation and their succession trends in Poyang Lake were studied through quantitative interpretation technology and multivariate statistical analysis. Combined with water level fluctuations characteristics of the five monitoring hydrological stations (i.e., Hukou, Xingzi, Duzhan, Tangyin and Kangshan) at the Poyang Lake, the inter-annual and intra-annual water level variations of Poyang Lake were analyzed. The study was aimed to investigate the quantitative effects of water regime on the spring wetland landscape and spatial distribution pattern of vegetation and their succession trends in Poyang Lake. The results showed that: (1) the maximum scope of water levels of the five monitoring stations varied from 8.5 m to 13.57 m, and the water level of Poyang lake showed a downward trend, declining at an average rate of 0.16 m per year during 2000-2010; (2) the total area of the 10 types of the landscapes did not change significantly, which was always maintained at about 3026 km(2) and the total area of vegetation coverage showed increasing trend during 2000-2010 in Poyang Lake, with a maximum area in 2008 and a minimum area in 2010; (3) The water level change was consistent with the area of the lake water, and was inconsistent with the areas of the mudflat, vegetation and land-water transition zone. The highest linear fitting degree with water level was the area of the land-water transition zone, followed by the lake water and vegetation. The results were helpful to further explore the eco-hydrology process and its trend at Poyang Lake wetland, a scientific reference for the maintenance of stable ecosystem functions of the seasonal freshwater lake wetland.

J	KERLINGER, P				KERLINGER, P			THE MIGRATION OF COMMON LOONS THROUGH EASTERN NEW-YORK	CONDOR												Tracking radar and direct visual observations were employed to study the migration of common loons (G. immer) through eastern New York. Single birds and groups of up to 4 individuals flew at altitudes between 1500 and 2700 m (above sea level), usually above the turbulent convective layer. These migrants were not readily visible without the aid of binoculars and the tracking radar. Loons flew downwind toward the Atlantic coast in autumn (124.degree.) and toward the eastern end of Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River [Canada] in spring (347.degree.). Direction of migration was more variable in spring, possible owing to the greater variability of winds on flight days and destination of migrants. Loons never flew into headwinds. Strong westerly winds in autumn promoted higher groundspeeds than in spring. Mean airspeed was faster than that reported for most other species and did not vary in relation to following wind component as did groundspeed. Estimated flight time between Lake Ontario and the Atlantic coast of southern New England was between 3-4 h depending on wind velocity.																				1938-5129					1982	84	1					97	100		10.2307/1367828	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1367828													WOS:A1982NM07900012

The samples were collected from two catching areas that represent two different models of the aquatic ecosystem (El-MaIek-El-Saleh and Manzala lake). Data showed that DDT and its analogues were predominant in fish samples collected from Manzala lake.

Coupled long-term summer warming and deeper snow alters species composition and stimulates gross primary productivity in tussock tundra	OECOLOGIA												Climate change is expected to increase summer temperature and winter precipitation throughout the Arctic. The long-term implications of these changes for plant species composition, plant function, and ecosystem processes are difficult to predict. We report on the influence of enhanced snow depth and warmer summer temperature following 20 years of an ITEX experimental manipulation at Toolik Lake, Alaska. Winter snow depth was increased using snow fences and warming was accomplished during summer using passive open-top chambers. One of the most important consequences of these experimental treatments was an increase in active layer depth and rate of thaw, which has led to deeper drainage and lower soil moisture content. Vegetation concomitantly shifted from a relatively wet system with high cover of the sedge Eriophorum vaginatum to a drier system, dominated by deciduous shrubs including Betula nana and Salix pulchra. At the individual plant level, we observed higher leaf nitrogen concentration associated with warmer temperatures and increased snow in S. pulchra and B. nana, but high leaf nitrogen concentration did not lead to higher rates of net photosynthesis. At the ecosystem level, we observed higher GPP and NEE in response to summer warming. Our results suggest that deeper snow has a cascading set of biophysical consequences that include a deeper active layer that leads to altered species composition, greater leaf nitrogen concentration, and higher ecosystem-level carbon uptake.

In Lake Taihu, pollutant discharge standards have traditionally been quantified based on water environmental capacity, while neglecting the response characteristics of algal growth in different regions to boundary inputs. For that analysis, this study first estimated the river pollutant loadings of 16 most significant inflow and outflow rivers of Lake Taihu from 2008 to 2020 and explored the correlations between inflow water quality parameters and lacustrine chlorophyll-a levels. Results highlighted the significant influence of high river input of permanganate values in spring on the chlorophyll-a levels in the lake. Based on this, this study proposed the hypothesis that reducing the inflow concentration of permanganate in spring would inhibit algal growth, which was further validated using coupled hydrodynamic and ecological models. The simulation results indicated that the reduction of permanganate inflow concentration during spring would significantly decrease chlorophyll-a concentration in spring and summer, especially leading to a notable impact on peak values. However, due to variations in background concentrations among rivers, the extent of reduction in lake chlorophyll-a levels showed significant spatial differences. Additionally, analysis of extracted algal bloom areas revealed that there still remained a relatively high risk of algal blooms occurring in the main regions, particularly during autumn when inflow pollutant concentrations increased rapidly. These findings emphasized the importance of formulating reasonable exogenous reduction schemes, which should consider the concentration and variation trend of inflow pollutants, as well as the response characteristics of algal bloom growth in different lake zones to the boundary.

J	Bonvechio, TF; Allen, MS				Bonvechio, TF; Allen, MS			Relations between hydrological variables and year-class strength of sportfish in eight Florida waterbodies	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Hydrological variables have influenced fish recruitment in lakes, reservoirs and rivers. We evaluated how annual and seasonal hydrological variables were related to year-class strength (i.e., residuals from catch curves) of sportfish across eight Florida waterbodies (four rivers and four lakes). Multiple regression equations computed for black bass Micropterus spp. were combined across rivers and year-class strength was negatively related to spring median flow rates and in some cases positively related to winter median flow rates (all p less than or equal to 0. 10). Conversely, Lepomis spp. residuals combined from the rivers indicated that year-class strength was positively related to median flow rates in the fall prior to spawning and negatively related to post-spawn fall median flow rates (all p less than or equal to 0. 10). Fish recruitment combined across lakes were not related to water levels in this study, although within lake relationships did occur in some instances. Ecological implications of this work include regulations such as minimum flows and levels (MFLs) regarding sportfish species. Impacts of hydrology on year-class strength of sportfish were stronger in rivers than in lakes for these Florida systems. High flows at least once every 3 years in the fall may allow inundation of floodplain habitat, providing favorable environmental conditions for Lepomis spp. reproduction. Setting MFLs during periods of drought (i.e., 3 years or more) should consider impacts to short-lived species such as Lepomis spp.						Bonvechio, Timothy/0000-0003-2523-2345													0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN 1	2005	532						193	207		10.1007/s10750-004-1388-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-004-1388-y													WOS:000226928800017

Land Cover Switching in Autumn by Female Mallards in Ohio	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Autumn waterfowl habitat management often focuses on providing high energy food resources to attract and concentrate waterfowl for harvest. Similarly, many waterfowl conservation plans assume food resources are the primary, controllable limiting factor influencing waterfowl distribution during migration; however, hunting-related disturbance also influences waterfowl distribution in autumn. We investigated factors influencing mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) movements in an intensively hunted and food-rich landscape in Ohio, USA, during autumn of 2015 and 2016. We used locations from female mallards equipped with global positioning system (GPS) back-pack-transmitters to determine the probability of mallards switching land cover types based on seasonal and daily patterns of hunting disturbance and to determine the distances mallards moved between cover types that offer refuge and those that offer food resources as evidence for or against food resource depletion during the hunting season. Mallards switched cover types to exploit food-rich but intensively hunted locations nocturnally and cover type switching during times subject to disturbance increased significantly from the early segment to the late segment of hunting season. Distances mallards moved between refuge cover types and food-rich cover types did not change over the duration of the study. Hunting disturbance is a key variable influencing autumn movements and distribution of mallards, and mallards in a food-rich and intensively hunted landscape likely employ nocturnal foraging as a strategy to survive autumn migration. Nocturnal foraging behavior has consequences for waterfowl managers tasked with providing quality waterfowl hunting opportunities because ducks that forage only at night are largely unavailable to hunters.

The accepted view, based on summer conditions, is that the estuary's surface layer receives its nutrient supply from vertical mixing processes. This mixing is caused by the estuarine circulation and tides interacting with the topography at the head of the Laurentian Channel. During winter when ice forms, historical process-based studies have been limited in scope. Winter monitoring has been typically confined to vertical profiles of salinity and temperature as well as near-surface water samples collected from a helicopter for nutrient analysis. In 2018, however, the Canadian Coast Guard approved a science team to sample in tandem with its ice-breaking and ship escorting operations. This opportunistic sampling provided the first winter turbulence observations, which covered the largest spatial extent ever measured during any season within the St. Lawrence Estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The nitrate enrichment from tidal mixing resulted in an upward nitrate flux of about 30 nmol m(-2) s(-1), comparable to summer values obtained at the same tidal phase. Further downstream, deep nutrient-rich water from the gulf was mixed into the subsurface nutrient-poor layer at a rate more than an order of magnitude smaller than at the head. These fluxes were compared to the nutrient load of the upstream St. Lawrence River. Contrary to previous assumptions, fluvial nitrate inputs are the most significant source of nitrate in the estuary. Nitrate loads from vertical mixing processes would only exceed those from fluvial sources at the end of summer when fluvial inputs reach their annual minimum.

J	Davies, JM; Nowlin, WH; Mazumder, A				Davies, JM; Nowlin, WH; Mazumder, A			Variation in temporal [14C]plankton photosynthesis among warm monomictic lakes of coastal British Columbia	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Seasonal patterns of [C-14]phytoplankton photosynthesis (PP) were examined in six warm monomictic lakes of coastal British Columbia. Four of our study lakes followed typical lake patterns with maximum PP occurring in the spring and minimal rates occurring during the winter. However, the spring maximum occurred several weeks earlier than lakes in other climatic regions. In addition, maximum rates of daily photosynthesis were observed to occur during the winter months in Maxwell Lake, rather than during the standard growing season. All study lakes except Maxwell Lake had large Daphnia in the plankton community. Maxwell was dominated by small crustacean zooplankton implying the importance of trophic structure in mediating seasonal patterns of productivity. The four oligotrophic lakes in our study also exhibited P-deficiency during winter, as indicated by P-debt bioassays and rapid (PO43-)-P-32 turnover rates. Our data suggest that these coastal oligotrophic lakes were co-limited by nutrients and light during winter. The importance of winter (November-March) photosynthetic production to the total annual carbon budget in the six lakes studied here is greater than that typically reported for other temperate zone lakes. If plankton community respiration decreases more than photosynthetic production with wintertime temperatures, then >50% of annual net pelagic carbon fixation could occur in winter in some coastal lakes.

J	Kajale, MD; Deotare, BC				Kajale, MD; Deotare, BC			Late Quaternary environmental studies on salt lakes in western Rajasthan, India: a summarised view	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												The paper reviews pollen analytical and palaeoenvironmental work carried out on saline lakes in western Rajasthan, northwest India. The saline lakes are salient geomorphological features within the arid and semi-arid landscapes to the west of the Aravalli mountain ranges. Preliminary palynological work was carried out on two profiles from a gypsum-rich lake depression around Thob (District of Barmer). The varied pollen data are indicative of a fluctuating vegetational assemblage, possibly in response to local hydrological conditions and not necessarily indicative of climatic change. Pollen of Ephedra sp. (a typical desert species) in the lower levels suggests episodes of relatively dry conditions during the early phase of lake sedimentation at the end of the Pleistocene. Other work at four lake sites, on the basis of pollen analysis has indicated shifts in climatic and vegetational belts during the early Holocene, especially during the period of Indus Valley Culture. Later in the Holocene, between 5000 and 3500 yr BP, rainfall variations have been related to the dynamics of the monsoon. Pioneering geoarchaeological studies carried out at the palaeolithic site of 16 R and the adjacent Didwana lake have illustrated palaeoclimatic fluctuations and accompanying changes in cultural stages from the lower palaeolithic to mesolithic. These studies have been extended geochemically and sedimentologically through a detailed study documenting a history of salinity from 20 000 to 13 000 yr BP and freshwater conditions from 9000 to 6000 yr BP. Later studies have illustrated a sequence of changes reflecting summer and winter precipitation. These have indicated steppe vegetation during the last Glacial Maximum along with hypersaline lake conditions at Didwana, inferring a weakened summer monsoon and relatively high winter precipitation. The taxa indicative of both summer and winter precipitation in the mid-Holocene declined during the late Holocene, at the same time as falling lake levels around 4000 yr BP, a time when other lakes, at Sambhar, Lunkaransar and Pachpadra, also became ephemeral.

The quality of coastal waters in the Ghazaouet town was studied seasonally between winter and autumn 2007. The accumulation of heavy metals such as Cd, Zn, Fe, Cu, Pb and Co were determined in water, sediment, and organs (gonads, muscles and gills) of Mugil cephalus, which were collected from Ghazaouet harbour (Western part of Algerian coast). The metal concentrations showed a general trend of Pb > Co > Zn > Fe > Cd > Cu in water and Fe > Zn > Pb > Cu > Co > Cd in sediment samples while Zn > Fe > Pb > Cu > Cd > Co were in gonads and Zn > Fe > Pb > Cu > Co > Cd were in muscle and gill tissues. The highest metal concentrations were found in spring for sediments and in winter for fishes. The calculation of pollution index (PI) revealed an abnormal situation for Cd, Zn, Cu, and Pb. The accumulation of heavy metals in sediments was derived using enrichment factor (EF). The enrichment factors showed that Cd, Zn, Cu, Pb and Co are enriched. Zn and Fe have the highest bioconcentration factors (BCF) in all tissues while the least was Co. For water, the concentrations of Cu were significant differences, and the concentrations of Cd, Fe, Pb and Co were significantly higher. The concentrations of Fe for sediments, and Cd and Cu for Mugil cephalus, were significant differences.																			1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	6					3740	3747																WOS:000405360700002
J	Shabbar, A; Khandekar, M				Shabbar, A; Khandekar, M			The impact of El Nino-Southern Oscillation on the temperature field over Canada	ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN												The impact of the two phases of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), namely EI Nino and La Nina, on the surface and lower tropospheric temperature fields over Canada is documented. Gridded surface temperature data for 91 years (1900-1990) and 500-1000 hPa thickness data for 49 years (1946-1994) have been analyzed statistically in the context of EI Nino, La Nina and normal years. Using a composite analysis, the present study conclusively demonstrates that significant positive surface temperature anomalies spread eastward from the west coast of Canada to the Labrador coast from the late fall to early spring (November through May) following the onset of El Nino episodes. The accompanying temperatures in the lower troposphere show a transition from the Pacific/North American (PNA) pattern to the Tropical/Northern Hemisphere (TNH) pattern over the North American sector during the same period. Conversely, significant negative surface temperature anomalies spread southeastward from the Yukon and extend into the upper Great Lakes region by the winter season following the onset of La Nina episodes. Furthermore, the lower tropospheric temperatures show a negatively-phased PNA-like pattern in early winter which weakens considerably by May of the following year. Thus, while western Canadian surface temperatures are influenced during both phases of ENSO, eastern Canadian surface temperature effects are found during the El Nino phase only. The impact of ENSO on the Canadian surface temperatures is the strongest during the winter season and nearly disappears by spring (April and May). The largest positive (negative) anomalies are found to be centred over two separate regions, one over the Yukon and the other just west of Hudson Bay in the EI Nino (La Nina) years. Over western Canada, mean wintertime temperature distribution of the EI Nino (La Nina) years is found to be shifted towards warmer (colder) values relative to the distribution of the normal years. This study suggests the possibility of developing a long-range forecasting technique for Canada using ENSO related indices.																			0705-5900					JUN	1996	34	2					401	416		10.1080/07055900.1996.9649570	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07055900.1996.9649570													WOS:A1996VG16600006

To test the responses of phytoplankton to elevated temperature (+ 4.5 degrees C) at genus and functional group level, we conducted a 60-day experiment with and without the presence of Potamogeton crispus in the winter of Wuhan, China. When P. crispus was present, elevated temperature had little or no effect on the biomass and composition of the phytoplankton community. In the absence of P. crispus, however, elevated temperature significantly decreased the biomass and changed the composition of the phytoplankton. In contrast to many but not all published results mainly conducted during spring and summer, elevated temperature in winter reduced rather than increased the dominance of Cyanophyta. Instead, Chlorophyta became dominant. Redundancy analyses (RDA) showed that conductivity, light intensity and the ammonium/nitrate ratio (NH4:NO3) were the most important environmental variables, accounting for almost similar parts of the variations recorded in both genus and functional group composition. Among treatments, functional models did not show advantages over taxonomic models in depicting the response of the phytoplankton assemblage to the environmental conditions prevailing in our study conducted in winter, characterised by low phytoplankton abundance.

J	Gerten, D; Adrian, R				Gerten, D; Adrian, R			Climate-driven changes in spring plankton dynamics and the sensitivity of shallow polymictic lakes to the North Atlantic Oscillation	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Climate is increasingly recognized as a major factor driving long-term changes in plankton communities in both marine and limnetic ecosystems. In a shallow and polymictic lake, marked changes in the dynamics of phytoplankton and in the timing of distinctive successional events in spring were observed during two recent decades. We studied whether and how these changes were linked to a series of uncommonly warm winter and spring seasons, focusing on the predictive power of a macroscale atmospheric circulation pattern, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). In the warm period 1988-1998, phytoplankton developed about I month earlier than in the cool period 1979-1987, and high total phytoplankton biomass was recorded in early spring. These changes were significantly related to the NAO, which explained about 35% of the variance, and can be attributed to a shortening or lack of ice cover periods in winter Zooplankton (Keratella, Bosmina, Daphnia) developed about 2 weeks earlier in the warm period, consequently leading to an early establishment of the clearwater phase. The shift in the timing of the daphnid peak and of the clearwater phase required an additional warming trend in late April and early May and was net significantly correlated with the winter situation The memory effect of the NAO was restricted to a rather short postwinter period and was overtaken by the prevailing weather in April. Our results suggest that assessments of potential impacts of climate warming an biological processes in freshwater ecosystems demand basic knowledge about the relationships between global climate indices, local meteorological conditions, and the thermal response of various lake types.

This is unfortunate as the progressing climate change may have strong effects on lake winter temperature and possibly on trophic dynamics too. We conducted an enclosure experiment with and without the presence of fish throughout winter in two shallow lakes with contrasting phosphorus concentrations. In hypertrophic Lake Sobygard, absence of fish led to higher biomass of zooplankton, higher grazing potential (zooplankton:phytoplankton ratio) and, accordingly, lower biomass of phytoplankton and chlorophyll a (Chl a), while the concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), oxygen and pH decreased. The average size of egg-bearing Daphnia and Bosmina and the minimum size of egg-bearing specimens of the two genera rose. In the less eutrophic Lake Stigsholm, zooplankton and their grazing potential were also markedly affected by fish. However, the decrease in Chl a was slight, and phytoplankton biovolume, pH and the oxygen concentration were not affected. TN was higher when fish were absent. Our results indicate that: (i) there is a notable effect of fish on zooplankton community structure and size during winter in both eutrophic and hypertrophic North temperate lakes, (ii) Chl a can be high in winter in such lakes, despite low light irradiance, if fish are abundant, and (iii) the cascading effects on phytoplankton and nutrients in winter may be more pronounced in hypertrophic lakes. Climate warming supposedly leading to reduced winter mortality and dominance of small fish may enhance the risk of turbid state conditions in nutrient-enriched shallow lakes, not only during the summer season, but also during winter.

Summer-season runoff, lake water salinity and deposition of sediments by aeolian activity were reconstructed from concentrations of K, Ca and Zr/K in bulk sediments. More-than-average runoff during c. 12.3-9.3cal.ka BP represented an interval of enhanced summer precipitation. Arid intervals of c. 14-12.3cal.ka BP and c. 6-4.3cal.ka BP were characterized by average and more-than-average aeolian activity. Comparison with proxy records of summer as well as winter precipitation from tropical and sub-tropical North America and sea surface temperatures from the Atlantic and Pacific provides insight into the source of moisture and possible forcing. The wet Pleistocene-Holocene transition and early Holocene was contemporary with warmer conditions in the Gulf of California. We suggest that the Atlantic had minimal influence on the summer precipitation of the western part of sub-tropical northern Mexico and that the source of moisture was dominantly Pacific.

During the thermolialine stratification (spring and summer), the surface water is well-oxygenated while anoxia is occurring in the bottom layer. Anoxic deep water is characterized by high concentrations of RSS (up to 10(-3) M, mainly in the form of sulfide); nutrients (NH4+, up to 150 mu M; PO43-, up to 22 mu M; SiO44-, up to 400 mu M) and DOC (up to 6 mg/l) as a result of the pronounced remineralization of allochthonous organic matter produced in the surface water. The depth position of anoxic water layer changes seasonally and is greatly influenced by rainfall, the influence of which is visible from decreased salinity in deeper layers as well. As a result of autumn/winter mixing, bottom water rich with nutrients is coming to the surface, supporting new phytoplankton and oxygen productions. Natural eutrophication of the lake is strongly influenced by nutrient recycling under anaerobic conditions. Turnover of lake water layers in September 1997 occurred so quickly that it resulted in the appearance of total anoxia and sulfide presence throughout the water column. The aerobic flora and fauna died and added to the oxygen demand and the production of nutrients. Those long-term datasets help in recognizing the general trend from unique cases, such as the anoxic event in 1997, which was related to anthropogenic eutrophication. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

J	Li, LF; Schmitt, RW; Ummenhofer, CC				Li, Laifang; Schmitt, Raymond W.; Ummenhofer, Caroline C.			The role of the subtropical North Atlantic water cycle in recent US extreme precipitation events	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												The role of the oceanic water cycle in the record-breaking 2015 warm-season precipitation in the US is analyzed. The extreme precipitation started in the Southern US in the spring and propagated northward to the Midwest and the Great Lakes in the summer of 2015. This seasonal evolution of precipitation anomalies represents a typical mode of variability of US warm-season precipitation. Analysis of the atmospheric moisture flux suggests that such a rainfall mode is associated with moisture export from the subtropical North Atlantic. In the spring, excessive precipitation in the Southern US is attributable to increased moisture flux from the northwestern portion of the subtropical North Atlantic. The North Atlantic moisture flux interacts with local soil moisture which enables the US Midwest to draw more moisture from the Gulf of Mexico in the summer. Further analysis shows that the relationship between the rainfall mode and the North Atlantic water cycle has become more significant in recent decades, indicating an increased likelihood of extremes like the 2015 case. Indeed, two record-high warm-season precipitation events, the 1993 and 2008 cases, both occurred in the more recent decades of the 66 year analysis period. The export of water from the North Atlantic leaves a marked surface salinity signature. The salinity signature appeared in the spring preceding all three extreme precipitation events analyzed in this study, i.e. a saltier-than-normal subtropical North Atlantic in spring followed by extreme Midwest precipitation in summer. Compared to the various sea surface temperature anomaly patterns among the 1993, 2008, and 2015 cases, the spatial distribution of salinity anomalies was much more consistent during these extreme flood years. Thus, our study suggests that preseason salinity patterns can be used for improved seasonal prediction of extreme precipitation in the Midwest.					, Laifang/W-4654-2017; Schmitt, Raymond/B-7451-2011; Li, Laifang/W-4654-2017	, Laifang/0000-0002-6721-9002; Schmitt, Raymond/0000-0002-3924-8244; 													0930-7575	1432-0894				FEB	2018	50	3-4					1291	1305		10.1007/s00382-017-3685-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-017-3685-y													WOS:000425328700033

The concentration of the major components of the suspended matter, organic material, alumino-silicates and calcite varied significantly from spring until later summer. The high concentration of organic material and the fluctuations of calcite concentration result from high rates of photosynthesis and respiration and temperature increases in spring and summer.																			0380-1330						1984	10	3					286	298		10.1016/S0380-1330(84)71842-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(84)71842-9													WOS:A1984TL80400013
J	FERRANTE, JG				FERRANTE, JG			ROLE OF ZOOPLANKTON IN INTRABIOCOENOTIC PHOSPHORUS CYCLE AND FACTORS AFFECTING PHOSPHORUS EXCRETION IN A LAKE	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The temporal and spatial excretion rates of specific size groups of limnetic zooplankton were studied by measuring changes in soluble reactive P following incubation. Animals were collected in the epilimnion and hypolimnion of Stonehouse Pond, New Hampshire [USA] from Aug. 1972-July 1973 and separated into > 0.308 and < 0.308 (mm) size groups. Temporal excretion rates varied considerably within groups; similar patterns were observed in both strata. Peak excretion rates were observed in the spring and fall with a low in winter months. In addition, smaller animals excreted at higher rates, and excretion rates of both size groups in the epilimnion exceeded those in the hypolimnion. The P uptake of natural seston relative to the amount released by zooplankton is considered using mass balance equations and kinetic analyses. During the spring of 1973 excretion rates increased, this increase was offset by an even greater rise in the rate of P uptake by the seston. This suggests that during this period the P excretions of zooplankton were not sufficient to meet the amount of P being removed by the seston.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1976	49	3					203	214		10.1007/BF00014513	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00014513													WOS:A1976BX84100002
J	Ma, WT; Kim, MK; Hao, JL				Ma, Wenting; Kim, Moon Keun; Hao, Jianli			Numerical Simulation Modeling of a GSHP and WSHP System for an Office Building in the Hot Summer and Cold Winter Region of China: A Case Study in Suzhou	SUSTAINABILITY												This paper studies the long-term performance of a Ground Source Heat Pump (GSHP) system and a Water Source Heat Pump (WSHP) system for an office building in Suzhou, which is a hot summer and cold winter climate region of China. The hot summer and cold winter region is the most urbanized region of China and has subtropical monsoon climate, therefore, Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems are in great demand. Due to the fact that 42.5% of Suzhou's total area is covered by lakes and rivers, the city has an abundance of surface water resources. Based on Suzhou's meteorological data and the thermal characteristics of the building envelope, an office building model was created and the dynamic cooling and heating load was calculated using Transient System Simulation (TRNSYS) simulation software. Two numerical HVAC modeling systems were created: a GSHP system for which the data of an in-situ Thermal Response Test (TRT) was used and a WSHP system for which the Tai Lake water temperature was used. Simulating the performance of both systems over a 20-year period, the two systems were analyzed for their Coefficient of Performance (COP), heat source temperature variation, and energy consumption. The results show that the GSHP system causes ground heat accumulation, which reduces the system's COP and increases energy consumption. The study also revealed that compared with the GSHP system, the WSHP system has a more stable long-term performance for buildings in Suzhou.

J	HAIRSTON, NG				HAIRSTON, NG			RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PIGMENTATION AND REPRODUCTION IN 2 SPECIES OF DIAPTOMUS (COPEPODA)	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Adult D. sicilis and D. nevadensis in 2 central Washington [USA] lakes show a seasonal range in body pigmentation:from high throughout the year to markedly seasonal with a winter and early spring peak. Both species have winter-spring peaks in reproduction in both lakes. Pigment is accumulated by adult females and concentrated in their eggs and nauplii. During the day, the nauplii are at the surface of the lakes where visible light is intense; the carotenoid apparently functions as photoprotection. Seasonality of adult pigment content varies as a function of predation pressure. In a population experiencing little predation, adults are highly pigmented throughout the year; as predation pressure on the populations increases, the timing of pigmentation maxima contracts to the period of reproduction.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1979	24	1					38	44		10.4319/lo.1979.24.1.0038	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1979.24.1.0038													WOS:A1979GJ26100003

Seasonal Regime Shift in the Viral Communities of a Permafrost Thaw Lake	VIRUSES-BASEL												Permafrost thaw lakes including thermokarst lakes and ponds are ubiquitous features of Subarctic and Arctic landscapes and are hotspots of microbial activity. Input of terrestrial organic matter into the planktonic microbial loop of these lakes may greatly amplify global greenhouse gas emissions. This microbial loop, dominated in the summer by aerobic microorganisms including phototrophs, is radically different in the winter, when metabolic processes shift to the anaerobic degradation of organic matter. Little is known about the viruses that infect these microbes, despite evidence that viruses can control microbial populations and influence biogeochemical cycling in other systems. Here, we present the results of a metagenomics-based study of viruses in the larger than 0.22 mu m fraction across two seasons (summer and winter) in a permafrost thaw lake in Subarctic Canada. We uncovered 351 viral populations (vOTUs) in the surface waters of this lake, with diversity significantly greater during the summer. We also identified and characterized several phage genomes and prophages, which were mostly present in the summer. Finally, we compared the viral community of this waterbody to other habitats and found unexpected similarities with distant bog lakes in North America.					; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019; Langlois, Valérie/ISS-1028-2023	Vigneron, Adrien/0000-0003-3552-8369; Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; Langlois, Valerie/0000-0003-1326-7081; Girard, Catherine/0000-0002-3899-0180; Culley, Alexander/0000-0001-6639-9112; 														1999-4915				NOV	2020	12	11							1204	10.3390/v12111204	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v12111204								33105728					WOS:000593836000001

In this study, we investigated 14C concentration (Delta 14C) of lake water for three years and employed a 14C box model to estimate the groundwater contribution. Seasonal variations of Delta 14C were also observed in both 2019 and 2020, con-firming that Delta 14C in Lake Kawaguchi decreases from summer to fall and increases during winter. Heavy pre-cipitation exceeding 300 mm in a few days because of tropical cyclon HAGIBIS (Typhoon#19) significantly increased Delta 14C in the lake for one month and it could caused by temporal changes in the surface water pathway. The 14C box model demonstrated that 14C could semiquantitatively evaluate the groundwater flow in the lake. It is needed to add quantative evaluations inflow from rivers and other factors to understand of groundwater dynamics.					; Yamamoto, Shinya/C-5134-2011; Yokoyama, Yusuke/N-9623-2013	Yokoyama, Yusuke/0000-0001-7869-5891; Yamamoto, Shinya/0000-0001-7938-1106; Miyairi, Yosuke/0000-0003-3428-5342; Wong, Wanyee/0000-0003-1066-6829; Ota, Kosuke/0000-0003-1190-9001; 													0168-583X	1872-9584				MAY	2023	538						75	80		10.1016/j.nimb.2023.02.021	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nimb.2023.02.021		MAR 2023											WOS:001003432500001

A modified stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) model, which accounts for the unrepeatable agricultural and property damages and improves the accuracy of these damage estimates, is used to evaluate the performance of Lake Shelbyville. The optimal pool levels in the summer months are found to be 2-5 ft lower than the current target level of 599.7 ft. The expected damages in the model increase by 9% when a penalty function is used to force the summer pool to the current target. Moreover, it would take more than one month for Lake Shelbyville to resume the summer pool from the winter drawdown. A transition period of at least two months for lake levels between winter and summer appears warranted.																			0733-9496					MAR-APR	1992	118	2					185	204		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9496(1992)118:2(185)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9496(1992)118:2(185)													WOS:A1992HE93500005

The Ain Zada reservoir is a home of 5 genera. The occurrence frequency estimation of the identified genera shows the constancy of Planktothrix, the regularity of Aphanizomenon, Pseudanabaena and Cylindrospermopsis and the rarity of Oscillatoria. The dominant genus Planktothrix is represented exclusively by Planktothrix agardhii; this species showed the highest proportion rates in winter (95.61%), spring (94.80%) and autumn (80.29%) and the lowest in summer (29.16%). Planktothrix agardii abundances show positive relation with suspended solids and chlorophyll a and negative relation with the depth of Secchi disc. The blooms of the potential toxinogenic Planktothrix agardhii and Cylindrospermopsis are related negatively. The results from cyanotoxins and pigments characterization showed a strong positive relation of Planktothrix agardhii abundance with microcystins (MCs) and phycocyanin (PC) concentrations. Indeed, in Ain Zada dam, we found that MCs contents have positive relation with water temperature and pH and a negative relation with NO3. Our results show that - except for the months of March, October and November- the monthly abundances of cyanobacterial population recorded in Ain Zada dam exceeded the alert level 2. The filamentous species found in this dam are of great concern, as they are able to synthesize toxins harmful to aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Further research is needed to confirm the presence of other cyanotoxins (e.g. cylindrospermopsin) in Ain Zada dam.

J	RING, RA				RING, RA			THE INSECT FAUNA AND SOME OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF NATURAL SALT SPRINGS ON SALTSPRING ISLAND, BRITISH-COLUMBIA	MEMOIRS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF CANADA												The natural salt springs on Saltspring Island, southwestern British Columbia, originate from a source at least 1000 m deep and are distinct in chemical composition not only from the surrounding seawater but also from the groundwater-based salt springs on nearby Mayne Island. Spring water is approximately 2.2-fold more saline than average seawater and is characterized by having significantly higher levels of chloride, sodium, sulphate, silica, iron, alumina, and boron; similar levels of calcium, potassium, fluoride, and nitrogen; but less magnesium. The pH levels in different springs vary between 7.3 and 7.9, compared with pH 8.2 for average surface seawater. Near-surface water temperatures range from 7-degrees-C in mid-winter to 16-21-degrees-C in late summer. The flora and fauna that exploit this unique habitat are characterized by halophilic species known from other saline environments such as saline lakes, brackish water, beaches, and the intertidal zone. Organisms that have been isolated and identified include the following: seven species of bacteria, none of which depends exclusively on a saline environment; a blue-green alga that lives within the springs; an abundant filamentous green alga; and halophilic higher plants and grasses. Two species of spiders [Zelotes sp. (Gnaphosidae) and Pardosa sp. (Lycosidae)] are active in the salt-impregnated areas surrounding the springs. Collembola are represented by Anurida sp. (Poduridae); and insects by Saldula comatula (Saldidae, Hemiptera), the chironomids (Chironomidae, Diptera) Thalassosmittia marina plus two unidentified species, brine flies (Ephydridae, Diptera), and two unidentified cyclorrhaphan dipterans. Among the Hymenoptera, there are two species of Eupteromalus (Pteromalidae), Cyrtogaster capitanea (Pteromalidae), Urolepis rufipes (Pteromalidae), and Stigmus sp. (Pemphredonidae). Ants (Formica spp.) and yellowjackets (Vespula sp.) are frequent foragers in the immediate vicinity of the salt spring. There are three species of Coleoptera, Bembidion indistinctum (Carabidae), Ochthebius lecontei (Hydraenidae), and Thicanus mimus (Anthicidae). These insects are discussed in terms of their distribution within, and preference for, saline environments.																			0071-075X					SUM	1991		155					51	61		10.4039/entm123155051-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.4039/entm123155051-1													WOS:A1991FU07100004

This system is inhabited by II fish species, of which six are native. Four of the native species are endemic to the region and threatened due to touristic pressure and to the introduction of exotic species. The objectives were to determine the characteristics that influence the spatial distribution of the fish species, to analyze their spatial distribution patterns, and to describe the relationships between the different species. The general aim was to establish some basis for the conservation of these fish communities and their habitat. Several sessions were initiated in 1992 through direct observation. Later, between 1998 and 1999 five systematically seasonal sampling sessions were conducted (54 subaquatic transects/session). Finally, the data was updated by sampling in summer 2002 and winter 2006. Through the analysis was performed only for endemics of the region, like Ataeniobius toweri Meek, Cualac tessellatus Miller, Cichlasoma bartoni Bean and C. labridens Pellegrin, in at least one life stage, showed correlation with habitat variables or with other species. For these species, patterns of spatial aggregation and association with other species were observed. These results show a certain degree of specialization of endemic species to some microhabitat characteristics, as well as a significant interaction with other native species which they coexist. In addition, some significant relations between endemic and alien species suggest an antagonist relation. Management actions focused in the touristic use of the spring represent the main threat for these species, followed by an adequate management of exotic species. This study provides basis for future responsible management of these wetlands, where tourism and conservation can be combined. Rev. Biol. Trop. 58 (1): 413-426. Epub 2010 March 01.

The numerically most important adult copepods were the calanoids Paracartia latisetosa (66.9 %) and Calanipeda aquaedulcis (27.4 %), while the harpacticoids Euterpina acutifrons, Harpacticus gracilis, Tisbe sp. and Microsetella sp. along with the cyclopoid Oithona nana accounted on average for 5.7 %. The copepod nauplii (not distinguished to species) were found year-round and outnumbered the community. For all species, greater abundance values were found in late spring and in summer while lowest in winter. Along the vertical axis, over 90 % of the abundance of the two most important species and nauplii was recorded in the surface 0-5 m layer, except in winter and early spring when considerable proportions were also recorded in deeper layers. The percentage contribution of the harpacticoids and cyclopoid species within the copepod's community showed an increase with depth, from 5.4 % in the surface to 39.5 % in the deepest layer. An exponential increase in the average percentage of copepod carcasses with depth was also noticed. In the well oxygenated surface layer, the most important parameter influencing the seasonal cycles of all species was temperature. The depletion of oxygen and the increase of hydrogen sulphide with depth were restricting factors for the vertical distribution of calanoid copepods. However, they seemed to have affected less the presence of harpacticoid and cyclopoid species which seemed to be more tolerant to anoxia.

Additionally, we addressed the question of the contribution and the potential significance of meiofauna within the overall invertebrate drift at the small spatial scale. During the study period, a total of 60 invertebrate taxa were recorded in the drift. Six of these taxa belonged to the annelid/arthropod meiofauna and they represented 35% of total drift density. Macroinvertebrates found in drift were represented mainly by larval insects. The composition of the most abundant taxa in total drift was as follows: Alona spp. (Cladocera 26.7%), Riolus spp. (Coleoptera: Elmidae 13.2%), Simulium spp. (Diptera: Simuliidae 12.2%), Enchytraeidae (Oligochaeta 10.4%), Hydrachnidia (6.3%), Orthocladinae (Diptera: Chironomidae 3.9%) and Naididae (Oligochaeta 3.6%). Faunal drift densities and amounts of transported particulate matter (PM) were highest at the fast-flowing sites located at the barriers and lowest at the slow-flowing sites within pools. Similarly to the seasonal amounts of transported PM, faunal drift was lowest in winter, and peaked in autumn and in late spring/early summer. Correlation between flow velocity and PM-faunal drift densities suggested a significant effect of the dislodged PM, though a minor influence of discharge and flow velocity on faunal drift. We suggest that the small-scale habitat heterogeneity and the respective feeding and refugial strategies of the fauna, as well as faunal passive dislodgement initiated by the shear forces of the flow were the most important drivers of observed drift patterns.

The pharmaceutical contribution of hospitals to municipal wastewater was determined. The removal of target pharmaceuticals was evaluated in a WWTP consisting of conventional biological treatment using activated sludge. Additionally, the potential environmental risk for the aquatic receiving environments (salt lake) was assessed. Beta-blockers and psychiatric drugs were detected in high concentrations in the wastewater samples. Atenolol (919 ng/L) from beta-blockers and carbamazepine (7008 ng/L) from psychiatric pharmaceuticals were detected at the highest concentrations in hospital wastewater. The total pharmaceutical concentration determined at the WWTP influent and effluent was between 335 and 737 ng/L in summer and between 174 and 226 ng/L in winter. The concentrations detected in hospital effluents are higher than the concentrations detected in WWTP. The total pharmaceutical contributions from hospitals to the WWTP in summer and winter were determined to be 2% and 4%, respectively. Total pharmaceutical removal in the WWTP ranged from 23 to 54%. According to the risk ratios, atenolol could pose a high risk (risk quotient > 10) for fish in summer and winter. There are different reasons for the increase in pharmaceutical consumption in recent years. One of these reasons is the COVID-19 pandemic, which has been going on for 2 years. In particular, hospitals were operated at full capacity during the pandemic, and the occurrence and concentration of pharmaceuticals used for the therapy of COVID-19 patients has increased in hospital effluent. Pandemic conditions have increased the tendency of people to use psychiatric drugs. It is thought that beta-blocker consumption has increased due to cardiovascular diseases caused by COVID-19. Therefore, the environmental risk of pharmaceuticals for aquatic organisms in hospital effluent should be monitored and evaluated.

J	Zohary, T				Zohary, T			Changes to the phytoplankton assemblage of Lake Kinneret after decades of a predictable, repetitive pattern	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Phytoplankton abundance and species composition in Lake Kinneret, Israel, have been monitored at weekly or fortnightly intervals since 1969. This paper summarises the resulting 34-year phytoplankton record with a focus on the last 13 years of new data, and reassesses an earlier conclusion that the lake phytoplankton shows remarkable stability despite a wide range of external pressures. 2. The Kinneret phytoplankton record can be split into two major periods. The first, from 1969 till 1993, was a period of distinct stability expressed by a typical annual pattern revolving around a spring bloom of the dinoflagellate Peridinium gatunense that repeated each year. The second period, starting around 1994 and ongoing, is characterised by the loss of the previously predictable annual pattern, with both 'bloom years' and 'no-bloom years'. 3. In the second period, deviations from the previous annual pattern include: the absence of the prevailing spring P. gatunense blooms in some years and increased variability in the magnitude of the bloom in others; intensification of winter Aulacoseira granulata blooms; higher summer phytoplankton biomass with replacement of mostly nanoplanktonic, palatable forms by less palatable forms; new appearance and establishment of toxin-producing, nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria in summer; increase in the absolute biomass and percentage contribution of cyanobacteria to total biomass; and fungal epidemics attacking P. gatunense. 4. The 34-year record serves to validate Schindler's (1987) assessment that phytoplankton species composition will respond to increased anthropogenic stress before bulk ecosystem parameters.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				OCT	2004	49	10					1355	1371		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01271.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01271.x													WOS:000223906000009

DIVERSITY-BASEL												A high abundance of planktonic microalgae is typically thought to be related to their 'bloom', that is, to active population growth. Diatom blooms in the photic zone of Lake Baikal generally occur during hydrological spring (April-June); when the summer arrives and the surface water temperature increases, diatoms are replaced by other microalgae. In July 2019, we found a concentration of the diatom Fragilaria radians at a station in South Baikal that was extremely high for that season. This species generally blooms in spring, but in spring (May) of 2019, this alga was nearly absent from the phytoplankton population. Microscopic analysis of the sample taken in July 2019 revealed that the cells were in a dormant stage. The species composition of microalgae in phytoplankton samples from May 2018 and July 2019 was similar. According to the temperature profile analysis, a summer upwelling event from a depth of ca. 100 m occurred in 2019. We hypothesised that this event caused the resuspension of microalgae, including Fragilaria radians, which were deposited on the slopes of the lake in 2018.

J	Olli, K				Olli, K			Diel vertical migration of phytoplankton and heterotrophic flagellates in the Gulf of Riga	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Vertical distribution of a phototrophic ciliate (Mesodinium rubrum), autotrophic dinoflagellates (Peridiniella catenata, Heterocapsa rotundata, Dinophysis acuminata), a cryptomonad (Teleaulax sp.), a filamentous cyanobacterium (Aphanizomenon flos-aquae), a non-motile chlorophyte (Monoraphidium sp.) and two heterotrophic dinoflagellates were studied during two diel periods in spring (May 1-2 and 27-28, 1995) and summer (June 26-27 and July 6-7, 1994) in the southern part of the Gulf of Riga, the Baltic Sea. The two seasons, corresponding to the vernal bloom and summer stage, differed considerably with respect to phytoplankton community, hydrography and vertical distribution of the species. In spring the cells stayed in the upper mixed layer above a strong thermocline at 12-15 m depth, and changes in the vertical distribution were related to surface avoidance in the middle of the day. By using correspondence analysis, the vertical distribution of all the motile species were shown to differ significantly from the non-motile Monoraphidium, but not from each other. The vertical migration was reflected in a higher variability in the depth distribution patterns of the motile species, compared to Monoraphidium. In summer 1994, Aphanizomenon, Dinophysis and Teleaulax showed similar depth distribution patterns during the first period, but different from Mesodinium and the heterotrophic dinoflagellates, while during the second period all the autotrophic species had a species specific depth distribution pattern. Me. rubrum revealed a considerably different depth distribution between the two seasons, characterised by surface accumulation in spring and relatively uniform depth distribution over the whole sampling range (0-30 m) in summer. The results demonstrate different vertical niche separation strategies between species. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

A total of 591 female L. r. siliquoidea were examined over a 3-yr period. The reproductive cycle was fairly synchronous. Glochidial release was restricted to about the 1st 3 wk of June. Egg production and subsequent fertilization occurred shortly after glochidial release. By mid-July late cleavage stages were found. Fully formed glochidia were evident in the swollen marsupia by early autumn. They were retained in the brood pouches over winter and not released until the following spring. Fish collected from Shannon Lake included 1753 individuals of 18 spp. (Perca flavescens, Stizostedion vitreum, Lepomis macrochirus, L. gibbosus, Pomoxis annularis, P. nigromaculatus, Micropterus salmoides, Hypentelium nigricans, Esox lucius, Ictalurus melas, Notropis heterodon, Pereina maculata, Etheostoma nigrum, E. exile, Catostomus commersoni, Percopsis omiscomaycas, Cottus cognatus and Ambloplites rupestris) representing 8 families. Seven species were natural hosts for the glochidia of this clam. The percent of the population infected and the intensity of the infections were both relatively low.																			0003-0031	1938-4238					1981	106	2					243	248		10.2307/2425160	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2425160													WOS:A1981MQ07100004

In the course of the year the 'river snow' community changed. It was characterized by a great bacterial diversity in spring, the predominant occurrence of algae in summer and reduction of the total bacterial cell count in autumn and winter. In all 'river snow' samples, more than 70% of the bacteria counted with the general DNA stain DAPI also hybridized with the Bacteria-specific probe EUB338. In situ analysis of the bacterial 'river snow community with a comprehensive suite of specific rRNA-targeted probes revealed population dynamics to be governed by seasonal factors. During all seasons, beta-Proteobacteria constituted the numerically most important bacterial group forming up to 54% of the total cell counts. In contrast to this, the relative abundance of other major bacterial lineages ranged from 2% for the order Planctomycetales to 36% for Cytophaga-Flavobacteria. Cultivation of 'river snow' under aerobic and anaerobic conditions with a variety of different media resulted in the isolation of 40 new bacterial strains. Phenotypic and phylogenetic analyses revealed these new strains to be mostly unknown organisms affiliated to different bacterial phyla. Application of newly developed specific oligonucleotide probes proved the cultivated bacteria. including clostridia and the numerically abundant beta-Proteobacteria, as relevant in situ members of the;river snow' community.

Persistence of fecal indicator bacteria and associated genetic markers from wastewater treatment plant effluents in freshwater microcosms	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												Limited information exists on the environmental persistence of genetic markers for fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) in treated wastewaters. Here, the decay rate constants of culturable cells and genetic markers for four diverse groups of FIBs, such as enterococci, Clostridium, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides, were investigated in freshwater microcosms seeded with disinfected and non-disinfected secondary-treated wastewaters. Decay rate constants of genetic markers and culturable cells varied significantly among the different FIB groups. Water temperatures (winter vs. fall/spring/summer) significantly affected the decay of all genetic marker and cell types; however, genetic marker decay were not found to be significantly different in disinfected (chlorination/ultraviolet) and non-disinfected wastewater-seeded microcosms or, for example, lake- and river-receiving waters. No evidence was seen that decay rate constants of FIB genetic markers from treated wastewater were substantially different from those observed in similar, previously reported microcosm studies using raw sewage. Unexpected relationships between decay rate constants of genetic markers and culturable cells of Bacteroides were observed. Results suggest that decay rate constants of FIB genetic markers determined from other studies may be applicable to treated wastewaters. Results of this study should be informative for ongoing efforts to determine the persistence of FIB genetic markers relative to surviving pathogens after wastewater treatment.

The whitewater (entry of Lago Camaleao) and the blackwater (Taruma Mirim) lakes are connected to the adjacent Rio Solimoes (= Amazon) and Rio Negro, respectively, by an inflow/outflow channel such that their water levels can fluctuate in response to the river levels, often by more than 10 m.

Maxima of up to 6400 cells l-1 were recorded in late summer, with similar numbers in the 0-8 and 8-20 m depth intervals. On an annual average, the population accounted for 10-17% of the total biomass of planktonic ciliates. In the laboratory, Histiobalantium grew well on a diet of the cryptophyte Rhodomonas sp. Maximum growth rates obtained in batch cultures were 0.21 and 0.33 day-1 at 9 and 18-degrees-C, respectively. In situ experiments using diffusion chambers yielded positive growth rates in autumn and winter. The highest values recorded at the ambient temperatures 5, 14 and 17-degrees-C were 0.17, 0.32 and 0.40 day-1, respectively. Comparing these results with the different seasonal distributions and higher measured growth rates of other ciliates from Lake Constance, we conclude that Histiobalantium is a superior competitor at relatively low algal food concentrations.

The antioxidant potential of hydrophilic and lipophilic extracts of fish fillets was evaluated. The fillet extracts of zander and bream in summer and common carp in winter had the highest antioxidant activity. Palmitic and oleic acids were the major saturated (SFA) and monounsaturated (MUFA) fatty acids, respectively. The fatty acids C22:6n3 and C20:5n3 were the most abundant polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acids in all the fishes. In summer, the highest levels of SFA (44.09), total PUFA (25.97), n3 PUFA (20.71) and n3/n6 ratio (4) were found in zander. In winter, the highest amounts of total PUFA and n3 PUFA were determined in silver carp, followed by zander. The highest n3/n6 ratio was also found in silver carp. The ratio of PUFA/SFA was higher in winter than in summer for all the fishes. Vitamin E content of fishes was largely varied. In conclusion, seasonal variation changed the antioxidant potential and fatty acid composition of fish fillets. Aras River fishes, especially zander, possess excellent antioxidant activity and high nutritional quality. (C) 2022 Urmia University. All rights reserved.

J	Yuan, LY; Liu, GH; Li, W; Li, EH				Yuan, Long-Yi; Liu, Gui-Hua; Li, Wei; Li, En-Hua			Seed bank variation along a water depth gradient in a subtropical lakeshore marsh, Longgan Lake, China	PLANT ECOLOGY												Although zonation patterns of the standing vegetation along a water depth gradient in wetlands have been well described, few studies have explored whether such patterns also occur in the seed bank. This study examined patterns of the seed bank along a water depth gradient in three vegetation types (submerged zone, floating-leaved zone, and emergent zone) of a subtropical lakeshore marsh, Longgan Lake, China. Submerged zone is the deepest water and never exposed its soil to air, and was dominant by submerged species; floating-leaved zone is waterlogged soil even during drawdown and was dominant by Nelumbo nucifera; emergent zone is rarely exceeded 1 m water depth during the wet season (summer and autumn), and the marsh soil was usually exposed to air during drawdown (winter and spring), and is dominant by Zizania latifolia, Polygonum hydropiper and Scirpus yagara. It was found that many species were ubiquitous in the seed bank. Frequency of distribution and densities of the dominant species, however, varied significantly from zone to zone. A total of 22 species was recorded in submerged zone, 20 in floating-leaved zone, and 29 in emergent zone. Germinated seedling density was 1,580, 8,994 and 20,424 seedlings m(2) in submerged zone, floating-leaved zone, and emergent zone, respectively. Submerged and floating-leaved species were significantly abundant in the submerged zone, while the emergent species were found predominantly in the emergent zone. A fern species, Ceratopsis pterioides, was the most abundant seedling in seed banks from all three zones. A TWINSPAN dendrogram and CCA ordination diagram clearly showed separation of species among sites with the emergent zone being well separated from the submerged zone and floating-leaved zone, thus revealing marked zonal patterns in species distributions in the seed bank. This pattern of zonation reflected the pattern in the standing vegetation.																			1385-0237	1573-5052				MAR	2007	189	1					127	137		10.1007/s11258-006-9170-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-006-9170-z													WOS:000244187800010

The Influence of Weather and Lemmings on Spatiotemporal Variation in the Abundance of Multiple Avian Guilds in the Arctic	PLOS ONE												Climate change is occurring more rapidly in the Arctic than other places in the world, which is likely to alter the distribution and abundance of migratory birds breeding there. A warming climate can provide benefits to birds by decreasing spring snow cover, but increases in the frequency of summer rainstorms, another product of climate change, may reduce foraging opportunities for insectivorous birds. Cyclic lemming populations in the Arctic also influence bird abundance because Arctic foxes begin consuming bird eggs when lemmings decline. The complex interaction between summer temperature, precipitation, and the lemming cycle hinder our ability to predict how Arctic-breeding birds will respond to climate change. The main objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between annual variation in weather, spring snow cover, lemming abundance and spatiotemporal variation in the abundance of multiple avian guilds in a tundra ecosystem in central Nunavut, Canada: songbirds, shorebirds, gulls, loons, and geese. We spatially stratified our study area based on vegetation productivity, terrain ruggedness, and freshwater abundance, and conducted distance sampling to estimate strata-specific densities of each guild during the summers of 2010-2012. We also monitored temperature, rainfall, spring snow cover, and lemming abundance each year. Spatial variation in bird abundance matched what was expected based on previous ecological knowledge, but weather and lemming abundance also significantly influenced the abundance of some guilds. In particular, songbirds were less abundant during the cool, wet summer with moderate snow cover, and shorebirds and gulls declined with lemming abundance. The abundance of geese did not vary over time, possibly because benefits created by moderate spring snow cover were offset by increased fox predation when lemmings were scarce. Our study provides an example of a simple way to monitor the correlation between weather, spring snow cover, lemming abundance, and spatiotemporal variations in Arctic-breeding birds.

This issue has been widely considered in oceans but not in inland water. Here, we develop experiential and semi analytical models, which validated by independent in situ measurement data, respectively, to derive C-phyto and phytoplankton absorption coefficient at 675 nm (a(ph)(675)) from MODIS. The effects of nutrients and temperature on the seasonal variation of phytoplankton physiology were assessed through a novel proxy of C-phyto to a(ph)(675) ratio (C-phyto/a(ph)(675)) over the Lake Taihu, the third largest lake in China. Significant seasonal climatological cycles of C-phyto, a(ph)(675) and C-phyto/a(ph)(675) were observed in Lake Taihu, especially in Meiliang Bay and Zhushan Bay, where algal blooms occur frequently. The highest C-phyto and a(ph)(675) values were observed in summer due to the growth of phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll-a concentration. Lower values were observed in winter and spring, which are characterized by relatively high total nitrogen levels and low irradiance, owing to the low temperature astricts the algae growth. However, the C-phyto/a(ph)(675) shows an opposite trend compared to C-phyto and a(ph)(675), which have high values in winter and low values in summer. The analysis of C-phyto, a(ph)(675) and C-phyto/aph(675) with total phosphorus (TP) levels and temperature indicates that TP are the main positive driver of the increase in C-phyto and a(ph)(675) and negatively regulate C-phyto/a(ph)(675). Warming promotes an increase in C-phyto and a(ph)(675) and restricts C-phyto/a(ph)(675) in summer. Biomass and nutrient levels are the primary drivers of the decrease of C-phyto/a(ph)(675) in such a typical eutrophic lake. The results present some new findings compared to previous oceanic studies and expand our knowledge in the study of phytoplankton biomass and physiology in eutrophic lakes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Summer water temperatures declined between 1991-1993, as did the sizes of 0+ fish of both species. Small overwinter increases in length occurred after poor summers due, in roach, to size-selective mortality. Fat content was size-dependent and increased over the summer in both species. Ail sizes of roach but only small perch lost fat overwinter. Dead roach collected towards the end of the 1992/3 winter had significantly less fat than live individuals. The allocation of energy to growth (and ultimately reproduction) and to fat (and overwinter survival) was modelled as a tradeoff, assuming that fat has twice the energy density of protein and using observed summer and winter changes in body composition. The predicted allocation optima were close to observed values but, for roach, this entailed a substantial survivorship cost.

It is fed by springs located on its eastern and northern boundaries. These springs discharge groundwater from a volcanic aquifer. Arid conditions dominate in the area, with an average precipitation of less than 200 mm/year. The tritium content in some groundwater samples shows the contribution of modern recharge to the total groundwater flow. Recharge occurs by infiltration of snowmelt in the austral winter months and to a lesser extent by short but intense precipitation events during the summer. According to the vertical gradients of precipitation and its rainfall isotopic content (delta O-18, delta H-2), the recharge zone of the springs is located at the northern area of the lake, above 4,900 m a.s.l., along the slopes of the Tuyajto volcano, whereas the recharge to the springs discharging on the eastern area of the lake originates in the adjacent basins of Pampa Colorada and Pampa Las Tecas, at altitudes of between 4,400 and 4,700 m a.s.l. The water of these springs may contain measurable tritium. The chemical composition of groundwater is the result of meteoric water evaporation processes, high temperature water-rock interaction and the dissolution of buried old salt flat deposits. The groundwater flow is shallow, due to the presence of a regional low permeability ignimbrite formation, which precludes the formation of deep convective groundwater flow cells due to the high density. At the local scale, the Laguna Tuyajto behaves as a flow-through system compared to the regional groundwater flow. The persistence of the springs is essential for the existence of the brine sheet and maintaining the ecological conditions for the waterfowl.

Telemetry-based spatial-temporal fish habitat models for fishes in an urban freshwater harbour	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Fish habitat associations are important measures for effective aquatic habitat management, but often vary over broad spatial and temporal scales, and are therefore challenging to measure comprehensively. We used a 9-year acoustic telemetry dataset to generate spatial-temporal habitat suitability models for seven fish species in an urban freshwater harbour, Toronto Harbour, Lake Ontario. Fishes generally occupied the more natural regions of Toronto Harbour most frequently. However, each species exhibited unique habitat associations and spatial-temporal interactions in their habitat use. For example, largemouth bass exhibited the most consistent seasonal habitat use, mainly associating with shallow, sheltered embayments with high aquatic vegetation (SAV) cover. Conversely, walleye seldom occupied Toronto Harbour in summer, with the highest occupancy of shallow, low-SAV habitats in the spring, which corresponds to their spawning period. Others, such as common carp, shifted between shallow summer and deeper winter habitats. Community level spatial-temporal habitat importance estimates were also generated, which can serve as an aggregate measure for habitat management. Acoustic telemetry provides novel opportunities to generate robust spatial-temporal fish habitat models based on wild fish behaviour, which are useful for the management of fish habitat from a fish species and community perspective.					; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010	Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY	2023	850	8					1779	1800		10.1007/s10750-023-05180-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-023-05180-z		MAR 2023						37063494					WOS:000950080600001

During the early summer period the average whole water column chlorophyll a, the deep chlorophyll maximum, and the size of deep chlorophyll layer decreased 50%, 55%, and 92%, respectively, between 1995-2000 and 2007-2011. By contrast, in late summer there were no changes in these metrics between periods. Surface mixed layer chlorophyll a in early and late summer did not differ between time periods. On the other hand, chlorophyll a in the near bottom zone (bottom 20 m) declined 63% and 54% between 1995-2000 and 2007-2011 in early and late summer respectively. Changes in total phosphorus between 1995-2000 and 2007-2011 were less dramatic, with declines of 22-27% in early summer and 11-30% in late summer. Changes in the chlorophyll a conditions were attributed to dreissenid mussels which reduced material available from the spring bloom and disrupted the horizontal transport of nutrients to the offshore. Although light availability increased (i.e., increased secchi depths), reduced nutrient availability and spring diatom abundance resulted in a much smaller deep chlorophyll layer in 2007-2011.

J	Derbali, A				Derbali, Abdelkarim			First study on the reproductive biology of the clam Polititapes aureus in southern Tunisian waters (Central Mediterranean)	CAHIERS DE BIOLOGIE MARINE												The clam Polititapes aureus is among the most abundant shellfish species in Tunisia. It is widely distributed along the Tunisian coasts. Despite its economic value, the target species is still unexploited and there are no research works focusing on its biology. The present work is the first study examining its reproductive biology during one-year in Tunisian waters. All samples showed a balanced sex ratio; males dominated smaller individuals, while females predominated larger size classes. The obtained total sex ratio (F:M) was equal to 1:1.02. It was also found that males matured at a shell length (SL) ranging from 13 to 22 mm, against 14 and 24 mm SL for female. On the other hand, the size at which 50% of males and females became mature was 18.07 and 20.20 mm SL, respectively. The seasonal variations evaluated using macro-and microscopic characteristics in the gonads of the two sexes showed that this species displayed a clearly defined annual reproductive cycle with two peaks during summer and autumn. Besides, gametogenic activity in males and females was clearly activated by the increase in the seawater temperature in spring and summer. P. aureus exhibited a short resting phase that occurred simultaneously in both sexes during January.																			0007-9723	2262-3094					2022	63	4					317	324		10.21411/CBM.A.D72034C0	http://dx.doi.org/10.21411/CBM.A.D72034C0													WOS:000886781900003
J	Hoffman, AR; Armstrong, DE; Lathrop, RC				Hoffman, Adam R.; Armstrong, David E.; Lathrop, Richard C.			Influence of phosphorus scavenging by iron in contrasting dimictic lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Internal regulatory controls of phosphorus (P) via iron (Fe) scavenging were quantified in four contrasting dimictic Wisconsin lakes: Mendota (eutrophic, calcareous), Fish (mesotrophic, calcareous), Devil's (mesotrophic, noncalcareous), and Sparkling (oligotrophic, noncalcareous). Hypolimnetic enrichment of P was highest in Mendota and Devil's and least in Fish and Sparkling. This enrichment was attributed mainly to internal loading in the noncalcareous lakes and regeneration of sedimenting epilimnetic P in the calcareous lakes. Differences in Fe scavenging efficiencies at fall turnover were related to hypolimnetic Fe: P molar ratios as well as Fe availability and its control by sulfate-sulfide chemistries. In the noncalcareous lakes with high hypolimnetic Fe enrichment (Fe:P > 2), 45% of whole-lake total P was removed. P removal was low (<20%) in the two calcareous lakes with minimal Fe enrichment (Fe:P < 2). These differences in hypolimnetic P enrichment and subsequent Fe scavenging at fall turnover help to explain the differences in the amount of P available for subsequent spring and summer primary production as well as the differences in trophic state of the four lakes.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JUL	2013	70	7					941	952		10.1139/cjfas-2012-0391	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2012-0391													WOS:000321247700001

Davison			Seasonal Abundance and Species Richness of Birds in Common Reed Habitats in Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Common reed (Phragmites australis) forms dense stands with deep layers of residual organic matter that negatively affects plant diversity and possibly habitat use by wetland birds. We sought to determine whether seasonal relative abundance and species richness of birds varied among 3 habitat types in Great Lakes coastal wetland complexes recently invaded by common reed. We used fixed-distance point counts to determine species relative abundances and species richness in edge and interior locales within common reed, cattail (Typha spp.), and meadow marsh habitats of various sizes during 2 summers (2001 and 2002) and 1 autumn (2001) at Long Point, Lake Erie, Ontario, Canada. We found that total relative abundance and species richness of birds were greater in common reed habitat compared to cattail or meadow marsh habitats. However, we also found that relative abundance of marsh-nesting birds was greater in meadow marsh habitat than in cattail and common reed during summer. Lastly, we found that, irrespective of habitat type, habitat edges had higher total relative abundance and species richness of birds than did habitat interiors. Our results show that common reed provides suitable habitat for a diversity of landbirds during summer and autumn but only limited habitat for many marsh-nesting birds during summer. Based on these results, we recommend restoration of meadow marsh habitat through reduction of common reed in Great Lakes wetlands where providing habitat for breeding marsh-nesting birds is an objective. Managers also might consider reducing the size of nonnative common reed stands to increase edge effect and use by birds, possibly including wetland birds.																			0022-541X	1937-2817				SEP	2010	74	7					1559	1567		10.2193/2008-467	http://dx.doi.org/10.2193/2008-467													WOS:000281361200018

Our studies show that Cyanobacteria are widespread in the reservoirs of Guangdong Province; common genera are Microcystis, Pseudanabaena, Cylindrospermopsis, Merismopedia, Chroococcus, Gloeocapsa, Dactylococcopsis, Anabaena, Raphidiopsis and Gloeothece. In summer and autumn, Cyanobacteria become dominant in eutrophic reservoirs and their relative abundance can reach up to 80%. Many species produce toxins, among which the environmentally persistent, hepatotoxic microcystins (MCs) are most prominent. A survey in 2003 showed that, although microcystins were common in Guangdong Reservoirs, their concentration was low. A survey of six reservoirs in 2004 revealed that relatively high MC concentrations appear in summer and autumn; moreover, MC concentrations increase earlier than in temperate regions and persist longer. The MC content during cyanobacterial blooms ranged from 175.8 to 2478.9 mu g/g DW and of Microcystis strains ranged from 16.8 to 982.3 mu g/g DW. Both implied differentiation between toxin-producing Microcystis.																			0077-0639		978-94-007-2006-0				2012	91						109	122		10.1007/978-94-007-2007-7_7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-2007-7_7	10.1007/978-94-007-2007-7												WOS:000301802900007

Trace metal concentrations (Cd, Cu and Zn) in the foot and digestive gland, and biomarkers such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE), catalase ( CAT) and glutathione transferase (GST) activities in the digestive gland, were determined in samples collected at four sites at different periods of the year. One site, in the North of the lagoon, is influenced by urban and industrial waste waters. Another, to the south, is located at the outfall of Ichkeul Lake. A third site is one that may be impacted by eutrophication processes, and the last, in the center of lagoon, is considered as less polluted. Temperature and salinity were simultaneously measured during the mollusc samplings. They varied greatly, from 13.5 degrees C and 30 psu in February to much higher values in summer-autumn: 30.7 degrees C and 37 psu. Metal concentrations were always higher in the digestive gland than in the foot. In the digestive gland, the lowest Cd and Cu concentrations were found in the center of the lagoon (mean +/- standard deviation: 9.35 +/- 0.78 mu g Cd g(-1) and 84.5 +/- 15.3 mu g Cu g(-1)) and no significant Zn variations were noted (682 +/- 38 mu g g(-1)) between sites. Metal concentrations in both types of tissue were higher in winter than in summer. AChE varied significantly among sites with high activities for individuals in the center of lagoon (15.4 +/- 0.3 nmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein), whereas GST were low (12.2 +/- 0.8 nmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein); CAT activities were low in this site 8.7 +/- 0.5 mu mol min(-1) mg(-1) protein. Season also had an influence on biomarkers, with low AChE in winter and rather low CAT and GST in summer. Principal component analysis showed that the center of lagoon can be considered as a reference site, whereas high chemical and biochemical responses were found in M. trunculus from other sites; particularly at the site which may be subject to eutrophication.

J	Guo, JX; Liu, XZ; Liang, Y				Guo, Jia-Xing; Liu, Xiao-Zhen; Liang, Yue			Treatment of Lakeside Domestic Wastewater by an Artificial Horizontal Undercurrent Wetland	JOURNAL OF RESIDUALS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												More than 50% of pollutants found in lake waters in China are derived from rural non-point pollution sources, resulting from untreated domestic wastewater released in rivers that feed into the lakes. There is a need of cost-effective means to treat wastewater locally. To this aim, an undercurrent artificial wetland pilot system was constructed to treat domestic wastewaters of the Wucheng lakeside area. Performance of the planted wetland was assessed by measuring removal rates of chemical oxygen demand (COD), the ammonia fraction of nitrogen (NH3-N), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). Water samples were taken before, during and after treatment, over a period of 7 months covering autumn through early spring. The levels of dissolved oxygen (DO) were also determined. The results showed temporal variations in pollutant concentrations in the wastewater before treatment (except for COD) with higher levels in autumn. The average removal efficiencies of the determined pollutants by the artificial wetland were 42.86% for COD, 29.46% for NH3-N, 31.35% for TN and 21.75% for TP. Removal rates of these pollutants were subject to minor seasonal variation. Along the 20 m horizontal water flow studied, the removal rates were highest in the first section. A horizontal undercurrent artificial wetland is simple to construct, easy to manage, and with low running costs it can treat waters effectively and efficiently. To ensure efficient water purification and reach optimal water quality, the hydraulic load and DO levels should be carefully managed.

However, records with sufficient length and resolution to resolve high-frequency (decadal-scale) variability across the Holocene are scarce. We present a 10,800-year reconstruction of spring and summer temperature at three-year resolution based on biochemical varves from Lake & Zdot;abi & nacute;skie, Poland. The reconstruction is based on Ca/Ti ratio, which are significantly correlated with instrumental spring and summer temperature spanning 240 years. Major climate events of the Holocene period are represented in the reconstruction, including the Holocene Thermal Maximum, 8.2 ka Event, Medieval Climate Anomaly, and Little Ice Age. A low-frequency 8,000-year decreasing trend in warm-season temperatures is driven by declining summer insolation. Temperature variability is highest during the early Holocene, likely related to warmer and drier conditions. The rate of warming during the past 90 years is extremely unusual, if not unprecedented for the Holocene, based on our reconstruction.

In Ushuaia city, Tierra del Fuego, Argentina, sewage effluents have been discharged into natural watercourses without treatment for many years. Organic matter has been introduced until 2016 when improvements in sewage infrastructure were done. The quality of surface sediments from three watercourses with different degree of impact has been studied taking into account contrasting hydrological periods. pH, organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) were measured in austral autumn and spring between 2013 and 2018 in three sections of each watershed. Nutrient content in sediments of upstream sites derives from the contribution ofNothofagusspp. forests through litter-fall. Middle and downstream sites were the most affected by wastewater discharges evidencing that fluvial sediments act as a receptor of the allochthonous organic loads. Particularly, sediments of Buena Esperanza Stream had the lowest mean pH (5.44) and the highest mean concentrations of OC (42.95 mg g(-1)), TN (2.53 mg g(-1)) and SRP (0.067 mg g(-1)), along with the lowest mean annual flow and the largest urbanized area. No differences between hydrological periods were found, although TN and SRP contents were higher in autumn than in the snowmelt season. Minimal differences in nutrients between before and after infrastructure improvement were found. Even when external contributions have been decreased, more time will be necessary to reduce eutrophic conditions of fluvial sediments in southernmost Patagonia.					; Gómez-Armesto, Antía/N-9954-2016; López, Melissa/AAB-2429-2021; Nóvoa-Muñoz, J.

The model explores the impact of wind forcing, water supplement from external watersheds, outflow management and setting up an enclosure in the lake on the hydrodynamics in the Yilong Lake. The results show that (1) the overall velocity of the water body of the Yilong Lake is relatively slow, 90% of the area is lower than 0.01 m s(-1), the central and eastern areas are faster and the western is slower. During the dry period and the wet periods of the year, improves the flow velocity of the water body in 90% of the area is increased by 80% compared to no wind velocity; (2) the increase in the amount of water supplement is significant for the improvement of the hydrodynamic conditions of water body; the water supplement volume at the two water supplement points of Mafangwan is conducive to improving the hydrodynamic conditions. If the total water supplement volume is increased by 10 million cubic meters per year which corresponds to water supplement volume increases at the Pubu and the Mafangwan by 33 and 35%, respectively, then water area with flow velocity greater than 0.007 m s(-1) can be increased to 70%; (3) based on the demand for water quality, the water level management curves for different seasons are designed. It should be dominated by the eastern outflow, during the spring, coordinated by the southern and eastern outflows during the summer, and should be dominated by the southern outflow during the autumn and winter period.

Yet vertical water exchange is still not fully understood and challenging to evaluate in highly dynamic systems. Here, we applied a scaling approach using the vertical timescale, vertical water age (VWA), defined as time since a water parcel last touched the water surface. We established a 3D hydrodynamic-based age model to quantify the vertical water renewal in Xiangxi Bay, a tributary bay of the Three Gorges Dam. The integrated effects of hydrodynamic processes like stratification, intruding density currents from the mainstream, and upstream inflow on the vertical renewal were accounted for. Results indicated that the spatial-temporal distribution of VWA in Xiangxi Bay depended on stratification and forms of intruding density currents. Age was large in spring and summer, and small in autumn and winter, reaching a maximum of 25 days in April. The vertical water renewal was faster during bottom intrusions from the mainstream than during middle and surface intrusions. At times, the epilimnion contained old water due to circulations, and the hypolimnion contained young water due to upstream flushing. In contrast to natural lakes, the bottom water was often younger than overlying intermediate waters. This demonstrated that mixed layer depth was insufficient to fully capture the vertical exchange in riverine systems with significant surface/bottom intrusion. The findings suggested VWA as a quantitative measure of vertical water transport in highly dynamic systems and its usability for environmental water management.

J	WEBB, BW; NOBILIS, F				WEBB, BW; NOBILIS, F			LONG-TERM WATER TEMPERATURE TRENDS IN AUSTRIAN RIVERS	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES												Monthly mean data collected for a 90 year period (1901-1990) have been used to study long term water temperature trends at 10 river sites in Austria. Significant increases in monthly mean values were evident over the study period for seven river stations, but the magnitude of the rise Varied from 0.47 to 1.26 degrees C and its pattern was not uniform between catchments. River temperature trends for individual months also ranged from increases of >2.5 degrees C, through no significant change, to decreases of > 1.0 degrees C. Rises in water temperature during the twentieth century appear to reflect, at least in part, the increasing impact of human activity on Austrian rivers. Progressive regulation of main rivers, such as the Danube and Inn, has resulted in strong increases in mean water temperatures during the low flow period of autumn but not in the summer months when high flows generally occur. Different trends were evident for sites closer to glacial runoff sources, for catchments containing a large proportion of lakes, and for stations influenced by point source discharges and other local factors. Rising mean water temperatures at the end of the study period were related more to the occurrence of mild winters than to the incidence of particularly hot summers.																			0262-6667					FEB	1995	40	1					83	96		10.1080/02626669509491392	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626669509491392													WOS:A1995QF93600006

Shear velocity U-* was incrementally increased 11 times for 10 min each (0-2.57 cm s(-1)) to initiate resuspension. Entrainment rates (E) of suspended particulate matter (E-SPM) and total P (E-TP) were determined by a mass balance. Sandy nearshore sediments at 1-2 m depth showed low E-SPM (0.01-6.64 g m(-2) h(-1)) and E-TP (0.2-2.96 mg m(-2) h(-1)). There was no difference in critical shear velocity (U-*crit) of incipient resuspension between winter and summer. Muddy offshore sediments at 2-3.8 m depth showed higher E-SPM (0.09-106.1 g m(-2) h(-1)) and E-TP (0.06-532.3 mg m(-2) h(-1)). Under ice, U-*crit was 0.9-1.1 cm s(-1) higher than in summer, indicating that the wave-unaffected sediment had ample time for consolidation and biostabilization. Wind-wave modeling, using measured E-SPM and E-TP, revealed that resuspension is primarily (90%) restricted to the nearshore sediments (17% lake area). Our scenarios show that annual entrainment of SPM and TP increased linearly with the duration of ice-free period. Since ice coverage increased shear resistance, climate-driven absence or shortening of ice-cover would reduce the period for settling of particles and their integration into sediments, lowering their biostabilization, thus facilitating resuspension and phytoplankton recruitment in spring after ice thaw.

Habitat use by the species alone (allopatric) and in coexistence with each other (sympatric) was investigated by gill netting at 0-40 m depth contours (surface to bottom) so that several habitats (littoral, epipelagic, pelagic, epibenthic) were sampled. From June to October, trout used mainly littoral and epipelagic habitats in sympatry and allopatry. Char used all habitats in allopatry, and deep habitats (pelagic, epibenthic) not frequented by trout in sympatry. The two species were thus spatially segregated with depth in sympatry. Diel (day, night) and seasonal changes (spring, summer, autumn) in habitat use were not pronounced. The shift in habitat use by experimentally allopatric char but not trout suggests that the effects of competition between sympatric trout and char for habitat resources are greater on the char.

Intraspecific variation in resource use is not explained by population persistence or seasonality	OECOLOGIA												Populations of generalist grazers often contain genotypes with "powerful" and "efficient" strategies. Powerful genotypes grow rapidly on rich-quality resources, but slowly on poorer-quality ones, while efficient genotypes grow relatively better on poorer resources but cannot exploit richer resources as well. Via a "power-efficiency" trade-off, variation in resource quality could maintain genetic diversity. To evaluate this mechanism, we sampled six populations of the freshwater cladoceran Daphnia pulicaria. In persisting (year-round) populations, Daphnia consume resources that vary in quality, whereas in non-persisting (spring-only) populations, Daphnia primarily encounter rich-quality resources. We hypothesized that non-persisting populations harbor no efficient clones (hence should show lower growth on poor-quality resources). Although individuals from non-persisting populations remained smaller than individuals from persisting populations, no evidence arose for a trade-off between powerful and efficient strategies. In fact, growth rates on the two diets were positively correlated (instead of negatively, as predicted). Furthermore, in the persisting populations, we predicted that clonal selection from spring to summer should shift the distribution of genotypes from powerful (specialists on richer spring resources) to efficient (poorer, summer resources). Genetic composition of populations shifted from spring to summer, but not toward more efficient genotypes. Therefore, in these lakes, maintenance of variation among genotypes must stem from more complicated factors than population persistence patterns or seasonal shifts in resource quality alone.

The observed cases of infection in fish featured a high prevalence, when almost all of the fish were infected. However, if an outbreak of the monogenean infection is observed in spring, the intensity of the infection may be low, and when the infection occurs in the ice-covered period (late autumn - winter), the number of parasites on the fins of a single fish may exceed 3000 specimens. Molecular identification of the parasite demonstrated that the infecting clone was identical with rainbow trout specific strain of Gyrodactylus salaris RBT widely spread in Northern Europe, but a small proportion of the parasites were the hybrid clone Gyrodactylus pomeraniae x G. lavareti. Morphological variations of hooks and other opisthaptor parts in the monogenean Gyrodactylus depending on the intensity of infection in rainbow trout were demonstrated.

Effect of winter conditions on distributions of anoxic phototrophic bacteria in two meromictic lakes in Siberia, Russia	AQUATIC ECOLOGY					1st International Winter Limnology Symposium	MAY 24-28, 2008	Kilpisjarvi Biol Stn, Kilpisjarvi, FINLAND	Univ Jyvaskyla, Univ Joensuu, Univ Helsinki	Kilpisjarvi Biol Stn			The year-to-year variations of vertical distribution and biomass of anoxic phototrophic bacteria were studied during ice periods 2003-2005 and 2007-2008 in meromictic lakes Shira and Shunet (Southern Siberia, Russian Federation). The bacterial layers in chemocline of both lakes were sampled with a thin-layer hydraulic multi-syringe sampler. In winter, biomass of purple sulphur bacteria varied considerably depending on the amount of light penetrating into the chemocline through the ice and snow cover. In relatively weakly stratified, brackish Shira Lake, the depth of chemocline varied between winters, so that light intensity for purple sulphur bacteria inhabiting this zone differed. In Shira Lake, increased transparency of mixolimnion in winter, high chemocline position and absence of snow resulted in light intensity and biomass of purple sulphur bacteria exceeding the summer values in the chemocline of the lake. We could monitor snow cover at the lake surface using remote sensing and therefore estimate dynamics and amount of light under ice and its availability for phototrophic organisms. In Shunet Lake, the light intensities in the chemocline and biomasses of purple sulphur bacteria were always lower in winter than in summer, but the biomasses of green sulphur bacteria were similar.

Species from 58 genuses, 32 families and 7 phyla had been found in the investigations, and the major phyla were Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta and Cyanophyta. The average abundance of phytoplankton in summer and winter were 35.92x10(5) cell/L and 6.63x10(5) cell/L, respectively. Even though the unique hydrodynamic conditions of such a water passing lake (during flood seasons Poyang Lake forming a vast lake, but in dry seasons, lake recedes into a channel) make the water environment unstably, Chlorophyta are able to adapt to the conditions and grow well, therefore, the lake was dominated by Chlorophyta, especially Chlorella and Cosmarium, respectively accounting for 56.38 % and 52.10 % of the total abundance in summer and winter. CCA ordination on 12 sampling sites, 58 genuses of phytoplankton and 10 environmental factors demonstrated that there were great geographic differences of water environmental physicochemical conditions in winter, while in summer, it's not significant, besides, DO, water temperatufe and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphate) were the most important environmental factors that regulated the distribution of phytoplankton community.

Therefore, the spatial and temporal variations of NAIs and their influencing factors have attracted much attention. The Wudalianchi Scenic Area was selected as the research area in which to determine the differences of environmental factors that influence NAIs at different time and space scales. The sampling frequency of the field observation data was 1 h. NAI, meteorological factors, gas pollutants, and particulate matter were monitored simultaneously. Pearson correlation analysis, linear regression analysis, principal component analysis, and the Random Forest algorithm were used to quantify the relationship between NAIs and the influencing factors. The results revealed the following: (1) The NAI concentration from least to greatest appeared in the following order: open space (blank) (843 ions cm(-3)) z lake (892 ions cm(-3)) forest (2871 ions cm(-3)); (2) The diurnal variation of NAIs generally presented a U-shaped distribution, and was high in the early morning, decreased at noon, and gradually increased in the evening, with a peak time from 7:00 to 11:00; (3) There may be seasonal variations in the correlation between NAI concentration and single environmental factors, and the correlation between NAI concentration and air temperature was found to be positive in the spring and negative in the summer and autumn, and the effect of wind speed was in contrast to that of temperature; thus, there were seasonal differences in the synergistic relationship between NAI concentration and some environmental factors. NAI concentration was susceptible to various environmental factors, such as gas pollutants and particulate matter, in the spring and autumn; (4) The sensitivity of the NAI concentration to different factors in order from greatest to least was found to be as follows: inside the forest, ozone PM10 > temperature > radiation; outside the forest, humidity > ozone > NO. In general, the relationships between the NAI concentration and the influencing factors were greatly affected by the observed spatio-temporal scale. The research results are of great significance to the construction of forest healthcare. (c) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Kolesar, SE; McKnight, DM; Waters, SB				Kolesar, SE; McKnight, DM; Waters, SB			Late fall phytoplankton dynamics in three lakes, Rocky Mountain National Park	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We studied phytoplankton population dynamics during the month preceding formation of ice cover in three small subalpine lakes in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, U.S.A. The outflow from Emerald Lake, which is surrounded by talus, flows into Dream Lake, which is surrounded by sub-alpine forest. Nymph Lake is a lower seepage lake with abundant macrophytes in summer. The major ion concentrations in the three lakes were similar during the study, although Emerald and Dream Lakes had higher concentrations of nitrate and silica than Nymph Lake. A principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the phytoplankton in Emerald and Dream Lakes were distinct from the phytoplankton in Nymph Lake. The species composition changed in each lake during the late fall. The patterns of change in Emerald and Dream Lakes were similar on the PCA diagram despite the greater abundance of diatoms in Dream Lake and the decreasing flow from Emerald Lake into Dream Lake during the fall. In Nymph Lake, a progressive shift in species distribution occurred with a decrease in the most abundant chlorophyte, Chlamydomonas sp., and increases in several species, including two chrysophytes and the diatom Eunotia sp. The marked change in species composition in all three lakes suggests that phytoplankton populations are influenced by changes in water temperatures and incident solar radiation that occur during the late fall. We also compared these data with phytoplankton data for two fall periods from two other hydrologically connected Rocky Mountain lakes. PCA analysis showed that the difference between years was greater than the change during the fall and that the fall species composition in these two lakes was distinct from that in Emerald and Dream Lakes or in Nymph Lake. Studying phytoplankton dynamics in alpine and sub-alpine lakes may offer clues as to how these ecosystems may respond to projected climate changes in the Rocky Mountain region, such as warmer temperatures and later formation of ice-cover.

But many studies mainly emphasized the influence of fertilizer overuse, neglecting the contribution of accelerated erosion to diffuse N and P pollution. Thus, the objectives of this study were to determine the seasonal changes of sediment and particulate N (PN) and P (PP) entering the river by surface runoff from core sugarcane growing watershed, and clarify their influencing factors. Surface runoff, sediment and associated nutrients were measured in summer and autumn at the outlets of three sub-watersheds under rainfall events, in Nala watershed, southern subtropics of China. The total sediment, PN and PP loads in the entire seasons were 30.9 t ha(-1), 41.1 kg ha(-1) and 14.7 kg ha(-1), respectively. The seasonal exports from the entire watershed in early summer, late summer, early autumn and late autumn were respectively, 8.5, 10.5, 11.6 and 0.3 t ha(-1) for sediment, 15.3, 12.4, 12.9, and 0.4 kg ha(-1) for PN, and 3.4, 5.3, 5.9, and 0.1 kg ha(-1) for PP. The largest sediment and PP exports in late autumn coincided with the rainfall peak (208.8 mm), but the highest PN export in early summer was due to sugarcane establishment and basal fertilizer application in the watershed. Particulate N and P exports across the seasons were equivalent to 14 % and 64 % of applied N (296.4 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) and P (22.8 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) fertilizers, respectively, but PP exports were highest when no fertilizer and 31 % of P fertilizer were applied. Surface runoff had significant positive relationships with exported sediment and particulate nutrient loads, explaining 41-72 % of the seasonal variations in sediment, PN and PP. Ground covered by sugarcane plants was inversely correlated with sediment, PN and PP exports, and explained 15-40 % of the seasonal variations. Applied N fertilizer only had a positive relationship with PN, whereas no significant relationship (P > 0.05) exists between P fertilizer and PP. The contribution of the sub-watersheds to the export of sediment and particulate nutrients only varied spatially with slope gradient. Thus, our results imply that surface runoff played a dominant role in particulate N and P exports from the sugarcane watershed, but the seasonal variations of particulate N and P exports were dependent on a combined effect of surface runoff and fertilization.

J	Sosnovsky, A; Rosso, JJ; Quirós, R				Sosnovsky, Alejandro; Jose Rosso, Juan; Quiros, Rolando			Trophic interactions in shallow lakes of the Pampa plain (Argentina) and their effects on water transparency during two cold seasons of contrasting fish abundance	LIMNETICA												Trophic cascade interactions in shallow lakes have been studied extensively in the north temperate region mainly during the summer period. However, fewer studies have examined these interactions in warmer regions during the winter period. The aim of the present work was to study trophic cascade interactions and their effect on water transparency in small lakes in the Pampean Plain (Argentina) during the cold season. In addition, we examined whether low fish abundance would allow the appearance of key zooplankton genera such as Daphnia. Seven shallow lakes were studied during the autumn-winter period in 2000 and 2001. The dominance of the main primary producers varied between lakes. While five lakes were turbid and dominated by phytoplankton, two lakes were clear and dominated by macrophytes. In the autumn of 2000, fish abundance was reduced from six of these lakes. By the following year, the fish community had recovered naturally. In the phytoplankton dominated lakes, both zooplankton biomass and size were higher during the low fish abundance period. Moreover, large Daphnia were present, contributing to the decrease in algal biomass per unit of nutrients. Thus, Daphnia has the potential to increase water transparency in these lakes. On the other hand, in the vegetated lakes, zooplankton biomass was low and large Daphnia were scarce, probably because of the presence of macroinvertebrate predators. However, water transparency was still high in these ecosystems. From our results, we conclude that trophic interactions probably play a fundamental role in the determination of zooplankton structure and biomass in the small, temperate warm lakes of the Pampean Plain, even during the cold season. Moreover, the effects from fish would reach the lowest levels of the trophic chain, affecting water transparency. However, water transparency might be influenced by other factors as well. Transparency could be naturally elevated in the presence of macrophytes and greatly affected by the hydrology of the region.					; Rosso, Juan/ABC-5504-2020; Sosnovsky, Alejandro/AAD-4982-2022	Rosso, Juan Jose/0000-0001-6730-9385; Sosnovsky, Alejandro/0000-0001-8615-389X; 													0213-8409	1989-1806				DEC	2010	29	2					233	246																WOS:000287287200005

Updating our earlier work published in 2005, we find that with 14 additional years of data, over 90% of snow monitoring sites with long records across the western US now show declines, of which 33% are significant (vs. 5% expected by chance) and 2% are significant and positive (vs. 5% expected by chance). Declining trends are observed across all months, states, and climates, but are largest in spring, in the Pacific states, and in locations with mild winter climate. We corroborate and extend these observations using a gridded hydrology model, which also allows a robust estimate of total western snowpack and its decline. We find a large increase in the fraction of locations that posted decreasing trends, and averaged across the western US, the decline in average April 1 snow water equivalent since mid-century is roughly 15-30% or 25-50 km(3), comparable in volume to the West's largest man-made reservoir, Lake Mead.					; Mote, Philip/AAB-3500-2021; lettenmaier, dennis/T-3088-2017	Xiao, Mu/0000-0002-7437-0739; Mote, Philip/0000-0002-3580-3730													2397-3722						2018	1								2	10.1038/s41612-018-0012-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41612-018-0012-1													WOS:000468007700002

All components of the planktonic food-web were collected from the same water sample (with the exception of crustaceans), counted microscopically, converted to carbon units, and averaged over the euphotic zone. Due to phosphorus load reductions and the impact of non-indigenous mussels in the lower lakes, physical/chemical characteristics of the lower lakes are becoming similar to those in the upper lakes. Spring total phosphorus and euphotic zone depth were relatively similar among all the stations (except western Lake Erie), ranging from 3 to 7 mu g/L and 21 to 26 m, respectively. During the summer total phosphorus concentrations were more variable, but ranged between 4 to 10 mu g/L at all stations except western Lake Erie. Planktonic biomass was correlated with total phosphorus concentration. Within a season, the structure of the planktonic food-web was remarkably similar among all stations across all the lakes. Of the seventeen food-web structure parameters examined, only two exhibited significant differences among stations during the spring isothermal period; only four parameters exhibited significant differences among stations during the summer. Small plankton were very abundant in all the lakes. Picoplankton (0.2 to 2.0 mu m) biomass was approximately equal to the combined biomass of nannoand microplankton (2 to 200 mu m). For microorganisms (all organisms except crustaceans) autotrophic: heterotrophic ratios averaged 1.3 (spring = 1.1, summer = 1.5). The heterotrophic microorganism community was comprised of bacteria (mean = 65%), protozoans (mean = 32%), and rotifers (3%). Even though zebra mussel veligers were found in all the lakes except Lake Superior, their contribution to microorganism biomass never exceeded 1%. Due to seasonal variation in crustacean abundance, the mean contribution of major functional groups varied by season; producers (autotrophs), decomposers (bacteria), micrograzers (protozoans and rotifers), and mesograzers (crustaceans) constituted 40%, 30%, 11%, and 19% of total planktonic carbon, respectively, during the spring, and 32%, 15%, 9%, and 43%, respectively, during the summer. The overall similarity in the structure of the planktonic food-web across all stations in the Great Lakes was attributed to the strong influence of abiotic factors.

J	Andersen, DO; Gjessing, ET				Andersen, DO; Gjessing, ET			Natural organic matter (NOM) in a limed lake and its tributaries	WATER RESEARCH												The chemistry of a limed lake and its main tributaries were studied for 3 years (1992-94) with an emphasis on natural organic matter (NOM). Increased transparency and decreased water colour indicated a general reduction of NOM in the lake. Increased A(254nm)/A(410nm) ratios in the epilimnion during summer and early autumn suggested degradation of higher molecular size organic matter into low molecular size NOM. Increase in ammonium and dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations in the lake was possibly due to the NOM degradation. Using budget calculations and the literature values, photodegradation and microbial activity were estimated to be the main mechanisms of the NOM removal. These mechanisms accounted for about 30-35% and 60-65% of the total loss of organic matter, respectively, in the summer and early autumn period. Low sedimentation rates indicate that co-precipitation of organic matter with calcium, aluminium and/or iron was of minor importance in these seasons. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

They were tagged with a coded wire tag and returned to the river to continue their migration to Lake Huron to begin the parasitic (juvenile) phase of their life. During the spawning run in spring 1992 when the tagged animals were expected to mature and return to spawn, sea lampreys were trapped in nine tributaries to Lake Huron, including the Devil River; 47,946 animals were examined for coded wire tags, and 41 tagged animals were recovered. None of the 45 mature sea lampreys captured in the Devil River in 1992 were tagged, a proportion (0%) significantly lower than the proportion of the recently metamorphosed sea lampreys tagged in 1990. The distribution of tag recoveries among streams lakewide, however, was proportional to catch. Tagged sea lampreys did not appear to home, but instead seemed to select spawning streams through innate attraction to other sensory cues.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAR	1995	124	2					235	239		10.1577/1548-8659(1995)124<0235:EFLOHB>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1995)124<0235:EFLOHB>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1995QN16000008

The incident, reflected and penetrating through the ice solar radiation were measured. The use a highly sensitive equipment for measuring water temperature and dissolved oxygen with a small time step (from 10 seconds to one minute), allowed us to obtain fundamentally new information on the time evolution of heat and mass transfer in the bottom boundary layer during winter. Data analysis indicates the presence of fluctuations in water temperature and dissolved oxygen in a wide range of time scales at different levels of the water column of shallow lakes throughout the winter. The main features of the temperature dynamics in the upper convective layer during the spring convection are described. The vertical velocities as a function of the kinematic heat flux at the lower boundary of the ice are estimated. Chlorophyll "a" for four groups of phytoplankton (green, blue-green, diatoms and cryptophytes) was measured during spring 2011. Based on measurements of solar radiation fluxes at the upper and lower boundaries of ice, water temperature, and chlorophyll "a", it is shown that the vertical convection currents keeps phytoplankton mostly within the convective mixed layer.

However, the strengthened monsoon in Early to Middle Holocene climate model simulations cannot sustain vegetation in the Sahara or account for the increased humidity in the Mediterranean region. Here, we present an 18,500-y pollen and leaf-wax delta D record from Lake Tislit (32 degrees N) in Morocco, which provides quantitative reconstruction of winter and summer precipitation in northern Africa. The record from Lake Tislit shows that the northern Sahara and the Mediterranean region were wetter in the AHP because of increased winter precipitation and were not influenced by the monsoon. The increased seasonal contrast of insolation led to an intensification and southward shift of the Mediterranean winter precipitation system in addition to the intensified summer monsoon. Therefore, a winter rainfall zone must have met and possibly overlapped the monsoonal zone in the Sahara. Using a mechanistic vegetation model in Early Holocene conditions, we show that this seasonal distribution of rainfall is more efficient than the increased monsoon alone in generating a green Sahara vegetation cover, in agreement with observed vegetation. This conceptual framework should be taken into consideration in Earth system paleoclimate simulations used to explore the mechanisms of African climatic and environmental sensitivity.					; Manay Torres, Roger Enrique/AAS-6372-2021; Ochoa, Diana/AAV-1916-2020; Cheddadi, Rachid/GXM-6391-2022; François, Louis/K-9172-2019; Schefuss, Enno/A-7101-2015; Carre, Matthieu/G-6324-2012; Schefuß, Enno/A-7101-2015	Cheddadi, Rachid/0000-0001-5652-8718; Rhoujjati, Ali/0000-0002-8176-7451; NOUR EL BAIT, Majda/0000-0003-3677-8351; Ochoa, Diana/0000-0001-6242-4202; Schefuss, Enno/0000-0002-5960-930X; Carre, Matthieu/0000-0001-8178-7316; Manay, Roger/0000-0002-3645-5547; Francois, Louis/0000-0001-8292-8360													0027-8424	1091-6490				JUN 8	2021	118	23							e2024898118	10.1073/pnas.2024898118	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2024898118								34074769					WOS:000684996800010
J	Jain, S; Lall, U				Jain, S; Lall, U			Magnitude and timing of annual maximum floods: Trends and large-scale climatic associations for the Blacksmith Fork River, Utah	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The magnitude and timing of spring snowmelt floods reflects seasonal snow accumulation and spring temperature patterns. Consequently, interannual variations in regions such as the intermountain West, with snowmelt annual maximum floods, may be related to low-frequency variations in winter/spring large-scale climate variability. Changes in the seasonality of basin precipitation and temperature consequent to slow changes in the baseline climate state (e.g., owing to natural climate variations and/or potential global warming trends) may have significant impacts on such floods. A case study of the Blacksmith Fork River in northern Utah that explores such a hypothesis is presented here. Trends and associations in the magnitude and timing of annual maximum floods are documented, their impact on time-varying estimates of the 100 year flood is assessed, and relationships with known large-scale, quasi-oscillatory patterns of climate variability are explored. Evidence for structured low-frequency variation in flood timing and magnitude and its relation to winter/spring precipitation and temperature and to tropical (EI Nino-Southern Oscillation) and extratropical (Pacific Decadal Oscillation) Pacific climate precursors is presented. Mechanisms for these ocean-atmosphere teleconnections to basin precipitation, temperature, and flood potential are discussed.					; Jain, Shaleen/B-2923-2011; Lall, Upmanu/B-7992-2009	Jain, Shaleen/0000-0003-1792-4421; Lall, Upmanu/0000-0003-0529-8128													0043-1397	1944-7973				DEC	2000	36	12					3641	3651		10.1029/2000WR900183	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2000WR900183													WOS:000165799100019

Water samples were collected from April through November 1992 and analyzed for filtered and unfiltered total Hg, methylmercury (CH3Hg), dimethylmercury, ionic Hg, and elemental Hg to characterize the biogeochemical cycling of Hg during water column stratification and hypolimnetic anoxia. In the spring and late fall when the water column was isothermal, total Hg and CH3Hg concentrations were relatively constant throughout the water column, at approximately 3-7 ng/L and 0.3-1 ng/L, respectively. Through the summer and early fall, CH3Hg concentrations systematically increased in the deeper waters, reaching peak concentration in August and September. In September 1992, CH3Hg concentrations increased from 0.3 ng/L in the epilimnion to 10.6 ng/L in the hypolimnion, an increase of nearly 2 orders of magnitude. At the same time, total Hg increased from 6.6 ng/L in surface water to 21.7 ng/L at depth, a 3-fold increase. The spatial and temporal patterns observed for CH3Hg agree well with manganese, suggesting that CH3Hg and manganese are controlled by processes of the same or parallel cycles.																			0049-6979					FEB	1995	80	1-4					553	562		10.1007/BF01189705	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01189705													WOS:A1995RM44200060

JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Changes in spring phenology at mid- and high latitudes have shown an association with fluctuations of winter surface temperature, with the warmer winters being generally followed by early onsets of the growing season. The study of the interannual variability of timing and length of the growing season is gaining importance because plant phenology is a sensitive indicator of climate change and has broad impacts on terrestrial ecosystems through changes in productivity and in the annual carbon and water cycles. The dependence between onset of the spring season (measured through dates of first leafing, blooming, pollen season start, and ice break in lakes) in Europe and the phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation, a large-scale displacement of air mass between the subarctic and the subtropical regions of the North Atlantic, has been studied in detail. The effects of this oscillation include climatic anomalies in the months preceding the onset of the Northern Hemisphere growing season, with important impacts on spring phenology.					; D'Odorico, Paolo/HTQ-6744-2023	D'Odorico, Paolo/0000-0002-0007-5833; 													0894-8755	1520-0442					2002	15	4					435	445		10.1175/1520-0442(2002)015<0435:CSAEOT>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0442(2002)015<0435:CSAEOT>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000173561600007

This has caused the lake to shift from oligo-mesotrophic to hypertrophic conditions, symptomized by toxic cyanobacterial blooms, dominated by the non-N-2 fixing genus Microcystis. From 2008 to 2013, a series of in situ microcosm and mesocosm nutrient addition bioassays were conducted that were focused on the heavily polluted northern region (i.e., Meiliang Bay) and other lake locations. Bioassays showed that phytoplankton production, as chlorophyll a and photopigments diagnostic of major phytoplankton groups, was controlled by P inputs from spring to early summer, while N played a more dominant controlling role in summer-fall. In most cases, combined N and P additions promoted maximum growth. This pattern proved true for both the highly eutrophic northern region and the less-eutrophic central and southern regions. Cyanobacteria, chlorophytes, and cryptophytes all showed the strongest positive responses to N and N+P enrichment during the summer bloom period, while diatoms were the least abundant then and just moderately stimulated by nutrient additions. Cyanobacteria failed to selectively respond to P inputs during the summer bloom period, contradicting the paradigm that selective P enrichment will favor them, especially the N-2-fixing genera. Rather, Microcystis-dominated blooms remained N-limited during summer months and were not replaced by N-2-fixing genera, indicating that internal N and P regeneration of previously loaded nutrients must be sustaining blooms. Successful 'de-eutrophication' of Taihu will require reductions of both N and P inputs in all lake regions in order to control blooms and counter the legacy of several decades of nutrient over-enrichment.					xu, hai/JEP-5422-2023; Paerl, Hans/ACA-9911-2022; Qin, Boqiang/E-5900-2013														0270-5060	2156-6941				JAN 2	2015	30	1			SI		5	24		10.1080/02705060.2014.994047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2014.994047													WOS:000349680600001

An integrated three dimensional, hydrodynamic, sediment transport, wave current bottom boundary layer, and wave model is applied to simulate the hydrodynamics and sediment transport. A curvilinear grid system with 208 by 79 cells in the horizontal direction and 12 sigma layers in the vertical direction is used to cover the whole lake and the 12 km long dredged channel of the Maumee River. Four sediment transport application cases are constructed under strong and weak storms in spring and fall. The numerical simulation results reveal the sediment transport and formation mechanisms of the two mobile sediments mounds in the Maumee River/Lake Erie confluence under storms. Under strong storms/seiches, Mound 1, the upstream one, is mainly formed by riverine sediment inflow and settlement while Mound 2, the downstream one, is mainly formed by sediment resuspension in the river bottom upstream of Mound 2. During weak storms both Mounds I and 2 are maintained by riverine sediment settlement with bottom sediment upstream of Mound I being the second largest contributor to the formation and maintenance of Mound 2. Strong vertical thermal stratification exists in spring, but not in fall. This stratification influences the sediment transport in the river/coastal confluence. Under both strong and weak storms/seiches, the riverine sediment deposition at Mound I is more in spring than in fall, but more in fall than in spring at Mound 2; the total sediment transport into the Maumee Bay is more in fall than in spring.																					0-7844-0734-7				2004							1054	1074																WOS:000228129600064

The habitat and diet variation of rudd were studied in Lake Banyoles (Spain), an oligotrophic karstic lake dominated by exotic fish species. Rudd were strictly littoral and the diet was based on detritus and plant material. The most important animal prey were the cladocerans Daphnia longispina and Scapholeberis rammneri, amphipods and several late stages of nematoceran dipterans. Rudd were more zooplanktivorous in spring and autumn and less in summer. There was also a size-dependent diet shift, from microcrustaceans to macroinvertebrates. The diet of rudd was also distinguished by the importance of plant material and various small neustonic invertebrates, particularly S. rammneri and late stages of nematocerans, showing a strong resource partitioning with other fish species. The degree of herbivory in Lake Banyoles was lower than usual.

Substantial numbers of animals with empty or partially-full guts indicated that P. hoyi feeds intermittently unlike other continuous-feeding amphipods which routinely maintain uniformly full guts among all members of a population. The incidence of animals with empty, partially-full, and full guts also varied significantly with animal size and sampling date and implied that aspects of the amphipod''s life history, and seasonality, were primarily responsible for changes in feeding rates. Overall, P. hoyi gut fullness was greatest in spring and, secondarily, in autumn, reflecting an opportunistic feeding strategy that exploited newly-deposited detritus generated from spring and autumn phytoplankton blooms. This strategy, in association with P. hoyi''s known capacity to store energy as lipids may largely explain P. hoyi''s exclusive and widespread distribution in profundal areas of the upper Great Lakes, compared to other amphipods.																			0380-1330						1988	14	2					178	187		10.1016/S0380-1330(88)71547-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(88)71547-6													WOS:A1988N631100008

Primary (O2) production in Lake Hazen may have occurred largely before the ice began to melt, but was unmeasurable in summer. Primary production in the pond was about the same as in other small arctic lakes. Cyclops scutifer was overwhelmingly dominant in Lake Hazen. C. scutifer and Daphnia middendorffiana were commonest in the pond. C. scutifer is annual in Scandinavia, often with coexisting spring-born and fall-born generations. On Ellesmere Island the pond appears to contain alternating annual and biennial generations, whereas the species is strictly biennial in Lake Hazen. Numbers of C. scutifer in Lake Hazen were greatly reduced as a result of summer ice conditions between 1958 and 1961, while the rotifer Keratella hiemalis increased. Estimated mean standing crop (96 mg/m2) and net production (1.0 mg/m2-day) in dry weight of C. scutifer in Lake Hazen during the summer of 1958 were extremely low. In early Aug. the crop of this species in the pond was about the same as in Lake Hazen, but net production was some 15 times as large, and other zooplankters added considerably to crop and production of the pond.																									1964	42	4					613	+		10.1139/z64-053	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z64-053													WOS:A19648171A00015

Behavioural responses of a cold-water benthivore to loss of oxythermal habitat	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Climate-driven declines in oxythermal habitat in freshwater lakes can impose prolonged constraints on cold-water fishes sensitive to hypoxia. How fish cope with severe habitat limitations is not well understood, yet has implications for their persistence. Here, we use acoustic-positioning telemetry to assess seasonal habitat occupancy and activity patterns of lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), a cold-water benthivore, in a small boreal lake that regularly faces severe oxythermal constraints during summer stratification. During this stratified period, they rarely (<15% of detections) occupied depths with water temperatures> 10 degrees C (interquartile range= 5.3-7.9 degrees C), which resulted in extensive use (>90% of detections) of water with <4 mg L(-1)dissolved oxygen (DO; interquartile range= 0.3-5.3 mg L-1). Lake whitefish were least active in winter and spring, but much more active in summer, when only a small portion of the lake (1-10%) contained optimal oxythermal habitat (<10 degrees C and>4 mg L-1DO), showing frequent vertical forays into low DO environments concurrent with extensive lateral movement (7649 m d(-1)). High rates of lateral movement (8392 m d(-1)) persisted in the complete absence of optimal oxythermal habitat, but without high rates of vertical forays. We found evidence that lake whitefish are more tolerant of hypoxia (<2 mg L-1) than previously understood, with some individuals routinely occupying hypoxic habitat in winter (up to 93% of detections) despite the availability of higher DO habitat. The changes in movement patterns across the gradient of habitat availability indicate that the behavioural responses of lake whitefish to unfavourable conditions may lead to changes in foraging efficiency and exposure to physiological stress, with detrimental effects on their persistence.

J	Benedek, CL; Willis, IC				Benedek, Corinne L.; Willis, Ian C.			Winter drainage of surface lakes on the Greenland Ice Sheet from Sentinel-1 SAR imagery	CRYOSPHERE												Surface lakes on the Greenland Ice Sheet play a key role in its surface mass balance, hydrology and biogeochemistry. They often drain rapidly in the summer via hydrofracture, which delivers lake water to the ice sheet base over timescales of hours to days and then can allow melt-water to reach the base for the rest of the summer. Rapid lake drainage, therefore, influences subglacial drainage evolution; water pressures; ice flow; biogeochemical activity; and ultimately the delivery of water, sediments and nutrients to the ocean. It has generally been assumed that rapid lake drainage events are confined to the summer, as this is typically when observations are made using satellite optical imagery. Here we develop a method to quantify backscatter changes in satellite radar imagery, which we use to document the drainage of six different lakes during three winters (2014/15, 2015/16 and 2016/17) in fast-flowing parts of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Analysis of optical imagery from before and after the three winters supports the radar-based evidence for winter lake drainage events and also provides estimates of lake drainage volumes, which range between 0.000046 +/- 0.000017 and 0.0200 +/- 0.002817 km(3). For three of the events, optical imagery allows repeat photoclinometry (shape from shading) calculations to be made showing mean vertical collapse of the lake surfaces ranging between 1.21 +/- 1.61 and 7.25 +/- 1.61m and drainage volumes of 0.002 +/- 0.002968 to 0.044 +/- 0.009858 km(3). For one of these three, time-stamped ArcticDEM strips allow for DEM differencing, which demonstrates a mean collapse depth of 2.17 +/- 0.28m across the lake area. The findings show that lake drainage can occur in the winter in the absence of active surface melt and notable ice flow acceleration, which may have important implications for subglacial hydrology and biogeochemical processes.

We used the state-of-the-art complex, dynamic, mechanistic model GOTM-FABM-PCLake to quantify the impacts of extreme summer warming on a summer-stratified temperate Danish lake. Simulated values of all calibrated parameters (water temperature, DO, NO3, NH4, TN, PO4, TP and Chl.-a) agreed well with observed values over the whole calibration and validation period and generally exhibited the same seasonal dynamics and inter-annual variations as the monitoring data. A series of climate scenarios with different summer heat wave frequencies and duration were set up to quantify the effects on the ecosystem state of the lake. Our simulations showed that summer surface mean TN will decrease with rising summer heat wave frequencies, while summer surface mean TP and Chl.-a and the biomass and proportion of cyanobacteria will increase. Following a summer heat wave, the lake approached baseline conditions in the autumn, but with increasing frequency of heatwaves the recovery period increased. Our results suggest that compliance with existing legislation, such as EU's Water Framework Directive, will become increasingly challenging in a future scenario with increased temperatures and more frequent heatwaves.

J	CORNETT, RJ; OPHEL, IL				CORNETT, RJ; OPHEL, IL			TRANSPORT OF CO-60 BETWEEN WATER AND SEDIMENTS IN A SMALL SHIELD LAKE	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Low levels of 60Co, discharged from a waste management area, have flowed into a small shield lake over a period of 22 yr. Constructing a mass balance using measured waterflows, measurements of 60Co activities in the inflow, in the bottom sediments, and in the lake outlet provides a unique record of the isotope''s behaviour. The long-term, annual, and seasonal movements of 60Co between the water, sediments, and the outflow have been examined and compared. An instantaneously mixed, single reservoir model with constant parameters accurately simulated the average annual variations in 60Co activity in the water and in the sediments. The lake sediments were the major sink for 60Co. More than 90% of the 60Co present in the lake system at any one time was found in the sediments. However, less than half of the total 60Co inputs were retained in the sediments over the 22-yr period. The remainder left the lake through the outflow. The fractional rate of 60Co deposition in the sediments was independent of the rate of 60Co inputs and independent of the 60Co activity in the lake sediments. Seasonal changes in 60Co concentrations in the lake water were vary large. Spring and summer concentrations were often 50-500% lower than predicted from a model that simulated annual average concentrations. The bias was likely due to rapid removal of 60Co by increased scavenging of the isotope by particulates. During the winter, 60Co concentrations in the lake water were greater than expected, probably due to the exclusion of 60Co from lake ice, incomplete mixing of the inflow with the lake water, or release of 60Co from the sediments. These seasonal variations in the 60Co activity were accurately simulated by a single reservoir model using different removal rates for the summer and winter periods.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				APR	1986	43	4					877	884		10.1139/f86-108	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f86-108													WOS:A1986A801900019

In half of the lakes picocyanobacteria abundance was significantly correlated with temperature, while in other lakes the presence of a small spring peak resulted in a poor correlation with temperature. In all lakes there was a significant correlation between epilimnetic abundance and day of the year. Correlations with water chemistry parameters (soluble reactive phosphorus, total phosphorus, particulate C:P and C:N) were generally weaker or insignificant. However, in the three lakes with the highest spring nitrate concentrations, a significant negative correlation with nitrate was observed. During summer stratification, picocyanobacteria abundance reached a maximum within the metalimnion and at or above the euphotic zone (1 % of incident light) in all lakes. These peaks were not related to nutrient gradients. The average total phytoplankton biomass ranged from 0.5 g m-3 (wet weight) in the most oligotrophic lake to 1.4 g m-3 for the most mesotrophic with picoplankton biomass ranging from 0.01 g m-3 to 0.3 g m-3. Picocyanobacteria biomass comprised 1 to 9 % of total phytoplankton biomass in late summer, but in one year for one lake represented a maximum of 56 %. Other photosynthetic picoplankton (unidentified eukaryotes, Chlorella spp. Nannochloris spp.), although less abundant (10(3) cells.ml-1) than picocyanobacteria, represented biomass equal or greater than that of the picocyanobacteria in spring and early summer. On average, half of the photosynthetic picoplankton biomass was eukaryotic in the more coloured lakes, while in the clear lakes less than 20 % was eukaryotic. Among the lakes there was a significant positive correlation between the average light extinction coefficient and the proportion of eukaryotic biomass of the picoplankton. In mesotrophic Jack's Lake, the contribution of picoplankton to the maximum photosynthetic rate ranged from 10 to 47 % with the highest values in the spring (47 %) and late summer (33 %), as a result of eukaryotic picoplankton and picocyanobacteria respectively. Picocyanobacteria cell specific growth rates were high during July (0.6-0.8 day-1) and losses were close to 80 % of the growth rate. Thus, despite low biomass, photosynthetic picoplankton populations appeared to turn over rapidly and potentially contributed significantly to planktonic food webs in early spring and late summer.

The European Commission's Copernicus Land Monitoring Service Platform provides free turbidity data for large lakes to monitor the global water quality of lakes. However, the data were missing from April 2012 to April 2016, severely limiting long-term analysis. Based on MODIS and turbidity data, Random Forest and XGBoost models are used to invert Tonle Sap Lake's turbidity. Random Forest outperformed the XGBoost model. Based on Random Forest model, missing data were filled in to construct longterm series data of Tonle Sap Lake turbidity (2004-2021). Trend, persistence and correlation analyses were conducted to reveal spatiotemporal characteristics and driving mechanism of turbidity. The results showed that: (1) spatially, the average annual, monthly, and seasonal turbidity was higher in the north but lower in the south, with regions of higher turbidity exhibiting more significant changes; (2) temporally, the annual turbidity mean was 53.99 NTU and showed an increasing trend. Monthly, turbidity values were higher from March to August and lower from September to February, with the highest and lowest recorded in June and November at 110.06 and 5.82 NTU, respectively. Seasonally, turbidity was higher in spring and summer compared to autumn and winter, with mean turbidity values of 84.16, 93.47, 15.33 and 23.21 NTU, respectively; (3) In terms of sustainability, the Hurst exponent for annual turbidity was 0.23, indicating a reverse trend in the near future; (4) Dam construction's impact on turbidity was not significant. Compared with natural factors (permanent wetlands, grasslands, lake surface water temperature, and remote sensing ecological index), human activities (barren, urban and built-up lands, croplands and population density) had a more significant impact on turbidity.

However, migration can also incur costs, and quantifying these costs can provide important clues to the ultimate ecological forces that underpin migratory behaviour. A key emerging model to explain migration in many systems posits that migration is driven by seasonal changes to a predation/growth potential (p/g) trade-off that a wide range of animals face. In this study we assess a key assumption of this model for a common cyprinid partial migrant, the roach Rutilus rutilus, which migrates from shallow lakes to streams during winter. By sampling fish from stream and lake habitats in the autumn and spring and measuring their stomach fullness and diet composition, we tested if migrating roach pay a cost of reduced foraging when migrating. Resident fish had fuller stomachs containing more high quality prey items than migrant fish. Hence, we document a feeding cost to migration in roach, which adds additional support for the validity of the p/g model of migration in freshwater systems.					; Nilsson, Anders/H-6836-2014; Hansson, Lars-Anders/HCI-2735-2022; Baktoft, Henrik/E-6581-2011; Skov, Christian/X-6511-2019; Grønkjær, Peter/A-3697-2008; Gronkjaer, Peter/A-3697-2008	Hansson, Lars-Anders/0000-0002-3035-1317; Nilsson, Anders/0000-0002-3541-9835; Baktoft, Henrik/0000-0002-3644-4960; Gronkjaer, Peter/0000-0003-1337-4661; Skov, Christian/0000-0002-8547-6520													1932-6203					MAY 28	2013	8	5							e61223	10.1371/journal.pone.0061223	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0061223								23723967					WOS:000319733000003

The three sites showed similar congener compositions with BDEs-28, -47, -99, -207 and -209 as the dominant congeners. The gas phase contribution ranged from 42.1% +/- 17.1% of the total PBDEs in summer to 9.0% +/- 8.6% in winter. Partitioning of PBDEs between gas and particulate phases was well correlated with the subcooled liquid vapor pressure (P-L(0)) for all samples. Both Junge-Pankow adsorption model and K-OA-based absorption model fitted well the PBDEs data in winter but overestimated the sorption of PBDEs in summer. The mean atmospheric concentrations of BDE5-47 (2748 pg m(-3) in summer and 6146 pg m(-3) in winter) and -99 (1656 pg m(-3) in summer and 4911 pg m(-3) in winter) in GY were much higher than those from other places around the world. Additionally, the time series of PBDEs in GY demonstrated a pronounced diurnal variation pattern, but not CD and GR, where PBDEs appeared partly associated with regional accumulation. Source characterization from local emissions may be the major factor controlling the diurnal variation of PBDEs in GY air. The risk assessment showed that the total daily intakes of BDE-99 in GY was 9.0-34.9 ng kg(-1)-bw d(-1). which is higher than the maximal allowed intake level (0.26 ng kg(-1)-bw d(-1)) with factors of 35-135, indicating possible health risk for GY residents with exposure to PBDEs.

Results showed that cyanobacteria abundance in water column decreased from autumn to winter but increased in the sediment; in spring, cyanobacteria abundance decreased in sediment but increased in water column. Since phycocyanin in the sediment fluctuated during the year with maxima in March and minima in September, vertical migration and recruitment of cyanobacteria were apparent. Algal abundance and composition changed in the water column. Chlorophytes dominated phytoplankton community initially and were replaced by cyanobacteria especially Microcystis spp., which underwent a colony-enlargement process and evolved from colonies with a few cells to those with dozens or hundreds of cells before blooming in late June.					; yu, yang/HIZ-9682-2022	, Min/0000-0002-8130-5214; 													1684-5315					OCT 5	2009	8	19					4977	4982																WOS:000273274900037

Eleven years (2010 to 2021) of daily P, total suspended solids (TSS), discharge, and climatological data were aggregated from three Canadian tributaries that form a gradient of tiled areas: East Sydenham River (ESR, 60% tile), Thames River (TR, 48% tile), and Grand River (GR, 23% tile). Instead of using traditional seasons (winter, spring, summer, fall), we classified seasons by air temperature to highlight hydrological periods of importance for P loss through tile drains. Seasons included frozen (<-3.2 degrees C), thawing (-3.2 - 6.7 degrees C), bare (6.7 - 15.9 degrees C), and growing (>15.9 degrees C). Nonparametric comparisons revealed that during every season, the ESR and TR had significantly higher soluble reactive P (SRP) and total P (TP) concentrations than the GR. For %SRP, the ESR was significantly higher than the other rivers during every season, while for TSS, the GR was significantly higher than the other rivers during every season. Only during the thawing season were positive relationships observed in every river between year-over-year tile-drainage proportion and associated P loadings and concentrations. The ESR was the only river to yield significant relationships between tile drainage and P in all seasons except the frozen season. Our findings suggest that increases in tile-drainage area can lead to increases in SRP loading to Lake Erie from Canadian tributaries, especially during the thawing season. However, effects of tile drainage are moderated by differences in soil texture, land-use-land-cover, climate, and point sources.																			0380-1330					OCT	2024	50	5							102396	10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102396	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102396		SEP 2024											WOS:001324456100001

The bloom-forming cyanobacteria are capable of nuisance growth and produce toxins, resulting in serious threats to water safety and human health. This paper summarized physiological and ecological characteristics of bloom-forming cyanobacteria in their annual life cycle, internal regulation mechanisms and environmental factors for blooms formation. In winter, dormant period is regarded as the continuation of cyanobacteria populations, which conserve "seed bank" for the following year. In spring, recruitment can be defined as an inoculation of overwintering cyanobacteria to the pelagic phase after growth recovery under suitable conditions. Temperature, resuspension and bioturbation had been recognized to be the main driving factors for recruitment. Shortly after recruitment, cyanobacteria establish dominance by fast growth rate and colony enlargement strategy. Under suitable meteorological and hydrological conditions, cyanobacterial colonies aggregate and float up to form heavy blooms, which can lead to water supply crisis and ecological disaster. From late autumn, blooms disaggregate and decline. The sinking process is not only a periodic life cycle but also an irregular mechanical movement. Cyanobacteria accumulation areas in late autumn might highly related to the first occurence locality of blooms in the following year. This information could provide valuable information for the prediction and prevention of cyanobacterial blooms, so as to establish a more stable and healthy ecosystem in lakes.																			1660-9336		978-3-03785-485-3				2012	209-211		1-3				1227	1230		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.209-211.1227	http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.209-211.1227													WOS:000319231000238
J	Szynkiewicz, A; Olichwer, T; Tarka, R				Szynkiewicz, Anna; Olichwer, Tomasz; Tarka, Robert			Delineation of groundwater provenance in Arctic environment using isotopic compositions of water and sulphate	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Little is known about water-rock interaction related to deeper groundwater flows along tectonic discontinuities in the Arctic glacial catchments. Therefore, we analyzed oxygen and sulfur isotope compositions (delta O-18, delta S-34) of dissolved sulfate (SO42-) to better understand this process in groundwater from mineral and thermal springs and subglacial outflows of southern Spitsbergen. Our results show that coupled delta O-18-delta S-34 of SO42- is a useful measure of groundwater provenance and its relation to water-rock interaction along flow paths in different lithologies. In the studied area, groundwater-rock interaction with carbonate and crystalline rocks contributes two different sources of sulfide-derived SO42- with distinctive isotope compositions and leaves similar isotopic signature as in shallow surface environment (e.g., proglacial lakes and streams). The sulfide-derived SO42- from Paleozoic carbonates has lower delta S-34 (+5 parts per thousand) and higher delta O-18(- 5 parts per thousand) compared to higher delta S-34 (+ 10 to +15 parts per thousand) and more negative delta O-18(- 10 parts per thousand) in the Precambrian crystalline rocks. Minor contributions of SO42- are from sea spray. Conversely, direct inflows of seawater appear to be negligible, if any. Moreover, the more negative delta H-2 and delta O-18 values (- 85 to - 70%o and -12 to - 9 parts per thousand, respectively) suggest that majority of the studied groundwater and surface water is from melting of snow/ice formed in fall/winter months compared to lower contributions from spring/summer precipitation with higher delta H-3 and delta O-18 (- 65 to - 55 parts per thousand and - 8 to - 6 parts per thousand). Interestingly, the water-soluble SO42- from the Antarctic soils with high delta S-34 (+12 to + 16 parts per thousand) and negative delta O-18 (-15 to +5 parts per thousand) is remarkably similar to the sulfide-derived SO42- from the Precambrian crystalline rocks analyzed by us in southern Spitsbergen. This implies that sulfide oxidation might be a widespread process in polar environments, even under extremely dry conditions as in Antarctica.					; Tarka, Robert/S-8563-2018	Olichwer, Tomasz/0000-0002-9989-4504; Tarka, Robert/0000-0002-2973-8258													0022-1694	1879-2707				JAN	2020	580								124232	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124232	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124232													WOS:000509620900001

Climate warming is expected to change respiration in shallow lakes but to an extent that depends on nutrient state. 2. We measured sediment respiration (SR) over the season in the dark on intact sediment cores taken from a series of flow-through, heated and unheated, nutrient-enriched and unenriched mesocosms. The natural seasonal temperature cycle ranged from 2 to 20 degrees C in the unheated mesocosms. In the heated mesocosms, the temperature was raised 4-6 degrees C above ambient temperatures, depending on season, following the A2 climate change scenario downscaled to the local position of the mesocosms, but enlarged by 50%. We further measured ecosystem respiration (ER) in the mesocosms based on semi-continuous oxygen measurements. 3. SR changed over the season and was approximately ten times higher in summer than in winter. SR showed no clear response to warming in the nutrient-enriched treatment, while it increased with warming in the unenriched mesocosms which also had lower fish densities. 4. ER was not affected by artificial warming or nutrient enrichment, but it was ten times higher in summer than in winter. 5. SR contributed 24-32% to ER. The SR:ER ratio was generally stimulated by warming and was higher in winter than in summer, especially in the nutrient-enriched mesocosms. 6. Our results indicate that climate warming may lead to higher SR, especially in clear, macrophyte-dominated systems. Moreover, the contribution of SR to ER will increase with higher temperatures, but decrease as the winters get shorter.

Some nonbreeders remain for the summer, and in the autumn the lake becomes a staging area that may accommodate 750,000 returning breeders and young of the year. There the birds become obese by feeding on invertebrates and, if they have not already done so, molt. Most grebes remain several months until a decline in prey populations stimulates further migration. During this period the birds become flightless, and the flight muscles may lose up to 50% of their mass. Myofibers from atrophic birds show evidence of mitochondrial division (or fusion). Even severely atrophic fibers retain a high mitochondrial density (27% vs. 33% in migratory condition), so that relative volume remains stable although absolute volume is reduced. In contrast, intracellular triglyceride droplets are extremely sparse in atrophic fibers, even though most of the birds are carrying > 200 g of subcutaneous fat. Mean myofiber diameter increases and decreases with atrophy and hypertrophy. In late autumn, as food availability declines, the birds engage in conspicuous flapping exercises. In the same period, intracellular lipid reappears in the muscles. Within several weeks the muscles are rebuilt to full size and the grebes emigrate. The benefits, if any, of this cycle of muscle atrophy and concomitant obesity, followed by muscle hypertrophy and weight loss, remain obscure.																				1938-4254				OCT	1990	107	4					649	659		10.2307/4087994	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4087994													WOS:A1990EG01600001

ABIOTIC FACTORS AND PHYTOPLANKTON	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Located at 1197 m in the Massif Central Francais, Lake Pavin has a volcanic origin. Samples were collected bimonthly at 8 depths (0-40 m) from May 1973-April 1974. Physicochemical parameters (light energy, temperature, pH, conductivity, O2, N, P, silica, C) and dynamics of phytoplanktonic populations (cells counts, standing crop, primary production, photosynthetic pigments) were studied. The waters of this lake are clear, with low conductivity and high concentrations of O2 in the first 40 m. In a water column, 0-40 m, the means of N2 concentrations are between 45 and 279 .mu.g/l and between 0 and 161 .mu.g/l for P. The phytoplankton is characterized by an important development of diatoms (Melosira italica ssp. subarctica and Asterionella formosa) in winter and spring, opposed to low standing crops of Chlorophycea (Coenococcus, Sphaerocystis, Chlamydomonas) in summer. The highest values of the activity coefficient (P/B [production/biomass]) are found during the development of Chlorophycea, but photosynthetic efficiency is maximum in winter for diatom populations. To summarize physicochemical parameters and phytoplankton relationships, a synthetical, mathematical model was made by principal components analysis.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1980	68	2					167	189		10.1007/BF00019702	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00019702													WOS:A1980JE42800007

Simulated impacts of climate change on Lake Simcoe water quality	INLAND WATERS												Lake Simcoe has undergone eutrophication and hypoxia since the 1960s. Climate change, leading to enhanced summer thermal stratification, has been identified as a key stressor. In this study, we modeled the impacts of climate change on hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry in Lake Simcoe by applying a 1-dimensional (vertical) model forced with A2 and B1 scenario outputs from a global climate model over 2000-2100. The model was calibrated in 2008 and validated in 2009, with maximum root mean square error (RMSE) of modelled temperature between 1.5 and 3.0 degrees C and dissolved oxygen RMSE between 0.5 and 2.5 mg L-1. Phytoplankton chlorophyll a was simulated with RMSE between 1.25 mu g L-1 (large diatoms) and similar to 0.5 mu g L-1 (other groups). Interannual variability in spring water temperature and length of stratification were related to changes in the North Atlantic and Artic Oscillation indices, respectively. Under A2 and B1 forcing, the duration of stratification will increase by 45 and 38 days in summer between spring and fall turnover, respectively. The extended stratified period leads to a reduction in hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen from 3-7 to <3 mg L-1, thereby reducing the quality of cold-water fish habitat and increasing internal phosphorus loading from the benthos. These internal loads, combined with increased water temperatures, lead to increased cyanobacteria concentrations, beginning around 2070.																			2044-2041	2044-205X				APR 3	2022	12	2					215	231		10.1080/20442041.2021.1969190	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2021.1969190		DEC 2021											WOS:000728639900001

Spring-season changes during the Late Pleniglacial and Bolling/Allerod interstadial	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Earlier spring onset and the associated extension of the growing season in high latitudes belong to the most obvious consequences of global warming. The natural dynamics of growing-season properties during past climate shifts however, are extremely difficult to reconstruct since temperature reconstructions are hardly ever seasonally resolved and the applied proxies such as chirinomid or pollen analysis are mainly sensitive to summer temperatures. Here we apply a newly developed leaf cuticle-based proxy to reconstruct growing degree-days (GOD) in a quantitative way and to estimate changes in the timing of spring onset over the last deglaciation. Cuticle analyses of fossil birch leaves preserved in lake sediments from southern Germany reveal extremely low GDD values during the Late Pleniglacial, which are rapidly increasing at the onset of the Bolling/Allerod interstadial. While temperature and GDDs show a simultaneous warming during deglaciation, a GDD decline precedes lowering of summer temperatures during the Older Dryas cooling.

Numbers of total coliforms, fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci were 3-9 times higher in dry sand than in the seawater and 2-6 times higher in dry sand than in wet sand. Within a year, number of fecal bacteria inhabiting the sand and seawater showed considerable monthly changes. The highest number of the studied fecal indicator bacteria in the seawater and sand occurred in spring-summer season and the best sanitary state was noted in the winter months. There were differences in the numbers of fecal indicator bacteria between the surface and subsurface sand layer with a clear decreasing trend in the number of the studied bacteria with increasing depth.					; Perliński, Piotr/AAI-5231-2021	Perlinski, Piotr/0000-0002-9296-7184; 													0717-3326	0718-1957				DEC	2012	47	3					503	512		10.4067/S0718-19572012000300012	http://dx.doi.org/10.4067/S0718-19572012000300012													WOS:000315586800012

The common temporal patterns were originating from the effects caused by winter climate, and from corresponding synchronisms in the interannual variations in the extent of the spring water renewal and replenishment of nutrients. In turn, the sequence of linked causal events was triggered by two atmospheric modes of variability relevant for the Mediterranean region, i.e. the East Atlantic pattern (EA) and the Eastern Mediterranean Pattern (EMP). In contrast, there were no significant relationships of air and water temperatures with the North Atlantic Oscillation. In oligotrophic lakes, which were characterised by weak vertical nutrient gradients, the spring replenishment of P was negligible and difficult to detect (Maggiore), or detectable but of minor importance (Garda and Como) compared to that measured in more enriched lakes (Iseo and Lugano). The applicability of EA and EMP in the study of the impact of climate on aquatic ecosystems will require to be tested by expanding the number, typology, and geographical location of water bodies in the Alpine and Mediterranean regions.

The overwintering population in Marion Lake reproduced in March and then died after the completion of brooding. The spring generation grew rapidly and a 2nd generation of young was produced in July. After summer growth the 2nd generation formed the next overwintering population. The overwintering population in Newsome Pond reproduced in May and then died after completion of brooding. After summer growth this generation formed the next overwintering population. It is suggested that copulation in Newsome Pond occurs in the fall with egg production the following spring. An annual migration between the shore zone and deep water zone occurred in Newsome Pond. During most of the ice free periods H. stagnalis were in high densities in the shore zone and in very low densities in the deeper waters. Conversely during periods of ice cover the densities in the deeper waters increased and none were found on shore. In Marion Lake between April and Nov. 84.4% of the H. stagnalis collected were in water less than 2 m deep; during the rest of the year 93.2% were collected from water deeper than 2 m. The life cycle in Marion Lake is similar to that described previously in England and Wales with 2 generations per year. The life cycle in Newsome Pond is the 1st documented example of a single generation being produced per year. It is suggested that water temperature in terms of growing season is at least one of the most important determinants for the production of only 1 generation/yr in Newsome Pond.																			0021-8790	1365-2656					1976	45	2					457	470		10.2307/3885	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3885													WOS:A1976BU58700008

Habitat coupling in a large lake system: delivery of an energy subsidy by an offshore planktivore to the nearshore zone of Lake Superior	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												We hypothesised that the autumn spawning migration of Lake Superior cisco (Coregonus artedi) provides a resource subsidy, in the form of energy-rich cisco eggs, from the offshore pelagic to the nearshore benthic community over winter, when alternate prey production is likely to be low. We tested this hypothesis using fish and macroinvertebrate surveys, fish population demographics, diet and stable isotope analyses, and bioenergetics modelling. The benthic, congeneric lake whitefish (C.clupeaformis) was a clear beneficiary of cisco spawning. Cisco eggs represented 16% of lake whitefish annual consumption in terms of biomass, but 34% of energy (because of their high energy density: >10kJgwetmass(-1)). Stable isotope analyses were consistent with these results and suggest that other nearshore fish species may also rely on cisco eggs. The lipid content of lake whitefish liver almost doubled from 26 to 49% between November and March, while that of muscle increased from 14 to 26% over the same period, suggesting lake whitefish were building, rather than depleting, lipid reserves during winter. In the other Laurentian Great Lakes, where cisco populations remain very low and rehabilitation efforts are underway, the offshore-to-nearshore ecological link apparent in Lake Superior has been replaced by non-native planktivorous species. These non-native species spawn in spring have smaller eggs and shorter incubation periods. The rehabilitation of cisco in these systems should reinstate the onshore subsidy as it has in Lake Superior.

During our study, several of the lakes were treated with additions of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers. Picoplankton communities in most lakes were dominated (> 70 %) by unicellular or colonial coccoid cyanobacteria, provisionally identified by morphological and autofluorescence properties as Synechococcus. Also common in some lakes were red-fluorescing cyanobacteria and Chlorella-like eucaryotes. Autotrophic picoplankters contributed from 36-63 % to total chlorophyll, from < 2-26 % to total phytoplankton carbon, and from 29-53 % to total photosynthesis. Average populations ranged from < 5-10,000 cells . ml-1 in winter and early spring to 65-75,000 cells . ml-1 in summer and fall. Peak densities in most lakes occurred in August-September and most populations were within the epilimnion or metalimnion/hypolimnion boundary. Subsurface peaks were prevalent only in untreated, strongly stratified lakes. Eucaryotic picoplankters became dominant in acidic (pH < 6.2), humic lakes. Colonial picoplankters were more common in more productive interior lakes in August, and though present, were uncommon in coastal systems. Picoplankton populations exhibited large increases under ice in a Yukon lake, and their abundance and seasonal distribution showed little relation to temperature or to light. Fertilization of lakes resulted in picoplankton population increases (> 2 x) and the elimination of subsurface peaks. Nutrients were considered to be one of the major factors controlling population abundance in these oligotrophic lakes with average pH > 6.5.																			0020-9309						1991	76	4					581	601		10.1002/iroh.19910760410	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19910760410													WOS:A1991HE11500009

In this study, we intensively investigated seasonal and spatial variations of soil microbial biomass (SMB) within three representational vegetation communities in the two dominant types of wetlands within Poyang Lake. The results showed high levels of SMB carbon (SMBC) and SMB nitrogen (SMBN) among the vegetation communities within both types of wetlands. The highest concentrations of SMBC and SMBN were found in spring and autumn in the Phragmites community, the lowest in the Phalaris community. Compared to the delta wetland, the dish-shaped pit wetland was found to have higher levels of SMBC and SMBN within the same vegetation type. Interestingly, variations of SMB were also significantly and positively correlated with vegetation biomass both in spring and autumn. Moreover, we found variations of SMB to be consistently correlated with soil bulk density, soil nutrient conditions and elevation. However, contrary to seasonal tendency, we detected relationships between SMB and community biodiversity, indicating a hidden interaction between these aspects in Poyang Lake. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	ELLIOTT, JM				ELLIOTT, JM			POPULATION REGULATION FOR DIFFERENT LIFE-STAGES OF MIGRATORY TROUT SALMO-TRUTTA IN A LAKE DISTRICT STREAM, 1966-83	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												From 1966-1983 in Black Brows Beck (English Lake District), most surviving trout spent 2 yr in fresh water, then migrated to the sea/estuary, and finally returned to spawn in fresh water as either males in their 3rd yr or males and females in their 4th yr. The sex ratio was .apprx. 1 for fish of similar age. Survivor density at 5 stages in the life cycle was related to egg density at the start of each yr-class; the density-dependent relationship was best described by the dome-shaped, Ricker-curve (from 6 stock-recruitment models fitted to the data). Losses during successive life-stages were effectively zero for the egg-alevin stage (loss-rate k0), density dependent in the 1st spring (k1) and summer (k2) of the life cycle, and density independent within the 1st winter (k3), 2nd summer (k4) and 2nd winter plus post-migration period (k5). Density-dependent survival of the young trout (k1, k2) was chiefly responsible for the stock-recruitment relationships for different life-stages; proportionate survival occurred between life-stages of older trout (k3, k4, k5). The key factor for population regulation was the spring losses (k1) soon after the young trout started to feed. A predictive equation was developed for total loss-rate (K = k0 + k1 + k2 + k3 + k4 + k5 = 4.399 + 0.665k1). Neither water temperature nor rainfall significantly affected loss-rates except those for 1 + parr (k4) in summer droughts. There were no obvious density interactions between trout of different yr-classes or between trout and other fish species in the stream. The relationship between total egg production by the surviving progeny and egg density at the start of a yr-class was density dependent; the equilibrium point (S*) was 80 eggs m-2 and the slope at this point indicated that S* should be stable. The age structure of the trout population in 1933-1934 was similar to that in the present study. The problems of separating losses due to mortality from those due to migration are discussed but not completely resolved. The implications of density-dependent population regulation and equilibrium theory are discussed and it is concluded that the population rarely exists in dynamic equilibrium because of environmental perturbations such as droughts.																			0021-8790	1365-2656					1985	54	2					617	638		10.2307/4503	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4503													WOS:A1985AHV9500022
J	Slesak, RA; Kaebisch, T				Slesak, Robert A.; Kaebisch, Tyler			Using lidar to assess impacts of forest harvest landings on vegetation height by harvest season and the potential for recovery over time	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												Tree regeneration and growth is generally reduced at forest harvest landing areas because of significant soil compaction, but it is commonly believed that harvesting in winter can reduce these impacts and that recovery occurs naturally with time. We used lidar data to assess differences in vegetation height between landing and general harvest areas across 79 sites in northern Minnesota, United States, that had been harvested in either summer/fall or winter and between 2 and 175 months since harvest. Vegetation height was significantly lower at landing areas compared with general harvest areas; however, there was no effect of harvest season on the difference (p = 0.50), indicating that impacts occur during all seasons. There was a significant (p < 0.01) positive relationship between the difference in vegetation height and time, regardless the harvest season, providing evidence that recovery occurs across a wide range of conditions within our time period of assessment. Sites with three landings present had the lowest relative landing area and also had the lowest differences in vegetation height between landing and general harvest areas, demonstrating the potential for optimized landing configurations to minimize impacts to growth. Based on our findings, landing areas should be kept as small as reasonably possible during all seasons of harvest, but the need for active reclamation practices is probably not warranted given that recovery occurs within the first few decades after harvest.																			0045-5067	1208-6037				JUN	2016	46	6					869	875		10.1139/cjfr-2015-0517	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2015-0517													WOS:000376887200012
J	Anshumali; Ramanathan, AL				Anshumali; Ramanathan, A. L.			Phosphorus fractionation in surficial sediments of Pandoh Lake, lesser Himalaya, Himachal Pradesh, India	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												The fractionation of P in Pandoh Lake surface sediments has been investigated for the first time in order to understand its environmental availability and sources, and the eutrophication status of this lake. Inorganic-P is present mainly as authigenic-P (step-III). The authigenic P concentration is higher in winter relative to the summer and monsoon seasons and ranged from 35.9 to 46.9 mu g/g. The loosely sorbed or exchangeable-P (step-I), Fe(III)-bound-P (step-II) and detrital inorganic-P (step-IV) were higher in the monsoon season and varied from 3.70 to 11.1 pg/g, 16.9 to 32.0 mu g/g and 9.89 to 17.0 mu g/g, respectively. Organic-P reached a maximum in the summer season and ranged from 8.00 to 14.9 mu g/g. Authigenic-P and detrital inorganic-P show seasonal changes, as pH influences the interaction between P and CaCO3 in the water column. In the winter season, phosphate is precipitated out of the water column and fixed in the sediments as a result of an increase in pH. Calcite-bound-P in the sediments may be redissolved by decreasing pH in the summer season. Relatively high rates of mineralization during the monsoon results in the seasonal pattern of organic-P fractionation to sediment as follows: monsoon = winter < summer. Iron, Ca, organic matter and silt and clay contents seem to play a significant role in regulating the seasonal P budget. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify the factors which influence sedimentary P in the different seasons. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ward, FJ; Northcote, TG; Boubée, JAT				Ward, FJ; Northcote, TG; Boubée, JAT			The New Zealand common smelt: biology and ecology	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The common smelt is one of the most widespread indigenous freshwater fishes in New Zealand. One other member of the family, Retropinnidae, Stokellia anisodon (Stokell). is present but is confined to a small region of the South Island. There are many diadromous as well as river and lake resident populations, the latter, sometimes a result of introductions to serve as forage fish for trout. Diadromous smelt spawn during austral autumn-winter on sand bars of lower riverine reaches. Larval stages inhabit coastal marine waters, and the postlarvae to immature stages re-enter rivers and some lowland takes. Diadromous smelt are distinguished from lowland lake resident forms by high vertebral but low gill raker numbers and larger size and from those present in some isolated waters, by high vertebral numbers alone. Lake or reservoir resident smelt usually spawn in austral spring-summer on sand), shallows at stream mouths or along shorelines. Verified smelt ages (otolith analyses) indicate that in some populations most smelt mature and spawn after c. 1 year. Adult smelt feed on a spectrum of primarily invertebrate animals ranging from small zooplankters to insects and occasionally small fishes. Smelt are a major prey for both brown trout and rainbow trout. Adult smelt are a minor food for the Maori people. As postlarvae they are a component of a few 'whitebait' fisheries. Most smelt populations are increasingly affected by environmental changes induced by human activities. Although many studies have examined problems affecting smelt, further effort is required, along with more basic research. (C) 2005.

However, the excessive presence of nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, stimulates rapid algal proliferation, leading to the occurrence of algal blooms. To prevent this phenomenon, it is imperative to conduct regular ecological surveys aimed at assessing water quality and monitoring the dynamic composition of aquatic biological communities within the reservoir's ecosystem. In this study, seasonal changes in water quality parameters and the spatial and temporal distribution of planktonic algae at 14 sampling sites in the Danjiangkou reservoir were analyzed. A total of 136 taxonomic units of planktonic algae were identified, belonging to 8 phyla, 41 families, and 88 genera, with the dominant algae belonging to the phyla Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta, and Cyanophyta. The order of abundance of the algae was summer > autumn > spring > winter and Hanku > Intake > Danku > Outflow. WT, pH, DO, CODMn, and Chl a were the primary drivers influencing the changes in the planktonic algal community within the reservoir. Two dominant algae, Chlamydomonas debaryana and Scenedesmus quadricauda, were isolated and cultured indoors to simulate the growth behaviors of algae in the Danjiangkou reservoir. The results show that the growth of C. debaryana was severely limited by the temperature, light, and nutrient concentration, whereas the growth of S. quadricauda was slightly affected under different temperature and light conditions and could occur at low concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients. With excess nutrient levels, excessive proliferation of S. quadricauda could potentially cause algal blooms. This study examined the growth characteristics of the dominant algae in the Danjiangkou reservoir under laboratory conditions and delved into their interdependencies with environmental factors, aiming to furnish a theoretical and experimental foundation for investigating algal community dynamics and preventing algal blooms within the freshwater reservoir.

We consider the stratification where density gradients are exclusively due to temperature differences. The annual circulation patterns are discussed for various climatic conditions. Very deep lakes do not necessarily produce full overturns during T-md transition in autumn and spring. Peculiarities of the stratification are derived for cases, in which surface temperatures cross 4 degrees C during the annual cycle: Firstly, the asymmetry between autumn and spring circulation, secondly, the proximity of temperature to the Tmd profile, and thirdly, the isothermal deep water. We compare conceptual model results of horizontally homogeneous lakes with measurements in very deep caldera lakes in Japan (Lakes Ikeda, Tazawa, Toya, Kuttara and Shikotsu). Between oligomictic lakes and thermobarically stratified lakes, we have found lakes circulating reliably despite their enormous depth. We discuss susceptibility to climate variability supported by comparisons with single point measurements from the 1920s and 1930s.

Hazards Resulting from Hydrological Extremes in the Upstream Catchment of the Prut River	WATER RESOURCES												Taking into account the fact that during the last decades domestic readers were poorly familiar with the hydrology of this region, it was considered appropriate to study the extreme situations within the Prut basin. By means of very simple mathematical calculation we have highlighted the role of reservoirs in change of relationships between extreme rainfall and floods/droughts, estimate the confidence degree of these estimations, etc. The Prut watershed is characterized by a temperate-continental climate with excessive influences in the middle and lower parts. Probabilistic analysis of the annual maximum flow indicates high values in the summer. The high flows recorded in 2005, 2008, and 2010 were caused by the most serious floods for the last 35 years. The maximum flow values had an exceeding probability of 2-10%, which explained the frequency of the phenomenon. Only the historical value (4240 m(3) s(-1)) at Radauti-Prut exceeded the flow rate with 1% probability. The results obtained for the hydrometric station located downstream underlined the role of Stanca-Costesti Accumulation Lake in flood protection. Simple linear regression identified the strength of the relationship between the predictor variable (total monthly rainfall) and the criterion variable (average monthly flow). The indicator used in this study to highlight the size effect, R-2 (the regression coefficient), is based on the degree of association between variables and describes the percentage of variability explained by each variable in relation to the other. The results indicated a large effect size at the Radauti-Prut station that decreased gradually downstream, as a result of the flow regularization function played by the reservoir. The minimum flow study revealed 7 consecutive years with drought, from 1982-1988. In the current period, the extremely severe drought began in the late autumn of 2011 and was maintained at the end of the winter, summer, and autumn of 2012.

Emerging Wetlands From River Diversions Can Sustain High Denitrification Rates in a Coastal Delta	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												It is assumed that to treat excess NO3- high soil organic matter content (%OM) is required to maintain high denitrification rates in natural or restored wetlands. However, this excess also represents a risk by increasing soil decomposition rates triggering peat collapse and wetland fragmentation. Here, we evaluated the role of %OM and temperature interactions controlling denitrification rates in eroding (Barataria Bay-BLC) and emerging (Wax Lake Delta-WLD) deltaic regions in coastal Louisiana using the isotope pairing (IPT) and N-2:Ar techniques. We also assessed differences between total (direct denitrification + coupled nitrification-denitrification) and net (total denitrification minus nitrogen fixation) denitrification rates in benthic and wetland habitats with contrasting %OM and bulk density (BD). Sediment (benthic) and soil (wetland) cores were collected during summer, spring, and winter (2015-2016) and incubated at close to in-situ temperatures (30 degrees C, 20 degrees C, and 10 degrees C, respectively). Denitrification rates were linearly correlated with temperature; maximum mean rates ranged from 40.1-124.1 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) in the summer with lower rates (<26.2 +/- 5.3 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) in the winter seasons. Direct denitrification was higher than coupled denitrification in all seasons. Denitrification rates were higher in WLD despite lower %OM, lower total N concentration, and higher BD in wetland soils. Therefore, in environments with low carbon availability, high denitrification rates can be sustained as long as NO3- concentrations are high (>30 mu M) and water temperature is >10 degrees C. In coastal Louisiana, substrates under these regimes are represented by emergent supra-tidal flats or land created by sediment diversions under oligohaline conditions (<1 ppt).					; Rivera-Monroy, Victor/G-7329-2011; Maiti, Kanchan/E-1936-2013; Giblin, Anne/AEK-5137-2022	Giblin, Anne/0000-0003-3851-2178; Rivera-Monroy, Victor Hugo/0000-0003-2804-4139; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				MAY	2021	126	5							e2020JG006217	10.1029/2020JG006217	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JG006217													WOS:000655232300034

Eighteen species (10 Rotifera, 5 Cladocera, 2 Copepoda, 1 Mollusca) were evidenced. It includes Arctodiaptomus steindachneri, an endemic calanoid of the Western Balkans. The zooplankton density varied during the investigated period and certain seasonal successions in temporal transpositions of their maximal development were noticed. The total zooplankton density was much higher in spring and summer period. The representatives of subclass Copepoda were dominant during the whole year. The dominant species was A. steindachneri. At the second place (with exception of the winter period) were the Cladocera representatives. The dominant species was Daphnia cucullata. At the third and fourth place were rotifers and larval form of Dreissena polymorpha, respectively. The quantitative presence of the Copepoda representatives was significantly lower in terms of the previous investigations. The Cladocera quantity reached high values during this period, particularly in summer. Such altering in the quantitative ratio between Copepoda and Cladocera in favor of the Cladocera, especially high quantitative presence of D. cucullata, typical for eutrophic lakes, imply of significant changes in zooplankton community and changes of the water quality in Lake Prespa pelagial.																			0006-3088	1336-9563				OCT	2012	67	5					939	944		10.2478/s11756-012-0092-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-012-0092-z													WOS:000307767300015
J	Wingfield, CA				Wingfield, CA			The effect of certain environmental factors on the growth of brown trout (Salmo trutta L.)	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												Two batches of 14-mo. fish were allowed 6 weeks to settle down in respective tanks. Data were then taken from Apr. 3, 1939 to Mar. 7, 1940. Exptl. treatment of the tanks differed only in feeding CaCl2 soln. to one to maintain Ca at 5 mg./100 cc. (0.4 mg./100 cc. in the unaltered tap water in the other). Conditions were fairly constant (pH approx. 7) excepting water temp. (tap water fed from roof tank), illumination (skylight), and feeding (increased to maintain excess). Little growth (ave. individual wt. and length) occurred in winter (loss in Jan.); small growth in Apr. and May; rapid increase in summer (max. in Sept.). Temp. was regarded the important factor with illumination not excluded. Growth rate (in terms of monthly starting wt.) increased slowly then more rapidly with rise in temp., but fell off linearly with fall in temp. An approx. mean curve relating growth rate and temp. indicated a critical temp. (zero growth) of 6[degree]C. Scale examinations showed no variations in scale-ring width associated with growth-rate variations. Relatively diminished growth rate in the "hard" water during the fall months failed to clarify field data, indicating better growth in "hard water" lakes. No difference in vertebral Ca content was found in the 2 batches.																			0022-0949	1477-9145				NOV	1940	17	4					435	448																WOS:000200579200009
J	Ranalli, AJ; Turk, JT; Campbell, DH				Ranalli, AJ; Turk, JT; Campbell, DH			The use of bulk collectors in monitoring wet deposition at high-altitude sites in winter	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Concentrations of dissolved ions from samples collected by wet/dry collectors were compared to those collected by bulk collectors at Halfmoon Creek and Ned Wilson Lake in western Colorado to determine if bulk collectors can be used to monitor wet deposition chemistry in remote, high-altitude regions in winter. Hydrogen-ion concentration was significantly lower (p<0.05) in the bulk collectors. All other ion concentrations were significantly higher (p<0.05) in the bulk collectors except for ammonium (p>0.05) at Halfmoon Creek. Wet deposition concentrations were predicated from bulk deposition concentrations through linear regression analysis. Results indicate that anions (chloride, nitrate and sulfate) can be predicted with a high degree of confidence. Lack of significant differences between seasonal (winter and summer) ratios of bulk to wet deposition concentrations indicates that at sites where operation of a wet/dry collector during the winter is not practical, wet deposition concentrations can be predicted from bulk collector samples through regression analysis of wet and bulk deposition data collected during the summer.																			0049-6979					APR	1997	95	1-4					237	255		10.1023/A:1026469911702	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1026469911702													WOS:A1997WV50700018

Water quality monitoring of an agricultural watershed lake: the effectiveness of agricultural best management practices	DESIGN AND NATURE VI: COMPARING DESIGN IN NATURE WITH SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING	WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment				6th International Conference on Comparing Design in Nature with Science and Engineering	JUN 11-13, 2012	La Coruna, SPAIN	Wessex Inst Technol, Univ A Coruna, WIT Transact Ecol & Environm, Int Journal Design & Nat & Ecodynam				Beasley Lake is an oxbow lake located in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Plain (the Delta), a region of extensive agricultural activity. Due to intensive row-crop agricultural practices, the 915ha watershed was sediment impaired when monitoring began in 1995 and was a candidate to assess the effectiveness of watershed-wide agricultural Best Management Practices (BMPs) on lake Water Quality (WQ). BMPs within crop fields, at field edges throughout the watershed, and enrolment of 113ha into Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) were implemented from 1997-2003 targeting reductions in sediment runoff. Bi-weekly WQ data from 1996-2009 were analyzed. WQ parameters assessed include Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Filterable Orthophosphate (FOP), Total Orthophosphate (TOP), Total Nitrate Nitrogen (NO3), Total Ammonia Nitrogen (NH3), chlorophyll a, and water clarity (secchi visibility depth). Over the 14-year period, TSS, TOP, NO3, and NH3 decreased annually whereas chlorophyll a and water clarity increased in conjunction with implemented BMPs. FOP appeared unaffected throughout the monitoring period. While annual improvement in WQ occurred, distinct seasonal effects were noticeable. Changes in TSS, TOP, NO3, NH3, and water clarity were greatest during spring and negligible in winter. Changes in TDS were observed only during summer. Reductions in spring TSS directly reduced TOP, increased chlorophyll a and water clarity. Results of this study indicate clear improvement in Mississippi Delta lake WQ with watershed-wide implementation of agricultural BMPs and these improvements, manifested most strongly during spring, will promote a healthy, sustainable lake ecosystem.

During the Holocene interstadial, the Indian summer monsoon showed asynchronous weakening links to ice rafting events documented in the North Atlantic region. However, the sensitivity of the Indian Winter Monsoon in response to North Atlantic cold spells is unclear due to a lack of compelling evidence. This study aims to extract the deglacial Indian Winter Monsoon signals using lithogenic tracers in coastal sediments and explore its association with the North Atlantic cooling episodes. A 5.1 m sediment core was retrieved from Pottuvil Lagoon in the southeastern coast of Sri Lanka, and the concentrations of K, Rb, Mg, Al, and Ti in 101 sub-sections were analysed using ICP-MS. The core- chronology was established by Bacon 2.2 age-depth modelling based on calibrated AMS 14C dates. The monsoon signal was reconstructed using element proxies and compared with the drift ice indices from the North Atlantic deep-sea sediments. Results revealed distinct phases of intense monsoon activity at 2553-2984 years BP, 3899-5021 years BP, and 5244-5507 years BP intervals with intermittent weak phases during 2253-2553, 2984-3899, and 5021-5244 years BP. The episodes of the intensified Indian Winter Monsoon coincided with Bond Events 2, 3, and 4, showing a strong coherence with the North Atlantic's deglacial climate. Thus, on a millennial scale, North-Atlantic cooling has triggered intense winter monsoon conditions over the tropical Indian Ocean region from the mid to late Holocene. In comparison with regional monsoon archives, the Pottuvil winter monsoon record exhibits an anti-phase association with the Indian Summer Monsoon during Holocene ice-rafted debris events. The geochemical approach executed in this study could provide new insight into the millennial-scale pacing of the winter counterpart of the Indian monsoon links to climate extremes of high northern latitudes.

Oubeira, a shallow and polymictic freshwater lake located in northeastern Algeria (36 degrees 50'N, 08 degrees 23'E), has recently experienced a significant proliferation of harmful cyanobacteria resulting in the generation of toxins. We carried out this study in order to understand the succession patterns of dominant cyanobacteria and cyanotoxin production and the factors driving this in Oubeira Lake. A total of 26 cyanobacterial genera were identified, and among them Microcystis and Planktothrix accounted for more than 60% of the overall cell abundance. The summer/fall period was dominated by Microcystis, Planktothrix, and in lesser extend by Cylindrospermum, Cylindrospermopsis. During the fall/winter transition, Dolichospermum, Pseudanabaena, and Aphanizomenon were the dominant genera. Statistically, the bloom-forming cyanobacteria showed significant differences between months but not between stations. Intracellular microcystins (MC-LR) was detected in all collected samples (0.62- and 19.14-mu g MC-LR equivalent/L), but appeared in high concentrations throughout the period of dominance of Microcystis and Planktothrix. Microcystis was more sensitive to nutrients than to temperature. Planktothrix was more dependent on temperature than on nutrients, which explains their coexistence during summer-fall period. However, both genera are positively correlated with MC-LR and would probably be the main producers of microcystins. Pseudanabaena, Dolichospermum, and Aphanizomenon co-occurred at the end of Planktothrix dominance period (December). Aphanizomenon and Pseudanabaena were correlated negatively with temperature and positively with water conductivity. Dolichospermum showed a strong positive correlation with MC-LR. Oubeira Lake, could serve as a model of how cyanobacteria blooms may develop in lakes within Mediterranean climates.																			2096-5508	2523-3521				SEP	2023	41	5					1834	1848		10.1007/s00343-022-1313-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-022-1313-0													WOS:001188513800001

Recent climatological trends and potential influences on forest phenology around western Lake Superior, USA	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												We assess long-term climatological means, trends, and interannual variability around the western end of Lake Superior during 1984-2013 by using available weather station data. Our results focus on changes in basic and derived climate indicators from seasonal and annual temperature and precipitation, to the traditionally defined frost-free season, to a novel definition of the climatological growing season. We describe seasonal and year-to-year climate variability that influences forest phenology, using an alternative growing season metric that is based on the warm-season plateau in accumulated chilling days as an indicator of environmental triggers for vegetation growth and senescence. Our results indicate +0.56 degrees C regional warming during our 30 year study period, with cooler springs (-1.26 degrees C) and significant autumn warming (+1.54 degrees C). The duration of the climatological growing season has increased +0.27 d/yr, extending primarily into autumn. Summer precipitation in our study area has declined by an average -0.34 cm/yr, potentially leading to moisture stress that impairs vegetation carbon uptake rates and can render the forest more vulnerable to disturbance. Many changes in temperature, precipitation, and climatological growing season are most prominent in locations where Lake Superior exerts a strong hydroclimatological influence, especially the Minnesota shoreline and in forest areas downwind (southeast) of the lake. Observed trends in lake temperature and ice phenology have also changed, coincident with a large-scale climatological regime shift around 1998. A number of factors are likely altering forest phenology and the role of the forest in the climate system of this ecologically important and highly varied forest-and-lake region.

Climate warming increases vertical and seasonal water temperature differences and inter-annual variability in a mountain lake	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Lakes around the world are warming, but not all water layers are warming at the same rate, and some are even cooling. Most studies have focused on summer lake water surface temperatures or analyzed short-time series. Here, we analyzea 44-year time series of water temperature from nine depths in a small mountain lakeusing dynamic linear models and temporal trend decomposition. We observe a significant long-term warming trend, but this occurred only from August to December in all water layers. The lake warmed ca. twice as fast (0.23 degrees C decade(-1)) as the air, but warming of the epilimnion slowed down remarkably (from 0.65 to 0.10 degrees C per decade) after 1993, a consequence of changing stratification timing. Deeper water layers even cooled thereafter, pointing to a stronger isolation from surface layers, which were still warming over the whole study period. This differential warming of the lake was accompanied by significant shifts of lake freezing and thawing dates leading to shorter ice-cover periods (similar to 5days decade(-1)). As a result, the thermal Schmidt stability of the water column strengthened, but also temperature variance in the epilimnion increased significantly, together with increasing variance and extremes of local air temperature. Our results show a significant autumn/winter warming effect of lake water together with an increasing intensity of temperature fluctuations in this seasonally ice-covered mountain lake, suggesting that current broad scale estimates of climate change impacts on lakes, based on summer temperature measurements and surface layers, do not fully reflect the effect of climate change.

Fourteen mysid species were recorded. Zonation patterns, life-history and diel activity of the three most abundant species, Tenagomysis tasmaniae, Anisomysis mixta australis and Paramesopodopsis rufa were examined. These three species were found in large numbers throughout the year associated with the macroalgal fringe on either side of the bay. Habitat partitioning within this zone of occurrence was evident. T. tasmaniae was the most abundant species (annual mean density 32.4 m-3), followed by A. mixta australis (annual mean density 20.5 m-3) and P. rufa (annual mean density 11.3 m-3). The major peaks of abundance of these three species were temporally separate. Breeding was intensive for the three species from spring till late autumn. A cessation of breeding in winter was evident for A. mixta australis and to a lesser extent for P. rufa but T. tasmaniae bred throughout the year although at a reduced rate during winter. Examination of the diel behaviour identified peaks of abundance at sunrise and sunset for T. tasmaniae; P. rufa was caught in greater numbers at night, but no consistent pattern was observed for A. mixta australis.																			0018-8158					OCT 30	1992	246	3					173	193		10.1007/BF00005696	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00005696													WOS:A1992KB85000001

The importance of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau for Bar-headed Geese Anser indicus: results from GPS/GSM telemetry	WILDFOWL												The Bar-headed Goose Anser indiens is confined to central Asia, where it is currently increasing in abundance. Historically, the species has been divided into seven flyway units, of which the Eastern Flyway comprises 70% of the total world population. We used data from GPS-GSM transmitters deployed on Eastern Flyway Bar-headed Geese to differentiate between sub-populations exhibiting contrasting migration strategies and to assess the importance of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) for these sub-populations. Tracking results identified three distinctive sub-populations with differing migration patterns within the flyway. These were: 1) the Qinghai Lake-Shigatse Prefecture sub-population, short-distance migrants; 2) the Mongolia- Shigatse Prefecture sub-population, middle-distance migrants; and 3) the Mongolia- India./Bangladesh sub-population, long-distance migrants. Individuals in the shortdistance sub-population remained in the QTP throughout the entire annual cycle. The middle-distance sub-population also exploited the QTP but returned north to Mongolia to breed. Geese from the long-distance sub-population departed their Mongolian breeding grounds early and spent > 80% of the total migration duration within the QTP, despite this area constituting less than half the total migration distance during both autumn and spring migration. These results show that birds from all three sub-populations have a particular affinity for the QTP, confirming the importance of this area to all sub-populations of Eastern Flyway Bar-headed Geese. Migration among birds from the long-distance sub-population was significantly faster in spring than in autumn, the result of using fewer stopover sites and a shorter total stopover duration. We recommend more telemetry studies to confirm these patterns and support improved protection of site networks. Further ground surveys of Bar-head Goose numbers are also required to identify threats to staging and wintering areas used by the different sub-populations of Bar-headed Geese in Eastern Flyway, with a view to securing key sites for the future.					; Batbayar, Nyambayar/N-7066-2015; Damba, Iderbat/I-5018-2018	Zhang, Junjian/0009-0006-0643-6579; Xie, YanBo/0009-0000-5548-512X; Batbayar, Nyambayar/0000-0002-9138-9626; Damba, Iderbat/0000-0001-7274-3960; Cao, Lei/0000-0002-1157-0303													0954-6324	2052-6458					2020	70						57	75																WOS:000592433100004

It is shown using the mathematical model 'Rostherne' that winter levels of ambient Si have a major influence both on spring levels of ambient P and on the summer cyanobacterial maxima. Additions of Si to the lakes could be used for the fine regulation of the biogeochemical balance and may prescribe a recipe for improvement of water quality, as well as a new solution to the problem of eutrophication.

Because lake herring spawn in fall and their eggs overwinter in the river and hatch in spring, their hatching success could be impacted by early opening of the locks in spring. Our laboratory studies showed that under the range of turbidities expected in the river due to vessel traffic, lake herring eggs hatched and larvae fed adequately. Field incubation studies produced about 75% survival and 70% hatching success of lake herring eggs at two of three study sites. Collections in the river throughout the month following ice-out showed that sufficient plankton of appropriate size were available to ensure growth and survival of larval lake herring. We did not detect any negative impacts on the early life stages of lake herring as a result of sedimentation in the laboratory or field. However, detailing the spawning sites of lake herring and defining the normal survival-to-hatch in these areas are necessary before making accurate predictions of the effects of early season vessel traffic on lake herring hatching success.

Snow retention for increased water supply of shallow Arctic lakes	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Throughout the year, water availability in the Arctic is marginal because of the cold climate, presence of permafrost, and low precipitation. Recent resource development and improvements in living conditions of the expanding population have placed additional stresses on the annual local water supply of communities and industry located in this region. This study implemented a snow control practice to enhance snowdrift growth as a local water source at a shallow Arctic lake located on Alaska's Coastal Plain, 50 km south of Prudhoe Bay, USA. A 130 m long and 3 m tall snow fence was placed next to a lake for the winters of 2009-2010 and 2010-2011. This snow fence retained large quantities of snow transported by wind during the winter, forming a sizable snowdrift. In this region of the Arctic, lakes receive most of their water from seasonal snowpack melt in late May and early June, with subsequent drying of the lakes after snowmelt. The artificially created snowdrift at the experimental lake contributed meltwater until early July during both summers of the study period and effectively offset summer lake drying. At summer's end, the additional lake volume from the fence snowdrift was 21% and 29% in 2010 and 2011, respectively. While techniques such as snow fences can be used to address existing needs for enhanced water supplies, they can also serve as a tool for assessing lake response to a future climate scenario in which summers are warmer and both evaporation and winter precipitation increase.

Population Dynamics of Larval Trematodes in Juvenile Bluegills from Three Lakes II, Michigan, and the Potential for Overwinter Parasite-Induced Host Mortality	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Prior studies of the population dynamics of larval trematodes infecting juvenile bluegills Lepomis macrochirus have suggested that there may be overwinter loss of the most heavily infected juvenile bluegills from the population. Our study objectives were to (1) describe population dynamics of the four most common larval trematodes-Cryptogonimus sp., Posthodiplostomum minimum, Diplostomum sp., and Neascus sp.- and the overall larval trematode burden for three year-classes of juvenile bluegills in Three Lakes II, Michigan; and (2) assess the potential for larval trematode infections as a cause of first-winter bluegill mortality based on changes in parasite overdispersion. We examined 393 juvenile bluegills for larval trematodes, and more than 99% of examined bluegills were infected with a parasite. Decreases in overdispersion of several larval trematode species in spring and summer 2003 may have been the result of larval trematode-induced host mortality. The results of this study suggest that heavy larval trematode infections may be negatively influencing bluegill survival, particularly during and after winter. Additionally, this study demonstrates that population dynamics of larval trematodes in Three Lakes II are similar to those of trematodes found in the southeastern USA but that the larval trematodes in the present study may have a more negative effect on bluegill survival due to more harsh winter conditions.

J	JONES, RI				JONES, RI			FACTORS CONTROLLING PHYTOPLANKTON PRODUCTION AND SUCCESSION IN A HIGHLY EUTROPHIC LAKE (KINNEGO BAY, LOUGH NEAGH) .1. PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITY AND ITS ENVIRONMENT	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The seasonal variation during 1973 and 1974 of phytoplankton and some physical and chemical conditions in Kinnego Bay, a shallow highly eutrophic part of Lough Neagh, N Ireland, are described. The shallow water column was always well-mixed, and vertical heterogeneity with respect to temperature and oxygen saturation was slight. The annual loading of algal nutrients was very great, but concentrations could be low as a result of depletion by the large algal growths. Diatoms, especially Stephanodiscus hantzschii, were dominant in the phytoplankton community during spring and autumn, but blue-green algae predominated during summer. Peak crops of both chlorophyll a (240 mg/m3) and algal volume (60 mm3/l) were extremely high. Apparent changes in algal standing crop were found to be highly dependent on the form in which the algal biomass was expressed. In view of the high loading of nutrients into the bay, it is suggested that the annual succession of phytoplankton species was not entirely attributable to nutritional considerations, but was at least partly a response to changing physical conditions.

Presence of algae in freshwater ice cover of fluvial LAC Saint-Pierre (St. Lawrence river, Canada)	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												Winter ice cover is a fundamental feature of north temperate aquatic systems and is associated with the least productive months of the year. Here we describe a previously unknown freshwater habitat for algal and microbial communities in the ice cover of the freshwater St. Lawrence River, Quebec, Canada. Sampling performed during winter 2005 revealed the presence of viable algal cells, such as Aulacoseira islandica (O. Mull.) Simonsen (Bacillariophyceae), and microbial assemblage growing in the ice and at the ice-water interface. Vertical channels (1-5 mm wide) containing algae were also observed. Concentrations of chl a ranged between 0.5 and 169 mu g . L-1 of melted ice, with maximal concentrations found in the lower part of the ice cores. These algae have the potential to survive when ice breakup occurs and reproduce rapidly in spring/summer conditions. Freshwater ice algae can thus contribute to in situ primary production, biodiversity, and annual carbon budget in various habitats of riverine communities.

We analyzed the phytoplankton community of five lakes located in the lowland areas of Huaihe River using Reynolds functional groups (RFG) approach, with simultaneous measurement of several environmental variables in monthly sampling campaigns during 2 years. The annual average phytoplankton biovolume of the five lakes ranged from 3.7 to 9.9 mm(3)/L, with the highest values occurring during warm seasons. The shallow eutrophic lakes primarily contained mixing and low-light adaptive species with C and D groups as dominant all-round the year. Representatives of X2, Y, and W1 were predominant during the spring and the autumn with high nutrients and organic matter concentrations. Cyanobacteria were mainly represented by group S1 especially during the summer. Mixing, temperature, together weak light caused by phytoplankton biomass, could shape phytoplankton assemblage more than nutrients in the shallow eutrophic lakes with warm-temperate climate.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				APR	2020	27	12					13930	13938		10.1007/s11356-020-07924-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-07924-z		FEB 2020						32036524					WOS:000516058500002

Field and Laboratory Evaluation of the Microsporidian Parasite Heterosporis sutherlandae: Prevalence, Severity, and Transmission	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC ANIMAL HEALTH												Heterosporis sutherlandae is an invasive microsporidian parasite in the Great Lakes region of North America that infects the skeletal muscle of numerous fish species, rendering the fillet unfit for human consumption. Although H. sutherlandae has been identified as a pathogen of concern by state management agencies, there is little information to inform regulation and intervention. We sampled fishes over 1 year from three lakes in northern Minnesota with known infected populations to determine the importance of host demographic and environmental variables for influencing H. sutherlandae infection prevalence. Heterosporis sutherlandae was present during all sampling periods, ranging in prevalence from 1% to 11%. The prevalence of H. sutherlandae among Yellow Perch Perca flavescens varied significantly according to season, with winter having the lowest prevalence (1%) and summer having the highest prevalence (11%). For other fish species, the prevalence of H. sutherlandae also varied significantly with season: the lowest prevalence occurred during spring (1%) and the highest prevalence occurred in fall (9%). Rates of pathogen transmission were estimated by exposing Fathead Minnows Pimephales promelas in the laboratory. Transmission rates were 23% when naive fish were fed infected tissues and only 2% when naive fish were held in cohabitation with tissue-fed fish. Exposure method and exposure duration (d) increased the probability that a fish was infected with H. sutherlandae. These findings suggest that H. sutherlandae transmission is greater when a susceptible host consumes infected tissue than when the fish is exposed to spores present in the water column. The current rates of infection in wild fishes are in stark contrast to the prevalence documented in 2004 (28%), suggesting a reduction in H. sutherlandae prevalence within at least one Yellow Perch population in the Laurentian Great Lakes region since the early 2000s.					; Venturelli, Paul/A-2337-2008	Tomamichel, Megan/0000-0002-7903-6633; Venturelli, Paul/0000-0002-7329-7517													0899-7659	1548-8667				JUN	2021	33	2					84	93		10.1002/aah.10122	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aah.10122		APR 2021						33369794					WOS:000641848400001
J	STAUFFER, RE				STAUFFER, RE			RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PHOSPHORUS LOADING AND TROPHIC STATE IN CALCAREOUS LAKES OF SOUTHEAST WISCONSIN	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The relationships among external P loading, lake P concentrations and indices of lake trophic state are investigated for 4 calcareous and 1 noncalcareous lake in southeast Wisconsin. The total P and molybdate-reactive P concentrations during winter and spring overturn are significantly higher in the calcareous lakes than predicted by models based on regional studies of Canadian Shield (ELA) lakes and the central New York Finger Lakes. The calcareous Wisconsin lakes have relatively low P retention coefficients and are eutrophic despite their low or only moderate external P loadings. By contrast, noncalcareous Devils Lake is oligotrophic; it is also adequately represented by the ELA loading vs. response equations. The calcareous Wisconsin lakes and edaphically similar Lake Minnetonka, Minnesota, have lower epilimnetic chlorophyll concentrations in summer than predicted by the Dillon and Rigler equation (based on lake mean total P at spring overturn). Because these stratified lakes are frequently P-limited in midsummer, the failure of the Dillon-Rigler model may be related to seasonal cycles of mixed-layer concentrations of total P (and SRP) and also to the seasonal patterns of loading. These observations may be part of a larger edaphic pattern related to low P binding tendencies of certain calcareous lake sediments.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1985	30	1					123	145		10.4319/lo.1985.30.1.0123	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1985.30.1.0123													WOS:A1985ACJ5400011

An Analysis of Faunal Remains From A Denbigh Flint Complex Camp at Matcharak Lake, Alaska	ARCTIC ANTHROPOLOGY												The Matcharak Lake site, located in the Brooks Range, Alaska, represents the first faunal assemblage recovered from a Denbigh Flint Complex (early Arctic Small Tool tradition) locality anywhere in Arctic Alaska. Organic remains, which include numerous bone tools, are well preserved in the frozen tundra soil of this 3,900 year-old site. Over 81,000 faunal specimens were unearthed with the identified portion predominantly composed of caribou; however, Dall's sheep, small mammals, bird, and fish were also recovered. Seasonal indicators suggest the hunting and butchering events occurred in the fall and spring. The presence of migratory bird and Alaska marmot suggest people camped here in the summer as well. Empirical evidence for Paleoeskimo subsistence are limited to coastal sites in the eastern Arctic. Matcharak Lake provides the first substantial dataset for supporting subsistence models for inland Denbigh groups in Alaska. Caribou clearly dominate in terms of potential calories and resource materials for clothing and shelter.																			0066-6939	1933-8139					2011	48	1					33	53		10.1353/arc.2011.0108	http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/arc.2011.0108													WOS:000295036800003

Windows were broken, doors were jammed, siding was buckled, walls were bowed, garage doors could not be closed and the driveway pavement was differentially distorted. The home owner was terribly upset that his three year old home was performing so badly. He hired a geotechnical engineering consulting firm and a structural engineering consulting firm to determine the cause of his problem and to recommend corrective actions. This technical paper will document the studies carried out to date which have included observations of building damage/distortion, subsurface exploration, exposing the existing footings, laboratory testing soil samples, thermal analysis of the existing foundation system, structural analysis of the existing foundation system, crack monitoring during subsequent winters and alternate designs for foundation repairs. The shallow insulated foundation system was found to be inadequately protected from the adverse effects of frost action. The Winter of 1995/1996 was found to be one of the worst in the last thirty years (a design condition). The repairs to the foundation have not been advanced, but are scheduled for the summer of 1999. If construction proceeds as scheduled, the repairs and the performance through the first winter after repair will be documented in a follow up paper.																					0-7844-0379-1				1998							57	69																WOS:000081048500006
J	Gauthier, A; Muñoz, A				Gauthier, Agnes; Munoz, Arsenio			Seasonal sedimentation in the Pliocene Villarroya Lake (N Spain) inferred from pollen analysis	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												High-resolution pollen analysis was performed on a short (8.7 cm thick) section with 94 varve couplets (made up of dark and light laminae) from a lacustrine facies of the Pliocene Villarroya Basin, Spain. The aim of the present study was (i) to verify the seasonality of the sedimentation and (ii) to determine if pollen data record the short-term climatic fluctuations related to variations in laminae thickness and colour. The samples displayed high pollen concentrations and very good taxonomic diversity. The composition of the pollen spectra indicated that the vegetation structure was closely linked to relief: (i) a regional open herbaceous vegetation, (ii) a local marshy and riparian environment, (iii) deciduous mixed forest at mid-altitudes, and (iv) coniferous mixed forest in the surrounding mountains at higher altitudes. In the 48 distinct couplets where the dark and light laminae have been separately sampled, the pollen content showed higher concentrations of early flowering trees in the dark ones, whereas late-flowering plants were more abundant in the light ones. Total pollen concentrations in the 48 couplets were higher in most of their dark layers. These results point to a seasonal layering. According to present-day flowering times, the dark laminae represent sedimentation in winter/spring and the light laminae sedimentation in late summer/autumn. The correlation between the AP (Arboreal Pollen)-NAP (Non-Arboreal Pollen) percentages and lamina thickness linked lamina thickness with the highest values of AP, indicating warmer periods. Variations in the ecological groups enabled us to differentiate eight pollen cycles related to short-term climatic fluctuations. These alternations seem to be more associated with seasonality in precipitation than with temperature oscillations and could be correlated with the NAO/ENSO-like and sunspot-like cycles.

Taking advantage of the water qualities experimental data on 27 and 28 October, 2003, the paper constructs the chlorophyll-a concentration estimating model for Taihu Lake, China. And then, the study uses this chlorophyll-a concentration estimation model to estimate the seasonal distribution pattern of chlorophyll-a concentration from CBERS-1 imageries on 5 April, 28 April, 16 May, 5 August, and 30 October of 2006, and 5 July, 2007. According to the research results, it was found that the chlorophyll-a concentration is lower in summer and higher in autumn and winter, and could illuminate the four stages of phytoplankton growth in a year; Compared with the previous study reports, the chlorophyll-a concentration is higher than the actual concentration by estimating from the CBERS-1. There are still some problems for applying the CBERS-1 imageries to water qualities remote sensing, which should be improved by further study.

Periphyton growth (measured as chlorophyll a) was investigated four times in situ using nutrient-diffusing substrata. The effect of grazing was also manipulated using exclusion cages. We found that periphyton responded differently to nutrient addition bioassays (N and P) depending on the background nutrient concentration and warming scenario. Our results indicate that single-nutrient limitation prevailed for periphyton in our experimental temperate shallow lakes. The responses were season sensitive. Periphyton in the unenriched mesocosms were P-limited in early summer in the ambient and A2 scenarios, N-limited in late summer in these two climate scenarios, not nutrient-limited in autumn and P-limited in spring in all climate scenarios. Periphyton in the A2+50% scenario showed a positive response to N and P added together in early summer. In contrast, periphyton in the enriched mesocosms showed no clear nutrient limitation, except for short-term periods of P limitation in the warmer systems. Grazers did not affect the quantitative response of periphyton to nutrient addition, and the concentrations of P and N as well as mean monthly temperature were the main environmental factors driving P or N limitation. We conclude that warming in low-productivity lakes affects the seasonality of N limitation and changes the single-nutrient limitation of periphyton into NP co-limitation. This last observation suggests that warming reduces the sensitivity of temperate shallow lakes to bottom-up perturbations.

Lake shores were mainly settled during warm and rather dry climate periods which caused a fall in the lake levels. Nevertheless, there were strong and partly very short-term shifts in the economy during the lake-dwelling period. These can be recognised only because the settlement layers can be very precisely dated by dendrochronology. In this article we discuss in an interdisciplinary way the possible interrelations between climatic and economic changes. To explain the latter, we assume crop failures as the main reason, which caused intensified hunting and gathering. There are three different possibilities which might explain this: cold and wet summers, severe droughts during spring and summer, or local over-exploitation of soils in densely settled areas.																			0939-6314	1617-6278				SEP	2006	15	4					403	418		10.1007/s00334-006-0053-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-006-0053-y													WOS:000239958900016

Heat budget of Lake Paajarvi in January-March was governed by terrestrial radiation losses of 20-35 W m(-2) recompensed by ice growth of 0.5-1.0 cm day(-1). In April, snow melted, albedo decreased from 0.8 to < 0.1, and the mean ice melt rate was 1.5 cm day(-1). Internal melting and surface melting were about equal. The mean turbulent heat loss was small. The heat flux from the water to ice was about 5 W m(-2) in winter, increasing to 12 W m(-2) in the melting season. The light attenuation coefficient was 1.1 m(-1) for the congelation ice (black ice) in winter, compared with 1.5 m(-1) for the lake water, and it was up to 3 m(-1) for candled congelation ice in spring, and about 10 m(-1) for superimposed ice (white ice) and snow. Gas bubbles were the main factor that reduced the transparency of ice. The radiation penetrating the ice heated the water body causing convective currents and horizontal heat transfer. This increased the temperature of the water body to about 3A degrees C before the ice break-up. After the snow had melted, the euphotic depth (the depth of 1% surface irradiance) was estimated as 2.0 m, only two-thirds that in summer.					; Lepparanta, Matti/M-7507-2017	Jakkila, Juho/0009-0003-3685-5465; Lepparanta, Matti/0000-0002-4754-5564													1386-2588	1573-5125				SEP	2009	43	3					681	692		10.1007/s10452-009-9275-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-009-9275-2													WOS:000269837500009

Diel Influences on Silver Carp Catch Rates Using an Electrified Paupier in Lentic Habitats	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												The CPUE (fish/6,000 m(3)) of Silver CarpHypophthalmichthys molitrixobtained by using an electrified butterfly trawl (paupier) was evaluated among various temporal (time of day and season) and spatial (location, habitat [shoreline and open water], and water depth) factors that are likely to be influential in large lentic habitats. The paupier sampled the upper water column (1.5 m) in three locations (Kentucky Lake, Kentucky [two embayments]; Lake Barkley, Kentucky [forebay]; and upper Illinois River, Illinois [two backwaters]). Sampling commenced 2 h prior to sunset and continued into the night, not exceeding 5 h beyond sunset. Model selection showed that all temporal and spatial factors were important. Post hoc analysis revealed that Silver Carp CPUE was higher at night (beyond 1 h after sunset), in shoreline habitat, and in water generally no deeper than 5 m. Seasonal variation in CPUE occurred, but in general the CPUE was high in the fall for all locations. Considering these results for management application, we estimated the sampling effort required to reach precise CPUE and adequately assess size structure (125 stock-length fish) in shoreline habitat at night. These sampling objectives were attainable in the spring and fall seasons for all locations (4-31 deployments) but were more variable in summer. We recommend consideration of the paupier as a standard method to sample Silver Carp in large lentic habitats by using the guidelines provided herein (i.e., sampling of the shoreline beyond 1 h after sunset during the fall season). An important next step to strengthen this method is to validate CPUE as an index of density.					; Ridgway, Josey/AAF-9093-2019	Ridgway, Josey/0000-0003-4157-7255; 													0275-5947	1548-8675				AUG	2020	40	4					1023	1031		10.1002/nafm.10467	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10467		JUL 2020											WOS:000548715200001

The seasonal distr. was studied, and it was shown that adult hydras are present throughout the year although in varying numbers per unit vol. of water or sq. cm. of plant surface or lake bottom. The distr. vertically on plants or artifical supports is influenced by wave action and water transparency. There is a zone of heavy population between 10 and 15 cm. below the surface. Immediately above and below this zone there are fewer hydras, with usually no individuals above the 5 cm. mark and none below 45 cm. The horizontal distr. is influenced by the kind of plant life, the depth of the water, and the condition of the bottom. Winter low temps., long continued, have effect of reducing hydra populations. Starvation apparently also has an influence in winter in the habitats where hydras are found. The reprqductive rate (6.1% per day) was detd., and a growth curve for individual hydras is presented. A method is discussed for studying individual hydras in the lake by means of an inverted glass funnel supported on a rope and covered with copper screen. By this method several factors of dynamics of the hydra populations were studied in the lake. Individual hydra buds take longer to develop on the parent and detached buds take longer to mature during late fall and winter.

River water quality assessment is one of the most important aspects to enhance water resources management plans. Water quality index (WQI), as one of the most frequently used evaluation tools, was used to comprehensively analyze the water quality in the Beiyun River. Between January 2017 and October 2018, we collected samples from 16 typical sampling sites along the main rivers of the watershed, covering four seasons. Seventeen water quality parameters, including temperature, pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), total phosphorus (TP), oil, volatile phenol (VP), fluoride, sulfide, surfactant, lead (Pb), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and arsenic (As), were used to calculate WQI. The average WQI values of Beiyun River in winter, spring, summer, and autumn were 88.15, 71.70, 78.92, and 90.12, respectively, explaining the water quality was "good" generally. There were significant differences in the spatial distribution of WQI values from Beiyun River, and water quality of upstream and downstream was better than that of midstream. In addition, correlation analysis was applied to explore the correlation between land use types and water quality. Water quality was significant negatively correlated with agriculture land and rural residential land, and a positive relationship between urban land and water quality. Generally, we believe that people's related activities on different land use are major elements impacting the water quality. Water environment improvement ought to increase the wastewater collection rate and sewage treatment capacity in rural areas, especially in the midstream of the Beiyun River.					zhang, yuhang/ISS-5685-2023; yang, wenjie/IXN-6840-2023														0944-1344	1614-7499				OCT	2020	27	28			SI		35449	35458		10.1007/s11356-020-09682-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09682-4		JUN 2020						32594437					WOS:000543684200002

A 13 000 year multi-proxy climate record from central Utah (western USA), emphasizing conditions leading to large mass movements	BOREAS												Younger Dryas to earliest Holocene mega-landslides (> 10 km(2)) in the eastern Fish Lake Plateau of central Utah required unusually wet conditions to drive movement. The sediment from abundant small lakes, ponds and espe-cially fens that formed in swales between hummocks on the landslide surfaces are excellent archives of past cli-mate. An integrated geophysical, geochemical and micro-palaeontological investigation characterized fen deposits, determining the timing of mass movement and establishing the subsequent climate history of the region. High-resolution P-(compressional) wave surveys of fen deposits were conducted to image fen-landslide contacts. Past climate states were assessed through loss on ignition, pollen and diatom abundances. Diatoms, in particular, record large variations in precipitation as the present-day wetland switched from fen (intermittent standing water) to pond states in response to variable precipitation. One core was analysed for detailed climate proxies. Awet epi-sode (pond) prevailed from 11.5 to 10 ka after which the climate became much drier (fen) until 6 ka due to weak-ening of the North American Monsoon. After 2.5-2.0 ka, reduced insolation produced cooler summers and wet winters (pond). Only recently (< 500 years) has a fen re-emerged based on direct observation and the disappear-ance of diatoms that require standing water. C-14 ages of basal sediment from four cores show two episodes of movement: 12.8-12.5 and 10.5 ka. The earlier ages indicate that Younger Dryas high effective precipitation caused mass wasting. Later, during early Holocene times, colder winters followed by warmer summers and vigor-ous monsoons drove movement as rapid spring snow-melt was followed by wet summers. In broad terms, this work highlights variable climate conditions that can drive mass movement, as well as the sensitivity of diatom records in fens to effective precipitation.																			0300-9483	1502-3885				APR	2017	46	2					308	324		10.1111/bor.12213	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bor.12213													WOS:000398048200012

We found significant changes both in terrestrial vegetation and lake diatom assemblages in the northern slope of the Retezat Mts between c. 8300 and 8000 cal. yr BP. Rapid changes in relative frequencies and pollen accumulation rates of the major deciduous pollen types associated with peaks in microcharcoal accumulation rates suggested that vegetation disturbance mainly took place in the mixed-deciduous forest zone, where woodland fires partially destroyed the populations of Fraxinus excelsior, Quercus, and Corylus avellana and facilitated the establishment of Carpinus betulus in the forest openings. The diatom record furthermore showed the spread of a planktonic diatom species, Aulacoseira valida, at 8150 cal. yr BP, coincidently with a short-lived expansion of C. betulus. Since diatom blooms mainly occur in spring in the Retezat Mts, increased spring water depth and increased water turbulence were inferred from these data. The expansion of C. betulus against F. excelsior and C. avellana at the same time suggested a modest increase in available moisture during the growing season. Taken together, these data imply that during the 8.2-ka event, winter and spring season available moisture increased, while summers were characterized by alternating moist/cool and dry/warm conditions.					; Finsinger, Walter/A-7937-2011; Palfy, Jozsef/A-3908-2009; Buczkó, Krisztina/AAO-3762-2020; Braun, Mihaly/F-8767-2010	Finsinger, Walter/0000-0002-8297-0574; Palfy, Jozsef/0000-0001-9686-1849													0959-6836	1477-0911				SEP	2016	26	9					1382	1396		10.1177/0959683616640039	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683616640039													WOS:000381283200004
J	Tuboi, C; Hussain, SA				Tuboi, Chongpi; Hussain, Syed Ainul			Plant community structure of the floating meadows of a hypereutrophic wetland in the Indo-Burma Biodiversity Hotspot	AQUATIC BOTANY												Floating meadows are widespread globally, but ecological information on their vegetation structure and functions is lacking. We examined the structure and composition of the vegetation of the floating meadows of Keibul Lamjao National Park, Manipur, located in the Indo-Burma Biodiversity Hotspot. The floating meadows in the park are crucial for the survival of the globally threatened Eld's deer (Rucervus eldii) and the hog deer (Axis porcinus). Vegetation data were collected from 936 plots of size 0.5 m x 0.5 m during winter and summer. The vegetation data were analyzed using two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) with PC-ORD version 4.20. Nine plant communities were observed in summer and eight in winter, with two communities being common to the two seasons. The overall Shannon and Simpson diversity indices, species richness and evenness of the communities varied significantly between summer and winter. The evenness (0.713) and diversity (H', 1.335) indices in summer indicate high species diversity, which is mainly due to homogenous distribution of the species. The Ivlev Electivity Index (IVI) indicates that plant communities have a specific preference for meadow thickness, Le., communities that prefer thick meadows avoid thin meadows. Competition among plant communities in terms of moisture and nutrient availability appears to be low due to the hypereutrophic condition of the lake and the floating nature of the meadows. But Capillipediwn spp., Phragmites karka, Leersia hexandra and Zizania latifolia appear to exhibit monodominance, as indicated by their frequency and abundance in most of the communities. Protection of areas with thick meadow from further deterioration is crucial for the long-term conservation of the Eld's deer and associated wild ungulates.																			0304-3770	1879-1522				NOV	2018	150						71	81		10.1016/j.aquabot.2018.06.006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2018.06.006													WOS:000444356300010

The distribution of the diatom species in 225 running water bodies from 8 basins of Turkey was determined in 2014 (summer and fall) and 2015 (spring and summer) in association with TP variation. Trophic values for 219 species were determined during this study and many of these are presented for the first time. Optima and tolerance TP values were calculated for each species in the different aquatic ecosystems using weighted average regression. Diatom species such as Clevamphora ovalis, Caloneis amphisbaena, Gyrosigma acuminatum, Navicula tripunctata, and Nitzschia umbonata showed high trophic weight values, while Achnanthidium minutissimum, Cymbella excisa, Didymosphenia geminata, Hannaea arcus, and Meridion circulare had low trophic weight values. These findings provide supplementary information about the biotic integrity of the water bodies and could be used to develop the TIT for the bioassessment of freshwater ecosystems, especially running water bodies.					; Çetin, Tolga/HLP-9596-2023; LEKESIZ, Omer/AAK-4391-2021; Çelekli, Abuzer/P-9845-2015	Celekli, Abuzer/0000-0002-2448-4957; LEKESIZ, H.Omer/0000-0003-2982-0136; Toudjani, Assane Anabi/0000-0002-6101-4284													1300-008X	1303-6106					2019	43	1					90	101		10.3906/bot-1704-40	http://dx.doi.org/10.3906/bot-1704-40													WOS:000455606900008
J	Huziy, O; Sushama, L				Huziy, O.; Sushama, L.			Impact of lake-river connectivity and interflow on the Canadian RCM simulated regional climate and hydrology for Northeast Canada	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Lakes affect regional climate by modulating surface albedo, surface energy, and moisture budgets. This is especially important for regions such as Northeast Canada with approximately 10 % of the landmass covered by lakes, wetlands and rivers. From the regional hydrology perspective, interactions between lakes and rivers are important as streamflow patterns can be significantly modified by lake storage, and similarly lake levels can be modified by streamflows. In this study, using a suite of experiments performed with the fifth generation Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM5) driven by the European Centre for Medium range Weather Forecasting ERA40 reanalysis data at the lateral boundaries for the 1979-2010 period, lake-river-atmosphere interactions and their impact on the regional climate/hydrology of north-east Canada are assessed. In these CRCM5 simulations, a one-dimensional lake model represents lakes, while the rivers are modeled using a distributed routing scheme, and one of the simulations includes interflow, i.e. lateral flow of water in the soil layers. Comparison of CRCM5 simulations with and without lakes suggests significant differences in winter/summer precipitation and winter temperature for the study region. CRCM5 simulations performed with and without lake-river interactions suggest improved representation of streamflows when lake storage and routing are taken into account. Adding the interflow process leads to increased streamflows during summer and fall seasons for the majority of the rivers, causing modest changes to land-atmosphere interactions via modified soil moisture. The impact of interflow on streamflow, obtained in this study, is comparable to the impact of lake-atmosphere interactions on streamflows. This study clearly demonstrates the need for realistic representation of lake-river interactions in regional climate models for realistic simulation of regional hydrology, particularly streamflows.																			0930-7575	1432-0894				FEB	2017	48	3-4					709	725		10.1007/s00382-016-3104-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-016-3104-9													WOS:000394150500001

This study investigates the temporal variations of hydrological connectivity and their driving mechanism in Baiyangdian Lake, a large shallow wetland in North China, using a time series of open water surface area data derived from 36 Landsat 8 multispectral images from 2013-2019 and in situ measured water level data. Water area classification was implemented using the Google Earth Engine. Six commonly used indexes for extracting water surface data from satellite images were compared and the best performing index was selected for the water classification. A composite hydrological connectivity index computed from open water area data derived from Landsat 8 images was developed based on several landscape pattern indices and applied to Baiyangdian Lake. The results show that, reflectance in the near-infrared band is the most accurate index for water classification with >98% overall accuracy because of its sensitivity to different land cover types. The slopes of the best-fit linear relationships between the computed hydrological connectivity and observed water level show high variability between years. In most years, hydrological connectivity generally increases when water levels increase, with an average R-2 of 0.88. The spatial distribution of emergent plants also varies year to year owing to interannual variations of the climate and hydrological regime. This presents a possible explanation for the variations in the annual relationship between hydrological connectivity and water level. For a given water level, the hydrological connectivity is generally higher in spring than summer and autumn. This can be explained by the fact that the drag force exerted by emergent plants, which reduces water flow, is smaller than that for summer and autumn owing to seasonal variations in the phenological characteristics of emergent plants. Our study reveals that both interannual and seasonal variations in the hydrological connectivity of Baiyangdian Lake are related to the growth of emergent plants, which occupy a large portion of the lake area. Proper vegetation management may therefore improve hydrological connectivity in this wetland.

The results show that the interannual variation in SAT_EA is significantly correlated with Eurasian snow cover anomalies (SCA) over two key regions, which include the western (SCAW) and eastern (SCAE) parts of the Eurasian continent. A pronounced climate shift of SAT_EA is observed around the late 1980s, and therefore, the data are divided into two subperiods, that is, 1972-1987 (P1) and 1988-2009 (P2). Examinations show that the relationship between SAT_EA and SCAW is impacted by the Arctic Oscillation. In contrast, the relationship between SCAE and the SAT_EA is Arctic Oscillation independent and is significantly increased from P1 to P2. Further analysis shows that the increased correlation between SAT_EA and SCAE from P1 to P2 cannot be well explained by the snow-related surface heat flux. A wave train-like anomalous circulation plays an important role in enhancing their relationship through intensified wind-induced heat advection in P2, which causes reduced snow and increased SAT_EA. A lead-lag regression analysis of the SCAE and the circulation anomalies indicates that the changes of the SCAE and SAT_EA are mainly responses to atmospheric circulation anomalies that occur 2months before spring. Numerical experiments that use a linear baroclinic model indicate that the snow anomalies around Lake Baikal may impact the variation of SAT_EA through modulating atmospheric circulation over the East Asia-North Pacific area.

Demography of Salsola australis populations in the agricultural region of south-west Australia	WEED RESEARCH												P>Salsola australis is a widespread annual weed of broad-scale cropping and pasture systems throughout Australia, and is of concern in the wheat belt of Western Australia. The population dynamics of S. australis was monitored at four sites in the Lake Grace district of Western Australia. At all sites, two to three cohorts emerged in summer and autumn or winter. While initial seedling density varied, density-dependent mortality ensured that the total number of senesced plants at each site was not significantly different. Estimated seed production ranged from 95 to 19 596 seeds per plant, although seed viability was low (approximately 9% for seeds that were shed and 15% for seeds that were retained on the mature plants). Total annual seed production per unit area was highly variable within sites but was not significantly different between sites.

Energy channelling, food chain length and body condition in a northern lake predator	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Identifying potential links between food web structure and animal body condition is fundamental for predicting the long-term persistence of populations under rapidly changing environments. Northern lakes, and the cold-water adapted species that inhabit them, are particularly vulnerable to a warming climate. We explored relationships among body condition and energy channel use in lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) and seasonal variation in food-chain length in the Lake of Two Rivers, Ontario, Canada. Bayesian mixing models using carbon isotope values (& delta;C-13) of essential amino acids showed that individuals utilising multiple energy channels had higher gonad mass, suggesting that dietary diversity has reproductive fitness benefits. Amino acid nitrogen isotope (& delta;N-15) analysis revealed seasonal variation in food chain length, with extension of the food web during winter and spring and truncation of the food web during summer. Although these findings illustrate increased omnivory of lake trout during summer, there was no clear evidence that seasonal changes in food chain length had an impact on trout condition. These findings provide new insight into potential relationships between food web structure, energy flow and consumer condition in freshwater ecosystems, thereby revealing potential responses of species to shifting ecosystem states under intensifying climate change at high latitudes.

Successful control of internal phosphorus loading after sediment dredging for 6 years: A field assessment using high-resolution sampling techniques	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The effectiveness of sediment dredging for the control of internal phosphorus (P) loading, was investigated seasonally in the eutrophic Lake Taihu. The high-resolution dialysis (HR-Peeper) and diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) techniques were used to measure the concentrations of soluble Fe(II) and soluble reactive P (SRP) as well as DGT-labile Fe/P in the non-dredging and post-dredging sediments. The P resupply kinetics from sediment solids were interpreted using DGT Induced Fluxes in Sediments (DIFS) modeling. The results showed no obvious improvement in water and sediment quality after dredging for 6 years, due to their geographical proximity (a line distance of approximately 9 km). However, dredging significantly decreased the concentrations of soluble Fe(II)/SRP and DGT-labile Fe/P in sediments, with effects varying at different depths below the sediment-water interface; More pronounced effects appeared in January and April. The diffusive flux of pore water SRP from sediments decreased from 0.746, 4.08 and 0.353 mg/m(2)/d to 0.174, 1.58 and 0.048 mg/m(2)/d in April, July and January, respectively. DIFS modeling indicated that the P retention capability of sediment solids was improved in April in post-dredging site. Positive correlations between pore water soluble Fe(II) and SRP as well as between DGT-labile Fe and P, reflect the key role of Fe redox cycling in regulating dredging effectiveness. This effect is especially important in winter and spring, while in summer and autumn, the decomposition of algae promoted the release of P from sediments and suppressed dredging effectiveness. Overall, the high-resolution HR-Peeper and DGT measurements indicated a successful control of internal P loading by dredging, and the post-dredging effectiveness was suppressed by algal bloom.

The unique methodological challenges of winter limnology	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												Winter is an important season for many limnological processes, which can range from biogeochemical transformations to ecological interactions. Interest in the structure and function of lake ecosystems under ice is on the rise. Although limnologists working at polar latitudes have a long history of winter work, the required knowledge to successfully sample under winter conditions is not widely available and relatively few limnologists receive formal training. In particular, the deployment and operation of equipment in below 0 degrees C temperatures pose considerable logistical and methodological challenges, as do the safety risks of sampling during the ice-covered period. Here, we consolidate information on winter lake sampling and describe effective methods to measure physical, chemical, and biological variables in and under ice. We describe variation in snow and ice conditions and discuss implications for sampling logistics and safety. We outline commonly encountered methodological challenges and make recommendations for best practices to maximize safety and efficiency when sampling through ice or deploying instruments in ice-covered lakes. Application of such practices over a broad range of ice-covered lakes will contribute to a better understanding of the factors that regulate lakes during winter and how winter conditions affect the subsequent ice-free period.

To better understand the drivers controlling phytoplankton communities, sampling was conducted during two seasons in 185 aquaculture ponds that cultured five species of aquatic animals (channel catfish, common carp, grass carp, crayfish and largemouth bass). Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), redundancy analysis (RDA), and generalized linear model (GLM) were applied to quantify the relative importance of multiple factors to phytoplankton species composition and diversity. The PCoA results demonstrated that in spring, phytoplankton species composition showed no distinct differences among the 5 cultivated-animal ponds. In summer, phytoplankton species composition had a distinct pattern, which was clustered into three distinct groups. The RDA results revealed that the variation in the phytoplankton composition was closely correlated with the water temperature, conductivity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), alkalinity, and nitrate in spring. In summer, different variables, including cultivated animals, alkalinity, pH and dissolved oxygen (DO), were responsible for explaining species composition patterns. In spring, no significant difference in phytoplankton alpha-diversity was found among the 5 cultivated-animal ponds. In summer, significantly higher alpha-diversity was found in the channel catfish and crayfish ponds than in the other ponds. GLM analysis showed that phytoplankton density, cultivated animals, and conductivity can be used to explain phytoplankton diversity. Although no effect of cultivated animals was found during the early aquaculture stage, the results from the summer samples demonstrated that cultivated animals have an important influence on phytoplankton communities. Therefore, we suggest that in intensive fish-stocking ecosystems, top-down effect is an important strength on phytoplankton communities. In terms of preventing algal blooms, a low density of phytoplankton is important for maintaining high phytoplankton diversity and water stabilization in aquaculture. Our results can provide useful information for water management practices in aquaculture ponds.					; Liu, Yang/JMR-0596-2023; Dong, Jing/KDM-6171-2024	liu, yang/0000-0002-6963-4509; Lv, Xu-Cong/0000-0002-0594-4284; 													0044-8486	1873-5622				NOV 15	2021	544								737078	10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.737078	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.737078		JUN 2021											WOS:000685114200008

Dust climatology of Mildura, Victoria, Australia: transport direction	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Large-scale geomorphic drivers that operate at continental scale are often climate driven. Changes in land use can accelerate wind erosion. The range of land management practises within one land use can have dramatic effect on ground cover and wind erosion. This study uses meteorological observations, land use, land management and dust concentration measurements of 129 dust events recorded between 1990 and 2007 to describe a dust chronology of Mildura, in south-eastern Australia. Frontal and frontal trough weather systems account for 74% of dust events. Furthermore, 88% of dust events come from rangelands in the northwest and the cropping lands to the southwest. The cropping areas to the southwest are the most common source of dust, accounting for 66% of events There is no relationship between rainfall and dust activity in this study, suggesting that land-management practices, especially on cropping lands, over-ride the controlling effect of rainfall. When cropping lands received above average rainfall in spring and summer during the 1990s, cultivation for weed control lead to rapid decline in ground cover that predisposed the land to wind erosion in following summer and autumn. In drought years, dust blows into Mildura from all directions suggesting that dust is climate driven rather than controlled by land use. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Diet of Lesser Scaup Wintering on Lake Pontchartrain, Louisiana	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												The lesser scaup Aythya affinis has been a species of conservation concern since continental breeding populations began declining in the 1980s. The causes of this decline are likely multifaceted, but cross-seasonal effects are believed to play a prominent role: females unable to acquire sufficient nutrient reserves during winter and spring migration have poor survival and breeding success. Understanding scaup diet composition and prey selection can help managers not only diagnose mechanisms underlying wintering scaup distributions, but may also help direct management actions to increase forage availability and quality. We evaluated the diet of 60 scaup collected from a major wintering site in Louisiana, Lake Pontchartrain. Scaup consumed almost entirely mollusks, especially targeting medium-sized (616 mm) common rangia clams Rangia cuneata, which were strongly selected relative to their availability. Eighty-two percent of scaup consumed dark false mussels Mytilopsis leucophaeata and 57% consumed dwarf surf clams Mulinia lateralis; both foods were selected by scaup, but were uncommon in benthic samples. On the other hand, small snails Texadina sphinctostoma, Probythinella protera were common in dredge samples but were either avoided or consumed in proportion to their availability. We conclude that medium-sized common rangia clams and dark false mussels are the most consumed foods for scaup wintering on Lake Pontchartrain, and hypothesize that annual variation in prey populations may be an important proximate driver of scaup abundance.

The landlocked population comprises two migrant groups, spring migrants and autumn migrants, which run to inlet rivers from the lake at different seasons. We used environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis, which is reported to be more sensitive and cost-effective than capture surveys, to clarify the genetic structure of this landlocked Ayu population with different migration patterns in Lake Biwa. We took water samples in 11 inlet rivers in the spring and autumn for 2 years in a row and quantitatively detected a total of 265 haplotypes of the mitochondrial D-loop region. The pairwise fixation index (F-ST) value and haplotype diversity indicated that there were genetic differences between the two migrant groups in their respective rivers, and the F-ST values were negatively related to latitude and the presence of artificial fish stocking. Additionally, isolation by distance within spring migrant group was observed when the lake was divided into the east and west sides. These findings show that the landlocked Ayu population in Lake Biwa has genetic structure associated with migration patterns and geographical distance. This study demonstrates that the eDNA approach will be effective for conducting a large-scale investigation of genetic structure beyond simple presence/absence tests.																			2637-4943					SEP	2023	5	5			SI		894	905		10.1002/edn3.345	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/edn3.345													WOS:001306413900008

Drivers and Management Implications of Long-Term Cisco Oxythermal Habitat Decline in Lake Mendota, WI	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Cisco (Coregonus artedi) are an important indicator species for cold-water lake habitats in the Great Lakes region, and many populations have been extirpated at their southern range limit over the last century. Understanding the roles of climate and water quality in these extirpations should inform protection of cold-water fishes. Using the water temperature at the depth where dissolved oxygen falls to 3mgL(-1) (TDO3) as a metric, we investigated the roles of climate and water quality as drivers of habitat availability for cisco in Lake Mendota, WI, USA from 1976 to 2013. We find that summer (Jun-Aug) air temperatures, spring (Mar-May) phosphorus load, and spring inflow influence summer TDO3. Warm air temperatures lead to the greatest increases in TDO3, whereas reduced phosphorus loads can reduce TDO3, thus alleviating oxythermal stress. Under air temperatures expected under the A1B climate change scenario, a 25% reduction in phosphorus load would stabilize TDO3 at current levels, while a 75% reduction in phosphorus loading would be required to expand oxythermal habitat. Costs of these reductions are estimated to range from US$16.9 million (-25%) to US$155-167 million (-75%) over a 20-year period but may be feasible by expanding upon current watershed phosphorus reduction initiatives if sustained funding were available. Identifying targeted reductions will become increasingly important throughout the region as warmer temperatures and longer stratification reduces cool- and cold-water fish habitat in many Midwestern lakes under the expected future climate.					; Magee, Madeline/ITW-0614-2023; Paerl, Hans/ABE-7384-2020; Wu, Chin/C-2042-2009	Hanson, Paul/0000-0001-8533-6061; McIntyre, Peter/0000-0003-1809-7552; Magee, Madeline/0000-0002-2741-2262; Wu, Chin/0000-0001-8393-1940													0364-152X	1432-1009				MAR	2019	63	3					396	407		10.1007/s00267-018-01134-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-018-01134-7								30645675					WOS:000459416600008

Considering their potential impacts on both the ecosystem and on human safety, fluctuations in lake levels are an important aspect of limnological research. In the enormous catchment of Lake Maggiore, there are many rivers and lakes, and the amount of annual precipitation is both high and concentrated in spring and autumn. This has produced major flood events, most recently in November 2014. Flood events are also frequent on Lake Orta, occurring roughly triennially since 1917. The 1926, 1951, 1976 and 2014 floods were severe, with lake levels raised from 2.30 m to 3.46 m above the hydrometric zero. The most important event occurred in 1976, with a maximum level equal to 292.31 m asl and a return period of 147 years. In 2014 the lake level reached 291.89 m asl and its return period was 54 years. In this study, we defined trends and temporal fluctuations in Lake Orta water levels from 1917 to 2014, focusing on extremes. We report both annual maximum and seasonal variations of the lake water levels over this period. Both Mann-Kendall trend tests and simple linear regression were utilized to detect monotonic trends in annual and seasonal extremes, and logistic regression was used to detect trends in the number of flood events. Lake level decreased during winter and summer seasons, and a small but statistically non-significant positive trend was found in the number of flood events over the period. We provide estimations of return period for lake levels, a metric which could be used in planning lake flood protection measures.

Of them, 143 (79.4 %) perch were infected with helminths. Thirteen helminth species were found: metacercariae of Bolbophorus confusus, Diplostomum pseudospathaceum, D. spathaceum, Ichthyocotylurus pileatus, Posthodiplostomum cuticola and Tylodelphys clavata; cestode Proteocephalus percae; acantocephalans Acanthocephalus anguillae and A. lucii and nematode larvae Contracaecum microcephalum, Eustrongilides excisus, E. tubifex and Rhaphidascaris acus. The digenean T. clavata was dominant species of the perch component community. Little seasonal differences were found in the prevalence, abundance and mean infection of helminths. Eustrongilides tubifex reported from the territory of Bulgaria for the first time, represent the new geographical records and new species of Bulgarian helminth fauna. P. fluviatilis was reported as a new host record for two digeneans, namely Diplostomum pseuspathaceum and Posthodiplostomum cuticola, the cestode Proteocephalus percae, the acantocephalan Acantocephalus anguillae and the nematodes Contracaecum microcephalum and E. tubifex from the territory of Bulgaria.

The reproductive life history of the species in Lake Monroe near Sanford, Florida, was studied from November 1990 to January 1992. No major differences in reproductive timing or performance were noted between this freshwater population and marine populations studied elsewhere in Florida. Females matured at approximately 22 cm disk width (DW), and mature ovarian eggs were ovulated in early April. Embryos were obtained from pregnant females from 15 May to 17 July, and parturition occurred in late July, when embryos attained approximately 100 mm DW. Males matured at approximately 21 cm DW. Mate gonadosomatic index peaked in November and declined continually through the spring, but fluid was retained in the seminal vesicles until May. This population experienced total reproductive failure during the 1991/1992 season. Extremely low conductivity in the lake during the fall and winter of 1991 is suggested as a possible stressor.

The movements of pike were characterised by long resident periods in the submergent vegetation, interrupted by short excursions to nearby areas. Two periods with more intense movement were observed; one period during early winter; and one period during spring from mid-March to mid-May. The increased movement during early winter may have been initiated by a slight temperature increase at this time, whereas the increased movement during spring coincided with the spawning of pike. Despite suitable spawning areas nearby the areas where pike resided most of the year, several pike, mainly females, migrated to distant localities during spring.

J	Salmaso, N; Decet, F				Salmaso, N; Decet, F			Seasonal and interannual changes of chemical characteristics and phytoplankton in a mountain lake of the Eastern Italian Alps (Lake Calaita, Trentino)	INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE												Measurements at Lake Calaita, a small mountain lake located at 1605 m a.s.l. in a metamorphic catchment area in the south of the Trentino Region (Northern Italy), have revealed great seasonal variations in the chemical characteristics and phytoplankton community during the ice free period in 1992 and 1993. The acidity present in wet precipitations (H+, NH4+) was neutralised within the drainage basin by mineral dissolution which led to an increase of basic cations and alkalinity in the runoff. The dilution during periods of higher discharge, e.g. in spring and autumn, resulted in loa values of alkalinity (up to 60 mu eq 1(-1)), pH (mostly <6.7) and conductivity (<18 mu S cm(-1), 20 degrees C). In summer, the decrease in runoff caused higher alkalinity (>110 mu eq 1(-1)), pH (6.9-7.4) and conductivity values (up to 30 mu S cm(-1)). The phytoplankton showed a major development in summer (with biovolume values of up to 7000 mm(3) m(-3)), two different taxa being dominant in 1992 (Oocystis cf. lacustris) and 1993 (Synedra sp.). Unpredictable climatic conditions have a strong influence on the physical stability of the lake, which makes it more difficult to explain the evolution of the phytoplankton community as opposed to deeper lakes.

We analyzed histopathological data from annual shellfish disease monitoring from 1988 to 2006 to quantify prevalence of B. ostreae in flat oyster stocks of the marine Lake Grevelingen. In addition, we estimated prevalence of B. ostreae on a monthly basis with field surveys in 2003. The parasite was detected with PCR, using specific primers for B. ostreae. Prevalence of B. ostreae was analyzed relative to O. edulis density, biomass and a range of environmental parameters. B. ostreae was detected in flat oysters throughout the year with a higher prevalence in spring than in autumn, possibly due to termination of spawning and the onset of oyster growth in autumn. Although B. ostreae was detected in all oyster weight classes, prevalence was highest in the largest oysters in spring and declined disproportionately in autumn, possibly due to high mortality of large oysters before autumn, suggesting that prevalence depends on oyster age. Parasite prevalence was independent of oyster density and total biomass, but appeared to be higher after a warm autumn. Abundance of the flat oyster (infected or non-infected with B. ostreae) was negatively related to the temperature of the preceding period, suggesting that mortality in flat oysters increased at higher water temperatures. Furthermore, O. edulis appeared to be more susceptible to B. ostreae after years with lower food availability and lower salinities (<29.5). B. ostreae may weaken the competitive ability of O. edulis relative to the introduced Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, particularly in years with high water temperatures.

Seasonal changes in kinetic parameters of trypsin in gastric and agastric fish	FISH PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY												The objective of the present study was to assess if trypsin, a key enzyme involved in protein digestion, presents some kind of functional adaptations to seasonal changes in water temperature in freshwater fish. In order to test this hypothesis, individuals of two fish species Carassius gibelio (agastric) and Perca fluviatilis (gastric) were sampled in the basin of Chany Lake (Siberia, Russia) at two different seasons (spring and summer). Apparent kinetic parameters (K-m and V-max) were determined for both species and seasons at the actual pH values in fish guts, and at actual temperatures. Results showed a significant effect of both the species and sampling season on the apparent kinetic parameters of trypsin. In the case of Prussian carp, K-m and V-max were lower for each assayed temperature (for 5 and 15 degrees C the differences were significant) for fish sampled in summer when compared to those sampled in spring. In contrast, values of K-m in perch tended to be lower in spring at 5 and 25 degrees C but these differences were not significant, while V-max showed a significant decrease in summer samples. This suggests a sort of functional adaptation of the same trypsin enzymes to seasonal changes, oriented to maximize protein digestion under variable conditions.

Some fish, as water-living animals, are especially sensitive to any water quality changes. Fish skin forms a natural border between the water and internal organs of the animal's body; therefore, the skin must be able to provide defense and resistance against any factors dangerous for the fish. Some seasonal changes can influence the skin morphology and physiology (mucus composition), blurring the assessment of the skin's reaction to any contamination. Abstract Fish frequently serve as bioindicators of aquatic environments during their ecological evaluation. Carpathian barbel (Barbus carpathicus, Cyprinidae) is a species common to rivers and lakes of Eurasia and Africa. Seasons of the year can influence its skin morphology and mucus composition. The clinical status of the animal depends on the above-mentioned factors. The aim of this study was a histological, histometrical and electrophoretical analysis of periodical changes in barbel common integument. The accessible material was investigated in histological, cytological and electrophoretic analysis using hematoxylin-eosin staining, histometric morphometry, gel electrophoresis and cytological methods. The results demonstrated significant differences in the investigated parameters for spring-summer and autumn-winter periods. Both skin epithelium morphology (epithelium thickness, number of cell layers, melanophores and mucous cell existence) and mucus composition (proteins, immune system cells, keratinocytes and mucocytes) showed significant differences between investigated seasons. These morphological and physiological changes were more pronounced in the dorsal than ventral regions of common integument. The differences in the physical characteristics of mucus and the histological structure of the skin cannot only serve as a source of useful information about an evaluated ecosystem, but can be also related to additional factors, e.g., microbiological and chemical water contamination.					; Poradowski, Dominik/AAD-4879-2019; Chrószcz, Aleksander/B-3840-2017	Poradowski, Dominik/0000-0003-4296-3174; Chroszcz, Aleksander/0000-0001-9079-549X; 													2076-2615					APR	2020	10	4							645	10.3390/ani10040645	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani10040645								32276487					WOS:000531832800102

These eco-evolutionary dynamics have been documented repeatedly in laboratory and mesocosm experiments. We show here that they are also important for understanding community functioning in a natural ecosystem. Daphnia is a major planktonic consumer influencing seasonal plankton dynamics in many lakes. It is also sensitive to succession in its phytoplankton food, from edible algae in spring to relatively inedible cyanobacteria in summer. We show for Daphnia mendotae in Oneida Lake, New York, United States, that within-year ecological change in phytoplankton (from spring diatoms, cryptophytes and greens to summer cyanobacteria) resulted in consumers evolving increasing tolerance to cyanobacteria over time. This evolution fed back on ecological seasonal changes in population abundance of this major phytoplankton consumer. Oneida Lake is typical of mesotrophic lakes broadly, suggesting that eco-evolutionary consumer-resource dynamics is probably common.

Fish mass mortality events in northern temperate lakes are happening later in the year than in the past	ECOSPHERE												Globally, mass mortality events are becoming more common across ecosystems and taxa. For fishes in northern temperate lakes, climate change is predicted to increase the frequency of summerkills and decrease the frequency of winterkills. We compiled reports of fish kills in Michigan inland lakes from 1936 to 2022 derived from historical records, management reports, and an online app for the public. Using this dataset of 525 reported fish kills in eight decades, we tested for changes in timing of fish kills. We found that fish kills in the early 20th century were most likely to be reported in early spring months, as lake ice thawed, while in the later 20th and early 21st centuries, more fish kills were reported through summer. Across our dataset, the median day of year fish kills were reported shifted later by more than 50 days. Shifts in the timing of these perturbations can alter population demography, and community resilience, and may have lasting and unprecedented impacts on lake ecosystems.

Major compositional changes in river phytobenthos occurred following high snowmelt inflows that filled the Lake Powell ell reservoir and resulted in high, steady discharges from GCD. Cladophora glomerata, the previously dominant alga, was partly displaced by a mixed mucilaginous phytobenthic assemblage consisting of miscellaneous algae, macrophytes, and bryophytes (MAMB). Relationships between abiotic parameters (discharge conductivity, nutrient concentration, and season) and biotic responses (composition and biomass of filamentous and epiphytic algae, and invertebrate biomass) were analyzed from 1995 to 1998. In addition, the response of the phytobenthos to an experimental flood (1275 m(3)/s) was examined in the tailwaters below GCD. Significant compositional changes occurred within 3 mo of lake filling and the onset of elevated discharges in June 1995. Relative phytobenthic composition by biomass prior Co June 1995 was: Cladophora glomerata = 915%, MAMB = 35% and cyanobacteria = 5.0% compared to 49.6 47.9, and 2.5%, respectively, after the initiation of high discharges. Cladophila and MAMB had an inverse relationship that fluctuated seasonally. Cladophora was positively associated with increased nutrient concentrations and loner discharge during summer-autumn whereas MAMB was positively correlated with deceased nutrients and higher discharge during winter-spring. Cladophora was positively associated with invertebrate biomass and also had greater epiphyton biomass and density than MAMB. The 1996 experimental flood resulted in a significant loss of MAMB biomass, in contrast to a minimal decrease in Cladophora and invertebrates. interactions between inflow patterns, reservoir chemistry, and discharge regime have an important effect on benthic community structure below dams. Resource managers need to consider these relationships and regard water resources above and below impoundments as a connected system when making management decisions.																			0887-3593					DEC	2000	19	4					742	755		10.2307/1468131	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1468131													WOS:000166307900014

Viral dynamics and patterns of lysogeny in saline Antarctic lakes	POLAR BIOLOGY												Antarctic lakes are extreme ecosystems with microbially dominated food webs, in which viruses may be important in controlling community dynamics. A year long investigation of two Antarctic saline lakes (Ace and Pendant Lakes) revealed high concentrations of virus like particles (VLP) (0.20-1.26 x 10(8) ml(-1)), high VLP: bacteria ratios (maximum 70.6) and a seasonal pattern of lysogeny differing from that seen at lower latitudes. Highest rates of lysogeny (up to 32% in Pendant Lake and 71% in Ace Lake) occurred in winter and spring, with low or no lysogeny in summer. Rates of virus production (range 0.176-0.823 x 10(6) viruses ml(-1) h(-1)) were comparable to lower latitude freshwater lakes. In Ace Lake VLP did not correlate with bacterial cell concentration or bacterial production but correlated positively with primary production, while in Pendant Lake VLP abundance correlated positively with both bacterial cell numbers and bacterial production but not with primary production. In terms of virus and bacterial dynamics the two saline Antarctic takes studied appear distinct from other aquatic ecosystems investigated so far, in having very high viral to bacterial ratios (VBR) and a very high occurrence of lysogeny in winter.																			0722-4060					FEB	2007	30	3					351	358		10.1007/s00300-006-0191-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00300-006-0191-9													WOS:000244212700012

The survey was conducted over three years at the end of the wet and dry seasons, assessing the seasonal and interannual variation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, whole-lake DOC mass, and DOM quality, through chromophoric and fluorescent DOM (CDOM and FDOM, respectively) properties. During the wet season (fall-winter), precipitation and runoff increased water discharge, water level, and inputs of terrestrial DOM with high aromaticity, humic content, and high molecular weight in both lakes. Contrastingly, during the dry season (spring-summer), in which photodegradation promoted by high irradiance and stagnant conditions drove DOM transformation, nonhumic, low-molecular-weight DOM prevailed. Both lakes displayed synchronicity in their DOC mass and CDOM and FDOM properties, indicative of similar responses to climate forcing, although the overall impact was modulated by their HGM features. Conversely, DOC concentration showed asynchronous responses between lakes, due to the higher intensity of the dilution or evapoconcentration processes in the connected lake, highlighting that DOC concentration is not always sensitive to climate-driven forces. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of variables other than DOC concentration, like whole-lake DOC mass, DOM quality, and HGM features, to better understand the effect of climate variability on DOM dynamics. Our results allow inferring the potential impact of an environmental scenario characterized by lower precipitation and sustained warming on DOM dynamics in Northern Andean Patagonia.

Salmonid fishes may shift from being mostly diurnal to being nocturnal in autumn and winter. As visual foragers, diurnal variation in prey availability and predation risk may drive variation in their activity pattern. In an oligotrophic lake, we studied diel activity and feeding of brown trout (Salmo trutta) and Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) using gill nets in the epibenthic habitat from May through October. Brown trout demonstrate an overall crepuscular activity pattern, whereas Arctic char demonstrate a more complex diel activity pattern. The variation in activity reflected the variation in stomach content in both species, with highest stomach-content mass in individuals sampled during night. Diet overlap of brown trout and Arctic char was high in early spring and reduced thereafter. Our results characterize both brown trout and Arctic char as indiscriminate particulate feeders and neither species had a diel change in their feeding mode.

However, differences in habitat preferences and feeding behaviour between bird species may result in variations in the dispersal of invertebrates via these birds, even if the different bird species live in the same lake. To test such effects, faecal samples from Antis platyrhynchos (collected in autumn and spring) and Tadorna tadorna (collected in spring) were cultured in water at 20 degrees C and 12 L: 12 D conditions in order to quantify the resting eggs which could be internally transported by these birds. One half of each faecal sample was initially cultured at a conductivity of 0.6 mS cm(-1) and the other half at 6 mS cm(-1). 1054 invertebrates hatched from a total of 60 faecal samples, including cladocerans, copepods, ostracods, rotifers and ciliates, with a wide variability among faeces. Autumn yielded a low proportion of samples with hatchlings (12.5%) compared to spring (90%). Significant differences were observed between birds, but not between conductivity treatments. Thus, our results imply different hatching dynamics affected by disperser and season, but most species transported as resting eggs by birds seem to have a wide tolerance to hatch under variable salinity conditions. These differences may largery influence the metacommunity dynamics of lake networks, and could be a key factor to consider in wetland conservation planning. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

This study investigates the water changes of Chao Lake during the last 30 years by using Landsat 5, 7 and 8 time-series images and water indices, including Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) and Normalized Sea Surface Temperature (SST). The gathered data demonstrates that each estimated indicator's value has increased with time. Thus, over the course of the 30-year research period, the NDWI, NDTI, GNDVI and SST annual average values show increases of 112.10%, 242.42%, 112.82% and 119.42%, respectively. The NDWI index underwent these fluctuations, evidenced with the biggest amount (681.8%) in the winter and the lowest amount (28.13%) in the fall. The most NDTI changes (480%) and the least (only 50%) occurred in summer and fall, respectively. The largest increases in GNDVI (180%) and SST values (537.86%) were observed in winter; the smallest changes in GNDVI (43.48%) and GNDVI (68.76%) in fall. The outcomes also demonstrated a strong link between all four estimated factors. In the majority of the analyzed months, the correlation between the 2 measures, GNDVI and NDTI, was considerably greater and near to 1. The findings of this study may be utilized by managers, decision-makers and local planners for the purpose of environmental planning and reducing water pollution in Chao Lake (and other water regions), as well as reducing the risk of environmental hazards due to water pollution.					; Rousta, Iman/N-2972-2017; OLAFSSON, HARALDUR/AAD-8234-2021	ZHANG, Hao/0000-0002-9735-1098; Rousta, Iman/0000-0002-3694-6936; 														2073-4433				FEB	2023	14	2							382	10.3390/atmos14020382	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos14020382													WOS:000938795100001

While most studies have focused on individual host-parasite systems, there is a gap in understanding the impact of warming on multi-host, multi-parasite assemblages in natural ecosystems. To address this gap, we investigated freshwater eukaryotic parasite communities in ten natural lakes near Konin, Poland: five artificially heated and five non-heated "control" lakes. Since 1958, the heated lakes have experienced a mean annual temperature increase of 2 degrees C due to hot water discharge from two adjacent power plants. We collected seasonal environmental DNA (eDNA) samples from surface waters over a two-year period and applied targeted metabarcoding to compare the richness and distribution of eukaryotic parasites across lake types with a focus on protists and fungi.ResultsUsing literature searches and sequence metadata from GenBank, we identified putative parasites which included Alveolates, Stramenopiles, basal Fungi and Ichthyosporeans as well as their associated hosts. Heated lakes harboured distinct parasite assemblages with higher richness of chytrids and aphelids, suggesting thermal preferences among certain freshwater microeukaryotic parasites. Other groups exhibited clear seasonal trends with richness of oomycetes peaking in spring and summer, and that of Cryptomycota in winter and autumn. A general linear model revealed a marginally positive correlation between chytrid parasite richness and richness of their green algal, diatom, and dinoflagellate hosts. Post-hoc analyses indicated that heated lakes exhibited greater seasonal variation in chytrid parasite richness and a stronger correlation between host and parasite richness than control lakes.ConclusionThese findings demonstrate that warming can induce strong shifts in the richness and assemblages of freshwater microeukaryotic parasites. Using chytrids as a focal group, we additionally demonstrate that warming may amplify seasonal variation in parasite richness and strengthen host-parasite richness relationships.

In attempts to assess relative abundance, assessment of lake sturgeon was conducted in nine Ottawa River reaches using two standard index netting techniques: the fall ( autumn) walleye index netting ( FWIN) and the near shore community index netting (NSCIN). A total of 488 lake sturgeons were collected over 5 years from 12 index netting surveys in nine reaches, 128 by FWIN and 360 by NSCIN. The relative abundance, mean total length and mean weight of lake sturgeons varied between the reaches. Lake sturgeons were relatively more abundant in natural reaches in comparison with impounded reaches. No lake sturgeons were sampled in three reaches, two of which are subject to a winter drawdown. Water quality, commercial harvest and waterpower management may still be the main stressors on lake sturgeon populations. Further assessment is required to ascertain the causes of the differences observed in the lake sturgeon populations.

Drivers and projections of ice phenology in mountain lakes in the western United States	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Climate change is causing rapid warming and altered precipitation patterns in mountain watersheds, both of which influence the timing of ice breakup in mountain lakes. To enable predictions of ice breakup in the future, we analyzed a dataset of mountain lake ice breakup dates derived from remote sensing and historical downscaled climate data. We evaluated drivers of ice breakup, constructed a predictive statistical model, and developed projections of mountain lake ice breakup date with global climate models. Using Random Forest analysis, we determined that winter and spring cumulative snow fraction (portion of precipitation falling as snow) and air temperature are the strongest predictors of ice breakup on mountain lakes. Interactions between precipitation, cumulative winter air temperature and lake surface area indicate that shifts in air temperature and precipitation affect smaller lakes (< 2 km(2)) more than larger lakes (> 2-10 km(2)). A linear mixed effects model (RMSE of 18 d), applied with an ensemble of 15 global climate models, projected that end-of-century ice breakup in mountain lakes will be earlier by 25 +/- 4 and 61 +/- 5 (mean +/- SE) days for representative concentration pathways 4.5 and 8.5, respectively.					; Dettinger, Michael/JAC-9558-2023; Sadro, Steven/AGC-7944-2022; Harpold, Adrian/K-9262-2015	Dettinger, Michael/0000-0002-7509-7332; Sadro, Steven/0000-0002-6416-3840; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2021	66	3					995	1008		10.1002/lno.11656	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11656		NOV 2020											WOS:000592627700001

The highest median per cent (by calories) of zooplankton in the diet was 1.3%; the remainder was macroinvertebrates. Watts Lake bluegills preferred (based on Manly's alpha) amphipods in spring and chironomids in summer. Cozad Lake bluegills did not show a strong preference (compared with Watts Lake) for any macroinvertebrates, but still utilized amphipods and chironomids during both seasons. Larger bluegills in Watts Lake preferred chironomids in summer, but Cozad Lake bluegills did not exhibit this relationship. The higher density Cozad Lake bluegill population appeared to be more opportunistic than the lower density Watts Lake population, but both preferred macroinvertebrates.					; Willis, David/D-3400-2009	Paukert, Craig/0000-0002-9369-8545; 													0969-997X					FEB	2003	10	1					31	40		10.1046/j.1365-2400.2003.00323.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2400.2003.00323.x													WOS:000180744800004

Therefore, we examined seasonal changes in physicochemical conditions and assemblages of zoobenthos and zooplankton, and whether these changes were correlated with the rise and decline of dense beds of Trapa japonica in Lake Mikata, a temperate shallow lake in central Japan. Our results suggested that the formation of dense Trapa beds during summer resulted in hypoxia, which significantly decreased the abundance of Chironomidae and Oligochaeta in the benthic community, as well as that of Calanoida among zooplankton. When dense Trapa beds formed, we also detected growth of other taxa that were resistant to hypoxia, including Cladocera, Cyclopoida, Ostracoda, and Nematoda. Chlorophyll a concentration declined across the lake during summer, when dense Trapa beds formed. The decline in Trapa beds from autumn to spring resulted in increased dissolved oxygen concentration, chlorophyll a concentration, and invertebrate abundance (Chironomidae, Oligochaeta and Calanoida), as well as a decrease in taxa utilizing the dense Trapa beds. Our results suggest that the phenology of dense Trapa beds can drastically change the seasonal dynamics of physicochemical conditions and the lower components of the food web in a shallow lake ecosystem.

Although the concept of water purification service helps quantify nitrogen export, the impact of river transport remains unclear. This study focused on nitrogen as a pollutant by utilizing the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model to assess nitrogen export in the Dongting Lake Basin, taking into account both the processes of sub-basin nitrogen export and river transport. Additionally, the monthly variations within the year were further explored, together with the identification of the priority area of returning cropland to forest land. The results showed that in 2021, the total nitrogen load outside the Dongting Lake was 11.34 x 108 kg center dot year-1 , with the sub-basins retaining a total of 9.02 x 108 kg center dot year-1 , accounting for 79.57 % of the total nitrogen load. Notably, the total nitrogen retention by the river made up 16.87 % of the total nitrogen retention, up to 1.83 x 108 kg center dot year-1 . In view of monthly variation, water purification service based on the entire process was higher in winter and late autumn, and lower in summer and early autumn. The priority areas for ecological project were mainly distributed around the Dongting Lake, achieving an improvement of 58.15 % in water purification service with approximately 7.02 % of the total returnable cropland. This study proposed a new approach of water purification service assessment through integrating river transport processes and seasonal dynamics, aiming to assess watershed nitrogen export risk more accurately.

J	MacInnis, AJ; Corkum, LD				MacInnis, AJ; Corkum, LD			Fecundity and reproductive season of the round goby Neogobius melanostomus in the upper Detroit River	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The round goby Neogobius melanostomus successfully invaded the Great Lakes perhaps, in part, because of its reproductive strategy, whereby females spawn many times over an extended reproductive season. Female round gobies were collected from the upper Detroit River (by trawling and angling) during spring, summer, and fall of 1996 in order to determine fecundity patterns and length of the reproductive season. Female round gobies were mature at 1 year of age, which is 1 year earlier than has been noted for gobies in Europe. Gravid females were present in May and declined at the end of July, which indicates that spawning occurs from spring until midsummer. Mean fecundity was 198 eggs, and variation in fecundity was correlated with standard length (r(2) = 0.76, P < 0.0001) of females. Fecundity was lower than that observed for the same species in Europe, but it was generally higher than that of most native species with which gobies would compete. A field experiment showed that artificial nests contained fewer eggs but were used more often by more spawning females than were such nests in Europe. The relatively high fecundity (compared with that of native species), rapid maturation, aggressive behavior, and extended spawning season may favor the continued expansion of round gobies throughout the Great Lakes.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				JAN	2000	129	1					136	144		10.1577/1548-8659(2000)129<0136:FARSOT>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(2000)129<0136:FARSOT>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000089076300011

The life cycle was bivoltine during both years. Development was direct and the population overwintered as larvae. The summer generation took only 6-7 wk to complete: the winter generation took the remainder of the year. Adult emergence took place from late May to early Sept., with 2 distinct peaks corresponding to the 2 generations. In both years summer generation larvae and adults were much more numerous than the winter generation. Production of this population (both generations) was estimated at 3.43 g .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. yr-1 (ash free dry mass). The type and abundance of aquatic macrophytes influenced larval microdistribution by acting as a substratum for the large capture nets of larvae. Potamogeton richardsonii and Equisetum were important substrata in summer. In winter, Chara was an important substratum, since it was the only major structural component on the mud-sand bottom during that season. Maintenance of capture nets was seasonal (May-Sept. or early Oct.) and appeared to be related to temperature. Cumulative degree-days were not sufficient to account for apparent differences in voltinism between populations; these differences may be a function of food supply, which in part is related to the productivity of the water body.

In Experiment 1, semen was diluted 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2 with Beltsville poultry semen extender (BPSE) #2. In Experiment 2, semen was diluted 1:1 with either Lake''s extender, BPSE #2, or BPSE #1. In Experiment 3, the fertility of semen from males 30 to 45-wk-old (first reproductive cycle) was compared to semen from males 51 to 66-wk-old (second reproductive cycle). Identical experiments were conducted in the fall-winter (F-W) and in the spring-summer (S-S). All hens were inseminated with 250 million spermatozoa per dose three times prior to egg production, then weekly for 15 wk. Egg fertility was determined after 7 days of incubation. In all experiments there was a significant interaction between holding time and treatment (semen dilution ratio, semen extender, or age of tom). Fertility of stored semen diluted 1:2 in Experiment 1 was lower than stored semen diluted 2:1 or 1:1 regardless of time of year (season) the experiment was conducted. Fertility was affected by a significant interaction between season and semen dilution ratio. Fertility of semen from males in F-W was higher than semen from males in S-S (Experiment 1). Semen fertility was unaffected by season when comparisons were made between semen extenders (Experiment 2) or age of tom (Experiment 3). Fertility was affected by a significant interaction between season .times. holding time .times. age of tom.																			0032-5791	1525-3171				OCT	1987	66	10					1721	1726		10.3382/ps.0661721	http://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.0661721								3432200					WOS:A1987L088100025

Michael			Temperature and light drive physiological and transcriptional responses, modulating infection outcomes in a freshwater diatom-chytrid system	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Stephanodiscus binderanus is a bloom-forming diatom abundant in winter and persisting into spring in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Climate change impacts these blooms by altering ice cover, turbidity, light penetration, and water temperature. Fungal parasites, especially Chytridiomycota, can suppress phytoplankton growth and alter bloom succession. To address the effects of both biotic and abiotic factors on S. binderanus in the face of a changing climate, we tested a range of temperatures (9.4-24 degrees C) and light intensities (15, 30, 50, 100 mu mol m-2 s-1) on infected and uninfected cultures. We also conducted an RNAseq analysis of both host and parasite across the described environmental parameters. Stephanodiscus binderanus can rapidly adapt to the above conditions, growing slowest at the lowest temperature and under low light, while adjusting its chlorophyll a (Chl a) content in lower light treatments to be more efficient at light harvesting. Chytrid infections were more prevalent at either end of the tested temperature range, despite downregulation of zoospore mitotic cycle genes at elevated temperatures. Elevated temperatures also induced reproductive stress in S. binderanus, marked by downregulation of meiosis-related genes. These effects, combined with nutrient depletion, likely contribute to seasonal declines in diatom populations as green algae and cyanobacteria emerge in late spring and early summer. It is anticipated that host response to lower light availability and the ability of the chytrid to infect under warming waters will contribute to a decline in filamentous diatom biomass in Lake Erie, especially as climate change increases the frequency of ice-free winters.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				2025 OCT 11	2025										10.1002/lno.70224	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.70224		OCT 2025											WOS:001590867500001

SEASONAL DISTRIBUTION OF ROTIFER DIVERSITY IN SELECTED FISH PONDS AND MARALA HEADWORKS SIALKOT, PAKISTAN	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND PLANT SCIENCES-JAPS												Seasonal distribution and diversity of Rotifers was explored at Marala Headwork (Lake) and selected fish ponds of district Sialkot, Punjab, Pakistan. Samples were collected randomly from the selected sites in the morning (09 am-11 am) with the help of zooplankton net during different seasons in 2017-2018. Rotifers counting was accomplished by Sedgewick-Rafter chamber under a compound microscope. We recorded fourteen species, 09 genera and 04 families at Marala Lake whereas 07 species, 05 genera and 06 families in fish ponds. B. angularis, B. calyciflorus, F. minuta, K. cochlaeris, K. valga, L. lunaris and P. roseola were common species recorded at both habitat types. Brachionidae was the most prevalent family throughout the year at both habitat types. Data recorded showed variations in the temperature (21 degrees C - 32.8 degrees C in Fish Ponds and 19.3 degrees C - 28.1 degrees C in Marala Lake), the gravity in fish ponds and Marala Lake varied from 1.001 to 1.003, electrical conductivity (317 mu s/cm to 396 mu s/cm in fish ponds and 259 mu s/cm to 315 mu s/cm in Marala Lake) and pH (6.7 to 9.2 in fish ponds and 6.5 to 9.06 at Marala Lake). Significantly different diversity (p <= 0.05) was recorded in fish ponds and Marala lake during different seasons i.e. autumn (H: 1.90 and H: 2.46), winter (H: 1.61 and H: 2.01) spring (H: 1.90 and H: 2.50) and summer (H: 1.91 and H: 2.52). Diversity indices showed higher population diversity of rotifers in Marala Lake than fish ponds. The study emphasized that natural bodies need to be explored extensively for the biodiversity of rotifers with special reference to physiochemical parameters for their conservation.

Stable isotopic composition of nitrate in Lake Taihu, China, and major inflow rivers	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Symposium on the Eutrophication Process and Control in Large Shallow Lakes	APR 22-26, 2005	Nanjing, PEOPLES R CHINA					Identification of sources of nutrient pollution is a first step towards remediation of eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems. The stable isotope nitrogen-15 (N-15) is a natural indicator of nitrogen (N) source and biogeochemistry. We sampled Lake Taihu, a hyper-eutrophic lake in eastern China, and major inflow rivers during winter and spring of 2004 to determine concentration and delta N-15 of nitrate (NO3-). Nitrate concentrations in rivers and the lake were higher, in most cases, in spring than in winter. delta N-15D of NO3- was not correlated with NO3- concentration, indicating that concentrations alone are insufficient to describe N sources. Results show that riverine N inputs in winter are influenced by discharge of human sewage into rivers and the lake. In spring, however, wastewater inputs to the lake appear to be balanced by fertilizers, atmospheric, and/or N-2 fixation sources. Rain NO3- concentrations were seasonally high and isotopically enriched compared to potential sources, indicating that rain may be a significant or even dominant source of N to the lake during the rainy season. delta N-15 values show that urbanized areas of the lake have more sewage-derived N than those areas dominated by agriculture, aquaculture, or industry. This observation has important implications for human health, since Lake Taihu is a source of drinking and irrigation water as well as fish for human consumption.

Seasonal changes in fatty acid composition of estuarine intertidal biofilm: Implications for western sandpiper migration	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												For shorebirds, long distance migration is an energydemanding activity, and lipids (largely comprised of fatty acids) with their high energy density are an ideal fuel. Diatoms in intertidal biofilms provide a rich source of fatty acids for fuel and for critical physiological functions. We compared the composition of intertidal biofilm on mudflats at Roberts Bank, a major stopover site for shorebirds in the Fraser River estuary, between two seasons: spring, during the northward breeding migration of Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri), and winter, when no migrating shorebirds are present. Mass fractions of fatty acids in biofilm ( g fatty acids/g sample in the upper 2 mm of biofllm-containing sediment) in April were 3-7 x higher than in winter (January and February). This difference included total saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, omega3 (n-3), and omega6 (n-6) fatty acids, as well as individual fatty acids such as palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3). In addition, organic content was similar to 25% higher in spring compared to winter. The microphytobenthos in spring biofilm was dominated by marineinfluenced diatoms (primarily from the genera Nitzschia and Navicula) which made up > 50% (mu g/ml) of total biofllm biomass. Higher fatty acid and organic content in biofilm during spring provide shorebirds with both energy and physiologically important fatty acids to support their migration. These findings are consistent with the 'green wave' hypothesis, whereby bird migration broadly coincides temporally with the availability of energy and essential nutrients. The role of diatoms as purveyors of important fatty acids to shorebirds underscores the need for new conservation policies that protect the abundance of organic and fatty acid content of intertidal biofilm at estuarine stopover sites.

Methylmercury photodemethylation is inhibited in lakes with high dissolved organic matter	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Photodemethylation can be one of the primary processes for loss of neurotoxic methylmercury (MeHg) in freshwater lakes. Few studies have quantified seasonal variations in photodemethylation rate constants as a function of dissolved organic matter (DOM). We conducted 1-week irradiation experiments in two seasons to test for spatial and temporal differences in photodemethylation potential in temperate lake waters. Six study lakes in Kejimkujik National Park, Nova Scotia were sampled in summer and fall to include a range of naturally occurring DOM concentrations (4.4-13.4 and 3.9-16.4 mg C L-1, respectively). A negative linear relationship (R-2 = 0.76, p = 0.01) was found between DOM concentration and photodemethylation rate constant across seasons, indicating that DOM is a strong predictor of MeHg photodemethylation independent of seasonal effects. The two highest carbon lakes (BDW and PEB) had significantly higher energy-normalized photodemethylation rate constants in summer compared to fall corresponding with lower DOM concentrations in summer relative to fall. Additionally, there were negative linear relationships between MeHg photodemethylation and DOM photomineralization (R(2)s = 0.58-0.72) and DOM photobleaching (R(2)s = 0.83-0.90). This key finding suggests that competition for photons within DOM structures may reduce the potential for MeHg photodemethylation in high carbon waters and that this relationship persists across seasons.

The biomass of cyanobacteria, densities of D. longispina and L. kindtii, concentration of chlorophyll a and water temperature were assessed weekly from April to October at three sampling stations along the longitudinal reservoir axis. The retention time was calculated using data on the actual water inflow and reservoir volume. A self-organising map (SOM) was used due to high interannual variability in the studied parameters and their often non-linear relationships. Classification of the SOM output neurons into three clusters that grouped the sampling terms with similar biotic states allowed identification of the crucial abiotic factors responsible for the seasonal sequence of events: cluster CL-ExSp (extreme/spring) corresponded to hydrologically unstable cold periods (mostly spring) with extreme values and highly variable abiotic factors, which made abiotic control of the biota dominant; cluster CL-StSm (stable/summer) was associated with ordinary late spring and summer and was characterised by stable non-extreme abiotic conditions, which made biotic interactions more important; and the cluster CL-ExSm (extreme/summer), was associated with late spring/summer and characterised by thermal or hydrological extremes, which weakened the role of biotic factors. The significance of the differences between the SOM sub-clusters was verified by Kruskal-Wallis and post-hoc Dunn tests. The importance of the temperature and hydrological regimes as the key plankton-regulating factors in the dam reservoir, as shown by the SOM, was confirmed by the results of canonical correlation analyses (CCA) of each cluster. The demonstrated significance of hydrology in seasonal plankton dynamics complements the widely accepted pattern proposed by the plankton succession model for lakes, the PEG (Plankton Ecology Group), and may be useful for the formulation of management decisions in dam reservoirs.					; Izydorczyk, Katarzyna/KHD-2599-2024	Wojtal-Frankiewicz, Adrianna/0000-0003-3509-6076; Izydorczyk, Katarzyna/0000-0003-2056-2513; Frankiewicz, Piotr/0000-0003-1782-9539; Kruk, Andrzej/0000-0003-1452-7906													1932-6203					DEC 3	2015	10	12							e0144109	10.1371/journal.pone.0144109	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0144109								26633032					WOS:000366040000057
J	Kuster, CJ; Schwarzenberger, A; von Elert, E				Kuster, Christian J.; Schwarzenberger, Anke; von Elert, Eric			Seasonal dynamics of sestonic protease inhibition: impact on Daphnia populations	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Daphnia populations often show rapid microevolutionary adaptation to environmental changes. Here, we investigated the possibility that microevolution of Daphnia populations could be driven by natural sestonic Protease Inhibition (PI). We hypothesized that PI changes seasonally, which might lead to concomitant changes in tolerance to PI in a co-occurring Daphnia magna population. In order to test this, seston from a eutrophic pond was sampled regularly over two successive years. Extracts of these freeze-dried samples were used to determine their Inhibitory Potential (IP) on D. magna gut proteases. In the summer seston the IP against chymotrypsins exceeded that of spring seston 200-fold. In order to test for possible impacts on the co-existing D. magna population, we isolated clones before (spring) and after (fall) the peak of the IP. Microsatellite analyses revealed that the two subpopulations were genetically distinct. Individual exposure of three clones from each population to varying concentrations of a cyanobacterium that contains chymotrypsin inhibitors revealed a decrease in population and somatic growth rate for each clone, but no seasonal effects on Daphnia's tolerance. In order to include maternal effects, we conducted a multi-clonal competition experiment on various cyanobacterial concentrations. However, no evidence for seasonally increased tolerance of D. magna to dietary protease inhibitors could be found.

The ice-break took place in mid-April instead of generally in May. Compared with data from 1960s onwards, a trend of shortening of the duration of ice-cover period is evident. In under-ice phytoplankton, diatoms, cryptophytes and flagellated chlorophytes predominated from March to June. In zooplankton, while thermophobic rotifers dominated in densities, copepods were dominant in biomass. The monthly sum of positive water temperatures correlated with the zooplankton in the following month and duration of the ice cover correlated with the biomass of all different zooplankton groups in May and June. The sum of water temperatures in April, May and June was positively correlated with the biomass of cladocerans and copepods, and negatively with the biomass of winter rotifers. Mild winters affected nitrogen and silica concentration positively and phosphorus concentration negatively.																			1386-2588					SEP	2009	43	3					745	753		10.1007/s10452-009-9283-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-009-9283-2													WOS:000269837500015

Knowledge of the bacterial communities in the water column of this lake, is incipient, with a basal quantification of the bacterioplankton abundance distribution in the North and South Basins of Lake Caviahue, and the described the presence of sulfur and iron oxidizing bacteria in the lake sediments. The role that bacterioplankton plays in nutrient utilization and recycling in this environment, especially in the phosphorus cycle, has not been studied. In this work, we explore this aspect in further depth by assessing the diversity of pelagic, littoral and sediment bacteria, using state of the art molecular methods and identifying the differences and commonalties in the composition of the cognate communities. Also, we investigate the interactions between the sediments of Lake Caviahue and the microbial communities present in both sediments, pore water and the water column, to comprehend the ecological relationships driving nutrient structure and fluxes, with a special focus on carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Two major environmental patterns were observed: (a) one distinguishing the surface water samples due to temperature, Fe2+, and electrical conductivity, and (b) another distinguishing winter and summer samples due to the high pH and increasing concentrations of N-NH4+, DOC and SO42-, from autumn and spring samples with high soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and iron concentrations. The largest bacterial abundance was found in autumn, alongside higher levels of dissolved phosphorus, iron forms, and increased conductivity. The highest values of bacterial biomass were found in the bottom strata of the lake, which is also where the greatest diversity in microbial communities was found. The experiments using continuous flow column microcosms showed that microbial growth over time, in both the test and control columns, was accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of dissolved nutrients (SRP and N-NH4+), providing proof that sediment microorganisms are active and contribute significantly to nutrient utilization/mobilization.

K.; Alenius, Teija; Seppa, Heikki; Giesecke, Thomas			Integrated varve and pollen-based temperature reconstruction from Finland:: evidence for Holocene seasonal temperature patterns at high latitudes	HOLOCENE												A detailed understanding of decadal to millennial-scale climate changes requires seasonal-scale (summer-winter) reconstructions of past precipitation and temperature fluctuations. Comparing seasonally resolved varve records with pollen-based sum of growing degree-days (GDD) reconstructions from Lake Nautajarvi, we examined the intra-annual nature of climate variability in central southern Finland during the Holocene. The organic varve record and the GDD reconstruction show roughly comparable trends supporting the interpretation that both proxies predominantly reflect summer temperatures in the study area. The records suggest low but rising early-Holocene (9500 to 8500 cal. yr BP) summer temperatures. The Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) in the GDD record dates to about 7500 to 4500 cal. yr BP, but the organic varve record along with reconstructed changes in vegetation composition, notably a peak of Tilia pollen percentages, indicate that during the HTM there was a trend towards a more continental climate with maximum mid-summer temperatures reached at 6500 to 4500 cal. yr BP. Both records reflect the start of the post-HTM cooling at about 4500 cal. yr BP, simultaneously with an increase of the amount of catchment erosion and mineral matter influx into the lake, suggesting gradually colder and/or longer winters with high net accumulation of snow. The organic varve record and the GDD record start to diverge at 2000 cal. yr BP, possibly owing to the human influence on catchment processes. The reconstructed mid-Holocene summer temperature peak deviates from the regional climate model outputs, which suggest highest summer temperatures during the early Holocene.

HYDROBIOLOGIA					4th International Conference on Reservoir Limnology and Water Quality	AUG, 2002	CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZECH REPUBLIC					The narrow, 53.5 m deep and 42 km long Slapy reservoir was sampled at 3-week intervals at a standard sampling station 9 km from the dam during the years 1964-2001. The chlorophyll-a increased relatively more than the total phosphorus concentration. The relative increase in the biomass of crustaceoplankton larger than 0.2 mm and also that of its cladoceran and copepod component was in-between. The biomass of copepods nearly equaled that of cladocerans. The seasonal maximum of copepods preceded that of cladocerans. The increase of the means of these maxims in subsequent decennia did not fully follow the general increase. In the last decennium compared to previous decennia there has been a clear increase of both taxonomical groups in the second half of summer and in the first half of autumn. The percentage of cladocerans larger than 0.71 mm determined in the period 1985-2001 decreased. In connection with the increase of the biomass of zooplankton this indicates an increase in the fishstock, especially of the fraction of small fish. The decrease in large cladocerans was distributed nearly uniformly over the season and is larger between the means of the 3-week intervals in the 1985-1990 period and 1991-1995 period than between the last one and the 1996-2001 period. The broad spring maximum is not uniform in individuals years. There are two subsequent high values the relation of which differs in different years in height and date. The two spring values for the impact of fish on the zooplankton are probably due to the spawning activities of two groups of fish, probably percids and cyprinids. The minimum percentage of the large cladocerans in autumn can be connected with the increasing size and therefore increased feeding activity of the yearlings in the period of decreasing biomass of zooplankton. The later mild increase can be connected to the decreased activity of cyprinids in the period of decreasing low temperature.																			0018-8158					SEP 1	2003	504	1-3					203	213		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008520.83751.e2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008520.83751.e2													WOS:000188316100021

This study investigates the dynamics of algal blooms in temporary wetlands within protected areas of northwestern Argentinean Patagonia. We characterised the algal community and biomass (measured by chlorophyll-a) in two wet meadows (Pitranto and Poza), assessing key environmental variables throughout the algal bloom. The blooms persisted from winter to early spring in 2023. Algal community composition varied between wetlands: at Pitranto, five green filamentous species, whereas at Poza, the community was primarily composed of the cyanobacterium Aphanocapsa sp., with a smaller proportion of filamentous algae. Excessive algal proliferation resulted in dense mats that blanketed the wetlands, attaching to vegetation and shading the water column, which, in turn, trapped macroinvertebrates within the mats. Cold winter temperatures triggered algal growth, and as water temperatures increased in early spring, the algae began to senesce. Chlorophyll-a concentrations and nutrient levels were lower than in previous years, likely due to nutrient depletion following efficient algal uptake. Sediment disturbance, exacerbated by invasive wild boar activity, may have altered nutrient dynamics and influenced algal blooms within these wetlands.

Relative quantum yield (alpha(B)) and light-saturated chlorophyll-specific carbon uptake (P(m)B) were calculated from the relationship of light and photosynthesis fitted to a hyperbolic tangent function. Temporal changes in P(m)B showed no regular pattern. Seasonal patterns of alpha(B) generally had peaks in the summer and autumn. Phytoplankton biomass (as measured by chlorophyll a) and light-saturated carbon uptake (P(m)) had peaks in the summer and autumn which were associated with vertical mixing. Estimates of mean daily carbon production were similar among the three years: 57 mg C m-2 d-1 in 1984, 70 mg C m-2 d-1 in 1985 and 60 mg C m-2 d-1 in 1987. Primary productivity in Emerald Lake is low compared to other montane lakes of California and similar to high-altitude or high-latitude lakes in other regions.																			0018-8158					FEB 28	1992	230	1					37	48		10.1007/BF00015113	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00015113													WOS:A1992HN79800004

R.; Fedorova, I., V			Winter thermal and ice regimes of small Karelian lakes against the background of regional climatic variability	VESTNIK OF SAINT PETERSBURG UNIVERSITY EARTH SCIENCES												This article investigates regularities of thermal and ice regimes of three small lakes of Karelia under current climatic conditions. Data of measurements of water temperature at autonomous stations and results of numerical calculations of the dates of ice-on and ice-off and the thickness of ice in these lakes using the one-dimensional parameterized model FLake in the anomalously warm winter season of 2019-2020 are analyzed. Data obtained are compared with long-term values over 1994-2019. The dates of the ice-on and ice-off on the lakes were quite close; however, on two larger lakes, intermediate ice destruction was observed at the beginning of winter, due to which the duration of the ice season differed between lakes by two weeks. The winter months of 2019-2020 were 6.4-9.4 degrees C warmer than the baseline, which was reflected in a noticeably smaller ice thickness on the lakes compared to previous years of measurements (40-48 cm at the end of March 2020 compared to the values in mid-April in 1994-2004 - 65-85 cm and in 2005-2018 - 50-65 cm). The decrease in ice thickness contributed to an early onset (mid-March) and long duration (more than five weeks) of spring subglacial convection. The model calculation, taking into account the atmospheric impact based on the ERA-5 re-analysis, reproduced the main features of the ice regime of the lakes, including the intermediate destruction of ice at the beginning of winter on two larger lakes. Significant regression relationships have been obtained between the dates of ice-on and ice-off on Lake Vendyurskoe, the dates of the onset and duration of spring under-ice convection, and the characteristics of the regional climate of southern Karelia (air temperature and the number of days with thaw in winter and spring months) for 1994-2020. The relationship between the dates of ice-on and the water temperature in the lake in winter is shown.

J	Qu, WC; Morrison, RJ; West, RJ; Su, CW				Qu, Wenchuan; Morrison, R. J.; West, R. J.; Su, Chenwei			Organic matter and benthic metabolism in Lake Illawarra, Australia	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Carbon and nitrogen contents (total organic carbon and total nitrogen), chlorophyll-a concentrations in surface sediments and benthic sediment water fluxes of oxygen and carbon dioxide were investigated at five stations in Lake Illawarra, (Australia) to compare the sources/quality of sedimentary organic matter and the characteristics of diagenesis and benthic biogeochemical processes for different primary producers (e.g., seagrass, microphytobenthos and macroalgae) and/or sediment types (sand or mud). The unvegetated sediments showed lower C/N ratios (with the lowest value occurring in the deep organic-rich muddy site) than the seagrass (Ruppia or Zostera) beds, which may be due to the contribution of microalgae (mainly diatoms) to the sedimentary organic matter pool. This was also supported by the detection of microalgal pigments in the bare sediments. On an annual basis, seagrass beds exhibited the highest gross primary productivity (O-2 or TCO2 fluxes), while the lowest rates occurred in the deep central basin of the Lake. Seasonally, there was a general trend of highest production in spring or summer, and lowest production in winter or autumn. Organic carbon oxidation scenarios, evaluated by either calcium carbonate dissolution or sulfate reduction models, indicated that both models can explain organic matter mineralization. Trophic status was evaluated using different indices including benthic trophic state index, net O-2 fluxes and P/R ratios for Lake Illawarra, which led to similar trophic classifications in general, and also the same trends in spatial and seasonal variations. Overall, these data indicated that the Lake was heterotrophic on an annual basis, as the total community carbon respiration exceeded production, and this supported an earlier LOICZ mass balance/stoichiometric modelling conclusion.

Two neighbouring mesotrophic (Ca' Stanga; CS) and hypertrophic (Lago Verde; LV) lakes, which originated from sand and gravel mining, were considered. Lakes are affected by high nitrate loads (0.2-0.7 mM) and different organic loads. Oxygen consumption, dissolved inorganic carbon, methane and nitrogen fluxes, denitrification and DNRA were measured under summer thermal stratification and late winter overturn. Hypolimnetic sediments of CS were a net sink of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (-3.5 to -4.7 mmol m(-2)d(-1)) in both seasons due to high nitrate consumption. On the contrary, LV sediments turned from being a net sink during winter overturn (-3.5 mmol m(-2)d(-1)) to a net source of dissolved inorganic nitrogen under summer conditions (8.1 mmol m(-2)d(-1)), when significant ammonium regeneration was measured at the water-sediment interface. Benthic denitrification (0.7-4.1 mmol m(-2)d(-1)) accounted for up to 84-97% of total NO3- reduction and from 2 to 30% of carbon mineralization. It was mainly fuelled by water column nitrate. In CS, denitrification rates were similar in winter and in summer, while in LV summer rates were 4 times lower. DNRA rates were generally low in both lakes (0.07-0.12 mmol m(-2)d(-1)). An appreciable contribution of DNRA was only detected in the more reducing sediments of LV in summer (15% of total NO3- reduction), while during the same period only 3% of reduced NO3- was recycled into ammonium in CS. Under summer stratification benthic denitrification was mainly nitrate-limited due to nitrate depletion in hypolimnetic waters and parallel oxygen depletion, hampering nitrification. Organic enrichment and reducing conditions in the hypolimnetic sediment shifted nitrate reduction towards more pronounced DNRA, which resulted in the inorganic nitrogen recycling and retention within the bottom waters. The prevalence of DNRA could favour the accumulation of mineral nitrogen with detrimental effects on ecosystem processes and water quality. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Because of the concern over the possible release of tributyltin species (TBT) from antifouling paints on boat hulls and marinas, surveys were carried out in 1989 and 1992 to determine the presence of this species and its degradation products dibutyltin (DBT) and monobutyltin (MBT) in this area. Many fish (pike and young-of-the-year spottail shiners) and sediment samples collected in 1989 contained detectable levels of TBT. A maximum concentration of TBT was recorded in northern pike in the spring to be 240 ng Sn g-1. Maximum levels occurred in marinas during the beginning of the boating season and significantly reduced during the summer and early autumn, although the maximum value of TBT in sediment (392 ng Sn g-1) was observed in the summer of 1989. The seasonal variation of TBT levels was further substantiated in the subsequent 1992 study, in which sediments from three areas in a marina were sampled at monthly intervals from May to October. TBT levels were much higher in May and then generally decreased with time. Mussels (Elliptio complanta) caged in the marina for three months also contained TBT. DBT was frequently detected in the sediments but less frequently in fish and mussels. MBT was generally below detection limits. Plants (macrophytes and cladophora) contained very small amounts of butyltin compounds.																			0268-2605					JUL	1994	8	4					385	391		10.1002/aoc.590080412	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aoc.590080412													WOS:A1994PD64300010

Global similarity, and some key differences, in the metagenomes of Swedish varroa-surviving and varroa-susceptible honeybees	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												There is increasing evidence that honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) can adapt naturally to survive Varroa destructor, the primary cause of colony mortality world-wide. Most of the adaptive traits of naturally varroa-surviving honeybees concern varroa reproduction. Here we investigate whether factors in the honeybee metagenome also contribute to this survival. The quantitative and qualitative composition of the bacterial and viral metagenome fluctuated greatly during the active season, but with little overall difference between varroa-surviving and varroa-susceptible colonies. The main exceptions were Bartonella apis and sacbrood virus, particularly during early spring and autumn. Bombella apis was also strongly associated with early and late season, though equally for all colonies. All three affect colony protein management and metabolism. Lake Sinai virus was more abundant in varroa-surviving colonies during the summer. Lake Sinai virus and deformed wing virus also showed a tendency towards seasonal genetic change, but without any distinction between varroa-surviving and varroa-susceptible colonies. Whether the changes in these taxa contribute to survival or reflect demographic differences between the colonies (or both) remains unclear.

Can spatial heterogeneity explain the perceived imbalance in Lake Superior's carbon budget? A model study	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Lake Superior is the largest lake in the world by surface area, containing 10% of the world's surface freshwater. Yet, little is known about its role within the regional carbon budget. Observational studies on Lake Superior have been limited by harsh winters and the challenges of covering such a vast expanse. To date, carbon budgets extrapolated from observational studies are largely out of balance and suggest a large efflux of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere (similar to 3 TgC/yr) that cannot be supported by the estimated net inputs into the lake (<1 TgC/yr). We couple a hydrodynamic model of Lake Superior to an ecosystem model to understand the seasonal cycle of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) in the lake surface waters, the resulting air-lake carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes, and whether spatial heterogeneity can explain the previously imbalanced carbon budget. The model sufficiently simulates lake productivity, circulation, respiration, pCO(2), and chlorophyll. We find that the seasonal cycle of pCO(2) is generally a double sinusoidal curve during the simulated period of 1996-2001. The lake acts as a sink of carbon dioxide in summer and during late winter of cold years and as a source to the atmosphere during winter and spring. We find significant spatial heterogeneity of respiration in Lake Superior, with near-shore to offshore rates of respiration varying by two orders of magnitude. Thus, Lake Superior need not act as a significant source of carbon dioxide (similar to 0.5 TgC/yr) to the atmosphere in order to be consistent with in situ observations of respiration.					; McKinley, Galen/IWU-5623-2023	McKinley, Galen/0000-0002-4072-9221; Urban, Noel/0000-0002-3586-0399; McDonald, Cory/0000-0002-1208-8471													2169-8953	2169-8961				AUG 14	2012	117								G03020	10.1029/2011JG001895	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2011JG001895													WOS:000307739700001

This paper presents meteorological observations made during winter and summer foehn wind erosion events as part of a 3 year investigation into the physical nature and incidence of eolian processes in the eastern Southern Alps, New Zealand. Foehn winds were observed to initiate eolian activity, including dust storm genesis when mean near-surface wind speeds exceeded 7-8 m.s(-1) over a 20 min period in the absence of precipitation. Wind speeds of 25-30 m.s(-1) were frequently recorded during typical foehn events, and wind speed maxima of 40-50 m.s(-1) were monitored during severe foehn windstorms. Saltation clouds sampled at 0.5 and 1 m above glaciofluvial deposits during foehn wind erosion events were found to display a mean grain size of between 300 and 435 mu m. The entrainment of fine-grained surface sediments by the airstream appeared to be enhanced in late autumn (May) and early spring (September) by freeze-thaw cycles that were observed to result in needle-ice growth in exposed glaciofluvial and lacustrine deposits. The needle ice fragmented such deposits, producing surfaces that were aerodynamically rough and highly susceptible to deflation by the airstream following a thaw. Observations made by this study are thought to be similar to foehn wind erosion events reported in the lee of other substantial mountain ranges, such as the Rocky Mountains, Andes, Hindu Kush, and Karakoram.

As an internationally important wetland reserve, Honghu Lake is polluted to varying degrees and the eutrophication trend has accelerated. The objective of this study is to quarterly monitor and assess the trophic status of Honghu Lake from 2000 to 2021 using the trophic level index (TLI). The TLI was retrieved by developing a semi-empirical model based on radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), air temperature and water level data were added to the model as input parameters, forming a control group with the model that did not include air temperature and water level data. Based on 178 Landsat images from 2000 to 2021, the eutrophication status of the Honghu Lake over the last 20 years was successfully determined. The main findings are as follows: 1) The accuracy of TLI retrieval model, with air temperature and water level data included (R2 = 0.723, RMSE = 4.971), is significantly higher than that without air temperature and water level data (R2 = 0.197, RMSE =10.453); 2) The eutrophication level of the waters in the northwestern part of Honghu Lake was higher than those observed in other lake water; 3) There were significant seasonal fluctuations in the eutrophication of Honghu Lake. The highest TLI values were observed in summer and autumn, while the lowest values were observed in winter and spring; 4) The eutrophication trend of the Honghu Lake has significantly accelerated from 2013 onwards, showing a change in eutrophication status, from light eutrophic to mid-eutrophic. Our results indicate that the TLI retrieval method with air temperature and water level is more predictive. Moreover, the eutrophication status for the entire lake from 2000 to 2021 was determined, which may contribute to the protection of the water environment.					; Zhang, Xiaoyang/KZI-3864-2024; Li, Wenchao/S-5567-2016	Yang, Fan/0000-0002-4450-5831; Zhang, Xiaoyang/0000-0001-8456-0547													1470-160X	1872-7034				FEB	2023	146								109898	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.109898	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.109898		JAN 2023											WOS:000925012200001

Multivariate statistical approach was used to study the apportionment of selected metals in the soil samples during summer and winter. The degree of contamination along with the geoaccumulation index, enrichment factor and contamination factor was also evaluated. In water-extract of the soil samples, relatively higher levels were noted for Na, Ca, K, Fe, Mg, and Pb with average concentrations of 56.38, 33.82, 12.53, 7.127, 5.994, and 1.045 mg/kg during summer, while the mean metal levels during winter were 76.45, 38.05, 3.928, 0.627, 8.726, and 0.878 mg/kg, respectively. In case of acid-extract of the soils, Ca, Fe, Mg, Na, K, Mn and Sr were found at 27,531, 12,784, 2769, 999.9, 737.9, 393.5, and 115.1 mg/kg, during summer and 23,386, 3958, 3206, 254.6, 1511, 453.6, and 53.30 mg/kg, during winter, respectively. Most of the metals showed random distribution with diverse correlations in both seasons. Principal component analysis and cluster analysis revealed significant anthropogenic intrusions of Cd, Pb, Co, Cr, Cu, Li, Zn and Na in the soils. Geoaccumulation indices and contamination factors indicated moderate to heavy contamination for Pb and Cd in the soils, while enrichment factor exhibited significant enrichment (EF > 5) of Cd, Pb, Ca, Co, Li, Mn and Zn by anthropogenic activities. Overall, on the average basis, considerable degree of contamination (C-deg > 16) was observed in both seasons, although it was higher in winter. Present metal levels were also compared with those reported from other areas around the world. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Wurster, CM; Patterson, WP				Wurster, CM; Patterson, WP			Late Holocene climate change for the eastern interior United States: evidence from high-resolution δ18O values of sagittal otoliths	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Stable oxygen isotope values were determined for freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens) sagittal otoliths recovered from the Eastman rockshelter archaeological site in northeast Tennessee to evaluate climate change for the eastern interior United States from 5500 calendar years ago to the present. Micromilled samples representing less than six days of otolith growth were extracted to acquire high-resolution intra-otolith variation in delta O-18 values. Freshwater drum sagittal otoliths form annual bands due to thermally induced growth cessation below 10 degreesC. delta O-18((H2O)) values can be calculated once a high-resolution carbonate sample representing the beginning of the growing season is isolated. Maximum summer temperature can be calculated using the seasonal minimum delta O-18((CaCO3)) value and the delta O-18((H2O)) value. Maximum summer temperatures calculated from the freshwater drum sagittae suggest that summer temperatures generally decrease from 29 degreesC at similar to5.5 ka to 22 degreesC at similar to0.3 ka. However, warmer climates at 2.9, 1.7-1.6, and 1.2-1.0 ka punctuate this trend. A more complete picture of the climate is reconstructed, because delta O-18((H2O)), values, which are a function of the ratio of summer to winter precipitation, are also calculated. A relatively low average delta O-18((H2O)) value of -8.1% VSMOW was calculated at 1.0 ka, suggesting cold winters, dry summers, and/or wet winters may have prevailed during part of the Medieval Warm Period in Tennessee. Contrary to studies suggesting that the Holocene was extremely stable and the Hypsithermal was invariably warm and dry, additional evidence suggesting both significant climate variability and evidence for a wetter mid-Holocene is presented.

To investigate the impact of the TGR on its downstream hydrological drought regime during different operation stages, Yichang and Cuntan stations were selected as the case study site with Cuntan station as a reference. On the basis of the recent updated long-term flow discharge data series from 1950 to 2016, drought occurrence, duration and frequency of the hydrological droughts downstream of the TGR during pre- and post-dam periods were analyzed and compared, respectively. Abrupt changes were also identified for hydrological drought at different timescales. Results showed that TGR's operation altered its downstream seasonal variation patterns of dry/wet spells, i.e., more severe drought from middle summer to middle winter while much wetter condition in late winter and spring; impacts on the downstream hydrological drought intensify with upgrading reservoir water storing levels; significant abrupt changes of hydrological droughts were identified, and the abrupt changing years were greatly correlated with the impoundment stages of the TGR. The study could provide valuable references for the ecological security and integrated water resources management of the Yangtze River basin and other large rivers severely impacted by anthropogenic activities over the world.

In the KDR, long-term water quality surveys have been carried out in order to determine the trophic status of this rather unique reservoir. In this paper, the focus is on the large phytoplankton species that were identified during the field studies conducted between 1991 and 1993. According to the results of the surveys, the overall phytoplankton density is low during the fall and winter months. However, species belonging to various groups started to become abundant in the spring when the water level began to rise. In terms of species diversity, the most dominant group was the Bacillariophyta. Other dominant species belonged to the Cyanophyta, Chloropyta, Pyrrophyta, Chrysophyta and Euglenophyta. The effects of various physicochemical quality parameters on the seasonal distribution and succession of the above taxa, as well as the interrelation with eutrophication, are also discussed.

Formation of the Chemical Composition of Water in Northern Baikal in the Zone of Mixing with the Water of Its Tributaries	RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY												The results of studying the chemical composition of water in Northern Baikal and in the rivers flowing into it are analyzed. It is shown that the influence of river water on forming the chemical composition of water in this part of the lake is observed at the distance of 1-3 km from the cofferdam separating the Upper Angara delta from Lake Baikal. In spring and early summer, the expansion of river water in the lake is constrained by a thermal bar. In summer, a biological barrier is formed in the mixing zone, where the minimum biogenic element concentrations of and maximum phytoplankton concentrations are registered. The increased concentrations of phosphorus have been revealed in the shallow area in winter, which points to the contamination of bottom sediments and secondary pollution of water. The increased content of phosphorus in the water may be a sign of the eutrophication of Northern Baikal.

Eddy Covariance Data Reveal That a Small Freshwater Reservoir Emits a Substantial Amount of Carbon Dioxide and Methane	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Small freshwater reservoirs are ubiquitous and likely play an important role in global greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets relative to their limited water surface area. However, constraining annual GHG fluxes in small freshwater reservoirs is challenging given their footprint area and spatially and temporally variable emissions. To quantify the GHG budget of a small (0.1 km(2)) reservoir, we deployed an Eddy covariance (EC) system in a small reservoir located in southwestern Virginia, USA over 2 years to measure carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes near-continuously. Fluxes were coupled with in situ sensors measuring multiple environmental parameters. Over both years, we found the reservoir to be a large source of CO2 (633-731 g CO2-C m(-2) yr(-1)) and CH4 (1.02-1.29 g CH4-C m(-2) yr(-1)) to the atmosphere, with substantial sub-daily, daily, weekly, and seasonal timescales of variability. For example, fluxes were substantially greater during the summer thermally stratified season as compared to the winter. In addition, we observed significantly greater GHG fluxes during winter intermittent ice-on conditions as compared to continuous ice-on conditions, suggesting GHG emissions from lakes and reservoirs may increase with predicted decreases in winter ice-cover. Finally, we identified several key environmental variables that may be driving reservoir GHG fluxes at multiple timescales, including, surface water temperature and thermocline depth followed by fluorescent dissolved organic matter. Overall, our novel year-round EC data from a small reservoir indicate that these freshwater ecosystems likely contribute a substantial amount of CO2 and CH4 to global GHG budgets, relative to their surface area.

B. anoplus taken from the open-water habitat fed mainly on copepods and cladocerans; those living in a small stream fed mainly on aquatic insect larvae and had a more varied diet. Seasonal shifts in the diet for both juvenile and adult minnows were observed. The smaller length groups changed from benthic feeding in spring to mainly mid-water feeding in summer. The larger fish prey on corixids in summer but switch to mainly chironomid larvae and zooplankton in winter. The minnows fed actively during the day with peak feeding in mid-morning and at dusk. Euryphagous feeding behavior of B. anoplus may be partially responsible for the widespread distribution of this species in southern Africa and for the successful colonization of the new shoreline habitat of Lake Le Roux. A review of the feeding biology of small Barbus spp. in Africa reveals that they are unspecialized facultative feeders, an attribute which has possibly played an important role in the success of this group of fishes in Africa.																			0377-9688						1983	9	1					12	22		10.1080/03779688.1983.9639406	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03779688.1983.9639406													WOS:A1983RF99800002

Studies show that, that organic matter of landfill leachate in Yongchuan, Dazu and Jiangjin is the class of fulvic-like acid and protein-like fluorescence. The study also found that the longer the time of the pile of garbage, the lower the content of class of protein-like concentration, and the higher the concentration of fulvic-like acid, indicating that the protein waste material in the humification process is easy degradation. However, the same source of DOM is similar in the functional group composition and molecular structure. Characteristic frequency area analysis showed that humic acids (HA), and fulvic acids (FA) contain more than hydrophilic organic matter (HyI) aromatic ring structure, and FA aromatic ring structure is the most. Because of Chung-amide NH deformation vibration, there are strong absorption peaks in the 1562 similar to 1572 cm(-1) for various components; HyI contains many organic nitrogen compounds and fatty acids.

GROWTH AND REPRODUCTIVE EFFORT	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Shell growth of tagged zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) was monitored in lakes at 3 sites over 1 1/2 years. It varied greatly with the season and was almost absent during winter months. Shell growth was significantly correlated with seston concentration, but not with water temperature. The theoretical maximum size (L infinity) of the v. Bertalanffy growth equation did not vary seasonally. Tissue weight underwent a pronounced seasonal cycle. In animals of 20 mm shell length, minimum weights recorded in September only corresponded to one quarter to one third of the maxima in late spring. Tissue weight of animals from the 3 sites was distinctly different. Carbohydrate content of the tissue stayed below 10 per cent and tended to be highest in spring. Spring maxima of lipids were very pronounced. These lipids were primarily located in the digestive gland. These data were combined with data of gonad size by Borcherding (1991). Results imply that production of reproductive tissue even continues at a retarded rate during winter months, if food conditions were favourable. With poor food conditions, no production of reproductive tissue was estimated during winter; this, however, was followed by an elevated rate of reproductive tissue production in spring. Weight specific production decreased with a weight exponent of -0.24. Shell and byssus production contributed only in the range of 10 per cent to total production. Reproductive effort showed maxima of 30 to 45%. It increased with shell length at 2 sites and decreased at the other site with the largest animals.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY 12	1995	304	2					117	132		10.1007/BF02579417	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02579417													WOS:A1995RC89600003

Symptomatic trees in many of these orchards had been diagnosed previously as suffering from winter injury or root asphyxiation following an excessively wet autumn and spring. When woody peach seedlings were transplanted into artificially infested potting soil and flooded for 48-hr periods at 2 wk intervals, P. cactorum and most isolates identified as P. cryptogea were highly virulent, causing > 90% root rot and a 60-100% incidence of crown rot; isolates of P. megasperma displayed more variable levels of virulence, causing 19-80% root rot and a 0-60% incidence of crown rot. These results indicate that root and crown rots caused by P. megasperma, P. cryptogea, and P. cactorum may be significant causes of decline and death of peach trees in New York and Ohio.																			0191-2917	1943-7692				OCT	1989	73	10					794	798		10.1094/PD-73-0794	http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-73-0794													WOS:A1989AU31600004

Twelve lake perimeter sites were regularly checked for otter tracks and signs. The amount of signs was compared to environmental parameters to test their influence on otter presence and movements. A positive correlation was found between the amount of signs and the physical structure of the littoral areas, as well as vegetation structure. Lakeside otter presence decreased during the summer sampling throughout all sites. In order to determine otter diet, 205 spraints were examined. Otters fed mainly on fish (mostly Cichlidae), but also on crustaceans and molluscs. Other fish consumed were Characidae, Synbranchidae, Loricariidae and Erythrinidae. Seasonal variation was observed in diet composition: in summer, diet crustaceans and vertebrates other than fish increased. A higher percentage of benthic fish species was also observed in summer, while pelagic and benthopelagic species increased in winter. Such dietary changes may be explained by the different habitat use of otters in different seasons, from the lake coast (winter) towards more internal marshy areas of the wetland (summer).

Long-term monitoring of glacier dynamics provides key information on glacier evolution in a changing climate, which is essential for regional water resource and natural hazard management. On large glaciers, detailed field based mass balance is not feasible. Ice dynamic variations quantify changes in mass transport and possibly the influence of environmental parameters on the evolution of the glacier. Although velocity variations of Baltoro Glacier during winter and summer are linked to seasonally enhanced basal sliding, little is known about differences in timing and magnitude of (intra-)seasonal velocity variations and their determining mechanisms. We present time series of annual, seasonal, and intra-seasonal glacier surface velocities by means of intensity offset tracking applied on multi-mission Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for a period of 25 years from 1992 to 2017. Supraglacial lakes forming on the downstream glacier surface in summer were mapped from 1991 to 2017 based on the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), calculated from multi-spectral Landsat and ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) imagery. Additionally, precipitation data of the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) and temperature data of ERA-Interim were used to derive the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Temperature Index (STI) from 1998 to 2017. Linking surface velocities to the SPI confirmed a strong correlation between heavy precipitation events in winter and the magnitude and the timing of glacier acceleration in summer. Downstream extensions of summer acceleration that have been found since 2015 may be explained by additional water draining from an increased number of supraglacial lakes through crevasses that have been formed in consequence of higher initial velocities, evoked by strong winter precipitation. The warmer melt seasons observed in the years 2015 to 2017 additionally affects the formation of a supraglacial lake, so stronger summer acceleration events in recent years may be indirectly related to global warming.					; Mayer, Christoph/AAD-6696-2019	Mayer, Christoph/0000-0002-4226-4608; Wendleder, Anna/0009-0005-1534-4732; Friedl, Peter/0009-0000-9891-6655													2072-4292					NOV	2018	10	11							1681	10.3390/rs10111681	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs10111681													WOS:000451733800012

The stomach content compositions of 174 individuals and the stable isotope ratios of 30 individuals and their prey animals were investigated along with the species composition of prey animals in the environment. Various aquatic animals, including fish eggs, mollusks, crabs, palaemonid shrimps, atyid shrimps, isopods (asellids), chironomid larvae, and dragonfly larvae, were present in juvenile E. oxycephala stomach contents. In the tributary, they mainly preyed on atyid shrimps, which were abundant in the environment, with lower feeding intensity during winter season. In the major stream, throughout the year (including winter), they fed mainly on chironomid larvae, which were smaller and slower than atyid shrimps, and so easily caught, even by small recently recruited juveniles. There were abundant chironomid larvae in the major stream environment, where the water temperature seemed warmer and more eutrophic than in the tributary because of the treated sewage discharge, particularly in winter. These results indicated that feeding intensity differed between sites, particularly in winter, and this difference might be associated with differences in prey availability (i.e., chironomid larvae) or warm-water conditions. Moreover, juveniles could shift their use of food resources, in response to differences in prey availability. Thus, to conserve E. oxycephala in terms of early food resource use, it is necessary to conserve various aquatic prey animals such as atyid shrimps and chironomid larvae and their habitats.

Sulfur mass balance and speciation in the water cap during early-stage development in the first pilot pit lake in the Alberta Oil Sands	ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY												Rationale. Sulfur cycling is crucial to the persistence of oxygen in the water cap of Base Mine Lake (BML), the first demonstration oil sands pit lake for water capped tailings technology (WCTT) in Alberta, Canada. Methodology. Here, we report on the first investigation of sulfur mass balance and sulfur speciation (SO42-, SO32-, S2O32-, S-0 and Sigma H2S) over seasonal, annual and spatial scales in BML. Results and discussion. High aqueous total sulfur concentration (1.7-2 mM), dominated by sulfate (>75%), decreased over the study period (2015-2021), due to the consolidation of fluid fine tailings (FFT) and operational pump-in and pump-out activities. Expanded BML water cap S biogeochemical cycling occurred after a 2016 alum amendment. Late summer hypolimnetic anoxia emerged post-alum (2017-2021), coincident with detectable total sulfide (Sigma H2S) and elemental sulfur (S0) concentrations and expanded sulfur-reducing bacteria activity in anoxic bottom waters. Post spring turnover resuspended FFT and particle settling rates also likely increased post-alum, supported by the observed migration of epilimnetic highest sulfite concentration (pre-alum) to metalimnetic waters (post-alum). These sulfide containing particles are likely the primary reduced S substrate for spring-summer sulfur-oxidising bacteria activity, as winter aqueous reactive S species (Sigma H2S, S-0, S2O32- and SO32-) were non-detectable across years. Concentrations of reactive S species reached up to 200 mu M, posing risks to BML O-2 levels (maximum 300-350 mu M). Results of this study establish the interactive effects of physical and biogeochemical processes, as well as operational activities in emergent S risks to water cap oxygen levels, a key criterion for success of this reclamation tailings technology.					; Apte, Simon/A-4241-2012; Yan, Yunyun/JJD-3184-2023	Warren, Lesley/0000-0002-1061-2700; Apte, Simon/0000-0003-2427-413X; Yan, Yunyun/0009-0003-3316-3236													1448-2517	1449-8979					2022	19	4					236	253		10.1071/EN22057	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/EN22057		OCT 2022											WOS:000871882700001

While many researchers believe that heatwaves and droughts may enhance algal bloom, heatwaves and droughts reduced algal blooms in Lake Chaohu during the spring and summer of 2022. To investigate the mechanism behind this phenomenon, on-site sampling and online monitoring were conducted in Lake Chaohu from 2019 to 2022. The results showed that non-algal turbidity played a critical role in temporarily inhibiting algal blooms. The water level in spring and summer of the drought year was 1.2 m lower than that in conventional years, resulting in the area of shoals where resuspension could occur being nearly 4 times larger than in conventional years. Strong resuspension caused turbidity in spring and summer to be more than double that of conventional years, sharply reducing gross primary productivity by 39 %, which led to lower chlorophyll a concentration than in conventional years. These results indicate that drought does not necessarily exacerbate algal blooms, and changes in shoal area due to water level fluctuations are a key factor affecting algal blooms in shallow lakes prone to resuspension. Furthermore, these results suggest lake managers can control algal blooms by adjusting water level to increase turbidity during or before algal bloom seasons.

After the first liming the lake reacidified close to the prelimed condition. The reliming, which started in 1987, was planned to maintain the pH at a relatively high level for the lake. A detailed monitoring of pH and temperature was performed at depth 0.5, 1, 1,5 and 5 m since spring 1983. Quantitative samples of benthic invertebrates were taken in spring and fall in 1977 and regularly at the same seasons from 1981 at depth 0.5, 2, 5 and 10 m. A reference lake, Lille Hovvatn have been sampled with the same procedure since 1988. The acid tolerant mayfly Leptophlebia vespertina responded quickly to the first liming with a 20 times increase in density after a few months. However,the densities rapidly decreased during the first years of reacidification. The lime treatments in 1987 and 1989, resulted in a second peak in density in 1990. After this, the densities have been reduced in spite of generally good water quality in Hovvatn. During fall the density increase was significant at 0.5 m depth in 1990, at 2 m depth in 1989, 1990 and 1992 and at 5 m depth in 1988 to 1990. No significant increase was observed in the limed localities during spring. It is concluded that acid surface water, prior to ice break, affect the food resources to L. vespertina and reduce the population at all depths during spring and in the littoral zone in fall.																			0049-6979					DEC	1995	85	2					961	966		10.1007/BF00476954	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00476954													WOS:A1995UB05300112

This lake is shallow, eutrophic, and annually ice-covered on average for 5 months. The ice sheet was 41-55 cm thick at the annual maximum, consisting of snow-ice and congelation ice. The e-folding depth of light intensity was 50-100 cm for congelation ice and 5-10 cm for snow. The water body had a 4-m thick upper mixed layer and lower continuously stratified layer. Fall cooling process was crucial to determine the temperature of the lower layer at freeze-up, anything within 0-4 degrees C. Oxygen concentration decreased in winter, especially close to the bottom sediments, and carbon dioxide concentration increased due to respiration activity. Phytoplankton production and biomass level were low or very low and, therefore, heterotrophic and mixotrophic species were abundant. Oxygen depletion in the hypolimnium had several chemical and ecological consequences, such as release of phosphorus from the bottom sediments. In spring, just before the ice-out, photosynthesis was at a high level beneath the ice due to improved light conditions and started to elevate the oxygen concentration in the topmost water layer.					; Lepparanta, Matti/M-7507-2017	Arvola, Lauri/0000-0003-1380-0659; Lepparanta, Matti/0000-0002-4754-5564; Kari, Elina/0000-0002-0861-3341													1201-3080						2012	47	3-4					287	299		10.2166/wqrjc.2012.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wqrjc.2012.003													WOS:000314819000009

We analyzed a data set of phytoplankton community and environmental parameters in seasonal periods (i.e., summer and autumn) in order to describe seasonal variations within the phytoplankton community and its relationship with environmental variables in Chagan Nur Lake on the Ordos Plateau in China. The lake's phytoplankton species was not abundant, with a mean density of 222.43x10(4) cells/L (ranging from 62.35x10(4) cells/L in autumn to 382.5x10(4) cells/L in summer 2014). However, the groups with highest densities were essentially limited to Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta, and Cyanophyta. There were considerable seasonal variations in phytoplankton composition. Eleven environmental variables were selected to explore the relationship between phytoplankton structure and environmental factors by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). The results of the CCA applied to the environmental factors indicated that total phosphorus (TP), pH, total ion degrees (Tds), salinity (Sal), and electrical conductivity (Con) significantly influenced the phytoplankton community (p<0.01; Monte Carlo test of first constrained axis).					chen, yuqi/KBB-4137-2024														1230-1485	2083-5906					2016	25	4					1427	1433		10.15244/pjoes/62257	http://dx.doi.org/10.15244/pjoes/62257													WOS:000381108800006
J	Khan, MA				Khan, MA			The phytoplankton periodicities of two warm-climate lakes subject to marked seasonal variability	JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY												The phytoplankton periodicity of a tropical upland reservoir in Nigeria (Liberty Dam, Jos Plateau) and a temperate-type lake (L. Naranbagh) from the Kashmir Himalaya were compared. Variations in the phytoplankton communities in the water-bodies were both quantitative and qualitative. Liberty Dam conformed to the oligotrophic-desmid plankton type whilst in L.Naranbagh, phytoplankton resembled the eutrophic chlorococcales-diatom plankton type. Contrary to the general belief of muted (or lack of) seasonal changes in tropical regions, phytoplankton succession in the Jos reservoir was pronounced with dense persistence of some species for relatively short periods. The most striking fluctuations, typical of many temperate waters, were characteristic of L. Naranbagh with a build-up of plankton during summer and autumn. Variability in photosynthetic productivity was related to shifts in the climate-dependent population densities. The seasonal growth of the Jos phytoplankton reflected the alteration from the dry 'Harmattan' (December-February) to wetter (May-September) periods. These are analogous to the winter (December-February) and summer (June-August) seasons of the Kashmir Himalayan Valley. Phytoplankton associations and periodicities in each of the two warm-belt lakes were strongly driven by their respective local environments, including especially the marked seasonality of the climatic variables (rain, wind and solar radiation). Detailed comparisons of adequate long-term data from tropical and temperate waters are still required.

J	Ibarra, DE; Egger, AE; Weaver, KL; Harris, CR; Maher, K				Ibarra, Daniel E.; Egger, Anne E.; Weaver, Karrie L.; Harris, Caroline R.; Maher, Kate			Rise and fall of late Pleistocene pluvial lakes in response to reduced evaporation and precipitation: Evidence from Lake Surprise, California	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Widespread late Pleistocene lake systems of the Basin and Range Province indicate substantially greater moisture availability during glacial periods relative to modern times, but the climatic factors that drive changes in lake levels are poorly constrained. To better constrain these climatic factors, we present a new lacustrine paleoclimate record and precipitation estimates for Lake Surprise, a closed basin lake in northeastern California. We combine a detailed analysis of lake hydrography and constitutive relationships describing the water balance to determine the influence of precipitation, evaporation, temperature, and seasonal insolation on past lake levels. At its maximum extent, during the last deglaciation, Lake Surprise covered 1366 km(2) (36%) of the terminally draining Surprise Valley watershed. Using paired radiocarbon and Th-230-U analyses, we dated shoreline tufa deposits from wave-cut lake terraces in Surprise Valley, California, to determine the hydrography of the most recent lake cycle. This new lake hydrograph places the highest lake level 176 m above the present-day playa at 15.19 +/- 0.18 calibrated ka (C-14 age). This significantly postdates the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), when Lake Surprise stood at only moderate levels, 65-99 m above modern playa, similar to nearby Lake Lahontan. To evaluate the climatic factors associated with lake-level changes, we use an oxygen isotope mass balance model combined with an analysis of predictions from the Paleoclimate Model Intercomparison Project 3 (PMIP3) climate model ensemble. Our isotope mass balance model predicts minimal precipitation increases of only 2%-18% during the LGM relative to modern, compared to an similar to 75% increase in precipitation during the 15.19 ka highstand. LGM PMIP3 climate model simulations corroborate these findings, simulating an average precipitation increase of only 6.5% relative to modern, accompanied by a 28% decrease in total evaporation driven by a 7 degrees C decrease in mean annual temperature. LGM PMIP3 climate model simulations also suggest a seasonal decoupling of runoff and precipitation, with peak runoff shifting to the late spring-early summer from the late winter-early spring. Our coupled analyses suggest that moderate lake levels during the LGM were a result of reduced evaporation driven by reduced summer insolation and temperatures, not by increased precipitation. Reduced evaporation primed Basin and Range lake systems, particularly smaller, isolated basins such as Surprise Valley, to respond rapidly to increased precipitation during late-Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1). Post-LGM highstands were potentially driven by increased rainfall during HS1 brought by latitudinally extensive and strengthened midlatitude westerly storm tracks, the effects of which are recorded in the region's lacustrine and glacial records. These results suggest that seasonal insolation and reduced temperatures have been under-investigated as long-term drivers of moisture availability in the western United States.					; Egger, Anne/OCL-3387-2025; Ibarra, Daniel/E-6141-2013; Maher, Kate/B-3489-2010	Egger, Anne/0000-0001-5686-4375; Ibarra, Daniel/0000-0002-9980-4599; Weaver, Karrie/0000-0002-7094-3501; Maher, Kate/0000-0002-5982-6064													0016-7606	1943-2674				NOV-DEC	2014	126	11-12					1387	1415		10.1130/B31014.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B31014.1													WOS:000343759600001
J	Algül, F; Beyhan, M				Algul, Fulya; Beyhan, Mehmet			Concentrations and sources of heavy metals in shallow sediments in Lake Bafa, Turkey	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The concentrations and sources of heavy metals in shallow sediments in Lake Bafa were investigated. The concentrations of nine heavy metals and the total organic carbon content in sediment samples were determined for between Summer 2015 and Spring 2016. The mean contents of heavy metals were in decreasing order Fe>Mn>Ni>Cr>Zn>Cu>Co>Pb>Cd. Sediment quality guidelines indicate that Cr, Cu, and Ni pose a considerable threat to the aquatic ecosystem in Lake Bafa. Site L3 was found to be contaminated with Cd, Cr, and Ni, and the pollution load indices suggest that these metals had anthropogenic sources. The sediment samples were notably enriched with Cd and Ni. There is no consistent trend for seasonal effect in terms of the sample locations. However, at all sampling points, an increase in heavy metal concentrations was observed in the autumn. The results of a multivariate analysis indicate that the sources of Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, and Zn were all natural, the sources of Cd were anthropogenic, and the sources of Ni and Cr were both anthropogenic and natural. These results highlight that Cd, Cr, and particularly Ni represent the most serious threat in terms of heavy metal pollution in the ecosystem of the lake.					; Beyhan, Mehmet/R-2051-2019	BEYHAN, MEHMET/0000-0003-2312-2249; 													2045-2322					JUL 16	2020	10	1								10.1038/s41598-020-68833-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-68833-2								32678245					WOS:000550057200095

Genomic Prediction Using Prior Quantitative Trait Loci Information Reveals a Large Reservoir of Underutilised Blackleg Resistance in Diverse Canola (Brassica napus L.) Lines	PLANT GENOME												Genomic prediction is becoming a popular plant breeding method to predict the genetic merit of lines. While some genomic prediction results have been reported in canola, none have been evaluated for blackleg disease. Here, we report genomic prediction for seedling emergence, survival rate, and internal infection), using 532 Spring and Winter canola lines. These lines were phenotyped in two replicated blackleg disease nurseries grown at Wickliffe and Green Lake, Victoria, Australia. A transcriptome genotyping-by-sequencing approach revealed 98,054 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) after quality control. We assessed various genomic prediction scenarios based on Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (GBLUP), BayesR and BayesRC, which can make use of prior quantitative trait loci information, via cross-validation. Clustering based on genomic relationships showed that Winter and Spring lines were genetically distinct, indicating limited gene flow between sets. Genetic correlations within traits between Spring and Winter lines ranged from 0.68 and 0.90 (mean = 0.76). Based on GBLUP in the whole population, moderate to high genomic prediction accuracies were achieved within environments (0.35-0.74) and were reduced across environments (0.28-0.58). Prediction accuracy within the Spring set ranged from 0.30-0.69, and from 0.19-0.71 within the Winter set. The BayesR model resulted in slightly lower accuracy to GBLUP. The proportion of genetic variance explained by known blackleg quantitative trait loci (QTL) was < 30%, indicating that there is a large reservoir of genetic variation in blackleg traits that remains to be discovered, but can be captured with genomic prediction. However, providing prior information of known QTL in the BayesRC method resulted in an increased prediction accuracy for survival and internal infection, particularly with Spring lines. Overall, these promising results indicate that genomic prediction will be a valuable tool to make use of all genetic variation to improve blackleg resistance in canola.					; Daetwyler, Hans/H-9775-2019; Fikere, Mulusew/AAB-7181-2019	Malmberg, Michelle/0000-0002-6351-5904; Koh, Joshua/0000-0002-3678-4789; , Mulusew Fikere/0000-0002-0404-7338; Daetwyler, Hans D/0000-0002-3018-3640; Cogan, Noel/0000-0003-1074-8998														1940-3372				JUL	2018	11	2							170100	10.3835/plantgenome2017.11.0100	http://dx.doi.org/10.3835/plantgenome2017.11.0100								30025024					WOS:000450929300012

Effects of reproductive timing and hatch date on fathead minnow recruitment	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Timing of reproduction can be an important determinant of recruitment success for fish in strongly seasonal environments, both for individuals hatching at different times over extended spawning seasons and for entire cohorts, if the spawning period is accelerated or delayed among years. To examine potential demographic consequences of delayed spawning, we staggered dates that fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) were introduced into experimental ponds in Alberta, Canada, by 3 weeks and compared growth and survival of offspring from early- and late-stocked fish. By autumn, size and mass were consistently greater in early-hatched minnows, regardless of cohort density. Size differences between treatments persisted through the second summer, which likely contributed to a higher proportion of early-hatched fish reaching sexual maturity as yearlings compared with late-hatched counterparts. Because late spawning can limit growth and subsequent maturation of progeny, temporal variability in reproductive timing should be considered when assessing recruitment potential of new year-classes.

Spatiotemporal variations of dissolved nitrous oxide concentrations in small water bodies in a typical urban landscape in eastern China	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Waters in urban landscape are susceptible to nitrogen (N) pollution, potentially leading to supersaturation of dissolved nitrous oxide (N2O) and making them a source of atmospheric N2O. However, the spatiotemporal variations and driving factors of dissolved N2O concentrations in these waters remain unclear. This study examined the spatiotemporal variations of dissolved N2O in an interconnected river-lake system in a subtropical urban landscape. The annual mean dissolved N2O concentration was 0.81 mu g N L-1, with a mean N2O saturation of 304 %, indicating the system could act as a N2O emitter. Under the influence of daily fluctuations in water temperature and DO, the diurnal variation of N2O was most pronounced in autumn, with the smallest amplitude observed in winter. Seasonal mean concentrations of dissolved N2O, N, phosphorus (P), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and dissolved oxygen (DO) peaked in winter and were lowest in summer. The central lake had significantly lower dissolved N2O, N and P concentrations, but possessed higher water temperature, pH, concentrations of Chl-a and DO than its upstream and downstream rivers. Dissolved N2O concentrations were positively correlated with concentrations of N and P, but negatively with pH, Chl-a, and DO. There was intensifying competition for N between the N2O producers and algae, particularly in summer or in the central lake area. Therefore, the spatiotemporal variations of dissolved N2O concentrations were primarily driven by the integrated effects of seasonal conditions, nutrient fluctuations and algal growth. This research can provide essential scientific guidance for developing the effective strategies to control N pollution and mitigate the risk of N2O emissions from water bodies in urban landscape.

Here, proven statistical downscaling methods are applied to relatively coarse-scale atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) output to improve the simulation and resolution of spatial and temporal variability in temperature and precipitation across the US Great Lakes region. The absolute magnitude of change expected over the coming century depends on the sensitivity of the climate system to human forcing and on the trajectory of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Annual temperatures in the region are projected to increase 1.4 +/- 0.6 degrees C over the near-term (2010-2039), by 2.0 +/- 0.7 degrees C under lower and 3 +/- 1 degrees C under higher emissions by midcentury (2040-2069), and by 3 +/- 1 degrees C under lower and 5.0 +/- 1.2 degrees C under higher emissions by end-of-century (2070-2099), relative to the historical reference period 1961-1990. Simulations also highlight seasonal and geographical differences in warming, consistent with recent trends. Increases in winter and spring precipitation of up to 20% under lower and 30% under higher emissions are projected by end-of-century, while projections for summer and fall remain inconsistent. Competing effects of shifting precipitation and warmer temperatures suggest little change in Great Lake levels over much of the century until the end of the century, when net decreases are expected under higher emissions. Overall, these projections suggest the potential for considerable changes to climate in the US Great Lakes region; changes that could be mitigated by reducing global emissions to follow a lower as opposed to a higher emissions trajectory over the coming century.

Bioavailable Nutrients (N and P) and Precipitation Patterns Drive Cyanobacterial Blooms in Missisquoi Bay, Lake Champlain	MICROORGANISMS												Anthropogenic activities release large amounts of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) nutrients into the environment. Sources of nutrients include surface and sub-surface runoffs from agricultural practices with the application of chemical fertilizers and manure as well as combined sewer overflows (CSOs). Nutrient runoffs contribute to the eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems and enhance the growth of cyanobacteria. Precipitation is an important driving force behind the runoff of nutrients from agricultural fields into surrounding water bodies. To understand the dynamics between nutrient input, precipitation and cyanobacterial growth in Missisquoi Bay, Lake Champlain (Quebec), one location in Pike River (a major tributary into the bay) and four locations in Missisquoi Bay were monitored from April to November in 2017 and 2018. Biweekly water samples were analyzed using chemical methods and high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. High concentrations of N and P were typically measured in April and May. Three major spikes in nutrient concentrations were observed in early and mid-summer as well as early fall, all of which were associated with intense cumulative precipitation events of 40 to 100 mm within 7 days prior to sampling. Despite the high concentrations of nutrients in the spring and early summer, the cyanobacterial blooms appeared in mid to late summer as the water temperature increased. Dolichospermum sp. was the major bloom-forming cyanobacterium during both summers. A second intense bloom event of Microcystis was also observed in the fall (October and November) for both years. Variation in the cyanobacteria population was strongly associated with inorganic and readily available fractions of N and P such as nitrites and nitrates (NOx), ammonia (NH3) and dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP). During blooms, total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and total particulate phosphorus (TPP) fractions had a substantial influence on total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations, respectively. The abundance of bacteria involved in the metabolism of nitrogen compared to that of phosphorus revealed the importance of nitrogen on overall microbial dynamics as well as CB formation in the bay. Our findings emphasize the combined influence of precipitation events, temperature and several bioavailable fractions of nitrogen and phosphorus on cyanobacterial bloom episodes.</p>					Tromas, Nicolas/MGB-4006-2025	Tromas, Nicolas/0000-0003-4332-8463; Celikkol, Sukriye/0000-0001-7231-4859														2076-2607				OCT	2021	9	10							2097	10.3390/microorganisms9102097	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9102097								34683418					WOS:000715454000001

However, in regions with complex terrain and significant rainfall variability, the limited number of rain gauge stations (RGS) is insufficient, and the spatial resolution of existing satellite precipitation data is too low to capture detailed precipitation patterns at the watershed scale. To address this issue, the downscaling of satellite precipitation products has become an effective method to obtain high-resolution precipitation data. This study proposes a monthly downscaling method based on a random forest model, aiming to improve the resolution of precipitation data in cloudy and rainy regions at mid-to-low latitudes. We combined the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform with a local Python environment, introducing cloud cover characteristics into traditional downscaling variables (latitude, longitude, topography, and vegetation index). The TRMM data were downscaled from 25 km to 1 km, generating high-resolution monthly precipitation data for the Dongting Lake Basin from 2001 to 2019. Furthermore, we analyzed the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of precipitation in the study area. The results show the following: (1) In cloudy and rainy regions, our method improves resolution and detail while maintaining the accuracy of precipitation data; (2) The response of monthly precipitation to environmental variables varies, with cloud cover characteristics contributing more to the downscaling model than vegetation characteristics, helping to overcome the lag effect of vegetation characteristics; and (3) Over the past 20 years, there have been significant seasonal trends in precipitation changes in the study area, with a decreasing trend in winter and spring (January-May) and an increasing trend in summer and autumn (June-December). These results indicate that the proposed method is suitable for downscaling monthly precipitation data in cloudy and rainy regions of the Dongting Lake Basin.					; peng, huanhua/GWZ-1376-2022	Peng, huanhua/0000-0003-1052-8557; Zhai, Jun/0000-0001-5272-1158; 														2072-4292				AUG	2024	16	16							2959	10.3390/rs16162959	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs16162959													WOS:001305215200001
J	Brown, ME; Morse, R; O'Neill, K				Brown, Meghan E.; Morse, Richard; O'Neill, Kerry			Spatial, seasonal, and diel distribution patterns of Hemimysis anomala in New York State's Finger Lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												With this contribution, we report on the continued and rapid spread of Hemimysis anomala (Crustacea, Mysidae) to inland waters of New York State within the Laurentian Great Lakes watershed. In the spring and summer of 2010, we detected Hemimysis at multiple locations in Seneca Lake, spanning the lake's 61 km length, and in the Seneca-Cayuga Canal, 7 km downstream of the canal's source at Seneca Lake. We did not detect Hemimysis in any of the other ten Finger Lakes. The pattern of range expansion suggests jump dispersal to Seneca Lake, followed by passive dispersal in the Seneca-Cayuga Canal. This range expansion highlights the potential of this emerging invader to spread throughout the New York State Canal system that links the Great Lakes with the Hudson River watershed and a number of large inland lakes via the Erie Canal and its tributaries. During our nighttime sampling campaign on Seneca Lake, densities of Hemimysis exceeding 2500 ind./m(3) were associated with littoral rocky structures, docks, and piers. At a reference site near the source of the Seneca-Cayuga Canal, we observed demographic shifts from an adult-dominated population in early spring to a juvenile-dominated population from late-spring to autumn. We also observed strong nocturnal behavior for all stages, with juveniles rising earlier than adults in the evening and remaining higher in the water column near dawn. These demographic and behavioral characteristics, combined with the extensive hydrogeographic network in the Great Lakes, contribute to the species rapid range expansion and the mechanism of its spread.

Taxonomic description of six species of pelagic, freshwater ciliates from the Order Choreotrichida collected from Lake Ontario, Canada	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Aloricate ciliates are essential members of the pelagic microbial foodweb and are easy to identify in samples, yet the taxonomic database is insufficient and many species have yet to be described. Individuals from the Phylum Ciliophora Doflein, 1901, Order Choreotrichida Small and Lynn, 1985 were collected from the epilimnion (upper 20m) of Lake Ontario in the spring, summer and autumn of 1990 and 1991. They were fixed and silver-stained. Here we describe the morphospecies of five species from the genus Rimostrombidium Jankowski, 1978: Rimostrombidium kyoskota n.sp., Rimostrombidium pentagrammum n.sp., Rimostrombidium trioeumekes n.sp., Rimostrombidium paravelox Kahl, 1932 n.comb., Rimostrombidium brachykinetum Krainer, 1995 and one from the genus Pelagostrobilidium Petz et al., 1995: Pelagostrobilidium limnospirale n.sp. Increasing the taxonomic database allows for a more detailed monitoring of the biodiversity and energy transfer within a system, which in turn can better inform ecosystem management decisions.

However, populations of this orchid have steadily shrunk due to orchid poaching in most of its habitats. By correlating data from micrometeorological stations that we installed in the cloud forest canopy at the study site, Yuanyang Lake (YYL) from 2017, we discovered the critical role of spring rainfall in triggering flowering and summer rainfall in promoting the growth of new bulbs. We found that rising temperatures and frequent drought events threaten orchid growth, potentially leading to pathogen infections. We climbed old-growth yellow cypresses to collect seed capsules of P. formosana for in vitro germination at YYL beginning in the autumn of 2018. Orchid plantlets were reintroduced to the study site in mid-August of 2022. However, the seedlings failed to survive the summer of 2023. This study is the first persistent monitoring of this rare orchid in the forest canopy of this old-growth cloud forest. Based on the result, we propose conservation strategies and directions for protecting this orchid on a regional scale. Our study highlights the mounting challenge to conservation efforts posed by global climate change.

MOLLUSK POPULATION OF A SUBARCTIC HYDROTHERMAL ECOSYSTEM IN WINTER	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												The structure of the mollusk population in a subarctic hydrothermal ecosystem in winter was studied from the example of Pymvashor area (Bolshezemelskaya tundra). Specific communities of the gastropod type with the simplified structure and low specific diversity against the high number of mollusks were revealed. The certain set of species dominating under specific environmental conditions (Lymnaea ovata, L. lagotis and L. fontinalis) of the territory studied is formed. The preservation of the activity of mollusks in hydroterms is characteristic at extremely low air temperatures (up to - 38 degrees C). They inhabit very limited space and are mainly restricted to algal and moss mats expanding in hot water. In the thermal springs studied, the sizes of Lymnaeidae were reduced as compared to those of other regions. In hydrothermal ecosystems of Northern Eurasia (the Cisurals, Lake Baikal, Kamchatka, and Chukotka), similar communities consisting of pulmonary mollusks of the families Lymnaeidae and Planorbidae are formed. The density and biomass of mollusk settlements in the thermal springs were very higher than those in usual streams of the tundra zone. In winter, mollusks of the thermal springs present the basic food resource for fishes feeding on benthos in the stream taking waters of hydrotherms.

The residue pattern in both resident and migratory birds was in the following order: PCBs > DDTs > HCHs > CHLs. OC concentrations in migratory birds varied, depending on the feeding habit. The maximum levels of OCs were found inpiscivores, followed by insectivores, omnivores, and herbivores. OC residue levels in Lake Baikal birds were lower than those in the Great Lakes region as well as in other lakes in Europe and Japan. Concentrations of HCHs and DDTs in most of the migratory birds collected in the spring were higher than for those collected in the autumn, indicating a notable accumulation in wintering grounds. Compilation and analysis of the available data in fish and birds from Asia suggested that the tropical and subtropical regions in south Asian countries may be a source of pollution for the wintering accumulation of migratory birds from Lake Baikal. Relatively higher compositions of alpha- and gamma-HCH in total HCHs, p,p'-DDT in total DDTs were observed in some migratory species, indicating recent exposure to HCHs and DDTs in Lake Baikal or wintering areas. PCB isomer patterns were different between residents and migrants,with the predominance of lower chlorinated congeners in migratory species, suggesting recent PCB accumulation in stopover sites during wintering. TEQ concentrations of toxic non- and mono-ortho coplanar PCBs in common terns from Lake Baikal were comparable to those reported in some species from Japan, the United States, and Europe. Relative contributions of non-ortho coplanar congeners to toxic equivalents (TEQs) were predominant, in which CB-126 accounted for the highest toxicity contribution. Estimated TEQ concentrations in the common tern from Lake Baikal exceeded the levels associated with enzyme induction in bald eagles. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study showing the seasonal variations of OC accumulation in the birds from Lake Baikal.

Patterns of residence and temperature selection in the thermal gradient were highly variable within and among seasons. Residence in the gradient and dispersion of body temperatures (Tb) decreased with increased ambient temperature, while selected temperatures and skewness of body temperature distributions were directly related to ambient temperature. The variability of responses and the apparent partitioning of thermal habitat among adult brown trout were also functions of sex, date and forage density. On an annual basis, brown trout selected a modal temperature of 12.degree. C, the reported optimum metabolic temperature for the species. The upper preferred temperature for adult brown trout in Lake Michigan [USA] is estimated to be 16.degree. C. Male and female trout often selected similar temperatures, but in late summer females selected 18.degree. C and demonstrated negative skewness while males selected 15.degree. C with high positive skewness. The reverse was true in Oct. when the selected temperature of males was 18.degree. C (females, 12.degree. C), and the distribution of male body temperatues was negatively skewed. Brown trough spent more time in the heated gradient during winter, spring and fall, resulting in high dispersions of body temperature compared to fish at ambient temperature. Thermal niche breadth (dispersion of Tb) of plume-resident fish was 3.5.degree. C on an annual basis, while the annual dispersion of water temperatures in ambient areas (Ta) was 4.1.degree. C. Over the short term (months), dispersion in Tb was considerably higher than dispersion in Ta.																			0378-1909	1573-5133					1983	8	2					137	149		10.1007/BF00005180	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00005180													WOS:A1983QV21400006
J	Heine, I; Jagdhuber, T; Itzerott, S				Heine, Iris; Jagdhuber, Thomas; Itzerott, Sibylle			Classification and Monitoring of Reed Belts Using Dual-Polarimetric TerraSAR-X Time Series	REMOTE SENSING												Synthetic aperture radar polarimetry (PolSAR) and polarimetric decomposition techniques have proven to be useful tools for wetland mapping. In this study we classify reed belts and monitor their phenological changes at a natural lake in northeastern Germany using dual-co-polarized (HH, VV) TerraSAR-X time series. The time series comprises 19 images, acquired between August 2014 and May 2015, in ascending and descending orbit. We calculated different polarimetric indices using the HH and VV intensities, the dual-polarimetric coherency matrix including dominant and mean alpha scattering angles, and entropy and anisotropy (normalized eigenvalue difference) as well as combinations of entropy and anisotropy for the analysis of the scattering scenarios. The image classifications were performed with the random forest classifier and validated with high-resolution digital orthophotos. The time series analysis of the reed belts revealed significant seasonal changes for the double-bounce-sensitive parameters (intensity ratio HH/VV and intensity difference HH-VV, the co-polarimetric coherence phase and the dominant and mean alpha scattering angles) and in the dual-polarimetric coherence (amplitude), anisotropy, entropy, and anisotropy-entropy combinations; whereas in summer dense leaves cause volume scattering, in winter, after leaves have fallen, the reed stems cause predominately double-bounce scattering. Our study showed that the five most important parameters for the classification of reed are the intensity difference HH-VV, the mean alpha scattering angle, intensity ratio HH/VV, and the coherence (phase). Due to the better separation of reed and other vegetation (deciduous forest, coniferous forest, meadow), winter acquisitions are preferred for the mapping of reed. Multi-temporal stacks of winter images performed better than summer ones. The combination of ascending and descending images also improved the result as it reduces the influence of the sensor look direction. However, in this study, only an accuracy of similar to 50% correct classified reed areas was reached. Whereas the shorelines with reed areas (>10 m broad) could be detected correctly, the actual reed areas were significantly overestimated. The main source of error is probably the challenging data geocoding causing geolocation inaccuracies, which need to be solved in future studies.

Epidemiology of squamous cell carcinomas in rudd Scardinius erythrophthalmus from SE Ireland	DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS												An epidemiological study was carried out to investigate the possible aetiology of squamous cell carcinomas which occur in a population of rudd Scardinius erythrophthalmus (L.) from Lough Aderry in south-east Ireland. A total of 1343 rudd were sampled from Lough Aderry and 2 nearby small lakes in spring, summer, autumn, and winter over 2 yr, 1986 to 1988. Fish were weighed, measured, sexed, aged, and examined for lesions. Water quality parameters and natural radioactivity were assessed as possible influencing factors in the disease. The prevalence of squamous cell carcinoma was 6.1% overall, with no significant difference between the lakes, seasons or years. Both male and female fish were affected, of ages from 1+ to 5+ yr. No fish of 6+ or 7+ yr was found with tumours, indicating that the neoplasm caused premature death. The female:male sex ratio of rudd with tumours was higher than that of healthy rudd overall, suggesting that males are more susceptible to the neoplasm. Of the parasites observed, Posthodiplostomum cuticola was common, but rarely found in rudd with tumours. Sphaerospora sp.was also common, but not in sufficient densities for statistical inference, and Argulus sp. was present on 7 fish. No viral particles were found. Natural radiation levels in the vicinity of the lakes were low. The lakes sampled are in an agricultural catchment, and the waters were eutrophic. While rudd are tolerant, it is likely that environmental conditions were stressful at least some of the time, with possible consequences for the immunocompetence of the rudd, The aetiology of the carcinoma is still unknown, but the possibilities of carcinogenic compounds resulting from the high nutrient levels, or of carcinogenic algal toxins produced during algal blooms, should be examined.

NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Lake Ellesmere, Canterbury, a large coastal lake is mechanically opened to the sea at predetermined water levels. The lake maintains important customary and commercial eel (Anguilla spp.) and flatfish (Rhombosolea spp.) fisheries, although the harvest of flatfish varies considerably between years. The three main flatfish species (black flounders Rhombosolea retiaria, sand flounders R. plebia and yellowbelly flounders R. leporina) recruit in spring, grow rapidly within the lake, and reach the minimum commercial size within two or three years. Maturing fish endeavour to leave the lake to spawn at sea during summer and autumn. There is a weak association between commercial catches and lake openings lagged by two years, but strong associations between catches in the lake and in the Canterbury Bight. The high interannual variability in abundance partly reflects timing and duration of lake openings, the opportunity of maturing fish to emigrate to sea, and the strength of regional recruitment.																			0028-8330					DEC	2011	45	4					575	589		10.1080/00288330.2011.560166	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.2011.560166													WOS:000299424600002

The socioeconomic and ecological problems attributed to the shrinking of the Aral Sea in Central Asia are notable concerns within the international community. In this study, the characteristics of salt dust aerosols from the Aral Sea were analysed to explore their interannual variation characteristics and analyse the spatial and temporal distributions of salt dust sources and transport and dispersion pathways. The results revealed that high concentrations of salt dust aerosols were concentrated around the Aral Sea and Lake Sarekamesh. The range and intensity of salt dust aerosols were less than those of dust aerosols. Salt dust events occurred frequently in spring and less frequently in autumn and winter. The occurrence frequency and impact range of salt dust aerosols from 2008 to 2012 were significantly lower than those during the previous period. From 2013 to 2018, the salt dust sources originated largely on the western side of the North Aral Sea. The spatial autocorrelation of salt dust aerosols was high and characterized by significant agglomeration, with significant changes in cold spot and hotspot regions. Salt dust in the Aral Sea region affects mainly the Kazakhstan region in spring, and it more notably affects Russia in winter. The results of this study increase the understanding of the spatial and temporal variability in salt dust aerosols within the arid zone of Central Asia and lay a foundation for the study of the impacts of salt dust aerosols on the climate system and ecological environment in arid zones.																			2045-2322					JAN 23	2025	15	1							3002	10.1038/s41598-025-86880-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-86880-5								39849011					WOS:001405681100018

Herein we examined spatial and temporal patterns of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), and seven other heavy metals from 16 lakes experiencing a gradient of human disturbance. These lakes were divided among six groups: suburban reservoirs (SR), suburban high-aquaculture lakes (SH), suburban low-aquaculture lakes (SL), suburban noaquaculture lakes (SN), urban aquaculture lakes (UA) and urban no-aquaculture lakes (UN). Spatially, water-column concentrations of Cd, Ni, Co, Mn, Fe, and Al, and sediment concentrations of Ni were significantly lower in SR compared to other lake groups. Except for Al, heavy metal concentrations did not differ between SN and SL lakes in the water-column or sediments. SH lakes exhibited significantly greater concentrations of Cu, Co, Cr, Mn, and Al in the water-column and Zn in sediments compared to SN lakes. UA lakes contained significantly lower concentrations of Zn, Cd, and Al in sediment compared to UN lakes, though no significant differences were detected within water column samples. Temporally, with all lake groups combined, summer water-column concentrations of Cd, Pb, Co, Mn, and Al were lower compared to spring and autumn. Additionally, summer sediment concentrations of Zn, As, Co, Fe also were lower compared to autumn. Further results indicated that low-density fish stockings without external feed inputs appeared to have little impact on heavy metals in both suburban and urban lakes. However, high-density fish stockings with external feed inputs were associated with increased heavy-metal concentrations across all lakes. Overall, urbanization has great potential to increase sediment heavy-metal ecological risks. These findings are crucial for developing heavy-metal pollution control and management strategies for freshwater lakes.					wang, rui/JAC-6240-2023														0048-9697	1879-1026				MAY 10	2022	820								153368	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153368	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153368		JAN 2022						35077782					WOS:000766808300006
J	HAYNES, JM				HAYNES, JM			MOVEMENTS OF PACIFIC SALMON IN LAKE-ONTARIO IN SPRING AND SUMMER - EVIDENCE FOR WIDE DISPERSAL	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												To determine spring and summer movements of Pacific salmon in Lake Ontario, 16 coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and 7 chinook (O. tshawytischa) salmon were radiotagged and tracked in 1984. Salmon dispersed widely along shore and throghout Lake Ontario, moving as far as 33 km/d and 500 km in 4 months. Salmon generally did not occupy near shore regions after temperature exceeded 9-10 C, except where winds produced upwellings of cold water near shore in summer. There were no significant difference in distances moved, movement rates or average temperatures occupied by coho (4.0 .+-. 2.2 km/d, 0.62 .+-. 0.48 km/h; 9.3 .+-. 2.1 C) and chinook (3.2 .+-. 2.7 km/d, 0.48 .+-. 0.04 km/h, 11.1 .+-. 1.9 C). Coho moved nearer to shore and occupied surface waters (r = 0.86) more often than chinook (r = 0.47), Temperatures when salmon were last found were significantly higher for chinook (12.3 .+-. 2.4 C) than for coho (9.7 .+-. 2.0 C). However, averaged over species, differences between average (10.1 .+-. 2.1 C) and last observed (10.7 .+-. 2.5 C) temperatures were not significant. Movement and temperature data indicate that Pacific salmon in Lake Ontario use wide geographic and temperature ranges in spring and summer.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				JUN	1986	3	3					289	297		10.1080/02705060.1986.9665120	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1986.9665120													WOS:A1986C646700001

The Lagrangian probability density functions were used to estimate the connectivity at a time scale of up to 30 days, and real drifting buoys were used to adjust the horizontal dispersion coefficients in the numerical model. In case i), the horizontal dispersion was similar between both seasons; only at the beginning during the first week was slightly different, but after day 10 and forward, they were alike due to the lake's small size. With respect to the vertical dispersion, the particles remain above 10 m deep during summer and travel along the total water column during winter, mainly from 10-20 m. For case ii), the horizontal dispersion was similar between both seasons. However, the vertical dispersion was inhibited by the thermal stratification during summer, where the particles do not reach depths above 20 m. In winter, the dispersion was more intense, and around day 3 they reached the total water column.																			0016-7169	2954-436X				OCT 1	2025	64	4								10.22201/igeof.2954436xe.2025.64.4.1874	http://dx.doi.org/10.22201/igeof.2954436xe.2025.64.4.1874													WOS:001590041000002
J	Brown, BB; Santos, S; Ocampo-Peñuela, N				Brown, Barbara B.; Santos, Sabrina; Ocampo-Penuela, Natalia			Bird-window collisions: Mitigation efficacy and risk factors across two years	PEERJ												Background. Research on bird-window collision mitigation is needed to prevent up to a billion bird fatalities yearly in the U.S. At the University of Utah campus (Salt Lake City, Utah, USA), past research documented collisions, especially for Cedar Waxwings (Bombycilla cedrorum) drawn to fruiting ornamental pears in winter. Mirrored windows, which have a metallic coating that turns window exteriors into mirrors, had frequent collisions, which were mitigated when Feather Friendly (R) bird deterrent markers were applied. Bird-friendly windows-ORNILUX (R) ultraviolet (UV) and fitted windows-also reduced collisions when data were collected across fall and winter. Extending this prior research, we evaluated additional mitigation and tested the replicability of effects for pear trees, mirrored windows, and bird-friendly windows across two years. Methods. Using published data from eight buildings monitored for collisions in year 1 (Fall and Winter, 2019-2020), we added another year of monitoring, Fall and Winter, 2020-2021. Between years, Feather Friendly (R) mitigation markers were added to collision-prone areas of two buildings, including both mirrored and transparent windows. Results. The two buildings that received new Feather Friendly (R) mitigation had significantly fewer collisions post-mitigation. Control areas also had nonsignificant decline in collisions. The interaction of area (mitigation vs. control) by time (year 1 vs. 2) was significant, based on generalized estimating equations (GEE). The total yearly collisions across all eight buildings declined from 39 to 23. A second GEE analysis of all 8 buildings showed that mirrored windows, pear trees, and bird-friendly windows were each significant when analyzed separately. The best-fit model showed more collisions for mirrored windows and fewer collisions for bird-friendly windows. We found pear tree proximity to be related to more collisions in winter than fall. In addition, pear trees showed reduced collisions from year 1 to 2, consistent with new mitigation for two of three buildings near pear trees. Discussion. Feather Friendly (R) markers can mitigate collisions with transparent windows, not only mirrored windows, compared to unmitigated areas over 2 years. Results also underscore the dangers of pear tree proximity and mirrored windows and the efficacy of bird-friendly windows. Thus, bird collisions can be prevented by window mitigation, permanent bird-friendly windows, and landscape designs that avoid creating ecological traps.					; Ocampo-Peñuela, Natalia/X-2458-2019; Santos, SABRINA/KVD-9956-2024	Ocampo-Penuela, Natalia/0000-0002-5120-7226; 													2167-8359					JUL 28	2021	9								e11867	10.7717/peerj.11867	http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.11867								34395093					WOS:000678775600006

For regional water environment agencies and researchers, remote sensing offers a cost-effective alternative to traditional in-situ water sampling methods. In this study, we designed a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on AlexNet to represent the relationship between Sentinel-2 images and in situ water quality levels of Lake Dianchi from November 2020 to April 2023. The model incorporated an algal bloom extraction algorithm and utilized correlation analysis, redundancy analysis (RDA), and random forest (RF) method to establish connections between two environmental factors: water quality and meteorology, to the area of algal bloom (AAB). The findings revealed an improvement in Lake Dianchi's water quality, with Levels A (good water quality) and B (mildly polluted water quality) averaging 1.24% and 84.28%, respectively. Starting in October 2022, water quality stabilized at Level B, averaging at 98.17%. Seasonal variations demonstrated the best water quality in spring and the worst in summer (Level C, severely polluted water quality, accounting for 5.19% and 21.68%, respectively). Algal bloom presence was minimally observed, with an average AAB value of 1.75%, peaking in autumn (4.05%) and hitting a low in winter (0.38%). A significant correlation was identified between water quality levels and AAB, with a notable spatial trend of decreasing Level C water quality and AAB from north to south, featuring lower AAB in the Southern Waihai compared to the Central Waihai. Statistical analysis pinpointed total phosphorus (TP) as the dominant factor influencing AAB, while meteorological factors such as wind speed (WS), relative humidity (RH), and precipitation (PP) playing secondary roles. Despite fluctuations in TP concentration, a recent stabilization at 0.05 mg/L suggests a positive trajectory for future algal bloom management in Lake Dianchi.

Hydroacoustic Surveys Underestimate Yellow Perch Population Abundance: The Importance of Considering Habitat Use	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												When estimating fish population abundance, it is important to recognize that differing habitat use may cause one gear type to be more effective and less biased than another. We generated and compared population abundance estimates (PE) for adult Yellow Perch Perca flavescens in Crystal Lake, Wisconsin using a spring mini-fyke net mark-recapture survey and summer hydroacoustic surveys. Mean PE from the spring mark-recapture survey was 11,051 adult Yellow Perch (95% confidence limits of 9,878 and 12,541). This mean was 4.0-8.5 times greater than the range of mean summer hydroacoustic estimates (mean +/- 95% CI = 1,291 +/- 312 and 2,912 +/- 703). Due to Yellow Perch spawning behavior, we assumed that the spring mark-recapture survey sampled the entire adult population, while summer hydroacoustics sampled the postspawn pelagic component. Using the mean of all hydroacoustic surveys (PE = 2,492; n = 5), we estimated that approximately 22% of adult Yellow Perch selected for pelagic habitats postspawn. Our study emphasizes the importance of evaluating gear bias and has implications for future assessments, particularly when the target species may exhibit multiple habitat preferences within a lake.					; Hrabik, Thomas/GYA-2566-2022; Mrnak, Joseph/ABH-1130-2020	Mrnak, Joseph/0000-0003-0909-7390; Sikora, Logan/0000-0001-7479-3814; Sass, Greg/0000-0002-9100-7421													0275-5947	1548-8675				AUG	2021	41	4					1079	1087		10.1002/nafm.10605	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10605		APR 2021											WOS:000643569800001
J	Stottlemyer, R; Toczydlowski, D				Stottlemyer, R; Toczydlowski, D			Seasonal change in precipitation, snowpack, snowmelt, soil water and streamwater chemistry, northern Michigan	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												We have studied weekly precipitation, snowpack, snowmelt, soil water and streamwater chemistry throughout winter for over a decade in a small (176 ha) northern Michigan watershed with high snowfall and vegetated by 60 to 80 year-old northern hardwoods. In this paper, we examine physical, chemical, and biological processes responsible for observed seasonal change in streamwater chemistry based upon intensive study during winter 1996-1997. The objective was to define the contributions made to winter and spring streamwater chemical concentration and flux by processes as snowmelt, over-winter forest floor and surface soil mineralization, immobilization, and exchange, and subsurface flowpath. The forest floor and soils were unfrozen beneath the snowpack which permitted most snowmelt to enter. Over-winter soil mineralization and other biological processes maintain shallow subsurface ion and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) reservoirs. Small, but steady, snowmelt throughout winter removed readily mobilized soil NO3- which resulted in high over-winter streamwater concentrations but little flux. Winter soil water levels and flowpaths were generally deep which increased soil water and streamwater base cation (C-B), HCO3-, and Si concentrations. Spring snowmelt increased soil water levels and removal of ions and DOC from the biologically active forest floor and shallow soils. The snowpack solute content was a minor component in determining streamwater ion concentration or flux during and following peak snowmelt. Exchangeable ions, weakly adsorbed anions, and DOC in the forest floor and surface soils dominated the chemical concentration and flux in soil water and streamwater. Following peak snowmelt, soil microbial immobilization and rapidly increased plant uptake of limiting nutrients removed nearly all available nitrogen from soil water and streamwater. During the growing season high evapotranspiration increased subsurface flowpath depth which in turn removed weathering products, especially C-B, HCO3-, and Si, from deeper soils. Soil water was a major component in the hydrologic and chemical budgets.

Interactions of water levels with water quality, endemic waterbirds, and invasive species in a shallow, tropical pond	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This study responds to a need for baseline physical and chemical data in shallow tropical water bodies. We investigated the degree to which water level fluctuations affected water quality and biota in a shallow tropical pond, Kelia Pond National Wildlife Refuge in Hawaii. We observed strong interactions among climate, water levels, salinity, DO, turbidity, waterbirds, fish, and invertebrates. Seasonal precipitation and air temperature patterns led to higher pond levels in winter and lower pond levels in summer. Low water levels in summer were associated with very high salinity and turbidity, and low DO. Endemic waterbirds were favored by lower water levels. Extremely low DO concentrations at minimum water levels caused fish die-offs, primarily non-native tilapia. The fish die-offs temporarily resulted in lower turbidities, clearer water, and a large increase in invertebrates, specifically a native rotifer but also a non-native chironomid midge. Nuisance emergences of midge only occurred in winters following summer fish die-offs but only if there was sufficient winter streamflow to lower salinity and create brackish conditions in the pond. The study results were used to assess restoration and management options to promote endemic waterbirds and other natives and suppress invasive species.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2019	829	1					77	93		10.1007/s10750-017-3401-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-017-3401-2													WOS:000456178700007

The model is tuned to match steady state experimental test results, and validated with transient experimental results. Further simulations were performed using a modeled thermal storage system, and integrating the CHP system into a building model to evaluate the feasibility of the CHP system in the mid-Atlantic region as well as the Great Lakes region. The transient simulation outputs are within 4.8% of experimental results for identical load profiles during a simulated summer week, and within 2.2% for a spring or autumn week. When integrated with a building model, the results show 21% cost savings on energy in the mid-Atlantic region, and 27% savings in the Great Lakes region. Moreover, energy cost analysis is conducted to investigate the economic effect of CHP systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

If different seasons, the phytoplankton responded to different environmental factors. During spring, the abundance of SRP (soluble reactive phosphorus) and existence of a certain thermal stability resulted in the development of a greater biomass in some lakes. During summer, however, excessively high temperatures adversely affected the communities of the warmer lakes. At the species level, the responses were diverse; ordination techniques enabled us to group them. Some similarities were observed in phytoplankton composition between lakes, possibly due to local dispersion between adjacent lakes (frequented by abundant waterfowl).

Between January 1983 and December 1987, nine sites were in operation. The present paper presents an analysis of the observed concentrations. The highest air concentrations of SO42-, NO3- and NH4+, SO2 and HNO3 were observed at Longwoods in southern Ontario, with medians of daily values equal to 6.7, 1.8, 1.6, 3.7 and 1.1-mu-g m-3, respectively. The lowest median daily concentrations were observed at Bay d'Espoir, Newfoundland, for SO2 and NH4+, and at Cree Lake, Saskatchewan, for SO42-, NO3- and NH4+. The concentrations were equal to 0.20, 0.09, 0.72, 0.03 and 0.06-mu-g m-3, respectively. A strong and statistically significant annual cycle existed for the SO2 daily concentrations at all sites. They were highest in winter and lowest in summer. A weaker and more complex annual cycle was also present in the SO42-, NO3-, NH4+ and HNO3 daily air concentrations. They were not statistically significant for some ion and site combinations. Gaseous SO2 generally exceeded particulate SO42- on a molar basis except during the summer months at all sites with the exception of Bay d'Espoir, where the latter dominated during all the year. On average, gaseous HNO3 dominated particulate NO3- except for the autumn to spring months at Longwoods, Kejimkujik and Bay d'Espoir. SO42-/NH4+ molar ratios varied between 0.3 and 3. The lowest values were observed at Longwoods and Sutton, and the highest at Cree Lake and Bay d'Espoir. In molar units, NH4+ concentrations were between 1 and 100 times larger than the NO3- concentrations. The NO3-/NH4+ molar ratios were highest at Longwoods and lowest at Cree Lake. Total SO42- (SO2 + SO42-) concentrations were, in molar units, between 2 and 20 times larger than the total NO3- (HNO3 + NO3-) concentrations.																			0004-6981					MAR	1992	26	4					593	607		10.1016/0960-1686(92)90172-H	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0960-1686(92)90172-H													WOS:A1992HD02900008

Mixing of the deeper waters occurred several times throughout the summer in 1982 but not in 1981. The water at 10 m became anoxic for only 2 wk in late July in 1982. In contrast, in 1981, the water at 10 m became anoxic at the beginning of July and remained so until mid-Sept. The phytoplankton dynamics observed in 1982 did not follow the typical progression from spring diatoms to summer species adapted to survive under stratified conditions, as in 1981. Diatoms were present throughout the summer in higher amounts in 1982 than in 1981. The most obvious difference in the 2 summers was the much greater abundance of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae in 1982. Other blue-green algae including Microcystis aeruginosa, Gomphosphaeria lacustris and Lyngbya birgei appeared earlier on in 1982, but did not immediately increase in abundance as in 1981. In 1982, rates of phytoplankton community change were low in May and June, and increases were observed in mid-July, early August, late August and late Sept. In contrast, in 1981, the rate of community change increased in late May, mid-June, early July and late July, and remained low throughout Aug. and Sept.																			0142-7873	1464-3774					1984	6	4					699	713		10.1093/plankt/6.4.699	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/6.4.699													WOS:A1984SZ52900012

Italy)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In 1996, we studied the phytoplankton seasonal succession in Lago Maggiore (N. Italy) through weekly sampling. Such a frequency enabled us to evaluate the changes of the phytoplankton assemblage in the light of the equilibrium and non-equilibrium theories. The distinct phases of changing of the species composition were identified separating the samples by means of cluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). We recognised well distinct phytoplankton associations, whose seasonal succession followed a clear cyclic path throughout the year, with spring and summer phases respectively characterised by a rapid turn-over of the assemblages and by a relative stability. Moreover, we observed an increase of species number and Shannon-Wiener diversity during the spring, followed by a summer decline of the diversity in spite of an unchanged species number. Because of the dominance of the same few species for about two months during summer, coupled with small fluctuations of the total biomass, we could identify the summer assemblage as a steady state assemblage. The aim of the present contribution, although describing the whole seasonal succession, is to draw the attention towards the species composition at the steady state, taking into account the functional properties of the species involved. The possible role of the metalimnetic niche in selecting a particular summer assemblage in deep and large lakes will be discussed.

J	Guo, JY; Zhou, Y; Zhang, BY; Zhang, JB				Guo, Junyu; Zhou, Ying; Zhang, Boya; Zhang, Jianbo			Distribution and evaluation of the fate of cyclic volatile methyl siloxanes in the largest lake of southwest China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Cyclic volatile methyl siloxanes (cVMS) used in personal care products are released to aquatic environments through wastewater effluent. cVMS are persistent, toxic, bioaccumulative, and have potential to cause ecological harm. In this study, the environmental behavior of octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4), decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5) and dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane (D6) were evaluated in the largest lake of southwest China, Dian Lake. Air, water and sediment samples were measured for three cVMS compounds in the winter (January) and summer (July) of 2017. In air, D5 exhibited the highest measured mean concentration among the three cVMS, which were 18.4 +/- 8.0 ng.m(-3) in winter and 5.78 +/- 3.61 ng.m(-3) in summer. In water and sediment, D6 was the cVMS with the highest measured mean concentration. The mean concentrations in water of D6 were 20.8 +/- 5.8 ng.L-1 in winter and 20.4 +/- 5.8 ng.L-1 in summer. The mean concentrations in sediment of D6 were 281 +/- 45.8 ng.g(-1) dw in winter and 270 +/- 31.3 ng.g(-1) dw in summer. A fugacity-based mass balance chemical fate model for lakes (QWASI) was used for Dian Lake to compare measurements and explore the behavior of cVMS. D6 was predicted to have the highest water column and sediment concentrations. Modeling results showed that most of the D5 and D6 partitioned into sediment and could persist for several years. Persistence was significantly influenced by the high rate of sediment burial. In an analysis of the impact of physicochemical properties and environmental parameters, K-OC was identified as a key parameter for predicting cVMS behavior. This study illustrates the importance of cVMS in sediments and the potential aquatic risk that they may pose. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A comparison of phytoplankton communities of the deep chlorophyll layers and epilimnia of the Laurentian Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Phytoplankton biomass and primary productivity within Great Lakes deep chlorophyll layers (DCL) remain largely uninvestigated. Consequently, the taxonomic makeup of DCL phytoplankton communities, as well as the mechanisms regulating their formation and maintenance, is poorly understood. We examined 6 years of phytoplankton compositional characteristics of Great Lakes summer DCL and epilimnetic communities as well as spring communities from isothermal water columns. DCLs were regularly observed during summer stratification in all lakes with the frequent exception of Lake Erie. Relative compositions of summer chlorophyte and cryptophyte assemblages were not different between the epilimnion and DCL, but DCL phytoplankton communities from other algal groups were distinct from their epilimnetic counterparts and comprised an integration of phytoplankton from the overlying epilimnetic assemblages and relict taxa characteristic of spring. Summer epilimnetic communities were characterized by higher abundances of cyanophytes, and centric diatom communities were dominated by Cyclotella sense lato (i.e. species within Cyclotella and closely related genera). Cyclotella species exhibited distinct patterns of vertical distribution, with small-bodied taxa being partitioned heavily into the epilimnion, while larger-bodied forms tended to occupy the DCL. Vertical size partitioning was exemplified by larger mean individual cell sizes in epilimnetic siliceous algae (diatoms and chrysophytes) in the DCL compared to the epilimnion, while the opposite pattern was exhibited by cyanophytes. These findings demonstrate the importance of stratification intensity to vertical structuring of summer phytoplankton communities and imply that changing stratification regimes (such as that due to recent climate change) may exert profound effects on Great Lakes primary producer communities.

Analysis of the seasonal dynamics of river phytoplankton based on succession rate indices for key event identification	HYDROBIOLOGIA					7th International Symposium on Use of Algae for Monitoring Rivers	NOV 23-25, 2009	LUXEMBOURG	Fonds Natl Rech (FNR)				The seasonal dynamics of river phytoplankton was analyzed using succession rate indices based on data collected from year-round observations of two small plain rivers in the Upper Ob Basin (Western Siberia). The study revealed a generally clear seasonal pattern of structural changes in the phytoplankton of the lower reaches of the studied rivers. The dynamics of succession rate indices reflects the key events in the life of phytoplankton in the Bolshaya Losikha and Barnaulka Rivers, showing mainly changes in the dominant species during the main phases of the hydrological cycle. The most significant changes in phytoplankton structure tend to occur in the period between the spring flood decline and the beginning of summer-autumn low water. These changes coincide with the most drastic changes in both environmental conditions and phytoplankton successional stages. Use of succession rate indices to analyze the seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton allowed us to distinguish between periods of abrupt change and periods of comparatively low-intensity changes in plankton composition in small lowland temperate rivers.					; Romanov, Roman/A-3686-2013	Romanov, Roman/0000-0002-6137-3586; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				OCT	2012	695	1					293	304		10.1007/s10750-012-1198-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1198-6													WOS:000307310000023

During fall/winter of 2005 and spring 2006, H5N1 virus spread rapidly over Asia, Europe, and Africa. One hypothesis for the global patterns and dynamics of the spread of H5N1 virus is that seasonally migratory wild waterbirds may carry the virus and spread it along migratory flyways. Since 2007, Tens of waterbirds had been marked with GPS transmitters to get the migration tracks in Qinghai Lake. Satellite remote sensing is a useful tool to help analyzing the birds' GPS tracks. In this paper, we take advantage of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor images to study the birds' migration patens. How to process and use the massive remote sensing images efficiently across computer cluster is discussed detailedly. At last, land surface temperature and cloud coverage information are obtained and used to study the wild birds' migration.					zhang, haiming/JPL-9286-2023														2165-4999		978-1-4799-3046-3				2013							46	50		10.1109/ICNDC.2013.34	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICNDC.2013.34													WOS:000364963200011
J	Holzschuh, JA; Deutschlander, ME				Holzschuh, Jennalee A.; Deutschlander, Mark E.			Do migratory warblers carry excess fuel reserves during migration for insurance or for breeding purposes?	AUK												Migration is energetically costly, and many passerines prepare for and maintain migration with hyperphagia and increased fuel or fat reserves. During spring migration, as they approach their breeding grounds, passerines may deposit fat in excess of what is needed to complete migration. Individuals may carry excess fuel reserves as insurance against potentially poor environmental conditions in early spring (insurance hypothesis). If this is true, individuals arriving early at northern stopover locations or their breeding grounds should have greater energy reserves than later arrivals. Alternatively, passerines may arrive in spring with excess fat to help offset the demands of breeding (breeding performance hypothesis). Given the energetic requirements of egg production, females may arrive with greater reserves than males if excess fat directly or indirectly offsets breeding costs. We analyzed the energetic condition of 12 warbler species mist-netted during migration from 1999 to 2012 at Braddock Bay Bird Observatory, Monroe County, New York, USA. This northern stopover location is near the breeding range (in relation to total migratory distance) for most of the parulid species we examined and, therefore, is a likely location to show carryover effects between migration and breeding. In 11 of the 12 species, energetic condition was greater in the spring than in the fall for both sexes; and in all 12 species, condition was greater in females than in males in both seasons. Contrary to the insurance hypothesis, condition increased with arrival date for most species during spring migration. Although better condition in females supports the breeding performance hypothesis, the presence of this difference in both seasons suggests that additional factors influence energetic condition in parulids. Given that males arrive in better condition in the spring than when they depart in the fall, individuals of both sexes may carry excess energy reserves during spring migration to potentially use for reproductive efforts.																			0004-8038	1938-4254				JUL	2016	133	3					459	469		10.1642/AUK-15-141.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1642/AUK-15-141.1													WOS:000379663400011
J	Bjelke, U; Bohman, IM; Herrmann, J				Bjelke, U; Bohman, IM; Herrmann, J			Temporal niches of shredders in lake littorals with possible implications on ecosystem functioning	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Temporal growth separation of shredders is known in streams but has not been reported from lakes. In the present study, temporal niche/trait differentiations among shredders in lakes were investigated. We sampled quantitatively three lakes in SE Sweden over a period of 18 months. Dry weight and number of individuals of the collected shredders were measured monthly. Standing stock of detritus types was also monitored. The same 10 species of lentic shredders were found in each lake, one isopod and larvae of nine trichopterans. Functionally, the shredders could be categorized into two main groups; winter and summer growing species. However, also within these groups, temporal differences in growth pattern existed. The main input of detritus occurred during the autumnal leaf fall and a majority of winter shredders had the start of their lives tied to this period. A succession in loss of detritus types was evident with easily degraded matter disappearing first followed by more resistant matter. Shredder species richness, shredder biomass per m(2) and the ratio coarse/fine detritus all reached its annual low in late summer. We propose a temporal link between the shredder groups and the organic matter subject to decomposition; the successive palatability of coarse detritus is likely to make a temporally separated community of shredders efficient in terms of decomposition. We believe that a temporal differentiation per se is sufficient to conclude that different impact on ecosystem function exists among shredders. Additionally we discuss impacts of differences in abundance and shredding capacity among the species.																			1386-2588	1573-5125					2005	39	1					41	53		10.1007/s10452-004-3524-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-004-3524-1													WOS:000229073300004

Three depths along three transects in this locality were sam-pled in spring and autumn of 2015. We recorded 25 taxa of macrozoobenthos belonging to eight classes: Turbellaria, Oligochaeta, Hirudinea, Gastropoda, Bivalvia, Amphipoda, Isopoda and Insecta. Seasonal changes (temperature, light availability, food availability and habitat conditions) as well as anthropogenic impacts affect macrozoobenthos communities. It was established that the density of communities is higher in autumn than in spring. Three species out of the 25 registered taxa were recorded with significantly higher densities: Dreissena carinata (14400 ind./m(2)), Gammarus triacanthus prespensis (4950 ind./m(2)) and Pyrgohydrobia prespaensis (4425 ind./m(2)). The results could contribute in obtaining a better under-standing of the vertical and horizontal distribution, seasonal fluctuations in the population densities and the general state of the benthic fauna of this locality of high conservational importance.																			0324-0770					SEP	2024	76	3																						WOS:001334725600012

This study explored the relationship between normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and seasonal climate elements in the Wuliangsu Lake Basin area from 1990 to 2020, and quantified the impacts of human activities on vegetation dynamics. We used Landsat series data to analyze the spatial and temporal variation of the NDVI using the trend analysis method, the Theil-Sen median, the Mann-Kendall test, and the Hurst index. Then, we used meteorological data and land use data to quantify the effects of human activities using residual analysis, and correlation methods to determine the driving forces of NDVI variations. The results showed that the NDVI changes presented obvious regional characteristics, with a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest in Wuliangsu Lake Basin. Due to global warming, the start of the growing season (SOS) is 4.3 days (2001 to 2010) and 6.8 days (2011 to 2020) earlier compared with 1990 to 2000. The end of the season (EOS) is advanced by 3.6 days (2001 to 2010), and delayed by 8.9 days (2011 to 2020). Seasonal (spring, summer, autumn, and winter) NDVIs with precipitation and temperature show spatial heterogeneity. Further, changes in grasslands and woodlands were vulnerable to climate change and human activities. Since the beginning of the 21st century, human activity was the driving force for vegetation improvement in the Dengkou, west-central, north and southwest regions, where ecological instability is weak. This finding can provide a theoretical basis for the implementation of the same type of ecological restoration projects and the construction of ecological civilization, and contribute to the regional green and sustainable development.

Food quality for profundal zoobenthos, as indicated by the concentrations of long-chain polyunsaturated FA, omega3 FA, or eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in sediment and sedimenting matter, was highest in spring and autumn and markedly lower in summer. Surficial sediment was consistently lower in all FA than was sedimenting matter. Palmitoleic acid (16:1 omega7) was the dominating FA in both sedimenting matter and sediment. In fauna samples, EPA, palmitic acid (16:0), palmitoleic acid, and vaccenic acid (18:1 omega7) were among the dominant FA. Docosahexaenoic acid was found only in the predators Chaoborus and Procladius. Differences between functional feeding guilds were found for the diatom-indicating FA palmitoleic acid and the bacteria-specific FA isoseptadecanoic acid (17:0iso). Furthermore, principal components analysis showed marked differences in FA composition among taxa. These differences reflect the relative contribution of food from autotrophic (phytoplankton production) and heterotrophic sources (detrital food web) in profundal invertebrate taxa.

We assumed that transition of the meandering channel into 5 active parallel anastomozing channels with different morphometric parameters, macrophyte cover and flow rate, causes variations in plankton parameters. Our results showed that parallel channels despite of a similar water quality differed in plankton parameters (species composition, number of species, total biomass and Shannon index). Our results also confirmed that in the anastomozing section of the Narew River species composition of zooplankton changes more than that of phytoplankton. In this section there was observed an increase of contribution of littoral rotifers and crustaceans. At the same time, in phytoplankton the main dominant from summer to autumn was typical planktonic species Planktothrix agardhii. P. agardhii creates toxic water blooms in a shallow hypertrophic Siemianowka dam reservoir that was established on upper course of the Narew River. Only in the spring and early summer the predominance over Cyanobacteria received other groups (mainly Cryptophyta, Bacillariophyceae, Chlorophyceae or Euglenophyta) more characteristic for potamoplankton.

Offspring (F1-generation) of each of the littoral spawning charr (LO) and the profundal spawning charr (PB) were reared individually over a period of 12 months under simulated natural photoperiod (at 69A degrees N) and two different temperature regimes to mimic the profundal zone conditions with constantly low temperature (similar to 4 A degrees C) and the littoral zone conditions with seasonally cycling temperatures. All charr increased in weight during the experimental period. The LO-morph performed generally best at naturally fluctuating temperature, whereas the PB-morph grew best at a constantly low temperature (4 A degrees C). The LO-morph showed a typical seasonal growth pattern found earlier for anadromous Arctic charr, with elevated specific growth rates (SGR) during June-October and profoundly reduced or negative SGR-values during November-February suggesting that the fish ceased feeding during this period. In contrast, the PB-morph maintained a steady growth rate, regardless of temperature regime, and showed less signs of reduced appetite during the polar night period and exhibited significantly higher SGR-values during late autumn and early winter compared to the LO-morph. This study suggests different heritable adaptations in somatic growth trajectories where the deep-water PB-morph do not show a down-regulation of appetite and voluntary fasting during winter conditions with typically low light intensity and low temperatures, and up-regulation of appetite with hyperphagia during summer, as characteristically found for the upper-water LO-morph and anadromous Arctic charr.																			1386-2588	1573-5125				MAR	2015	49	1					33	42		10.1007/s10452-015-9502-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-015-9502-y													WOS:000350394600003
J	Lindgren, PMF; Sullivan, TP				Lindgren, Pontus M. F.; Sullivan, Thomas P.			Mule deer-cattle interactions in managed coniferous forests during seasonal grazing periods in southern British Columbia, Canada	WILDLIFE RESEARCH												Context. In young forests of the Pacific North-west of North America, the potential impacts of domestic grazing by cattle (Bos taurus) on forest ecosystems and native ungulates such as mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) are poorly understood. It is not clear how cattle and deer may interact in young forests used for summer range by both ungulates, and winter range used by deer, where pre-commercial thinning (PCT) and fertilisation enhance both timber and forage. Aims. To test the following two hypotheses: (H-1) that PCT and repeated fertilisation of young lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) stands would increase relative habitat use by cattle; and (H-2) that increased use of forested range by cattle would result in decreased use by mule deer. Methods. Replicate study areas were located near Summerland, Kelowna, and Williams Lake in south-central British Columbia, Canada. Each study area had the following nine treatments: four pairs of stands thinned to densities of similar to 250 (very low), similar to 500 (low), similar to 1000 (medium), and similar to 2000 (high) stems ha(-1) with one stand of each pair fertilised five times at 2-year intervals. Relative habitat use was measured by counting cowpies for cattle in summer and pellet groups for deer in summer and winter periods 1998-2003. Key results. Relative habitat use by cattle was significantly enhanced by fertiliser treatments and heavy thinning, supporting H-1. Relative habitat use by deer during summer periods was not affected by stand density, but was significantly higher in fertilised than unfertilised stands, with no difference in winter months, thereby not supporting H-2. Conclusions. Summer habitat use by mule deer appeared to be a function of forage opportunities and no significant correlations in relative habitat use between cattle and mule deer during the summer were detected. Negative correlations were better explained by the need for tree cover by deer during severe winter conditions than a negative response to cattle grazing. Implications. Domestic grazing by cattle may be compatible with native ungulates such as mule deer, at least in those forest sites that are managed intensively for timber production. Fertilisation may result in sufficient forage production in the understorey vegetation of these forest ecosystems, to compensate for cattle grazing that reduces the live forage biomass.																			1035-3712	1448-5494					2014	41	8					691	702		10.1071/WR14134	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WR14134													WOS:000353148500007

The data thus obtained showed two peaks in abundance (the first in June and the second in October) and a minimum capture frequency in February. Egg-bearing females were recorded in spring and late summer, whilst recruitment occurred from spring to autumn, with maximum in June and October. The data collected also indicated the presence of a positive correlation between the abundance of talitrids and both temperature and sediment moisture. Morphological analysis enabled the identification of four different cohorts (with a lifespan of the species of approximately 12-15 months) all four of which remained distinguishable throughout the course of the year. It, moreover, enabled sex determination in individuals of 5 or more millimetres. The subsequent distribution indicated that, when significant, the sex ratio was female biased and that maximum size was greater in males. In particular, maximum sizes were recorded in spring for both males and females and were of 17.5 and 13.0 mm, respectively. Furthermore, the total body length recorded for egg-bearing females was positively correlated with the number of eggs in their brood pouch. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

J	Farhadzadeh, A				Farhadzadeh, Ali			A study of Lake Erie seiche and low frequency water level fluctuations in the presence of surface ice	OCEAN ENGINEERING												Coastal storms can initiate periodic low-frequency fluctuations of water level particularly in enclosed bodies of water. Such oscillations, known as seiches, can potentially result in an unexpected rise in water level leading to coastal flooding in low lying areas. Low frequency water level motions are also believed to contribute to long-term erosion of coasts. In this paper, low frequency motions of Lake Erie water levels are, analytically and numerically, studied for ice-free and ice-covered lake conditions. For the analytical study, first, a spectral analysis is performed on long-term hourly water level data collected over a 40-year period (1975-2015) at various water levels measuring stations around the lake. The frequencies of the lake's seiching modes are determined and the spatial variations of the energy corresponding to the low frequency fluctuations of the lake are investigated. Secondly, the seasonal variations of the seiching motions as well as the effects of surface ice on the low frequency oscillations of the lake level are assessed by analyzing the spectra and cross-spectra of the hourly water level data at various stations during winter and summer for ice-covered and ice-free conditions. The spatial variations of the spectral energy, phase lag and coherence for the low frequency motions are quantified for the winter and summer data. The lake's low frequency water level variations for a short-term extreme event, i.e. storm, are studied numerically. A historical winter storm taking place under ice-covered lake conditions is simulated using a coupled storm surge and spectral wave model (ADCIRC-SWAN). The model is forced by wind and pressure fields under a hypothetical ice-free conditions. The spectra of the low frequency motions for the simulated and measured lake level time-series are then compared. The spectral analysis of the Lake Erie long-term hourly water level data reveals distinct energy concentrations at the frequencies of approximately 1.7, 2.6, 4.1 and 5.8 cycle/day (CPD) which correspond to the first four modes of seiching oscillations. The energy corresponding to the low frequency motions is found to be at its highest level near Toledo, in the western basin, and lowest in Fairport, located at the nodal point for the first mode. The comparisons of the summer and winter spectra show that surface ice can suppress the low frequency oscillations. In general, the spectra of the lake levels during the summer are more peaked at the seiching modes than those of the winters when the lake is ice-covered. For the low frequency oscillations of the lake level following a short-term extreme event, higher energy levels are associated with the ice-free lake condition. This energy level is higher at the eastern and western ends of the lake, consistent with the findings for the winter and summer lake level oscillations. In general, the effect of surface ice on low frequency fluctuations of the lake is more pronounced in the western basin where typically more extensive surface ice is present during winters.																			0029-8018					MAY 1	2017	135						117	136		10.1016/j.oceaneng.2017.02.027	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.oceaneng.2017.02.027													WOS:000400040400010
J	West, CK; Greenwood, DR; Basinger, JF				West, Christopher K.; Greenwood, David R.; Basinger, James F.			Was the Arctic Eocene 'rainforest' monsoonal? Estimates of seasonal precipitation from early Eocene megafloras from Ellesmere Island, Nunavut	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												The early Eocene was the warmest interval of the Cenozoic, and included within it were several hyperthermal events, with the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) the most pronounced of these. These globally warm climates extended into the Arctic and substantive paleobotanical evidence for high Arctic precipitation (MAP > 150 cm/yr) is indicative of an Arctic rainforest, which contradicts some climate models that show low Arctic precipitation. Prior studies of Arctic early Eocene wood stable-isotope chemistry, however, have shown a summer peak in precipitation, which suggests modern analogs are best sought on the summer-wet east coast of the Asia (e.g., China, Japan, South Korea), not the winter-wet west coasts of the Pacific Northwest of North America). Furthermore, some prior modeling data suggest that highly seasonal 'monsoon-type' summer-wet precipitation regimes (i.e., summer:MAP > 55%) characterized certain mid and lower latitude regions in the early to mid-Eocene. Presented here is a new analysis using leaf physiognomy of 3 leaf megafloras (Split Lake, Stenkul Fiord and Strathcona Fiord) and palynofloral Biodimatic Analysis from the Margaret Formation from Ellesmere Island, placed stratigraphically as early Eocene, possibly occurring during or following one of the early Eocene hyperthermals. These new data indicate high summer precipitation in the Arctic during the early Eocene, which in part corroborates the results from Eocene wood chemistry. Nevertheless, in contradiction to the wood analysis, monsoonal conditions are not indicated by our analysis, consistent with current modeling studies. High summer (light season) and winter (dark season) precipitation in the Eocene Arctic during hyperthermals would have contributed to regional warmth. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We estimated 36,700 individuals of 24 avian species during the summer census. James' Flamingo (Phoenicoparrus jamusi and Andean Flamingo (P. andinus) were the most abundant species, followed by Horned Coot (Fulica cornuta), Chilean Flamingo (Phoenicopterus chilensis), and Crested Duck (Anas specularioides). These species comprised 78% of total individuals. In winter, we counted 7,121 individuals of 16 species, and the three flamingo species were the most abundant. In summer, we found Chilean and Andean Flamingos primarily in intermediate-altitude wetlands (3,500-4,000 m a.s.l.), whereas James' Flamingos and other waterbirds were above 4,000 m. In winter. the three flamingo species moved to lower-altitude wetlands (below 3,500 m).Water bird abundance was positively correlated with wetland size in wetlands with aquatic vegetation, with waterbird richness in wetlands without macrophytes. During summer, total abundance and richness were significantly higher in wetlands with macrophytes, where Chilean Flamingo and ten other waterbird species (e.g.. duck, grebes, gulls, and coots] were more common. James' Flamingo was the only species more abundant in hypersaline wetlands. In summer, foils wetlands (Grande, La Alumbrera: Vilama, and Pozuelos) contained 68% of the total individuals, with more than 3,000 waterbirds each. In winter, wetlands Pozuelos and Guayatayoc included 50% of waterbirds counted, with more than 5,000 birds each. Thirty four percent of the wetlands surveyed are within protected areas, but only in Laguna de los Pozuelos Natural Monument is it actually implemented. In 42% of the wetlands of the detected land uses that could represent threats to these environments. Here we propose some criteria to detect and prioritize relevant sites for conservation of altiplano waterbirds: a) large aggregations of individuals, either seasonal or permanent, b) vulnerable and/or endemic species and presence of nesting sites, c) ecological uniqueness, d) proximity to other complementary wetlands, e) high heterogeneity between and within sites. The complementary use of these environments by waterbird, both seasonally and spatially, suggests considering conservation action from a landscape perspective.

Iestyn; Sojka, Mariusz			On thinning ice: Effects of atmospheric warming, changes in wind speed and rainfall on ice conditions in temperate lakes (Northern Poland)	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Northern Hemisphere lakes are losing their ice cover due to climate change. Here we explored six decades of observational data (1961-2017) showing trends in air temperature, wind speed and precipitation over northern Poland, as well as changes in the ice conditions for five lakes with different morphometry. We evaluated whether and to what extent climatic effects, including atmospheric warming, changing wind speed and rainfall during fall and winter, influence ice conditions in morphometrically different lakes in Northern Poland. Our analysis demonstrated that ice cover duration and thickness decreased at rates of 5.4 days decade(-1) and 2.5 cm decade(-1), respectively. Ice conditions were influenced (65-75%) by the direct effects of air temperature change and to some extent by an interaction of warming with wind speed and precipitation (5-10%). While stronger autumnal winds result in longer ice cover duration, the effect of precipitation is bimodal with either an enhancement of ice formation by autumnal rain or accelerated ice loss during spring. To project future changes in ice conditions, we used a 1D hydrodynamic lake model forced with four climate model projections under low, medium and high Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. Our simulations demonstrate that current ice conditions will stabilize under the low emission scenario (RCP 2.6) but decrease under both the medium and high emission scenarios (RCP 6.0 and 8.5). During the 21st century, the lakes are projected to lose their ice at a rate between 4.5- and 10-days decade(-1) and ice thickness will decrease by between 3.0 and 5.0 cm decade(-1). The rate of change will be greater in smaller rather than larger lakes and more so for those situated further inland. The probability of ice-free winters will increase for all lakes and among all future scenarios by between 4 and 69% with the highest potential frequency of ice-free winters in smaller and deeper but relatively wind-exposed lakes.

Consequently, the thresholds derived from risk assessment tools such as species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) must allow for these changes. We built a single-substance SSD for each of four herbicides (atrazine, terbutryn, diuron and isoproturon), which was specific to the sensitivity of the benthic diatoms found in Lake Geneva, in order to derive protective thresholds for a mixture of these four herbicides using the concentration addition model. We then investigated (1) the structural parameters of a Lake Geneva benthic microalgal community during two contrasting seasons (summer 2012 and winter 2013), (2) the response of these communities to a herbicide mixture, and (3) the protective levels of the thresholds derived. The winter community was characterized by having greater biomass, diatom species richness, and diversity metrics, and lower non-diatom species richness than the summer community. The differences in the diatom communities composition in these seasons appeared to be primarily driven by the environmental nitrate concentrations and the temperature. Moreover, the species in the winter community were more resistant to herbicides than those found in the summer community. Consequently, the protective threshold for this herbicide mixture obtained in this study was in fact protective for the winter community, but not for the summer community based on their structural parameters. Thus, the protective level against herbicides of the threshold for the benthic microalgal community should take into account changes in the environmental physico-chemical conditions that strongly influence the structure and composition of the community. The fact that the succession of species over time (i.e., over the seasons) is difficult to predict introduces uncertainties into the estimation of protective thresholds and questions their applicability year round.					; RIMET, Frédéric/S-2702-2018; Rimet, Frederic/S-2702-2018	Bouchez, Agnes/0000-0001-8802-6966; Chevre, Nathalie/0000-0002-9248-7375; Rimet, Frederic/0000-0002-5514-869X													0963-9292	1573-3017				AUG	2014	23	6					1109	1123		10.1007/s10646-014-1254-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-014-1254-2								24840105					WOS:000338782100013

Under simulated field conditions, dilution bioassays were applied to assess limitation by N, P and trace nutrients. Growth kinetics of individual phytoplankton taxa in response to several levels of enrichment with N or P were analyzed. In every season studied, growth rates of algal laxa were often nutrient limited, with N-limitation and colimitation being especially common. Cyclotella was the dominant taxon in both lakes on an annual average, reaching its highest biomass in winter. During succession from winter to summer, there was a partial replacement of Cyclotella by cyanobacteria. Estimates of the Monod growth parameters were obtained for 21 taxa under N-limitation, and for 11 taxa under P-limitation. Cyclotella spp. should compete well for N in that its growth affinity was the highest of all the algal taxa we could study.

The drivers for this decline cannot be identified as long as the whereabouts of these long distance migrants remain unknown outside the breeding season. Ringing recoveries of sand martins from central-eastern Europe are widely scattered in the Mediterranean basin and in Africa, suggesting various migration routes and a broad non-breeding range. The European populations of house martins are assumed to be longitudinally separated across their non-breeding range and thus narrow population-specific non-breeding areas are expected. By using geolocators, we identified for the first time, the migration routes and non-breeding areas of sand martins (n = 4) and house martins (n = 5) breeding in central-eastern Europe. In autumn, the Carpathian Bend and northern parts of the Balkan Peninsula serve as important pre-migration areas for both species. All individuals crossed the Mediterranean Sea from Greece to Libya. Sand martins spent the non-breeding season in northern Cameroon and the Lake Chad Basin, within less than a 700 km radius, while house martins were widely scattered in three distinct regions in central, eastern, and southern Africa. Thus, for both species, the expected strength of migratory connectivity could not be confirmed. House martins, but not sand martins, migrated about twice as fast in spring compared to autumn. The spring migration started with a net average speed of > 400 km d(-1) for sand martins, and > 800 km d(-1) for house martins. However, both species used several stopover sites for 0.5-4 d and were stationary for nearly half of their spring migration. Arrival at breeding grounds was mainly related to departure from the last sub-Saharan non-breeding site rather than distance, route, or stopovers. We assume a strong carry-over effect on timing in spring.

J	Lozhkin, AV; Anderson, PM				Lozhkin, Anatoly V.; Anderson, Patricia M.			Forest or no forest: implications of the vegetation record for climatic stability in Western Beringia during Oxygen Isotope Stage 3	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Two conflicting stratigraphic schemes describe the Siberian Karginskii interstade (Oxygen Isotope Stage 3 equivalent) as having: 1) relatively stable climate with environments more similar to the full glaciation: or 2) variable climate with landscapes that more closely approximate contemporary ones. New data from continuous lake cores and a nearly continuous section from western Beringia (WB) suggest that both schemes are valid. Herb-dominated communities, possibly with isolated populations of Larix, characterized northern WB with only a slight shift from relatively warm to cool summers during the mid-interstade. In contrast, herb and shrub tundra, steppe, forest-tundra, and modern Larix forest occurred at various times in areas of southern WB, suggesting greater climatic instability. A thermal optimum is evident in the south during the mid-interstade, with modern vegetation in southeastern WB and Larix forest-tundra in the southwest. Variations in Pinus pumila pollen indicate summer warm/winter dry and summer warm/winter wet conditions in southeastern WB. These fluctuations contrast to other areas of WB, where summers and probably winters were consistently arid. Although the interstade presents a unique interval within the Late Pleistocene, paleodata and paleoclimatic models suggest that changes in marine conditions, including sea level, were likely key drivers in the regional climate history.

Abundant fragments of naturally fallen wood impregnated with silica were found in the overflow stream of the lake. These silicifications resulted from the precipitation of silica spheres onto split surfaces or cell walls of the fallen wood. The textures of wood tissues are the same as those found on naturally silicified wood formed in the vicinity of volcanic regions in the geological record. These results explain the formation mechanism of certain naturally silicified wood fragments that seem to be formed under the same conditions as those found in the hot spring water. To confirm the silicification process, fresh wood pieces of alder wood (Alnus pendula Matsumura) were placed in the hot spring water stream. Experimental wood fragments were silicified to nearly 40% by weight over a period of 7 years by the deposition of amorphous silica spheres in cell lumina of wood tissue. This study reveals that silicified wood can form under suitable conditions in time periods as short as tens to hundreds of years, and contributes to the understanding of the mechanisms forming silicified wood.

J	Guo, RF; Zhu, YQ; Liu, YB				Guo, Ruifang; Zhu, Yaqiao; Liu, Yuanbo			A Comparison Study of Precipitation in the Poyang and the Dongting Lake Basins from 1960-2015	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The Dongting Lake Basin and the Poyang Lake Basin, both located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, provide 30% of the total water volume for the Yangtze River. Under global climate change, precipitation patterns have undergone varying degrees of changes in different regions. Analysing temporal and spatial rainfall variations is important for understanding the variations in capacity of the two lake basins and the water intake variations by the Yangtze River. This study analyses the temporal and spatial variations of the two basins based on 33 rain-gauge data series from 1960-2015, using statistical methods, GIS spatial analysis and the M-K trend test. Our results showed that the annual precipitation generally increased in the Poyang Lake Basin and we found no obvious changes in the Dongting Lake Basin from 1960 to 2015. Seasonal precipitation levels at interannual scales were roughly consistent, but exhibited variability larger by an order of magnitude in the Poyang Lake Basin than in the Dongting Lake Basin. In general, an increasing trend dominated in spring and autumn while a decreasing trend was observed in summer and winter. The increasing trend was significant from the 1990s in the Poyang Lake Basin and from the late 1990s in the Dongting Lake Basin. It was found that annual precipitation with relatively larger anomalies appeared in ENSO (El Nino and Southern Oscillation) years in most cases, such as in 1963, 1997/1998 and 2002, while a few anomalies appeared in the previous or next year around an ENSO year, such as 1971 and 1978. All monthly precipitation periods with relatively larger or smaller anomalies coincided with ENSO events. In addition, El Nino and SOI (Southern Oscillation) events had significant relationships with negative monthly precipitation anomalies. El Nino and the SOI exerted more significant impacts on the Poyang Lake Basin than on the Dongting Lake Basin, which explains the conclusions regarding seasonal precipitation trends as mentioned above.

We analyze the hydrogen isotope composition (delta H-2) of plant-derived n-alkanoic acids (waxes) from Lake Qaupat, Baffin Island, Nunavut, Canada, to assess moisture sources and seasonality during the past 5.8 ka. We compare this record to a sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA)-inferred vascular plant record from the same lake, aiming to overcome the uncertainty of plant community impacts on leaf waxes. As the sedaDNA record reveals a stable plant community after the colonization of Betula sp. at 6.1 ka, we interpret plant wax delta H-2 values to reflect climate, specifically mean annual precipitation delta H-2. However, the distributions of n-alkanoic acid homologs suggest that aquatic mosses, which are not represented in the sedaDNA record, may become more abundant towards the present. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that changes in the plant community cause changes in the plant wax delta H-2 record, particularly long-chain waxes, which become less abundant through this record. We find that Lake Qaupat mid-chain plant wax delta H-2 is enriched coincident with high Labrador Sea summer surface temperature, which suggests that local moisture sources in summer and early autumn have the greatest impact on precipitation isotopes in this region.					; Sepúlveda, Julio/AAC-9956-2020; Sepulveda, Julio/K-6268-2017	Gorbey, Devon/0000-0002-1143-2736; Miller, G H/0000-0002-8225-2740; Hollister, Kayla/0000-0001-6225-7408; Thomas, Elizabeth/0000-0002-6489-7123; Raberg, Jonathan/0000-0003-2959-3631; Sepulveda, Julio/0000-0002-8251-6937; Crump, Sarah/0000-0002-6606-7350; de Wet, Gregory/0000-0001-8942-8801													0267-8179	1099-1417				JUL	2022	37	5			SI		967	978		10.1002/jqs.3390	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jqs.3390		NOV 2021											WOS:000714194500001

Seasonal variations in physicochemical characteristics and cyanobacterial diversity of a lake in Northern India	TOXICOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY												Physicochemical analyses and cyanobacterial diversity of Ramgarh Lake water were performed at five sampling sites during winter, summer, and monsoon seasons. Higher load of solids, carbon, and nutrients were persistent throughout the analysis that indicates the conversion of lake from oligotrophic to eutrophic nature. High nutrients load enhanced cyanobacterial biomass, while low nutrients load produced relatively less biomass. The physicochemical parameters of water samples revealed minimum 2.9mg L-1 dissolved oxygen (DO) at site-1 during summer, while maximum (5.6mg L-1) at site-4 in monsoon season. Maximum biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) (40mg L-1) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) (126mg L-1) were recorded at site-1 during summer, whereas minimum BOD (18mg L-1) and COD (52mg L-1) were evident at site-3 in monsoon season. Minimum concentration of nitrate (0.72mg L-1) was recorded at site-3 in summer, whereas maximum 2.7mg L-1 was present at site-5 in winter season. The phosphate concentration was maximum (0.52mg L-1) at site-5 in summer, and minimum (0.18mg L-1) was observed at site-4 in monsoon season. Cyanobacterial diversity was higher during all the seasons, and dominated by the species of Microcystis at all the five sampling sites.																			0277-2248	1029-0486				MAR 1	2013	95	3					458	471		10.1080/02772248.2013.790972	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02772248.2013.790972													WOS:000318541400009

Winter is not coming: evaluating impacts of changing winter conditions on coregonine reproductive phenology	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Fishes in northern latitude lakes are at risk from climate-induced warming because the seasonality in water temperature is degrading, which can change ecosystem properties and the phenology of life-history events. Temperature-dependent embryo development models were developed for a group of cold, stenothermic fishes (Salmonidae Coregoninae) to assess the potential impacts of climate-induced changes in water temperature on cisco (Coregonus artedi) from two populations in Lake Superior (Apostle Islands [USA] and Thunder Bay [Canada]) and one in Lake Ontario (USA), vendace (C. albula) in Lake Southern Konnevesi (Finland), and European whitefish (C. lavaretus) in lakes Southern Konnevesi, Constance (Germany), Geneva (France), and Annecy (France). Water temperatures for each study group were simulated and changes in reproductive phenology across historic (1900-2006) and three future climatic-warming scenarios (2007-2099) were investigated. Models predicted that increases in water temperatures are likely to cause delayed spawning, shorter embryo incubation durations, and earlier larval hatching. Relative changes increased as warming scenarios increased in severity and were higher for littoral as compared to pelagic populations. Our simulations demonstrated that slower cooling in the autumn and (or) more rapid warming in spring can translate into substantial changes in the reproductive phenology of coregonines among our study groups. We expect that the changes in reproductive phenology predicted by our models, in the absence of thermal or behavioral adaptation, will have negative implications for population sustainability.

The present study describes the seasonal reproductive cycle, gonad structure and sex ratio of the freshwater mussel U. terminalis. A total of 695 individuals were collected in monthly samples from October 2004 to September 2005 in Golbas iota Lake, Turkey. Calculation of the gonadosomatic index and histological examination of the gonads showed that gametogenesis began in winter, and spawning occurred in summer and early autumn. Five stages of oogenesis and five stages of spermatogenesis were identified. Spermatogenesis followed a pattern similar to that of typical oogenesis. The population consisted of dioecious individuals. Although sex ratios of U. terminalis were not significantly different from the expected 1:1 ratio (P > 0.05), slightly female-biased sex ratios were recorded. These results and existing data on mussel meat, phytoplankton production, availability of mussel spat, water quality and growth performance suggest that U. terminalis would be a great source for use in future aquaculture attempts.

Climate Change-Driven Regime Shifts in a Planktonic Food Web	AMERICAN NATURALIST												Predicting how food webs will respond to global environmental change is difficult because of the complex interplay between the abiotic forcing and biotic interactions. Mechanistic models of species interactions in seasonal environments can help understand the effects of global change in different ecosystems. Seasonally ice-covered lakes are warming faster than many other ecosystems and undergoing pronounced food web changes, making the need to forecast those changes especially urgent. Using a seasonally forced food web model with a generalist zooplankton grazer and competing cold-adapted winter and warm-adapted summer phytoplankton, we show that with declining ice cover, the food web moves through different dynamic regimes, from annual to biennial cycles, with decreasing and then disappearing winter phytoplankton blooms and a shift of maximum biomass to summer season. Interestingly, when predator-prey interactions were not included, a declining ice cover did not cause regime shifts, suggesting that both are needed for regime transitions. A cluster analysis of long-term data from Lake Baikal, Siberia, supports the model results, revealing a change from regularly occurring winter blooms of endemic diatoms to less frequent winter bloom years with decreasing ice cover. Together, the results show that even gradual environmental change, such as declining ice cover duration, may cause discontinuous or abrupt transitions between dynamic regimes in food webs.					; Wollrab, Sabine/H-2905-2017; Silow, Eugene/C-2958-2011; Klausmeier, Christopher/J-9339-2012	Klausmeier, Christopher/0000-0002-6987-5871; Silow, Eugene/0000-0002-7039-3220; Litchman, Elena/0000-0001-7736-6332; Wollrab, Sabine/0000-0003-2430-4845													0003-0147	1537-5323				MAR 1	2021	197	3					281	295		10.1086/712813	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/712813		MAR 2021						33625965					WOS:000612504600001

Patterns and mechanisms of Holocene climate change in arid Central Asia are, however, only partially understood. Multi-proxy data combining diatom, ostracod, sedimentological, geochemical and stable isotope analyses from a ca. 6000-year-old lake sediment core from Son Kol (Central Kyrgyzstan) show distinct and repeated changes in species assemblages. Diatom- and ostracod-inferred conductivity shifts between meso-euhaline and freshwater conditions suggest water balance and regime shifts. Organism-derived data are corroborated by stable isotope, mineralogical and geochemical records, underlining that Son Kol was affected by strong lake level fluctuations of several meters. The delta C-13(carb)/delta O-18(carb) correlation shows repeated switchovers from a closed to an open lake system. From 6000 to 3800 and 3250 to 1950 cal. yr BP, Son Kol was a closed basin lake with higher conductivities, increased nutrient availability and a water level located below the modern outflow. Son Kol became again a hydrologically open lake at 3800 and 1950 cal. yr BP. Comparisons to other local and regional paleoclimate records indicate that these regime shifts were largely controlled by changing intensity and position of the Westerlies and the Siberian Anticyclone that triggered changes in the amount of winter precipitation. A strong influence of the Westerlies ca. 5000-4400, 3800-3250 and since 1950 cal. yr BP enhanced the amount of precipitation during spring, autumn and winter, whereas cold and dry winters prevailed during phases with a strong Siberian Anticyclone and southward shifted Westerlies at ca. 6000-5000, 4400-3800 and 3250-1950 cal. yr BP. Similarities between variations in winter precipitation at Son Kol and records of the predominant NAO-mode further suggest a teleconnection between wet (dry) winter climate in Central Asia and a positive (negative) NAO-mode. Thus, this study identifies climate fluctuations as the main driver for hydrological regime shifts in Son Kol controlling physicochemical conditions and consequently causing abrupt species assemblage changes. This emphasizes the importance of multi-proxy approaches to identify triggers, thresholds and cascades of aquatic ecosystem transformations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	WARNER, K				WARNER, K			HOOKING MORTALITY OF LAKE-DWELLING LANDLOCKED ATLANTIC SALMON, SALMO-SALAR	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												To evaluate hooking mortality of lake-angled landlocked Atlantic salmon (S. salar), angled and net-trapped (control) fish were held for 5 days after capture in each spring and fall for 4 yr. Angled fish suffered a significantly greater mortality than controls in both spring (P < 0.001) and fall (P < 0.05). Mortality of fall-angled salmon was significantly less than that of spring-angled fish (P < 0.01). No significant differences (P > 0.05) were found between hooking mortality of age 2 and 3 fish, nor between legal-sized (.gtoreq. 356 mm, total length) and sublegal salmon. Most mortality occurred within 24 h of hooking. No significant differences (P > 0.05) were found between mortality caused by single- and treble-hook gears, nor between flies and lures. Mortality of gill-hooked fish was significantly greater (P < 0.001) than that of salmon hooked in the mouth area. No particular gear, hook or lure type was more prone to hook fish in vital anatomical locations. Mortality of fish bleeding from hooking was significantly greater (P < 0.001) than that of nonbleeding fish. Hooking deaths were predicted.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1978	107	4					518	522		10.1577/1548-8659(1978)107<518:HMOLLA>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1978)107<518:HMOLLA>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1978FS34600002

However, phenotypic and molecular responses of copepods to different environmental conditions, including ultraviolet radiation (UVR), are still not fully understood. Here, we tested whether gene expression patterns vary within the same species, Cyclops abyssorum tatricus, but in populations from different environments (a clear vs. a glacially turbid lake) when exposed to UVR. Moreover, we wanted to examine potential seasonal variation (summer vs. autumn) in copepod gene expression. We measured photoprotective compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids and carotenoids) and antioxidant capacities in two copepod populations and studied gene expression of heat shock proteins (hsps) as indicator of stress after UVR exposure in the laboratory. Compared with the copepod population from the clear lake, the population from the turbid lake showed lower mycosporine-like amino acid, but higher carotenoid concentrations that decreased over the season. Antioxidant capacities (both lipophilic and hydrophilic) were higher in autumn than in summer. The hsp60 and hsp90 genes were constitutively expressed, regardless of habitat origin and season, while hsp70 was upregulated after exposure to UVR (up to 2.8-fold change). We observed stronger upregulation of hsp70 gene expression in autumn for the turbid and summer for the clear lake, with highest gene expression 24 hr post-UVR exposure (up to 10.2-fold change in the turbid and 3.9-fold in the clear lake). We show how variation in phenotypic traits modulates hsp gene expression patterns, specifically hsp70 gene expression. Rapidly induced defences against cellular stress may improve survival in harsh environments such as alpine lakes, especially since these sensitive ecosystems may experience further changes in the future.

J	ECKERROT, A; PETTERSSON, K				ECKERROT, A; PETTERSSON, K			PORE WATER PHOSPHORUS AND IRON CONCENTRATIONS IN A SHALLOW, EUTROPHIC LAKE - INDICATIONS OF BACTERIAL REGULATION	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Peak pore water SRP and iron(II) concentrations were found during summer in surface sediments in the shallow and eutrophic L. Finjasjon, Sweden, and the concentrations generally increased with water depth. The SRP variation in surface sediments (0-2 cm) was correlated with temperature (R2 = 0.82-0.95) and iron(II) showed a correlation with sedimentary carbon on all sites (R2 = 0.42-0.96). In addition, sedimentary Ch1a, bacterial abundances and production rates in surface sediments (0-2 cm) varied seasonally, with peaks during spring and fall sedimentation. Bacterial production rates were correlated with phosphorus and carbon in the sediment (R2 = 0.90-0.95 and R2 = 0.31-0.95, respectively), indicating a coupling with algal sedimentation. A general increase in sediment Ch1a and bacterial abundances towards sediments at greater water depth was found. Further, data from 1988-90 reveal that TP and TFe concentrations in the lake were significantly correlated during summer (R2 = 0.81 and 0.76, in the hypolimnion and epilimnion, respectively). The results indicate that the increase in pore water SRP and Fe(II) in surface sediments during summer is regulated by bacterial activity and the input of organic matter. In addition, spatial and temporal variations in pore water composition are mainly influenced by temperature and water depth and the significant correlation between TP and TFe in the water suggests a coupled release from the sediment. These findings support the theory of anoxic microlayer formation at the sediment-water interface.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR 5	1993	253	1-3					165	177		10.1007/BF00050736	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00050736													WOS:A1993KY82400015

Oregon Spotted Frog (Rana pretiosa) Migration from an Aquatic Overwintering Site: Timing, Duration, and Potential Environmental Cues	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Relatively few North American anurans overwinter in water and information is sparse on their movement from overwintering habitat to breeding sites. Oregon spotted frogs (Rana pretiosa) breed explosively in early spring and often overwinter submerged at sites that are distanced from breeding habitats. In montane parts of their range, wintering and breeding habitats can remain frozen for months. We investigated tinting, duration, and potential cues for R. pretiosa migrations from a wintering lake near the Cascade Mountains in central Oregon, U.S.A. First and median migrant males moved slightly earlier than females. Onset of migration was as early as February 12 (males) and as late as April 4 (females) in years of mild and extended winters, respectively. Frogs were active at water temperatures below those associated with early breeding activities in one lowland R. pretiosa population. Higher proportions of frogs migrated before ice-out in years of prolonged winter conditions. Migrations were temporally compressed in years of later movement. This migration 'rush', along with the ability to move at cold temperatures and to vary timing of migrations likely helps montane R. pretiosa deal with colder and more variable spring conditions than lowland populations.																			0003-0031	1938-4238				JUL	2020	184	1					87	97		10.1637/0003-0031-184.1.87	http://dx.doi.org/10.1637/0003-0031-184.1.87													WOS:000551502600006

Prior to the introduction in spring, 1982, reservoir contained an established fish community dominated by centrachids. Blueback herring stomachs and zooplankton were sampled quarterly from summer, 1982 through winter, 1985. Cladocerans accounted for 89.4% of the zooplankton consumed by herring. Median lengths of cladocerans and copepods in the herring diet were significantly greater than those in the reservoir. No appreciable changes in lengths of cladocerans and copepods in the reservoir were observed after blueback herring introduction, but the zooplankton community shifted from cladoceran to copepod domination.																			0018-8158					FEB 1	1991	209	1					1	6		10.1007/BF00006712	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006712													WOS:A1991EX75200001

Comparison of Electrofishing Techniques and Effort Allocation across Diel Time Periods, Seasons, Sites, and Habitat in the Ohio Coastal Waters of Western Lake Erie	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Coastal (<3-m depth) and nearshore (3-15-m depth) zones of large freshwater lakes are generally rich in complex habitats that are important for fisheries, but they are often highly degraded and understudied. We identified spatial and temporal sampling efficiencies for monitoring coastal fish communities in a large freshwater lake by use of electrofishing. During 2011 and 2012, we sampled 21 coastal sites in Lake Erie's western basin via daytime and nighttime electrofishing with multiple replicates throughout the summer sampling season. Nighttime electrofishing captured more species and more individuals with less effort than daytime electrofishing; nighttime electrofishing conducted early in the season (i.e., late spring and early summer) was more efficient than that conducted late in the season (i.e., late summer and early fall). A sampling design based on 500 m of shoreline per site required fewer sites and person-hours to attain 65% and 75% of total species richness (6 and 11 sites, respectively) than a design that used 100 m/site. A 300-m/site design was more efficient at targeting 90% of total species richness. Targeting of wetland habitat increased the number of species captured but missed species that were only found at other habitat types. A sampling design that targeted 11 sites (75% of species richness) sufficiently described fish community metrics (e.g., number of tolerant species) since the design captured nearly all fish species that were relevant to each metric. This study provides the foundation for a coastal monitoring program in western Lake Erie and serves as a starting point for program development in other large freshwater lakes.																			0275-5947	1548-8675					2016	36	1					85	95		10.1080/02755947.2015.1111275	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2015.1111275													WOS:000371338300009

About 50% of the stocked fish died during their first week in net cages, mostly due to the transportation. The stocked vendace spread themselves 10-15 ion from the stocking site by autumn 1991. In this area about 50% of vendace caught by exploratory gill-netting were stocked fish. The stocked females had lower gonadosomatic index and egg dry weight than those of the native Puruvesi stock or vendace in Lake Onkamo. About 9% of the stocked females did not prepare themselves for spawning in 1991. About 20% of the eggs laid into the central parts of Lake Puruvesi were estimated to originate from the stocked females. In autumn 1992 and in winter 1992/3, the catch per unit of effort of 0+ vendace was high in exploratory trawling and winter-seining both in areas where the stocked fish had spread themselves and in more southern areas. Thus the effects of the transfers an recruitment remain unclear.																			0071-1128		3-510-47047-8				1995	46						413	420																WOS:A1995BH14P00050

Pluriactivity and professionalism in buffalo farming system: The case of Northern Greece	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES												Pluriactivity and professionalism in the water buffalo farming system was investigated with standardized questionnaires and in-depth interviews with breeders at Lake Kerkini National Park, Greece, where 80% of the country's buffalo population is raised. A distinction between total and complementary pluriactivity is proposed depending on including (or not) buffalo breeding as main occupation, respectively. Complementary pluriactivity appears to have synergistic effect and to encourage commerce of buffalo products to end users. Breeders not oriented to milk production tend to invest time in agriculture. Commerce seems to be encouraged by using private land for breeding (temporary pastures for early spring grazing and crop residues during summer-early autumn). Agriculture appears to be the usual alternative activity. The family character of holding and not the size of buffalo herd or the ownership status of agricultural land used for breeding seem to enhance professionalism. Simultaneous keeping of goat flocks and commerce weaken it.					; Tsiobani, Eleni/NXX-8813-2025	Tsiobani, Eleni/0000-0002-5142-6082; 													0367-8318					JUL	2013	83	7					763	767																WOS:000344391000023

Environmental Variation and Habitat Use Affect Blue Catfish Low-Frequency Electrofishing Catch Rates	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												The Blue Catfish Ictalurus furcatus is a popular sport fish in its native range and a prolific invasive species in its nonnative range. Low-frequency electrofishing (LFE) is effective for sampling Blue Catfish, and development of standardized LFE protocols for sampling Blue Catfish is critical for monitoring and management of their populations. However, standardized sampling for Blue Catfish can be difficult because their habitat use is variable among seasons and habitats, and LFE is affected by a suite of abiotic factors. To quantify this variation, our objectives were to determine how Blue Catfish LFE catch (1) differs during spring and summer sampling seasons, (2) is affected by environmental variables, and (3) relates to their habitat use. To do so, we conducted a telemetry study and systematic random LFE sampling in Lake Dardanelle, Arkansas, in the spring and summer of 2016. We compared the numbers, capture rates, and size structure (proportional size distribution index of quality-size fish) of telemetry-located and LFE-captured Blue Catfish in distinct habitats and found that habitat use was heterogeneous but capture rates were proportional to habitat use. Blue Catfish catch increased with conductivity and decreased with flow velocity; catch also differed among habitat types, among reservoir zones, and between seasons (spring/summer). Understanding how spatiotemporal differences in habitat use contextualize the effects of LFE catch will improve sampling protocols for Blue Catfish.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				OCT	2021	41			1	SI		S103	S117		10.1002/nafm.10601	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10601		MAY 2021											WOS:000646964600001
J	Chandler, DC				Chandler, DC			Limnological studies of western Lake Erie II. Light penetration and its relation to turbidity	ECOLOGY												Several times each month for a year penetration of daylight into the waters of western L. Erie was measured with a Weston photronic cell. Concurrently with light measurements were detns. of turbidity, amt. of organic and in-organic suspended matter, and the quantity of phytoplankton. Light penetration and the degree of turbidity show an inverse relationship, and the max. depth to which 1% of the surface light penetrated was 9.7 m. when turbidity was 5 ppm., while the minimum was 0.8 m. when turbidity was 115 ppm. In general transmission of light was highest during winter and early summer and lowest during late summer and autumn. Transmission was most uniform vertically when stormy conditions prevailed and least uniform when relatively calm conditions followed stormy periods. Turbidity in these waters is due primarily to materials derived from the bottom sediments; the inorganic component of which is present in larger quantities than the organic component. Biologically, turbidity through its effects on light penetration into this body of water is believed to influence: composition, size, duration, and time of occurrence of phytoplankton pulses; rate of photosynthesis at various depths; position of the compensation point of higher aquatic plants and phytoplankters; vertical distribution of microcrustacea; and magnitude of the commercial catch of saugers (Stizostedion canadense).																			0012-9658	1939-9170				JAN	1942	23	1					41	52		10.2307/1930871	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1930871													WOS:000200150000005

We compared the food consumption rates, diet overlap, and growth of white perch and yellow perch from field data collected during 1983-85 and 1987. Food consumption rates were as much as 27% greater in white perch than in yellow perch, and were higher for both species in the central basin than in the western basin. Seasonal diet composition was most alike in summer and less so in spring and fall, when yellow perch ate more benthos or fish than did white perch. Of 48 Schoener index comparisons of diet overlap during a 3-yr period, 52% were significant (>0.6).

Sampling was conducted across three different depths, representing the surface (epilimnion, 1 m), seasonal thermocline depth (metalimnion, 5-15 m), and bottom (hypolimnion, 19 m). The sampling period ranged over several months to capture the dynamics of MPs within the water column as seasonal stratification evolved from weakly stratified spring to stratified summer to weakly stratified fall of 2023. The findings reveal variability in MP abundances ranging from 116 to 181 items/L, 133 to 204 items/L, and 48 to 78 items/L for the surface, middle, and bottom layers, respectively. The data indicate that thermal stratification, particularly during the summer months, plays a key role in entrapping MPs within the middle layers, where the highest concentration (204 items/L) was observed. The study also highlights the diversity of MP types, including polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and rubber, with their vertical distribution partly governed by density and hydrodynamic factors such as water mixing. These results demonstrate the importance of vertical distributions, seasonal changes, and particle density when assessing MP pollution in freshwater ecosystems.					; Pulicharla, Rama/AAY-3237-2021	Brar, Satinder Kaur/0000-0001-6633-4247; 														2690-0637				MAY 6	2025	5	6					3155	3165		10.1021/acsestwater.5c00047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsestwater.5c00047		MAY 2025											WOS:001482447000001

The importance of year-to-year variation in meteorological and runoff forcing for water quality of a temperate, dimictic lake	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Natural stochasticity can pose challenges in managing the quality of the environment, or hinder understanding of the system structure. It is problematic because unfavourable stochastic events cancel management efforts and because a favourable stochastic event may overestimate perceived success. This paper presents a variance-based modelling method that can be used to quantify the extent to which natural stochasticity can affect the target environment. We use a case study of a eutrophication assessment of a Norwegian lake, Arungen, using a lake model, MyLake, in order to present the method, and to investigate how this method could assist in answering scientific and management questions. Here we contrasted two effects of nutrient loading in runoff (partially controllable by policies) and meteorology (purely natural stochastic events), illustrated in the case study, in order to achieve the season-by-season quantification of mutually confounding factors of stochastic events. The results indicate that, for example, variation in runoff volume was most prevalent during autumn and winter, while variation in phosphorus inflow was most extensive from late winter to early spring. Thermal-related properties in the lake were well predicted by the model, and showed that the time of thermocline formation varied among years by more than 1 month, from mid-April to mid-May, whereas loading was the most important factor for phytoplankton biomass and water transparency. Mild winters and greater inputs of suspended matter and phosphorus were followed by increased phytoplankton biomass and light attenuation. These findings also suggest that future changes in the global climate may have important implications for local water management decision-making. The present method of disentangling mutually confounding factors is not limited to lake water quality studies and may also provide utility in other types of aquatic system modelling.					; Tominaga, Koji/C-9795-2009	Tominaga, Koji/0000-0002-5006-784X; 													1027-5606	1607-7938					2015	19	6					2649	2662		10.5194/hess-19-2649-2015	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-19-2649-2015													WOS:000357125300009

The Daphnia population was small in spring and early summer, probably because of high predation pressure by fish. The population grew in midsummer, when thermal stratification developed and the dissolved oxygen became very low in the deeper layer of the hypolimnion. In this season, adults of D. longispina concentrated in the daytime near the lake bottom, where fish were absent because of the anoxic conditions, but ascended at night to the upper layer of the hypolimnion, where food was most abundant. The low oxygen layer near the bottom kept out the predators and protected Daphnia from predation, and consequently contributed to the built-up of its population. However, the low oxygen layer was unfavourable for reproduction of Daphnia, as reflected in the low egg ratio and high percentage of males in the population. The population decreased in the fall, when thermal stratification disappeared and predation pressure seemed to increase.					hosomi, masaaki/G-1122-2013														0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV 15	1989	185	1					19	27		10.1007/BF00006064	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006064													WOS:A1989CK35100004

Dry weight of sculpin gut contents was not correlated with fish wet weight. This, combined with age and growth data, suggested that sculpin may be food limited in Toolik Lake, particularly as they approach reproductive size. Since 3 taxonomically distinct chironomids were digested at similar rates; 1 chironomid species was used as a marker to measure gut passage. Gut passage rate as a function of temperature fits an inverse quadratic model slightly better than a negative exponential model. Sculpins took .apprx. 1 day to digest food at typical summer temperatures (8-16.degree. C), but .apprx. 2 day at a typical winter temperature (4.degree. C). Since winter is 3 times longer than summer, winter feeding by sculpins may have greater impact on chironomid density than summer feeding. If sculpin are important in the diet or other Toolik Lake fishers, they may serve as an important trophic link between benthic and pelagic production.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1985	42	3					483	487		10.1139/f85-065	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f85-065													WOS:A1985AEK9300010

In this study, we apply spatial statistical methods for the key physics and chemistry variables and chlorophyll a over eight sampling dates in two consecutive years in a large (area 103 km(2)) eutrophic boreal lake in southern Finland. In the four summer sampling dates, the water body was vertically and horizontally heterogenic except with color and DOC, in the two winter ice-covered dates DO was vertically stratified, while in the two autumn dates, no significant spatial differences in any of the measured variables were found. Chlorophyll a concentration was one order of magnitude lower under the ice cover than in open water. The Moran statistic for spatial correlation was significant for chlorophyll a and NO2+NO3-N in all summer situations and for dissolved oxygen and pH in three cases. In summer, the mass centers of the chemicals were within 1.5 km from the geometric center of the lake, and the 2nd moment radius ranged in 3.7-4.1 km respective to 3.9 km for the homogeneous situation. The lateral length scales of the studied variables were 1.5-2.5 km, about 1 km longer in the surface layer. The detected spatial "noise" strongly suggests that besides vertical variation also the horizontal variation in eutrophic lakes, in particular, should be considered when the ecosystems are monitored.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL	2018	190	7							378	10.1007/s10661-018-6742-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-018-6742-z								29868944					WOS:000434305300002

To improve the reservoir regulation strategies, this study analysed streamflow change of the HSRYR in a mesoscale. A tank model (TM) was proposed and calibrated with monthly observation streamflow from 1991 to 1998. In the validation period, though there is a simulation deviation during the water storage and power generation period, simulated streamflow agrees favourably with observation data from 2008 to 2013. The model was further validated by two inside lakes area obtained from Landsat 5, 7, 8 datasets from 2000 to 2014, and significant correlations were found between the simulated lake outlet runoff and respective lake area. Then 21 Global Climate Models (GCM) ensembled data of three emission scenarios (SRA2, SRA1B and SRB1) were downscaled and used as input to the TM to simulate the runoff change of three benchmark periods 2011-2030 (2020s), 2046-2065 (2050s), 2080-2099 (2090s), respectively. Though temperature increase dramatically, these projected results similarly indicated that streamflow shows an increase trend in the long term. Runoff increase is mainly caused by increasing precipitation and decreasing evaporation. Water resources distribution is projected to change from summer-autumn dominant to autumn winter dominant. Annual lowest runoff will occur in May caused by earlier snow melting and increasing evaporation in March. According to the obtained results, winter runoff should be artificially stored by reservoir regulation in the future to prevent zero-flow occurrent in May. This research is helpful for water resources management and provides a better understand of streamflow change caused by climate change in the future.					wang, shuqing/JRX-7812-2023; Wu, Pan/NOF-7004-2025; Luo, Dongliang/Q-9637-2016	Wu, Pan/0000-0001-5696-1597; Wang, Xu-Sheng/0000-0001-8736-2378													2199-899X						2018	379						231	241		10.5194/piahs-379-231-2018	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/piahs-379-231-2018													WOS:000459240300033
J	Patceva, SB; Leshoski, JV				Patceva, Suzana B.; Leshoski, Jovica, V			Phytoplankton Composition of Lake Prespa, Republic of Macedonia	ACTA ZOOLOGICA BULGARICA												Lake Prespa is an ancient lake located in the southeastern part of Europe. It is a transboundary lake shared by the Republic of Macedonia, Greece and the Republic of Albania. In order to study the phytoplankton composition, surveys in the Macedonian part of Lake Prespa were carried out at four sampling points in the littoral zone and two sampling points in the pelagic zone, during spring and summer period of 2013. Our results indicated that phytoplankton assemblages of Lake Prespa and their spatial and temporal distribution were typical of mesotrophic lakes. Bacillariophyta and Cyanophyta were the dominant divisions within the phytoplankton assemblage, showing distinct seasonal variations. Bacillariophyta predominated in spring, while Cyanophyta in summer. According to the trophic state index (TSI) based on chlorophyll a concentration, all sampling points at Lake Prespa indicated mesotrophic conditions.																			0324-0770					MAR	2019				13			51	56																WOS:000472245600008
J	Manca, M; Rogora, M; Salmaso, N				Manca, Marina; Rogora, Michela; Salmaso, Nico			Inter-annual climate variability and zooplankton: applying teleconnection indices to two deep subalpine lakes in Italy	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Investigating relation between meteo-climatic indices and between-year variation in Daphnia population density and phenology is crucial for e. g. predicting impact of climate change on lake ecosystem structure and functioning. We tested whether and how two teleconnection indices calculated for the winter period, namely the East Atlantic pattern (EA(DJF)) and the Eastern Mediterranean Pattern (EMPDJF) were correlated with Daphnia population growth in two Italian subalpine lakes, Garda and Maggiore. We investigated between-lake temporal coherence in: i) water temperature within the water layer in which Daphnia is distributed; ii) timing of Daphnia initial and spring maximum population density peak and iii) the level of Daphnia spring maximum population density peak over an eleven-year period (1998-2008) of unchanged predation pressure by fish and invertebrates, and of common oligotrophy. Between-lake temporal coherence was high for an earlier start, and earlier, and lower, Daphnia population spring density peak after milder winters. Peak density level was coherently, positively correlated with soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentration. We hypothesized that Daphnia peak densities were related to atmospheric modes of variability in winter and to the degree of late winter mixing promoting replenishment of algal nutrients into upper water layers and phytoplankton growth, enhancing food availability and Daphnia fecundity, promoting and Daphnia peak.
