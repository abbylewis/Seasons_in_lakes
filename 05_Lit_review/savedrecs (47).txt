The surface water of the Yellow River Basin also suffers antibiotic pollution, which hinders the improvement in the aquatic ecological environment. This study investigated and analyzed the characteristics and assessed the ecological risks of antibiotic pollution in surface water bodies such as canals, rivers and fish ponds in Kaifeng, Henan Province, which is a key city along the lower reaches of the Yellow River. The test results are as follows. A total of 15 types of antibiotics were detected in the surface water. They had a total antibiotic concentration of 12.2-249.9 mu g/L, of which tetracyclines (TCs) and quinolones accounted for the highest percentages. Six types of quinolones had detection rates of up to 100%, and doxycycline (DC) and oxytetracycline (OTC) had average concentrations of 29.52 mu g/L1 and 13.71 mu g/L, respectively. The major canals with water diverted from the Yellow River had total concentrations of quinolones and TCs of 22. 0 mu g/L and 14.9 mu g/L, respectively, which were higher than those in previous studies. This phenomenon may be related to the decrease in the water flow of the Yellow River during the dry season and the increase in the antibiotic consumption of residents in the context of the Covid-19 outbreak. The upper reaches of the Huiji River in the Xiangfu District had higher antibiotic content than other districts in Kaifeng. Specifically, TCs accounted for 72.38% -91.84% of all antibiotics, and the DC and OTC concentrations were significantly higher than other antibiotics in the upper reaches. As indicated by the ecological risk assessment results, TCs had the highest ecological risks to green algae. Among them, DC had medium-high risks; TC, OTC, and chlortetracycline (CTC) had medium-high risks; trimethoprim (TMP) and lomefloxacin (LOM) had low risks; other TC antibiotics had no risk. Compared with green algae, most antibiotics showed higher ecological risks to daphnia and lower ecological risks to fish. DC and OTC dominate antibiotic pollutants in the surface water in Kaifeng City, and especially in Xiangfu District, where DC and OTC have medium-high risks. The TCs in the major Yellow River showed medium risks to both green algae and daphnia. It can be speculated that the antibiotic pollution in the Yellow River might pose a certain threat to the ecological security of water in Kaifeng City.(c) 2022 China Geology Editorial Office.																			2096-5192					JUL	2022	5	3					411	420		10.31035/cg2022032	http://dx.doi.org/10.31035/cg2022032													WOS:000888623900001

Since many key watercolor parameters of Qinghai Lake are not yet available, this paper aims to study the spatial and temporal variations of the water clarity (i.e., Secchi-disk depth, Z(SD)) and suspended particulate matter concentration (CSPM) in Qinghai Lake from 2001 to 2020 using MODIS images. First, the four atmospheric correction models, including the NIR-SWIR, MUMM, POLYMER, and C2RCC were tested. The NIR-SWIR with decent accuracy in all bands was chosen for the experiment. Then, four existing models for Z(SD) and six models for C-SPM were evaluated. Two semi-analytical models proposed by Lee (2015) and Jiang (2021) were selected for Z(SD) (R-2 = 0.74) and C-SPM (R-2 = 0.73), respectively. Finally, the distribution and variation of the Z(SD) and C-SPM were derived over the past 20 years. Overall, the water of Qinghai Lake is quite clear: the monthly mean Z(SD) is 5.34 +/- 1.33 m, and C-SPM is 2.05 +/- 1.22 mg/L. Further analytical results reveal that the Z(SD) and C-SPM are highly correlated, and the relationship can be formulated with Z(SD)=8.072e(-0.212)C(SPM) (R-2 = 0.65). Moreover, turbid water mainly exists along the edge of Qinghai Lake, especially on the northwestern and northeastern shores. The variation in the lakeshore exhibits some irregularity, while the main area of the lake experiences mild water quality deterioration. Statistically, 81.67% of the total area is dominated by constantly increased C-SPM, and the area with decreased C-SPM occupies 4.56%. There has been distinct seasonal water quality deterioration in the non-frozen period (from May to October). The water quality broadly deteriorated from 2001 to 2008. The year 2008 witnessed a sudden distinct improvement, and after that, the water quality experienced an extremely inconspicuous degradation. This study can fill the gap regarding the long-time monitoring of water clarity and total suspended matter in Qinghai Lake and is expected to provide a scientific reference for the protection and management of the lake.

The relationship between remote sensing reflectance of OLI bands and in-situ measured SSC were used to develop new site-specific algorithms. Four different models were calibrated in this study for retrieval of SSC using in-situ observation and remote sensing reflectance of OLI data. The multiband linear regression model provided better result (R-2=0.6) as compared to the single-band regression model (R-2=0.45, polynomial; R-2=0.38, exponential and R-2=0.39, linear). The Landsat-8 OLI image shows spatiotemporal variations of SSC during pre and post-monsoon season (2013-15) in the lake. It is observed that the SSC variation is predominantly influenced by three factors: monsoon effect, wind-induced re-suspension of bottom sediments and influx of river water into the lake. It is also observed that due to the impact of severe tropical cyclone Phailin, there was a rapid increase of SSC in the lake.

JOURNAL OF TRAVEL RESEARCH												Climate change adaptation is a pressing need. However, local level stakeholders often find themselves overwhelmed with climate change information presented at both small temporal and spatial scales. To address this gap, and using a case study from New Zealand's Southern Lakes region, this research links tourism operators' information requirements with climate change projections. Interviews with 42 stakeholders provided exemplary storylines and insights into the climate parameters that would be useful for their planning (mean precipitation, extreme wind conditions, mean temperature, and frost days). These findings were then used to generate sector-relevant maps. Climate change maps were produced based on global and regional models to generate detailed climate projection information for the A2 emission scenario in the form of regional scale, color-coded maps. A final stakeholder workshop confirmed the usefulness of the maps as a planning tool but also highlighted a number of future challenges for climate change communication.					; Becken, Susanne/AFK-2875-2022	Zammit, Christian/0000-0001-9740-3815; Hendrikx, Jordy/0000-0001-6194-3596; Becken, Susanne/0000-0002-3348-2750													0047-2875	1552-6763				JUL	2015	54	4					430	441		10.1177/0047287514528286	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0047287514528286													WOS:000355332400002

These measurements identified highly significant empirical relationships between CDOM concentration measured using the in situ fluorescence sensor and CDOM absorption, fluorescence, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations. CDOM concentration expressed in quinine sulfate equivalent units, was highly correlated with the CDOM absorption coefficient (r(2) = 0.80, p < 0.001), fluorescence intensities (Ex./Em. 370/460 nm) (r(2) = 0.91, p < 0.001), the fluorescence index (r(2) = 0.88, p < 0.001) and the humification index (r(2) = 0.78, p < 0.001), suggesting that CDOM concentration measured using the in situ fluorescence sensor could act as a substitute for the CDOM absorption coefficient and fluorescence measured in the laboratory. Similarly, CDOM concentration was highly correlated with DOC concentration (r(2) = 0.68, p < 0.001), indicating that in situ CDOM fluorescence sensor measurements could be a proxy for DOC concentration. In addition, significant positive correlations were found between laboratory CDOM absorption coefficients and COD (r(2) = 0.83, p < 0.001), TP (r(2) = 0.82, p < 0.001) concentrations, suggesting a potential further application for the real-time monitoring of water quality using an in situ CDOM fluorescence sensor.

The world's largest heliothermal lake newly formed in the Aral Sea basin	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The Aral Sea desiccation is one of the worst aquatic ecological disasters of the last century, important for understanding the worldwide trends to degradation of arid lakes under water use and climate change. Formerly the fourth largest lake worldwide, the Aral Sea has lost similar to 90% of its water since the early 1960s due to irrigation in its drainage basin. Our survey on the seasonal thermal and mixing regime in Chernyshev-a semi-isolated hypersaline part of the Aral Sea-revealed a newly formed two-layered structure with strong gradients of salinity and water transparency at mid-depths. As a result, the Chernyshev effectively accumulates solar energy, creating a temperature maximum at the water depth of similar to 5 m with temperatures up to 37 degrees C. Herewith, this part of the Aral Sea has evolved to an unprecedently large (similar to 80 km(2)) heliothermal lake akin to artificial solar ponds used for 'green energy' production. The newly formed heliothermal lake, with transparent and freshened layer on top of the hypersaline and nutrient-rich deep water, acts as a solar energy trap and facilitates intense biogeochemical processes. The latter reveal themselves in practically 100% opacity of the deep layer to the solar light, permanent deep anoxia, and growing methane concentrations. The recent emergence of the Chernyshev as a heliothermal lake provides an opportunity for tracing the biogeochemical and ecological response of aquatic ecosystems to suddenly changed environmental conditions.

In this study, a broadly distributed cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa and a Chlorophyta species Chlorella pyrenoidosa were mono-cultured and co-cultured at three different temperatures (15 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 35 degrees C) with different phosphorus (P) availability, to explore algal growth patterns and competition results. In the mono-cultures, M. aeruginosa had a poor adaptation for its growth at low temperatures and it grew better at higher temperatures, but C. pyrenoidosa had flexibility for its growth in a wider range of temperatures and it showed the best growth at 25 degrees C. However, high P availability could alleviate the negative effects of low temperatures on M. aeruginosa growth. Meanwhile, algal P utilization behaviors could have a close relationship with their growth patterns at different temperatures, when higher P availability enhanced the growth advantages of two species at the optimal temperature in the mono-cultures. In the co-cultures, the mutually beneficial effects of two algal species for their growth were observed at low temperatures. But at warmer temperatures, the growth of M. aeruginosa was promoted and the growth of C. pyrenoidosa was inhibited when compared to monocultures. The superior P utilization of M. aeruginosa and its allelopathic effects on C. pyrenoidosa could be the main causes. Consistent with the batch experiment in flasks, water temperature in different seasons had a great impact on the growth strategies of algal species, and P enrichment affected algal succession in the natural waters. Overall, our results indicated the significant interactive effects of temperature and P availability on algal growth, and the strong competitive advantages of M. aeruginosa in eutrophic waters at high temperatures.

J	Chen, YR; Liu, XQ				Chen, Yaru; Liu, Xingqi			Aeolian activity in arid central Asia during the past 40000 years inferred from Lake Ailike, Xinjiang	CATENA												Aeolian activity is a mirror of climate change and a vital point for understanding the Earth's climate system in arid and semiarid regions. The processes and forcing mechanisms of aeolian activity in this region have remained debatable and inconclusive. In this study, we used accelerator mass spectrometry 14C dating, grain-size, and high-resolution X-ray fluorescence scanning data of the sediment core Ailike-2019 taken from Lake Ailike, Xinjiang, in arid central Asia, to reconstruct the variations in aeolian activity since the mid marine isotope stage (MIS) 3. The results reveal that aeolian activity in a dry climate strengthened during the mid-late MIS 3 (40-26.7 cal kyr BP) and the last glacial maximum (26.7-20 cal kyr BP), whereas the last deglaciation (20-12 cal kyr BP) was characterized by a weakening of aeolian activity with gradually increasing humidity in the Lake Ailike region. This period was followed by dustier and relatively wet conditions during the Holocene (12-0 cal kyr BP). The aeolian activity at Lake Ailike has been mainly controlled by Siberian high-pressure since the mid-MIS 3. Strong/weak aeolian activity is usually caused by frequent/infrequent cyclonic activity through cold polar air masses seasonal movement southward/northward induced by intensified/weakened Siberian high-pressure. Meanwhile, strong/weak cold polar air masses colliding with weak/strong warm tropical air masses might induce a long/short polar front duration, resulting in frequent/infrequent aeolian activity.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				JUN 15	2023	227								107106	10.1016/j.catena.2023.107106	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2023.107106		MAR 2023											WOS:000973170400001

Climate warming is driving groundwater evolution, altering the water balance and ecological stability of Asia's water towers. This study synthesizes the literature analysis and identifies the groundwater quantity evolution dynamics in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau dominated by climate change and synergized by various regional drivers. Research dynamics and methods for groundwater storage were assessed, with most studies finding that changes in precipitation evapotranspiration pushed groundwater storage to decrease in the south and increase in the north, with an overall increasing trend. The trends and drivers of groundwater storage changes still need to be further verified due to differences in calculation methods and data sources. Numerous studies have demonstrated that changes in climate and permafrost are important drivers of groundwater quantity evolution. Reducing the uncertainty of model parameters and improving the understanding of groundwater movement and environmental change processes to improve groundwater flow simulation. This remains a top priority for the study of groundwater quantity evolution processes and trends in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Despite the remarkable progress of current research, studies and monitoring of regional groundwater evolution are still missing or inadequate, especially in environmentally hostile and sparsely populated areas. We propose three considerations for future research, combining satellite remote sensing data and enhanced water cycle monitoring elements and densities, coupling multivariate data such as isotopes to develop advanced coupled cryosphere-groundwater numerical modeling methods, and considering various ecological and environmental effects arising from groundwater quantity evolution.

Assigning Sex and Reproductive Stage to Adult Lake Sturgeon using Ultrasonography and Common Morphological Measurements	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Sex determination of fish species is difficult to assess when sexual dimorphism and gametes are not apparent. For threatened and endangered fish species, noninvasive techniques are needed when determining sex to minimize stress and the potential for mortality. We evaluated the use of a portable ultrasound unit to determine sex of Lake Sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens in the field. Ultrasound images were collected from 9 yellow-egg (F2, F3), 32 black-egg (F4, F5), and 107 fully developed male (M2) Lake Sturgeon. Two readers accurately assigned sex to 88-96% of fish, but accuracy varied in relation to maturity stage. Black-egg females and fully developed males were correctly identified for 89-100% of the fish sampled, while these two readers identified yellow-egg females only 33% and 67% of the time. Time spent collecting images ranged between 2 and 3 min once the user was comfortable with operating procedures. Discriminant analysis revealed the total length : girth ratio was a strong predictor of sex and maturity, correctly classifying 81% of black-egg females and 97% of the fully developed males. However, yellow-egg females were incorrectly classified on all occasions. This study shows the utility of using ultrasonography and a total length : girth ratio for sex determination of Lake Sturgeon in later reproductive stages around the spawning season.

Modeling Antarctic subglacial lake filling and drainage cycles	CRYOSPHERE												The growth and drainage of active subglacial lakes in Antarctica has previously been inferred from analysis of ice surface altimetry data. We use a subglacial hydrology model applied to a synthetic Antarctic ice stream to examine internal controls on the filling and drainage of subglacial lakes. Our model outputs suggest that the highly constricted subglacial environment of our idealized ice stream, combined with relatively high rates of water flow funneled from a large catchment, can combine to create a system exhibiting slow-moving pressure waves. Over a period of years, the accumulation of water in the ice stream onset region results in a buildup of pressure creating temporary channels, which then evacuate the excess water. This increased flux of water beneath the ice stream drives lake growth. As the water body builds up, it steepens the hydraulic gradient out of the overdeepened lake basin and allows greater flux. Eventually this flux is large enough to melt channels that cause the lake to drain. Lake drainage also depends on the internal hydrological development in the wider system and therefore does not directly correspond to a particular water volume or depth. This creates a highly temporally and spatially variable system, which is of interest for assessing the importance of subglacial lakes in ice stream hydrology and dynamics.					; Nowicki, Sophie/D-5114-2012	Dow, Christine/0000-0003-1346-2258; Walker, Ryan Thomas/0000-0002-0440-1878; Werder, Mauro/0000-0003-0137-9377													1994-0416	1994-0424					2016	10	4					1381	1393		10.5194/tc-10-1381-2016	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-1381-2016													WOS:000379422700002

The results demonstrated that the diurnal variations of the sensible heat flux (H) and latent heat flux (LE) were different from that of the net radiation (R-n). R-n reached its peak value at the local noon, whereas H peaked in the morning and LE peaked in the afternoon. On a seasonal scale, H and LE were also different from R-n. The maximum value of R-n occurred in June, while the maxima of H and LE were observed in September. Lake evaporation was quantified with a daily mean value of 2.7 mm d(-1) and a total amount of 417.0 mm during the study period. In addition, evaporation from Lake Serling Co was compared with two types of pan evaporation (D20 pan and E601B pan) and potential evaporation on the land surface. The variability of conversion coefficients between lake evaporation, D20/E601B pan and potential evaporation indicate that coefficients varied depending on the month and could not be defined as a single experimental value.					; Song, Hong-tao/ACD-9242-2022; Ma, Ning/AEN-5541-2022	Ma, Ning/0000-0003-4580-0661; 													0026-1165	2186-9057					2016	94	5					453	465		10.2151/jmsj.2016-023	http://dx.doi.org/10.2151/jmsj.2016-023													WOS:000386593900005

The influence of water stress on grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) shoots in a cool, humid climate: growth, gas exchange and hydraulics	FUNCTIONAL PLANT BIOLOGY												Recent climatic trends of higher average temperatures and erratic precipitation patterns are resulting in decreased soil moisture availability and, consequently, periods of water stress. We studied the effects of seasonal water stress on grapevine (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Riesling grafted onto 101-14 (Vitis riparia Michx.xVitis rupestris Scheele) rootstock) shoot growth, leaf gas exchange, xylem morphology and hydraulic performance in the cool-climate Finger Lakes region of New York. A plastic rain exclusion tarp was installed on the vineyard floor to create a soil moisture deficit and consequently induce vine water stress. Weekly measurements of predawn leaf and midday stem water potentials ((md)) were made, and two contrasting shoot length classes, long (length >2.0m) and short (length <1.0m), were monitored. Growth of both long and short shoots was positively correlated with (md) but no difference in water status was found between the two. Compared with rain-fed vines, water-stressed vines had lower photosynthesis and stomatal conductance later in the season when (md) dropped below -1.2MPa. Long shoots had three-fold higher xylem-specific hydraulic conductivity values than short shoots. Long shoots experiencing water stress were less vulnerable to xylem cavitation than shorter shoots even though they had more large-diameter vessels. The lower vulnerability to cavitation of long shoots may be attributed to less xylem intervessel pitting being found in long shoots, consistent with the air-seeding hypothesis, and suggests that a hydraulic advantage enables them to maintain superior growth and productivity under water stress.					; Pagay, Vinay/AAT-6980-2021	Pagay, Vinay/0000-0003-1916-2758; 													1445-4408	1445-4416					2016	43	9					827	837		10.1071/FP16017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP16017								32480507					WOS:000382646500003

Understanding its feeding ecology is a basic, but essential tool for interpreting its impact. To assess which factors determine the diet of S. fontinalis we analyzed more than 500 stomachs from several introduced populations from the Gran Paradiso National Park (GPNP, Western Italian Alps) and we measured the availability of several prey groups (zooplankton, aquatic invertebrates, terrestrial invertebrates). We complemented the study with a short, but exhaustive literature review on the S. fontinalis feeding ecology. In general the food composition reflected the availability of prey -confirming that S. fontinalis is an opportunistic predator- and was influenced by habitat type (stream vs lake), fish size, and seasonality. The obtained results were discussed in the light of the existing literature on the feeding ecology and ecological impact of S. fontinalis. Large benthonic insects account for a substantial part of the diet of stream dwelling brook trout, while they are almost absent both in the diet and in the prey species pool of lake-dwelling brook trout, probably reflecting a stronger ecological impact in the lakes.					; Tiberti, Rocco/AAM-7103-2021	Tiberti, Rocco/0000-0003-1617-8826; CANEDOLI, CLAUDIA/0000-0003-3041-3968; Rolla, Matteo/0000-0003-4045-8289; 													1129-5767	1723-8633					2016	75	3					488	507		10.4081/jlimnol.2016.1366	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2016.1366													WOS:000385855900006
J	Mayer, A; Winkler, R; Fry, L				Mayer, Alex; Winkler, Richelle; Fry, Lauren			Classification of watersheds into integrated social and biophysical indicators with clustering analysis	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												In this work, we classify watersheds in the US portion of the Great Lakes basin according to a wide range of social and environmental characteristics. Classified watershed indicators serve to provide organizing principles for prescribing effective management strategies and for developing regional scale monitoring and modeling efforts. Classifications also provide a means for synthesizing seemingly disparate ecological attributes into powerful indicators. We use a robust watershed classification scheme based on cluster analysis that integrates a set of 12 social and environmental factors chosen to reflect the state of water resources in the Great Lakes basin. We found five statistically distinct classified watershed indicators: Urban Centers, Intensive Agriculture, Cultivated Rural, Northwoods, and Lakes Destinations. Within these classifications, we distinguished relationships between impacts on water resources and biophysical, demographic, land-use, and social characteristics of the landscape. We found that agricultural areas can be divided into those with high and low water impact, and that watersheds with considerable influence of seasonal homes are further distinguished into watersheds with inland lakes and relatively high socioeconomic status, contrasted with watersheds with wetlands and relatively low socioeconomic status. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Extreme nomadism in desert waterbirds: flights of the banded stilt	BIOLOGY LETTERS												In contrast towell-studied Northern Hemisphere birds with spatially and temporally predictable seasonal migrations, waterbirds in desert biomes face major challenges in exploiting stochastic, rich, yet short-lived resource pulses in vast arid landscapes, leading to the evolution of nomadic behaviour. An extreme example is the banded stilt (Cladorhynchus leucocephalus), an opportunistic colonial breeder at remote inland salt lakes after infrequent rain events. Using satellite telemetry on 21 birds (tracked for a mean of 196.2 days), we reveal extensive, rapid and synchronized movement among individuals to and from salt lakes. Two birds left coastal refugia for the inland following rain, flying 1000-2000 km, while 12 others rapidly moved a mean of 684 km (range 3571298 km) away from drying inland sites to the coast. Two individuals moved longitudinally across the continent, departing and arriving at the same points, yet travelling very different routes; one bird moving more than 2200 km in less than 2.5 days, the other more than 1500 km in 6 days. Our findings reveal movements nearly twice as long and rapid as recorded in other desert waterbirds. We reveal capability to rapidly detect and exploit ephemeral wetland resource pulses across the stochastic Australian desert.

However, macrophyte over-growth research has been mainly confined to the field of invasion ecology, and eutrophication research has been primarily limited to phytoplankton-dominated eutrophication. In this study, the impacts of macrophytes on the internal N cycle were studied utilizing inference statistics with field-scale observation data from several deliberately selected contrasting regions (i.e., with and without macrophytes and with and without water flow) in 13 semiconnected sublakes in a single large MDE lake based on the before-after-control-impact analysis method. The t test between the impact and control regions, combined with the macrophyte N stock variation and the vertical sediment N diffusion analysis, indicates that macrophyte biodynamics, not physiochemical dynamics, dominate the sustainable internal N cycle, leading to macrophyte overgrowth in MDE lakes. Sediment N is absorbed and stored in macrophytes during the growing season and then begins to return to sediment during the withering period, forming a sustainable internal N cycle. Therefore, the restoration of eutrophication should emphasize limiting the self-enforced "sediment-macrophyte" N cycle rather than controlling only water N content or sediment N release. A practical strategy was proposed using the synergetic considerations of both the sediment N removal efficiency and the ecological interruptions.

Isotopic insights on continental water sources and transport in the mountains and plains of Southern South America	ISOTOPES IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH STUDIES												Hosting the flattest sedimentary plains and highest Andean range of the continent, southern South America faces hydrological transformations driven by climate and land use changes. Although water stable isotopes can help understand these transformations, regional synthesis on their composition is lacking. We compiled for the first time a dataset of H and O isotopic composition for 1659 samples (precipitation, rivers, groundwater and lakes) along latitude (22.4 degrees S to 41.6 degrees S), longitude (55.3 degrees W to 71.5 degrees W), elevation (1-4700 m) and precipitation (similar to 50 to similar to 1500 mm/a) gradients encompassing the Chaco-Espinal-Pampas plains, their adjacent Andean Cordillera and smaller mountain ranges in-between. Emerging patterns reveal (i) only slight seasonal isotope trends in precipitation with no effects of event size, (ii) Atlantic/Amazonian vs. Pacific moisture supply to rivers north and south of the 'arid diagonal' of the continent, respectively, (iii) uniform isotopic composition in Atlantic/Amazonian-fed rivers vs. poleward isotope enrichment in Pacific-fed rivers caused by the elevation decline of the Andes, (iv) strong direct evaporation effect in rivers and shallow (<1 m) phreatic groundwater of the plains. We provide the first integrated water isotope geographical patterns of southern South America helping to improve our understanding of its water cycling patterns at the atmosphere and the land.					; Jobbágy, Esteban/A-6293-2010; Nosetto, Marcelo/JSK-2886-2023; Poca, María/AAG-7843-2021	Nosetto, Marcelo/0000-0002-9428-490X; Poca, Maria/0000-0001-9160-1036; 													1025-6016	1477-2639				NOV 1	2020	56	5-6			SI		586	605		10.1080/10256016.2020.1819264	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10256016.2020.1819264		SEP 2020						32940532					WOS:000570258900001

Excessive N input has resulted in serious agricultural nonpoint pollution. Water and N management are two important approaches to regulating N loss from paddy fields. This study aimed to determine N losses through ammonia volatilization, runoff, and leaching from a paddy field during the rice-growing season in Taihu Lake region. Field experiments with two water and two N managements were conducted. The N exported to the environment through ammonia volatilization, runoff, and leaching from the paddy field was 37.2 kg N ha(-1) to 102 kg N ha(-1), with ammonia volatilization accounting for 69.6% to 83.5% of N loss. Ammonium and dissolved organic N significantly contributed to N loss through runoff and leaching. Controlled irrigation and site-specific N management (CS) significantly decreased N losses through ammonia volatilization, runoff, and leaching. Compared with the N and irrigation water inputs in traditional water and N management, those generated by controlled irrigation and site-specific N management were reduced by 34.6% to 43.0% and 59.2% to 63.3%, respectively. Moreover, the reduction in N and water input in the CS paddy field enabled the maintenance of high rice yield; it significantly increased N use efficiency by 15.1% to 34.9% and decreased the N exported to the environment by ammonia volatilization, runoff, and leaching by 53.1% to 56.1%. Therefore, the joint application of controlled irrigation and site-specific N management efficiently reduces agricultural nonpoint pollution through N loss from paddy fields.					xu, junzeng/I-9266-2014														0010-3624	1532-2416				SEP 8	2013	44	16					2393	2407		10.1080/00103624.2013.803564	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2013.803564													WOS:000322867000005

Wetland destruction and quality loss may affect negatively also boreal breeding ducks in which habitat selection often needs balancing between important determinants of habitat suitability. In Finland duck population trajectories are habitat-specific, while the reasons behind are poorly understood. In this research, we studied the balance of nest predation risk and invertebrate food abundance in boreal breeding ducks in Finland at 45 lakes and ponds in 2017 and 2018. We surveyed duck pairs and broods from these and 18 additional water bodies. We evaluated nest predation by monitoring artificial nests with camera traps over a 7-day exposure period and sampled invertebrates from water bodies using emergence and activity traps. Camera trap results indicate that predation risk was higher in the water bodies surrounded by agricultural land than in forestland. Ponds (seasonal, beaver, and man-made) had lower nest predation risk, and they were also more invertebrate-rich than permanent lakes. In addition, artificial nests further away from water bodies had higher survival than shoreline nests. Habitat use of duck pairs was not associated with invertebrate food, but duck broods preferred habitats rich in food. High nest predation pressure in shorelines of especially agricultural landscapes may contribute to the declining population trends of ducks in Finland. Controlling predators could be an important conservation action to improve duck breeding success. This research underlines the benefits of the availability of different water body types for breeding ducks. There is an urgent need to pay attention to protecting seasonal ponds, while the lack of flooded waters may be mitigated by favouring beavers or creating man-made ponds. We studied the effects of wetland quality on boreal breeding ducks from two important aspects: nest predation and food availability. Duck food availability is low and nest predation pressure is high at permanent lakes, while ponds (seasonal, beaver, man-made) were shown to be food-rich habitats with low nest predation pressure. Our results emphasize the benefits of different wetland types in the landscape for the breeding ducks.image					; Pöysä, Hannu/JBS-4832-2023; Nummi, Petri/AAU-9666-2021; Miettinen, Elmo/JTU-7232-2023	Miettinen, Elmo/0000-0002-5354-7531; Holopainen, Sari/0000-0002-3271-4468; 													2045-7758					FEB	2024	14	2							e11011	10.1002/ece3.11011	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.11011								38343569					WOS:001159863600001

Based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, combined with the geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) technology, we used the index WI2019 to extract and analyze the water body area changes of the Bosten Lake basin from 2000 to 2021 when the threshold value is -0.25 and the slope mask is 8 degrees. The driving factors of water body area changes were also analyzed using the partial least squares-structural equation model (PLS-SEM). The result shows that in the last 20 years, the area of water bodies in the Bosten Lake basin generally fluctuated during the dry, wet, and permanent seasons, with a decreasing trend from 2000 to 2015 and an increasing trend between 2015 and 2019 followed by a steadily decreasing trend afterward. The main driver of the change in wet season water bodies in the Bosten Lake basin is the climatic factors, with anthropogenic factors having a greater influence on the water body area of dry season and permanent season than that of wet season. Our study achieved an accurate and convenient extraction of water body area and drivers, providing up-to-date information to fully understand the spatial and temporal variation of surface water body area and its drivers in the basin, which can be used to effectively manage water resources.

J	Nkiaka, E; Bryant, RG; Kom, Z				Nkiaka, Elias; Bryant, Robert G.; Kom, Zongho			Understanding Links Between Water Scarcity and Violent Conflicts in the Sahel and Lake Chad Basin Using the Water Footprint Concept	EARTHS FUTURE												Whilst there are several empirical studies linking water scarcity and violent conflicts, existing quantitative studies use mostly climate and environmental variables even though such variables have been shown to not be strong predictors of water conflicts by some studies. The aim of this study was to use the water footprint concept and the Falkenmark index to identify water scarcity hotspots at the sub-national scale and to understand the links between water scarcity and violent conflicts in the Sahel and Lake Chad Basin over a period of two decades (2000-2021). We achieve this by developing five water scarcity metrics at a monthly timescale using runoff, soil moisture, potential evapotranspiration, water consumption and demographic data. The developed metrics show high levels of water scarcity across the study area during the dry, pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Analyses further reveal high green water scarcity (GWS) (soil moisture deficit) and low Falkenmark index scores (water stress) during the dry, pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons, across all reported water conflict locations. This suggest that there is an indirect link between GWS, the Falkenmark index scores and water conflicts. Results from this study may be used to enhance water management, mitigate, and prevent water conflicts in the study area and likewise the methodology adopted may be used to address water scarcity and conflicts in other regions. According to the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, climate change is expected to increase the prevalence of conflicts across the world due to resources scarcity. The situation is expected to be exacerbated in regions with high population density, low socio-economic development, and high dependence on agriculture. Even though resources scarcity and conflict remain a topical issue within research and development arenas, establishing the direct link between the two has remained problematic. This may probably be due to a lack of an integrated approach to address this issue in a transparent way. Using an integrated approach involving several water scarcity metrics, this study shows that water conflicts in the Sahel and Lake Chad Basin are closely related to soil moisture deficit and population-driven water scarcity during different seasons of a calendar year. By developing different water scarcity metrics at the sub-national and seasonal scales, we have a clearer understanding of which water scarcity metrics are closely linked to conflicts and when water conflicts are prevalent. This implies that approaches to mitigate and prevent water conflicts may target specific water scarcity metrics and seasons within a calendar year. Water scarcity metrics are used to identify water scarcity hotspots and to understand the links between water scarcity and violent conflicts Water scarcity metrics show varying levels of water scarcity across the study area with capital cities being the most affected areas High green water scarcity (soil moisture deficit) and low Falkenmark index scores (water stress) are closely linked to water conflicts					Kom, Zongho/AAV-7123-2021; Bryant, Robert/C-7737-2009	Kom, Zongho/0000-0002-3294-8651; Bryant, Robert/0000-0001-7943-4781														2328-4277				FEB	2024	12	2							e2023EF004013	10.1029/2023EF004013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023EF004013													WOS:001154902200001

The Variation in the Water Level of Lake Baikal and Its Relationship with the Inflow and Outflow	WATER												Lake Baikal is the largest freshwater lake in the world, accounting for about 20% of the world's fresh surface water. The lake's outflow to the ocean occurs only via the Angara River, which has several hydroelectric power plants (HPPs) along its watercourse. The first such HPP, Irkutsk HPP, was built in 1956 and is located 60 km from the Angara River's source. After two years, the backwater from this HPP expanded to the lake shores and began raising the Baikal Lake level. Currently, there is a dynamic balance between the new lake level, the lake inflow from its tributaries, and the Angara River discharge through the Irkutsk HPP. However, both the Angara River discharge and the Baikal Lake level were distorted by the HPP construction. Thus, to understand the changes to the lake basin over the past century, we first needed to estimate naturalized lake levels that would be if no HPP was ever built. This was an important task that allowed (a) the actual impact of global changes on the regional hydrological processes to be estimated and (b) better management of the HPP itself to be provided through future changes. With these objectives in mind, we accumulated multi-year data on the observed levels of Lake Baikal, and components of its water budget (discharge of main tributaries and the Angara River, precipitation, and evaporation). Thereafter, we assessed the temporal patterns and degree of coupling of multi-year and intra-annual changes in the lake's monthly, seasonal, and annual characteristics. The reconstruction of the average monthly levels of Lake Baikal and the Angara River water discharge after the construction of the Irkutsk HPP was based on the relationship of the fluctuations with the components of the Lake water budget before regulation. As a result, 123-year time series of "conditionally natural" levels of Lake Baikal and the Angara River discharge were reconstructed and statistically analyzed. Our results indicated high inertia in the fluctuations in the lake level. Additionally, we found a century-long tendency of increases in the lake level of about 15 cm per 100 years, and we quantified the low-frequency changes in Lake Baikal's water levels, the discharge of the Angara River, and the main lake tributaries. An assessment of the impact of the Irkutsk HPP on the multi-year and intra-annual changes in the Lake Baikal water level and the Angara River discharge showed that the restrictions on the discharge through the HPP and the legislative limitations of the Lake Baikal level regime have considerably limited the fluctuations in the lake level. These fluctuations can lead to regulation violations and adverse regimes during low-water or high-water periods.

Seasonal fluctuations in their water depth drive changes in nutrients and total primary productivity, which directly and indirectly affect submerged macrophyte biomass. To investigate how water depth and environmental variables affect submerged macrophyte biomass, we surveyed six sub-lakes in the Poyang Lake floodplain, China, during the flood and dry seasons of 2021. Dominant submerged macrophytes include Vallisneria spinulosa and Hydrilla verticillata. The effect of water depth on the biomass of these macrophytes varied between the flood and dry seasons. In the flood season, there was a direct effect of water depth on biomass, while in the dry season only an indirect effect was observed. During the flood season, the direct effect of water depth on the biomass of V. spinulosa was less than the indirect effect, with water depth primarily affecting the total nitrogen, total phosphorus and water column transparency. Water depth directly, positively affected H. verticillata biomass, with this effect being greater than the indirect effect by affecting the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus content in the water column and sediment. During the dry season, water depth affected H. verticillata biomass indirectly through sediment carbon and nitrogen content, while for V. spinulosa, the effect on biomass was indirect through carbon content of the sediment and water column. The main environmental variables affecting submerged macrophyte biomass in the Poyang Lake floodplain during the flood and dry seasons, and the mechanisms through which water depth affects dominant submerged macrophyte biomass, are identifled. An understanding of these variables and mechanisms will enable improved management and restoration of wetland.					; Zhang, Quanjun/NYT-3493-2025; Yu, Xiubo/A-5875-2016	Zhang, Quanjun/0000-0001-6087-3928; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				JUN 15	2023	877								162690	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162690	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162690		MAR 2023						36894075					WOS:001055338000001

For 1956-2011, the inflow runoff displays small, statistically insignificant trends. However, for 2000-2011, significant downward trends are present. River runoff in the basin is significantly correlated with precipitation, while water intake and use is less influential; the most significant impact on river runoff is climate variability. To analyse the effects of water conservancy project scheduling and operation, we also compare the inflow and outflow runoff processes of typical large reservoirs before and after peak reservoir construction. The scheduling and operation of large reservoirs in the five rivers is known to play a supplementary role in dry season inflow runoff. The recent reduction in inflow runoff was mainly caused by basin precipitation; reasonable scheduling of water conservancy projects in the five rivers plays a positive role in safeguarding the water required by the dry season ecosystem in Poyang Lake.					; Lichuan, Wang/LCE-3228-2024; Chen, Xiangdong/KCX-7707-2024; Liu, Jiahong/AAG-1319-2021	Shao, Weiwei/0000-0002-4421-6781; 													0262-6667	2150-3435				APR	2017	62	4					575	587		10.1080/02626667.2016.1255745	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2016.1255745													WOS:000399493900006

In this paper, we present the results of a study on physiological and ecological traits of two introduced and three native macrophyte species in the Mantua lakes system (northern Italy). We compared their photophysiology, pigment content, leaf reflectance, and phenology in order to assess how the invasive Nelumbo nucifera and Ludwigia hexapetala perform compared to native species, Nuphar lutea, Nymphaea alba, and Trapa natans. We found L. hexapetala to have higher photosynthetic efficiency and to tolerate higher light intensities than N. nucifera and the native species especially at extreme weather conditions (prolonged exposure to high light and higher temperatures). Chlorophyll a and b, and carotenoids content of both allochthonous species were substantially higher than those of native plants, suggesting adaptive response to the ecosystem of Mantua lakes system. Higher variability of recorded data in invasive species was also observed. These observations suggest advanced photosynthetic efficiency of the invasive species, especially L. hexapetala, resulting in faster growth rates and higher productivity. This was supported by the evaluation of seasonal dynamics mapped from satellite remote sensing data. This study provides empirical evidence for the relationship between specific plant physiological traits and invasiveness of aquatic plant species, highlighting the importance of trait studies in predicting ecosystem-level impacts of invasive plant species.

To consider variations in the seasonal climate, topography, soil, land use, and land management, the upper Blue Nile basin was modelled in seven major sub-basins. The modelling showed significant spatial and temporal differences in the hydrological responses of different sub-basins and years. The long-term mean annual drainage ratios of the watersheds range from <0.1 to >0.65, and the annual drainage ratio of one sub-basin can vary from 0.22 to 0.49. Steep slopes, shallow soils, and cultivated areas increase the drainage ratios due to high surface runoff, low soil moisture content, and a smaller share of evapotranspiration. Various climate change scenarios predict more precipitation, and land use change scenarios foresee a higher share of cultivated areas due to population growth. In view of these trends, results from our study suggest that drainage ratios will increase and more available blue water can be expected for downstream stakeholders.					; Roth, Vincent/D-3045-2018; Subhatu, Alemtsehay/KEJ-1066-2024	Lemann, Tatenda/0000-0001-5507-1285; Roth, Vincent/0000-0001-7499-0762; 														2073-4441				JAN	2019	11	1							21	10.3390/w11010021	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11010021													WOS:000459735100020

Long-term studies and reproducibility: Lessons from whole-lake experiments	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												An important tenet of science is establishing the reproducibility of findings. While long-term studies may seem ill-suited to this goal, here we provide an example of reproducible results from repeated nutrient additions to a lake. We added nitrogen and phosphorus to Peter Lake in 9 yr of a 33-yr study. For seven of these nine additions, phytoplankton biomass, as measured by seasonal mean chlorophyll a, increased in proportion to the rate of nutrient loading. Additionally, for these seven additions, similar nutrient loading rates resulted in mean Chl a concentrations within a roughly twofold range-an outcome within expectation given uncontrolled sources of variation in a whole-lake manipulation. However, for two of the nine nutrient additions, Chl a concentrations were well below expected concentrations. The low chlorophyll responses co-occurred with years having the highest water color (absorbance of light at 440 nm). The number of years of nutrient additions was too limited to strongly test the influence of color at the scale of seasonal mean values. We, therefore, tested for the effect of phosphorus load and color, on Chl a using time series models of weekly data. At the weekly scale, there was a strong negative effect of color on chlorophyll concentration. Overall, the repeated nutrient additions provided a confirmation of existing models at the whole-lake scale and demonstrated an interesting exception to these models. Including repeated manipulations as part of long-term studies is an important way to test generalizations and to identify unexpected outcomes that raise new questions.					; Carpenter, Stephen/AAQ-6404-2020; Wilkinson, Grace/AAD-3202-2020	Carpenter, Stephen/0000-0001-8097-8700; Wilkinson, Grace/0000-0003-4051-2249; Pace, Michael/0000-0001-5945-6131; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2019	64			1	SI		S22	S33		10.1002/lno.11012	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11012													WOS:000456164100004

Intense predation of non-colonial, ground-nesting bird eggs by corvid and mammalian predators	WILDLIFE RESEARCH												Context. Loss of eggs to predators is a major cause of reproductive failure among birds. It is especially pronounced among ground-nesting birds because their eggs are accessible to a wide range of predators. Few studies document the main causes of clutch fate of ground-nesting birds. Aims. The main objective of the present study was to identify the major egg predator of red-capped plovers (Charadrius ruficapillus). We also investigated the effectiveness of the following two primary strategies available to the plovers to avoid egg predation: (1) the placement of clutches under vegetative cover and (2) avoiding predators by nesting outside the peak season of predator occurrence. Methods. Remote-sensing cameras were deployed on plover nests to identify egg predators and nests were monitored over four breeding seasons to document reproductive success and fate. An experiment using false clutches with model eggs investigated the influence of nest cover on the risk of egg predation throughout the year. Line-transect surveys were conducted to estimate the abundance of egg predators in and around the wetlands. Key results. The little raven (Corvus mellori) was the major egg predator identified in 78.6% of red-capped plover clutches and in 92.4% of false clutches that were camera-monitored. The hatching success of plover eggs was not influenced by nest cover (P = 0.36), but model egg survival in false clutches improved significantly with the presence of nest cover (P = 0.02). The abundance of little ravens increased during the plover breeding season and was highly negatively correlated with false clutch survival (r(pearson) = -0.768, P = 0.005). Conclusions. Little ravens were the major predator of red-capped plover eggs and their abundance increased significantly during the plover breeding season. Any influence of nest cover on hatching success of eggs may have been masked by the extremely high rate of egg loss associated with the increased little raven abundance during the plover breeding season. Implications. The high rate of egg predation is likely to have negative consequences on the local red-capped plover population, suggesting management is warranted. Little raven populations have expanded and, thus, their impact as egg predators needs to be investigated especially on threatened species.

The area is characterised by a semiarid climate, slow hydrological flow and geologic formations of predominantly volcanic origin. The present study aimed at mapping the extent of the water contamination in the area and to investigate the geogenic sources and processes involved in the release of As to the groundwater. Ground- and surface-water samples were collected from 24 different sites, including drinking water wells and rivers, in the southern Poopo basin in two different field campaigns during the dry and rainy seasons. The results revealed variable levels of As in shallow drinking water wells and average concentration exceeding the WHO guidelines value. Arsenic concentrations range from below 5.2 mu g/L (the detection level) to 207 mu g/L and averages 72 mu g/L. Additionally, high boron (B) concentrations (average 1902 mu g/L), and high salinity are further serious concerns for deteriorating the groundwater quality and rendering it unsuitable for drinking. Groundwater is predominantly of the Na-Cl-HCO3 type or the Ca-Na-HCO3 type with neutral or slightly alkaline pH and oxidising character. While farmers are seriously concerned about the water scarcity, and on a few occasions about salinity, there are no concerns about As and B present at levels exceeding the WHO guidelines, and causing negative long term effects on human health. Sediment samples from two soil profiles and a river bed along with fourteen rock samples were also collected and analysed. Sequential extractions of the sediments together with the calculation of the mineral saturation indices indicate that iron oxides and hydroxides are the important secondary minerals phases which are important adsorbents for As. High pH values, and the competition of As with HCO3 and dissolved silica for the adsorption sites probably seems to be an important process for the mobilisation of As in the shallow groundwaters of the region. Continuous monitoring and expansion of monitoring systems are necessary prerequisites for better understanding of the pattern of As mobilisation in the Southern Poopo Basin. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Study focus: The research investigates geochemical evolution and sources of chemical constituents in groundwater through an integrated methodology that integrates geochemical modeling, molar ratios, bivariate plots, and chemometric analysis. Groundwater samples (n = 240) were collected during wet and dry seasons to identify seasonal variations and the impact of geogenic and anthropogenic processes on groundwater quality. New hydrological insights: The findings revealed that Cl- and NO3- are associated with anthropogenic pollution. The Principal Component Analysis identified three main components associated with geogenic and anthropogenic processes, agricultural pollution, and mineral weathering. Hierarchical Cluster Analysis highlighted geogenic, anthropogenic, and evaporative influences. Groundwater in the basin is predominantly of Ca-HCO3 and Na-Cl types and is significantly undersaturated with calcite, dolomite, and fluorite, though seasonal variations show saturation in some samples. Elevated partial pressures of CO2 (pCO2) above atmospheric pCO2 in nearly all samples suggests active biogeochemical processes. Moreover, Gibbs plots, molar ratios, and bivariate plots, along with chloroalkaline indices (CAI-I & CAI-II) confirms influence of mineral weathering and ion exchange reactions within the aquifer system. Few locations show evaporation during the dry season. This study provides valuable insights for sustainable management of groundwater resources in semi-arid and arid regions.					; Kalin, Robert/E-8620-2011; Lawal, Ibrahim Mohammed/GZG-9546-2022; Shuaibu, Abdulrahman/HJH-3755-2023	Shuaibu, Abdulrahman/0000-0003-1679-0572; 														2214-5818				FEB	2025	57								102098	10.1016/j.ejrh.2024.102098	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2024.102098													WOS:001373978700001

Infection and risk factors of human and avian influenza in pigs in south China	PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE												The coinfection of swine influenza (SI) strains and avian/human-source influenza strains in piggeries can contribute to the evolution of new influenza viruses with pandemic potential. This study analyzed surveillance data on SI in south China and explored the spatial predictor variables associated with different influenza infection scenarios in counties within the study area. Blood samples were collected from 7670 pigs from 534 pig farms from 2015 to 2017 and tested for evidence of infection with influenza strains from swine, human and avian sources. The herd prevalences for EA H1N1, H1N1pdm09, classic H1N1, HS-like H3N2, seasonal human H1N1 and avian influenza H9N2 were 88.5, 64.5, 60.3, 57.8, 12.9 and 10.3 %, respectively. Anthropogenic factors including detection frequency, chicken density, duck density, pig density and human population density were found to be better predictor variables for three influenza infection scenarios (infection with human strains, infection with avian strains, and coinfection with H9N2 avian strain and at least one swine strain) than were meteorological and geographical factors. Predictive risk maps generated for the four provinces in south China highlighted that the areas with a higher risk of the three infection scenarios were predominantly clustered in the delta area of the Pearl River in Guangdong province and counties surrounding Poyang Lake in Jiangxi province. Identification of higher risk areas can inform targeted surveillance for influenza in humans and pigs, helping public health authorities in designing risk-based SI control strategies to address the pandemic influenza threat in south China.

The trench and rice area comprehensive results showed that pH (7.48-8.68), NH4+-N (0.2-1.09 mg/L), NO2--N (<0.052 mg/L) and conductivity (435-951 mu S/cm) were within the suitable ranges for P. clarkii and that turbidity (TU) was high during the crayfish harvesting and rice planting season. Annual averages of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), permanganate index (CODMn), and chlorophyll a (Chl.a) content were <2 (except in Nov-Dec), 0.25, 10 mg/L, and 50 mg/m(3) (especially in Nov-May, <10 mg/m(3)), respectively. Dissolved oxygen (DO) was below 4 mg/L in Mar-Sep, with a minimum of similar to 1 mg/L, and much higher in Oct-Feb. The maximum and minimum monthly average water temperature (WT) were 31.4 degrees C in July and 5.7 degrees C in December, while the maximum and minimum instantaneous WT were 39.7 degrees C and 2.5 degrees C, respectively . PCA analysis showed that the first three axes, which were mainly correlated with DO, WT and nutrient level, described most information of the parameters, and parameters showed seasonal changes. Some differences were observed in water parameters between the trenches and rice areas, i.e., trenches generally had higher TU, WT and DO, and lower TN, TP and CODMn, although no significant differences were found in some months and some parameters. The study revealed relatively low water nutrient level, probable extreme WT and DO level in some seasons, and certain differences between the trenches and rice areas in typical CRIS in China. Accordingly, some measures should be taken to improve the negative parameters: 1) enhance the water fertility; 2) increase DO, especially in Mar-Sep; 3) increase the trench and water depth to avoid extreme WT. And water quality management should be addressed in both trenches and rice areas.

J	Ali, K; Witter, D; Ortiz, J				Ali, Khalid; Witter, Donna; Ortiz, Joseph			Application of empirical and semi-analytical algorithms to MERIS data for estimating chlorophyll a in Case 2 waters of Lake Erie	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Lake Erie is biologically the most active lake among the Great Lakes of North America, experiencing seasonal harmful algal blooms (HABs). The early detection of HABs in the Western Basin of Lake Erie (WBLE) requires a more efficient and accurate monitoring tool. Remote sensing is an efficient tool with high spatial and temporal coverage that can allow accurate and timely detection of the HABs. The WBLE is heavily influenced by the surrounding terrestrial ecosystem via rivers such as the Sandusky River and the Maumee River. As a result, the optical properties of the WBLE are influenced by multiple color producing agents (CPAs) such as phytoplankton, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), organic detritus, and terrigenous inorganic particles. The diversity of the CPAs and their non-linear interactions makes these waters optically complex, and the task of optical remote sensing for retrieving estimates of CPAs more challenging. Chlorophyll a, which is the primary light harvesting pigment in all phytoplankton, is used as a proxy for algal biomass. In this study, several published remote sensing algorithms and band ratio models were applied to the reflectance data from the full resolution MERIS sensor to remotely estimate chlorophyll a concentrations in the WBLE. Efficiency of the sensor and the algorithms performance were tested through a least squares regression and residual analysis. The results indicate that, among the suite of existing bio-optical models, the Simis semi-analytical algorithm provided the best model results for measures of algal biomass in the optically complex WBLE with R (2) of 0.65, RMSE 0.85 mu g/l, (n = 71, P < 0.05). The superior results of this model in detecting chlorophyll a are attributed to several factors including optimizing spectral regions that are less sensitive to CDOM and the incorporation of correction factors such as absorption effects due to pure water (a (w)), backscatter (b (b)) from suspended matter and interference due to phycocyanin (delta), a major accessory pigment in the WBLE.

Assessing the effectiveness of household-level focal mass drug administration and community-wide mass drug administration for reducing malaria parasite infection prevalence and incidence in Southern Province, Zambia: study protocol for a community randomized controlled trial	TRIALS												Background: Mass drug administration (MDA) and focal MDA (fMDA) using dihydroartemisinin plus piperaquine (DHAp), represent two strategies to maximize the use of existing information to achieve greater clearance of human infection and reduce the parasite reservoir, and provide longer chemoprophylactic protection against new infections. The primary aim of this study is to quantify the relative effectiveness of MDA and fMDA with DHAp against no mass treatment (standard of care) for reducing Plasmodium falciparum prevalence and incidence. Methods/design: The study will be conducted along Lake Kariba in Southern Province, Zambia; an area of low to moderate malaria transmission and high coverage of vector control. A community randomized controlled trial (CRCT) of 60 health facility catchment areas (HFCAs) will be used to evaluate the impact of two rounds of MDA and fMDA interventions, relative to a control of no mass treatment, stratified by high and low transmission. Community residents in MDA HFCAs will be treated with DHAp at the end of the dry season (round one: November to December 2014) and the beginning of the rainy season (round two: February to March 2015). Community residents in fMDA HFCAs will be tested during the same two rounds for malaria parasites with a rapid diagnostic test; all positive individuals and all individuals living in their household will be treated with DHAp. Primary outcomes include malaria parasite prevalence (n = 5,640 children aged one month to under five-years-old), as measured by pre- and post-surveys, and malaria parasite infection incidence (n = 2,250 person-years among individuals aged three months and older), as measured by a monthly longitudinal cohort. The study is powered to detect approximately a 50 % relative reduction in these outcomes between each intervention group versus the control. Discussion: Strengths of this trial include: a robust study design (CRCT); cross-sectional parasite surveys as well as a longitudinal cohort; and stratification of high and low transmission areas. Primary limitations include: statistical power to detect only a 50 % reduction in primary outcomes within high and low transmission strata; potential for contamination; and potential for misclassification of exposure.					hamainza, busiku/AAF-1423-2020; Eisele, Thom/AAE-8958-2020	Yukich, Joshua/0000-0002-6160-5295; 													1745-6215					AUG 13	2015	16								347	10.1186/s13063-015-0862-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13063-015-0862-3								26268804					WOS:000359334700002

Meiobenthic community patterns of oligotrophic and deep Lake Constance in relation to water depth and nutrients	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Between February and April 2004, 48 sites in Lake Constance (Germany) were investigated to determine the distribution of the meiobenthic community, including 16 sites from the sub-littoral (13 -30 m water depth), 16 sites from the profundal (31-99 m) and 16 sites from the deep profundal (100-250 m). Lake-wide analysis showed no simple distribution pattern, but rather a heterogenic meiobenthic community composition, with nematodes representing the dominant group (48.7 %), followed by rotifers (27.7 %), harpacticoids (7.7 %), copepods (5.0 %), oligochaetes (3.7 %), ostracods (3.1 %), nauplii (1.9 %) and tardigrades (1.2 %). The relative abundances of all other investigated meiobenthic groups (cladocerans, chironomids, arachnids, gastrotrichs) were below 1 %. The densities of meiobenthic organisms varied greatly between sites, with nematodes reaching up to 3,336,676 and rotifers up to 6,357,008 individuals per m(2). The abundances of most organisms varied significantly between the different water zones. Nematodes, copepods, nauplii and cladocerans, however, were equally distributed between sub-littoral and the profundal zones. Organisms showed their highest levels of abundance in the sub-littoral zone, with the exception of harpacticoids and ostracods, which were most abundant in the profundal and deep profundal respectively. A multivariate statistical analysis revealed that besides Chl-a explaining 47 % of the variance degenerated algae, water depth, mean grain size, organic carbon, C/N ratio and total phosphorus were significantly correlated with lake-wide community structure. In the sub-littoral, mean grain size was the most important parameter explaining 25.4 % of the variance, while in the profundal Chl-a (29.4 %) and in the deep profundal algae pigments (38.6 %) were the most important parameters for meiofaunal distribution and environmental variables.

Understanding the relative importance of vertical and horizontal flow in ice-wedge polygons	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Ice-wedge polygons are common Arctic land-forms. The future of these landforms in a warming climate depends on the bidirectional feedback between the rate of ice-wedge degradation and changes in hydrological characteristics. This work aims to better understand the relative roles of vertical and horizontal water fluxes in the subsurface of polygonal landscapes, providing new insights and data to test and calibrate hydrological models. Field-scale investigations were conducted at an intensively instrumented location on the Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO) near Utqia.gvik, AK, USA. Using a conservative tracer, we examined controls of microtopography and the frost table on subsurface flow and transport within a low-centered and a high-centered polygon. Bromide tracer was applied at both polygons in July 2015 and transport was monitored through two thaw seasons. Sampler arrays placed in polygon centers, rims, and troughs were used to monitor tracer concentrations. In both polygons, the tracer first infiltrated vertically until encountering the frost table and was then transported horizontally. Horizontal flow occurred in more locations and at higher velocities in the low-centered polygon than in the high-centered polygon. Preferential flow, influenced by frost table topography, was significant between polygon centers and troughs. Estimates of horizontal hydraulic conductivity were within the range of previous estimates of vertical conductivity, highlighting the importance of horizontal flow in these systems. This work forms a basis for understanding complexity of flow in polygonal landscapes.					; Dafflon, Baptiste/G-2441-2015; Kneafsey, Timothy/H-7412-2014; Gomez-Velez, Jesus/AAU-6054-2020	Wales, Nathan/0000-0003-2442-7431; Dafflon, Baptiste/0000-0001-9871-5650; Gomez-Velez, Jesus/0000-0001-8045-5926; Kneafsey, Timothy/0000-0002-3926-8587; Soom, Florian/0000-0003-4297-2134; 													1027-5606	1607-7938				MAR 10	2020	24	3					1109	1129		10.5194/hess-24-1109-2020	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-1109-2020													WOS:000519722800001

However, little was considered about channel aggradation contributing downstream damage of outburst flood. Therefore, we investigated a debris flow dam's breaching and flooding process triggered by a 50-year heavy rainfall occurring on 17th June 2020 in Danba, China. The 6-m dam and a concomitant 1.04 x 10(6) m(3) barrier lake were formed by a tributary debris flow blocking the Xiaojin river. We used the dam breach overtopping and two-dimensional hydrodynamic models to simulate the whole process. The dam breach event persisted for 4.5 h with an outburst flood peak discharge of 823.5 m(3)/s, equal to a 20-year flood. It was noted that numerous sediments of approximately 5 x 10(6) m(3) were transported to the downstream channel, elevating the main channel bed and the terrace by 10-15 m and 2-5 m, respectively. Averaged transportation efficiency of an outburst flood is 1269.73 times greater than a 20-year seasonal flood. We simulated representative seasonal floods and outburst floods based on the pre-beach river geometry, which shows that previous channel capacity is sufficient to convey seasonal floods and the outburst flood. However, the outburst flood could easily submerge terraces and living land using after-breach geometry. Due to river aggradation lifting river elevation, deposited riverbed promotes sediment and flood evolute to living land, resulting in amplified damage. Additionally, we collected 59 dam breaches and demonstrated that local riverbed slopes could increase more than 100 times. During dam breaches, the sharp slope plays a key role in high sediment transportation efficiency. This study can promote understanding the formation and development of channel aggradation triggered by outburst flood and provide more reasonable considerations for disaster prevention and mitigation triggered by outburst flood hazard chain.

In this study, retrieval models of Chla were established based on the measured water spectra, spectral response function, measured Chla and the corresponding Sentinel-2 imagery of the Pingzhai Reservoir, the first large-scale trans-regional, trans-basin, and long-distance source reservoir in Guizhou. The retrieved results from 11 Sentinel-2 from 2018 to 2021 were used to analyze the spatiotemporal variations in Chla and the influence of different environmental factors on their spatial differentiation, providing a powerful approach for monitoring Chla in the Pingzhai Reservoir. Our binomial function model based on B8*(B7-B5) of Sentinel-2 yielded acceptable to high fitting accuracies, accounting for 89% of the variation in Chla. Overall, the Chla was relatively low, with a mean value of 10.24 mu g/L. Higher Chla were distributed in the catchment area, such as the Nayong River and the dam. Moreover, significant seasonal fluctuations and intra-year changes were observed . Spatio-temporal variations in Chla were influenced by human activities and environmental factors such as Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Total Nitrogen (TN), and Ammoniacal Nitrogen (NH4+-N). Our work provided compelling evidence that Sentinel-2 could be used for quantitative inversion of Chla in Pingzhai Reservoir.																				2279-7254				DEC 31	2022	55	1								10.1080/22797254.2022.2079565	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/22797254.2022.2079565		JUN 2022											WOS:000808191400001

Parametrization of a lake water dynamics model MLake in the ISBA-CTRIP land surface system (SURFEX v8.1)	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT												Lakes are of fundamental importance in the Earth system as they support essential environmental and economic services, such as freshwater supply. Streamflow variability and temporal evolution are impacted by the presence of lakes in the river network; therefore, any change in the lake state can induce a modification of the regional hydrological regime. Despite the importance of the impact of lakes on hydrological fluxes and the water balance, a representation of the mass budget is generally not included in climate models and global-scale hydrological modeling platforms. The goal of this study is to introduce a new lake mass module, MLake (Mass-Lake model), into the river-routing model CTRIP to resolve the specific mass balance of open-water bodies. Based on the inherent CTRIP parameters, the development of the non-calibrated MLake model was introduced to examine the influence of such hydrological buffer areas on global-scale river-routing performance. In the current study, an offline evaluation was performed for four river networks using a set of state-of-the-art quality atmospheric forcings and a combination of in situ and satellite measurements for river discharge and lake level observations. The results reveal a general improvement in CTRIP-simulated discharge and its variability, while also generating realistic lake level variations. MLake produces more realistic streamflows both in terms of daily and seasonal correlation. Excluding the specific case of Lake Victoria having low performances, the mean skill score of Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) is 0.41 while the normalized information contribution (NIC) shows a mean improvement of 0.56 (ranging from 0.15 to 0.94). Streamflow results are spatially scale-dependent, with better scores associated with larger lakes and increased sensitivity to the width of the lake outlet. Regarding lake level variations, results indicate a good agreement between observations and simulations with a mean correlation of 0.56 (ranging from 0.07 to 0.92) which is linked to the capability of the model to retrieve seasonal variations. Discrepancies in the results are mainly explained by the anthropization of the selected lakes, which introduces high-frequency variations in both streamflows and lake levels that degraded the scores. Anthropization effects are prevalent in most of the lakes studied, but they are predominant for Lake Victoria and are the main cause for relatively low statistical scores for the Nile River However, results on the Angara and the Neva rivers also depend on the inherent gap of ISBA-CTRIP process representation, which relies on further development such as the partitioned energy budget between the snow and the canopy over a boreal zone. The study is a first step towards a global coupled land system that will help to qualitatively assess the evolution of future global water resources, leading to improvements in flood risk and drought forecasting.					; Munier, Simon/D-3849-2011; Decharme, Bertrand/Z-4563-2019; Le+Moigne, Patrick/AAU-9622-2020	Choulga, Margarita/0000-0003-4393-931X; Le Moigne, Patrick/0000-0001-7993-0056; Decharme, Bertrand/0000-0002-8661-1464; Munier, Simon/0000-0001-7176-8584; boone, aaron/0000-0003-1901-7024; Guinaldo, Thibault/0000-0001-9792-8398													1991-959X	1991-9603				MAR 10	2021	14	3					1309	1344		10.5194/gmd-14-1309-2021	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-1309-2021													WOS:000627625300002
J	Ellis, C				Ellis, Christopher			Measuring Paleoindian range mobility and land-use in the Great Lakes/Northeast	JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL ARCHAEOLOGY												Distance and direction to source data were compiled on the main toolstones employed at 83 Paleoindian sites with concave-based points (ca. 11,000-10,000 B.P.) from across the recently deglaciated Great Lake-Northeastern area of North America. These data were used in order to more rigorously evaluate several much debated ideas about annual range mobility scale and land use patterns and how they changed over time as these groups colonized and settled into the area. Movements are significantly biased to north-south axes, strongly suggesting these represent mainly seasonal moves and procurement of toolstones during regular travels rather than by specialized task groups. Means of comparing the scale of range mobility to ethnographic norms are explored and the results clearly show that these groups, especially the earliest occupants, had large annual range mobility scales and distinctive patterns of land use that are rarely seen or approached historically. They had to have been intensively targeting widely spaced but relatively abundant resources on the landscape. The only ethnographic groups who come close to such patterns historically were all caribou hunters, a perspective consistent with the idea these groups regularly exploited that resource. As long suggested, these land use patterns are probably related to the colonization of new lands in which there were little or no existing populations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Persistent englacial drainage features in the Greenland Ice Sheet	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Surface melting on the Greenland Ice Sheet is common up to similar to 1400 m elevation and, in extreme melt years, even higher. Water produced on the ice sheet surface collects in lakes and drains over the ice sheet surface via supraglacial streams and through the ice sheet via moulins. Water delivered to the base of the ice sheet can cause uplift and enhanced sliding locally. Here we use ice-penetrating radar data to observe the effects of significant basal melting coincident with moulins and calculate how much basal melt occurred. We find that more melting has occurred than can be explained by the release of potential energy from the drainage of surface meltwater during one melt season suggesting that these moulins are persistent for multiple years. We find only a few persistent moulins in our study area that drain the equivalent of multiple lakes per year and likely remain active over several years. Our observations indicate that once established, these persistent moulins might be capable of establishing well-connected meltwater drainage pathways. Citation: Catania, G. A., and T. A.

The concentrations of twelve heavy metals commonly associated with environmental pollution were determined in the sediments of the lagoon by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS) and the cold vapor method was employed for Mercury (Hg). Nonempirical risk indices and empirical Sediment Quality Guidelines (SQGs) were used to assess the ecological risk associated with heavy metal in the sediments. The nonempirical risk indices showed that Hg, Arsenic (As), and Cadmium (Cd) are the major contributors to the ecological risk associated with heavy metal pollution in the ecosystem. Comparison of heavy metal concentrations to the Screening Quick Reference Table (SQuiRT) showed that mean concentration of Cd (5.22 and 4.88 mg kg(-1) in dry and rainy seasons, respectively) exceeds the effect range low (ERL) value (1.20 mg kg(-1)) in effect to biota. Industries sited around the lagoon have effluent output points in the lagoon serving as a major source of heavy metals coupled with indirect discharges from other sources. Heavy metals are nonbiodegradable, toxic and have the potential to alter ecosystem health, thus pollution sources should be effectively monitored and contained.					; Bawa-Allah, Kafilat/ABD-7310-2021	Bawa-Allah, Kafilat/0000-0001-5192-2388; 													1080-7039	1549-7860					2018	24	2					377	397		10.1080/10807039.2017.1384694	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10807039.2017.1384694													WOS:000424938100007

BIOACOUSTICS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SOUND AND ITS RECORDING												The aims of this study were to (i) assess the efficacy of passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) for detecting Arctic Charr at their spawning grounds and (ii) characterize the overall acoustic soundscape of these sites. PAM was carried out over three Arctic Charr spawning grounds in the UK, one lotic and two lentic. 24-h cycles of recordings were collected prior to and during the Arctic Charr spawning season, which was determined from data returns by simultaneous net monitoring. Acoustic analysis consisted of manual quantification of sound sources, Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI) calculation and spectral analysis in 1/3 octave band (SPL; dB re 1 mu Pa). In the lotic spawning ground, prior to the beginning of Arctic Charr spawning, SPL and ACI showed a restricted range of variation throughout the 24-h, while during spawning the night values of SPL and ACI were found to significantly increase, concurrently with the rate of gravel noise induced by fish spawning activities and fish air passage sounds. Both prior to and during the Arctic Charr run, the lentic soundscape was characterized by diel variation due to the daytime presence of anthropogenic noise and the night-time presence of insect calls, while only a few occurrences of fish air passage sounds and gravel noise were recorded. These findings suggest that PAM over Arctic Charr spawning grounds could provide meaningful information to be used in developing management plans for this threatened species, such as determining the location and time of arrival, diel pattern and length of spawning activities.					; Bolgan, Marta/AAV-8435-2021; Winfield, Ian/I-6085-2012	O'Brien, Joanne/0000-0003-0296-2660; Bolgan, Marta/0000-0002-4286-577X; Winfield, Ian/0000-0001-9296-5114; Gammell, Martin/0000-0001-9663-8989													0952-4622	2165-0586					2018	27	1					57	85		10.1080/09524622.2017.1286262	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09524622.2017.1286262													WOS:000415677400005

Nutrients' distribution and their impact on Pangani River Basin's ecosystem - Tanzania	ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY												Surface and groundwater from Pangani River Basin (PRB) were sampled in dry and wet seasons, analysed for dissolved organic and inorganic nutrients (N, P, Si and Urea). There was spatial and seasonal nutrients' variability, with enrichment of dissolved inorganic fractions accumulated from natural and anthropogenic sources. Silicates increased in dry season, whereas nitrate, ammonium, phosphate and urea increased in wet season; except for phosphate, other nutrients increased from upstream to the river mouth. High rate of chemical weathering possibly due to tropical climate and volcanic rocks has caused PRB to have higher concentration of silicates than average freshwater African Rivers. Contribution of PRB to the coast of Indian Ocean was 2.6, 39.0, 45.2, 67.4 and 5444.8 (mol/km(2)/yr) for nitrite, phosphate, ammonium, nitrate and silicates, respectively, which were lower than most of the tropical rivers in the world. Levels of nitrate and phosphate for most of the stations were higher than recommended levels for aquatic ecosystem health. Furthermore, observed hypoxia condition in some stations threatens aquatic life.

Macrophyte-induced thermal stratification in a shallow urban lake promotes conditions suitable for nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Densely vegetated shallow lakes often experience low water column nutrient levels and reduced phytoplankton growth, but in some cases a high phytoplankton biomass can co-exist with submerged macrophytes. The conditions that favour phytoplankton blooms within areas colonized by submerged macrophytes remain largely unexplored. We investigated changes in water quality variables and phytoplankton community composition data in relation to macrophyte-induced thermal stratification in a shallow urban lake. The results indicate that submerged macrophytes may favour internal loadings of phosphorus and low DIN:TP ratios, in periods when macrophyte-induced thermal stratification of the water column is common. Blooms of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria occurred under the strongly stratified conditions triggered by the high macrophyte biomass and elevated canopy, even though nitrogen limitation was apparent during the whole growing season. These findings suggest that submerged macrophytes can promote blooms of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria once they are sufficiently tall and dense to induce stable water column conditions.					; Marti, Clelia/H-5371-2014; Oldham, Carolyn/F-8458-2013; Hipsey, Matthew/C-3551-2009	Vilas, Maria P./0000-0002-9281-7717; Hipsey, Matthew/0000-0001-8386-4354; Oldham, Carolyn/0000-0003-2968-6889; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2018	806	1					411	426		10.1007/s10750-017-3376-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-017-3376-z													WOS:000416804200026

Statistical applications of physically based hydrologic models to seasonal streamflow forecasts	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Despite advances in physically based hydrologic models and prediction systems, long-standing statistical methods remain a fundamental component in most operational forecasts of seasonal streamflow. We develop a hybrid framework that employs gridded observed precipitation and model-simulated snow water equivalent (SWE) data as predictors in regression equations adapted from an operational forecasting environment. We test the modified approach using the semidistributed variable infiltration capacity hydrologic model in a case study of California's Sacramento River, San Joaquin River, and Tulare Lake hydrologic regions. The approach employs a principal components regression methodology, adapted from the Natural Resources Conservation Service, which leverages the ability of the distributed model to provide an added dimension to SWE predictors in a statistical framework. Hybrid forecasts based on data simulated at grid points acting as surrogates for ground-based observing stations are found to perform comparably to those based on their observed counterparts. When a larger selection of grid points are considered as potential predictors, hybrid forecasts achieve superior skill, with the largest benefits in watersheds that are poorly represented in terms of ground-based observations. Forecasts are also found to offer overall improvement over those officially issued by California's Department of Water Resources, although their specific performance in dry years is less consistent. The study demonstrates the utility of physically based models within an operational statistical framework, as well as the ability of the approach to identify locations with strong predictive skill for potential ground station implementation.

Temporal patterns in the social network of core units in Rwenzori Angolan colobus monkeys: Effects of food availability and interunit dispersal	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Multi-level societies are complex, nested social systems where basic social groups (i.e., core units) associate in a hierarchical manner, allowing animals to adjust their group sizes in response to variables such as food availability, predation, or conspecific threat. These pressures fluctuate over time and examining the extent to which this variation affects the clustering of core units into different tiers may be instrumental in understanding the evolution of multi-level societies. The goal of our study was to determine the degree of temporal variability in interunit associations in a multi-level society of Rwenzori Angolan colobus monkey (Colobus angolensis ruwenzorii), and to determine the social and ecological factors that underlie association patterns. The C. a. ruwenzorii multi-level society consists of at least three tiers, with core units clustering into clans that share a home range in a band tier. We performed social network analyses on 21 months of association data from 13 core units (totaling 139 identifiable individuals) at Lake Nabugabo, Uganda. We described the patterns of variation in core-unit associations over time and investigated how changes in rainfall, food availability, and interunit dispersals were correlated with these associations over the short-term (month to month) and long-term (year to year). Although clans were relatively stable, larger-scale changes in association patterns included the formation of an all-male unit and the transfer of one core unit between clans (within the band tier). Seasonally, core units associated significantly more when fruit, their preferred food source, was abundant (i.e., social networks were denser and more clustered) and there was no direct effect of rainfall seasonality or young leaf availability. Male dispersals also occurred more during periods of high fruit availability, suggesting that greater band cohesion allowed males to prospect and transfer between core units. Once males transferred, their previous and new units associated significantly more with one another than with other core units for 1-2 months postdispersal. The dispersal of five males from one core unit to another in a different clan co-occurred with this core unit switching its clan affiliation. By examining temporal shifts in social network structure among core units, this study shows the interconnected roles that food availability and dispersal have in shaping the C. a. ruwenzorii multi-level social system. Our findings highlight how ecological conditions can drive association patterns, impact interunit relationships, and influence social organization.

This study combines exploratory factor analysis with multilevel and structural equation modeling to: find spatial and temporal patterns of metal and metalloids in the Ctalamochita River Basin (Argentina); identify the processes responsible for the occurrence of these elements; and, establish relationships between latent variables of different aquatic compartments. For this purpose, the metal and metalloid concentration in different matrices was analyzed at sampling sites along 330 km of the river course, including seasonal variations. Our results indicate that the concentration of natural occurring elements in surface water increased downstream the catchment and during the warm-rainy season, as a consequence of surface runoff and groundwater discharge. In contrast, the spatial and seasonal variation in sediment showed an inverse pattern (negative correlation) compared to surface water. On the other hand, copper, zinc and lead were derived from anthropogenic sources, such as old mining areas and metal industries. Moreover, the input of these metals into the river evidenced a direct effect of surface water on sediment, Overall, the combined use of multilevel model and SEM allowed for a proper description of spatial and temporal patterns of metals and metalloids in the catchment, and successfully highlighted sources and processes influencing metal transport. The proposed methodological framework could be extended to wider spatial scales including nested regions, and could be applied to environmental studies dealing with repeated observations and multiple matrices.

This paper presents the result of a one-dimensional numerical modelling of lake ice cover, water temperature, as well as nutrient and phytoplankton dynamics in Lake 239 (Rawson Lake) located in the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA), Ontario, Canada. Using observed meteorological and inflow/outflow data, the Multi-year Lake simulation model (MyLake) was setup to replicate measured lake water temperature, ice-cover, dissolved organic carbon, particulate and dissolved phosphorus, and chlorophyll-a concentrations over the entire depth of the lake. The sensitivity of the lake to changes in climatic drivers, specifically to changes in surface air temperature and wind speed, was examined by incrementally changing the model input forcing for temperature and wind speed and mapping the resulting changes in the simulated outputs. The results show that lake processes are generally as sensitive to changes in wind speed as they are to changes in air temperature. Simulated changes in lake variables corresponding to projected changes in Global Climate Models (GCMs) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios reveal a general increase in lake water temperature and the corresponding decrease in lake ice thickness and ice cover duration under the changing climate. While lake water temperature increases at all depths, the shallow epilimnion layer is more sensitive to the changing climate than the deeper hypolimnion layer, reaching mean annual change value of +3.7 degree celsius for RCP 8.5 and the 2090s as compared to the 1990s baseline period. While the simulated change in lake ice thickness reaches -20 cm by 2090s for the RCP 8.5 scenario, the corresponding change in ice-cover duration reaches -47 days. These changes are shown to result in seasonal changes in the biogeochemical cycling over the depth of the lake with projected increases in chlorophyll-a concentration during ice covered season of December to May reaching up to +0.15 mg/m(3) for RCP 8.5 and the 2090s followed by a decrease during open water season of June to November reaching -0.15 mg/m(3) compared to the 1990s baseline period.

J	Dai, ZJ; Liu, JT; Xiang, YB				Dai, Zhijun; Liu, James T.; Xiang, Yunbo			Human interference in the water discharge of the Changjiang (Yangtze River), China	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES												This study analysed 130-year-long river flow and 58-year-long meteorological records, the volume capacity of reservoirs and water consumption records over the last 60 years of the Changjiang (Yangtze River) basin. The results show that there are strong periodicities in the river discharge at seasonal, and at 3-, 7-, 11- and 14.6-year cycles. The results also show that the river discharge has decreased noticeably, and the discrepancy between flood and dry-season flows has also decreased in the last 130 years. However, the basin-wide water discharge also showed spatial and temporal variability. In the 70-year period prior to 1949, the water discharge in the middle and lower reaches of the Changjiang did not show declining trends. Between 1949 and 2011, the water discharge in the upper and middle reaches of the river showed apparent decreasing trends. Yet, because of the modulation by large lakes in the middle reaches, the water discharge to the sea did not show any noticeable changes. The primary causes of the changes in water discharge in the Changjiang basin were basin-wide dam construction and water consumption. Therefore, a regulated index (RI) is proposed to quantify human activities in the river basin. Based on RI, the Changjiang basin was weakly regulated between 1950 and 1980, intermediately regulated between 1980 and 2010, and is highly regulated at present. This is expected to worsen by 2030.

J	Welker, JM				Welker, Jeffrey M.			ENSO effects on δ18O, δ2H and d-excess values in precipitation across the U.S. using a high-density, long-term network (USNIP)	RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY												RATIONALE Isotope (d18O and d2H values) ratios in precipitation have been central to understanding changes in Earth's climate as recorded in ice, coral, speleothems, lake varves and long-lived plants. Understanding how climate phases (i.e. ENSO) affect the spatial and temporal patterns of d18O and d2H values in precipitation has, however, been uncertain across the USA. METHODS A spatial precipitation isotope network (USNIP) has been established that aims to: (1) characterize the d18O, d2H and d-excess values in precipitation across the USA with the highest spatially dense network of measurements yet undertaken; (2) quantify the annual and seasonal patterns of precipitation d18O and d2H values that may be affected by ENSO climate phases; and (3) provide a new isotope database for scientific studies that can be incorporated into NEON, BASIN, GNIP, and IsoMAP. RESULTS On average, precipitation d18O and d2H values are very low in the northern Rocky Mountain region (similar to -15 parts per thousand d18O, and?similar to?-120 parts per thousand d2H), and precipitation d18O and d2H values are relatively higher along the Gulf Coast (similar to -5 parts per thousand d18O and -10 parts per thousand d2H) and in the Southeast. During El Nino periods the precipitation d18O and d2H values are lowest in northwest Montana, with precipitation that is depleted in 18O and 2H extending into northern Colorado, while moisture that is enriched in 18O and 2H continues to dominate the Gulf Coast. The annual average differences between the climate phases generally show especially depleted 18O and 2H in precipitation across the Rocky Mountain region during El Nino, compared with Neutral periods. CONCLUSIONS Detailed spatial and seasonal patterns of d18O, d2H and d-excess values provide fine-scale resolution not previously recognized. Climate phases of ENSO have major effects on the spatial patterns of d18O, d2H and d-excess values, being especially important on a seasonal basis in the Desert Southwest.

The knowledge about the effect of submerged vegetation types and water flow field on sediment total phosphorus (STP) and the relationship with environmental variables in eutrophic shallow lakes is limited. In this study, temporal and spatial characteristics of water and sediment nutrients in a typical subtropical shallow urban lake Hangzhou West Lake were evaluated, meanwhile, quantitative analyses were investigated to determine the contribution of water nutrients, sediment properties and submerged vegetation on retention and release of sediment total phosphorus. Results illustrated that the water nutrients characteristics are determined by the water flow field and season changes. Additionally, much lower Nitrogen/Phosphorus (N/P) ratio (6.29 +/- 3.25-16.82 +/- 1.54) of downstream locations compared to that (9.79 +/- 1.30-26.33 +/- 2.90)of upstream and midstream locations in lake water, which led to the inconsistent characteristics between water nutrients and water chlorophyll a (Chl-a) and trophic state index (TSI). Temporal and spatial distribution of STP determined by season changes, water flow field types, submerged vegetation types, and deposition of aluminium salt (Al-salts) originated from water diversion project. The effect of interception of submerged vegetation and flow velocities reduction induced by water flow field types changed are similar that both accelerate the phosphorus retention in sediments. Results of structural equation modeling illustrated that the main effect on STP is water nutrients including water total nitrogen (TN), Chl-a, and TSI, which implied that the nitrogen limitation is the key factor. Water nutrients significantly and directly affect (coefficient is 0.254) STP while submerged vegetation exhibited indirectly effect induced by water nutrients (coefficient is 0.077) and sediment properties (coefficient is 0.062). The loss of nitrogen and an increase in phosphorus mainly influence the submerged vegetation distribution, higher trophic level index and sediment phosphorus release.					zhang, yimeng/JLL-7337-2023; He, Feng/HHS-6457-2022														2213-2929	2213-3437				JUN	2022	10	3							107982	10.1016/j.jece.2022.107982	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2022.107982													WOS:000894472900006

The main objective of this study was to evaluate the water quality in aquifers that are the main source of fresh water for the eastern plains Urmia Lake, which has been drying up due to intensive land use/cover changes and climate change. We evaluated hydro-geochemical data and factors contributing to aquifer pollution and quality variation for nine aquifers in the vicinity of Urmia Lake during the dry and wet seasons from 2000-2020. Our methodology was based on the analysis of 10 years of data from 356 deep and semi-deep wells using GIS spatial analysis, multivariate statistical analysis, and agglomerative hierarchical clustering. We developed a Water Quality Index (WQI) for spatiotemporal assessment of the status of the aquifers. In doing so, we highlighted the value of combining Principal Component Analysis (PCA), WQI, and GIS to determine the hydro-geochemical attributes of the aquifers. We found that the groundwater in central parts of the study area was unsuitable for potable supplies. Anthropogenic sources of contamination, such as chemical fertilizers, industrial waste, and untreated sewage water, might be the key factors causing excessive concentrations of contaminants affecting the water quality. The PCA results showed that over 80% of the total variance could be attributed to two principal factors for most aquifers and three principal factors for two of the aquifers. We employed GIS-based spatial analysis to map groundwater quality in the study area. Based on the WQI values, approximately 48% of groundwater samples were identified as poor to unsuitable for drinking purposes. Results of this study provide a better hydro-geochemical understanding of the multiple aquifers that require preventive action against groundwater damage. We conclude that the combined approach of using a multivariate statistical technique and spatial analysis is effective for determining the factors controlling groundwater quality.

Prediction of future water availability in lakes of semi-arid regions is important as they are highly sensitive to climate variability. This study is to examine the water level fluctuations in Pakhal Lake, Telangana, India using a combination of a process-based hydrological model and machine learning technique under climate change scenarios. Pakhal is an artificial lake built to meet the irrigation requirements of the region. Predictions of lake level can help with effective planning and management of water resources. In this study, an integrated approach is adopted to predict future water level fluctuations in Pakhal Lake in response to potential climate change. This study makes use of the NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP) dataset which contains 21 Global Climate Models (GCMs) at a resolution of 0.25 x 0.25 degrees is used for the study. The Reliability Ensemble Averaging (REA) method is applied to the 21 models to create an ensemble model. The hydrological model outputs from Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) are used to develop the machine-learning based Support Vector Regression (nu-SVR) model for predicting future water levels in Pakhal Lake. The scores of the three metrics, correlation coefficient (R-2), RMSE and MEA are 0.79, 0.018 m, and 0.13 m, respectively for the training period. The values for the validation periods are 0.72, 0.6, and 0.25 m, indicating that the model captures the observed lake water level trends satisfactorily. The SWAT simulation results showed a decrease in surface runoff in the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 scenario and an increase in the RCP 8.5 scenario. Further, the results from nu-SVR model for the future time period indicate a decrease in future lake levels during crop growth seasons. This study aids in planning of necessary water management options for Pakhal Lake under climate change scenarios. With limited observed datasets, this study can be easily extended to the other lake systems.					; KEESARA, VENKATA REDDY/D-4424-2017; Sridhar, V/AAT-6676-2020	Jayanthi, Sri Lakshmi Sesha Vani/0000-0001-7911-8164; Sridhar, Venkataramana/0000-0002-1003-2247; KEESARA, VENKATA REDDY/0000-0002-6942-7585; 														2071-1050				JUN	2022	14	12							6974	10.3390/su14126974	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14126974													WOS:000816792000001
J	Jones, SE; Lennon, JT				Jones, Stuart E.; Lennon, Jay T.			A test of the subsidy-stability hypothesis: the effects of terrestrial carbon in aquatic ecosystems	ECOLOGY												Global change is altering the movement of materials across landscapes in ways that likely have major consequences for the functioning and stability of ecosystems. For example, the export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems is increasing globally. This browning phenomenon is expected to alter the stability of recipient aquatic ecosystems, but theory provides contrasting predictions about the form and direction of this response. We created a gradient in terrestrial DOC supply by adding humic substances on weekly basis to 10 experimental ponds (10(6) L each) over a growing season. The manipulation of terrestrial DOC supply had strong effects on the chemical, physical, and biological properties of the pond ecosystems. Light attenuation linearly increased with terrestrial DOC supply, which created a shading effect that negatively influenced whole-pond gross primary production and respiration. Despite this, bacterial contributions to basal energy mobilization and respiration increased with terrestrial DOC supply indicating that aquatic food webs were subsidized by terrestrial inputs. After establishing the DOC gradient, we used dynamic linear models to test the subsidy-stability hypothesis by measuring the resilience and sensitivity of each pond to a pulse nutrient perturbation. We found that recovery from the perturbation decreased nonlinearly along a gradient in terrestrial DOC supply. Reciprocal transplant experiments indicated that owing primarily to its light attenuating properties and recalcitrant nature, terrestrial DOC diminished aquatic ecosystem stability by reducing nutrient turnover rates (NTR). Together, our results demonstrate that global-change-mediated alterations in the movement of material and energy between habitats can have unpredictable and dramatic impacts on the reliability of ecosystem services.

J	McCarthy, TS				McCarthy, T. S.			THE OKAVANGO DELTA AND ITS PLACE IN THE GEOMORPHOLOGICAL EVOLUTION OF SOUTHERN AFRICA	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY												The Okavango Delta is southern Africa's largest wetland ecosystem and probably the most pristine large wetland ecosystem in the world. Alex du Toit was the first to recognize the role of faulting in the origin of the Delta, proposing that the Delta lies within a graben structure related to the East African Rift Valley system. The history of its rivers is more ancient, extending back to the breakup of Gondwana. Two mantle plumes initiated the breakup of Gondwana: the 140 Ma Karoo plume and the 130 Ma Parana-Etendeka plume. Domical uplift and rifting associated with these plumes created two major river systems: the Okavango-Zambezi-Limpopo system and the Vaal-Orange system. The climate at the time of breakup was hot and humid and the interior experienced extensive erosion, so much so that by the Oligocene (ca. 30 Ma), the sub-continent had been planed, to base level, rising only a few hundred metres above sea level and mantled by thick, leached soils (now known as the African Erosion Surface). Warping in the continent interior created uplifted arches and depressions, most notably the Kalahari basin. Arching severed the link between the lower Limpopo and its central African headwaters (Zambezi-Okavango), and a large lake formed in the Kalahari depression (Lake Palaeo-Makgadikgadi). This lake gradually disappeared, partly due to sedimentation but mainly due to the increasing dry climate. The East Africa Rift system commenced in the Afar about 30 Ma ago and began to propagate southwards. In southern Malawi and especially in Zambia, the path of rifting has not yet been clearly established and the region is characterized by numerous horsts and grabens. One of these grabens passes through the Okavango Delta. The formation of these grabens has profoundly affected the courses of the rivers in the region. The Okavango River debouches into the graben forming a large alluvial fan. Lakes have periodically existed at the toe of the Okavango fan where it abuts the bounding fault scarps, but these are not permanent. Some Okavango water discharges across the bounding fault scarps and flows into the Makgadikgadi depression to the southeast. The Okavango River catchment is largely underlain by Kalahari sand, which forms the major particulate sediment carried by the river. Consequently, sediment carried by the river is mainly fine sand, with little silt and mud. The dissolved solid concentration in the river water is low (ca. 40 mg/L) and consists mainly of silica and calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. However, the volume of water entering the Delta each year is large and hence the solutes constitute the largest component of the sediment carried into the Delta. The Okavango River discharges onto the alluvial fan where water is carried in channels that form the major primary distributaries. Channel margins are formed by vegetal material and are permeable, leaking water which sustains permanent swamps in the upper portion of the alluvial fan. The arrival of the seasonal flood increases the rate of channel leakage, forming the seasonal swamps on the lower fan. The advance of the flood water across the seasonal swamps is slow, as much of it infiltrates the ground, taking four to five months to traverse the 250 km length of the fan. Bedload is confined to channels and as water leaks through the channel margins, channel beds aggrade, increasing leakage, which further promotes bed aggradation. Channels eventually fail and water diverts elsewhere. Channel formation and failure results in a constant shift in the distribution of water across the Delta surface. The demise of a channel system results in desiccation of the surrounding peat, which is then destroyed by slow-burning peat fires. Nutrients and fine particulate material accumulated in the peat is released, enriching the soil. Most of the water delivered to the Delta annually is lost to the atmosphere by evapotranspiration because of the semi-arid climate. Transpiration of groundwater by terrestrial plants is the dominant means of water loss. The high transpiration rate of trees is particularly important: trees grow on islands and their transpiration lowers the water table beneath islands so there is a net flow of water towards islands. Solutes, especially silica and carbonates of calcium and magnesium, precipitate, leaving only the very soluble sodium carbonate in solution. Its concentration rises and impacts on the vegetation, resulting in a zonation in the distribution of plant species on islands. The salinity of the groundwater ultimately rises to the point where gravity induced advection occurs, thus transferring the sodium carbonate to the deep groundwater. This process prevents the formation of surface saline brine in the Delta and surface water remains fresh. The accumulation of precipitated solutes results in expansion and this form of chemical precipitation is the major mechanism of sedimentation in the distal regions of the Delta. Islands are mainly initiated as a consequence of termite activity during dry periods. Sand ridges which form by channel bed sedimentation may also result in islands. Constant changes in the distribution of water across the fan due to channel failure have profound effects on the ecology of the Delta: regions of swamp may revert to dry land, when rain flushes accumulated salts from the island soils; and formerly dry areas become seasonally or even permanently flooded. Such constant changes, operating on time-scales of decades to centuries, underpin the immense habitat diversity of the Okavango Delta.

There is doubt as to whether the pixel-based analysis (PBA) approach's answer to the lake's drying is a natural process or a result of human intervention. Here, a non-parametric Mann-Kendall trend test was applied to a 21-year record (2000-2020) of satellite data products, i.e., temperature, precipitation, snow cover, and irrigated vegetation cover (IVC). The Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud-computing platform utilized over 10 sub-basins in three provinces surrounding Lake Urmia to obtain and calcu-late pixel-based monthly and seasonal scales for the products. Canonical correlation analysis was employed in order to understand the correlation between variables and lake water level (LWL). The trend analysis results show significant increases in temperature (from 1 to 2 degrees C during 2000-2020) over May-September, i.e., in 87 %-25 % of the basin. However, precipitation has seen an insignificant decrease (from 3 to 9 mm during 2000-2019) in the rainy months (April and May). Snow cover has also decreased and, when compared with precipitation, shows a change in precipita-tion patterns from snow to rain. IVC has increased significantly in all sub-basins, especially the southern parts of the lake, with the West province making the largest contribution to the development of IVC. According to the PBA, this analysis underpins the very high contribution of IVC to the drying of the lake in more detail, although the contribution of climate change in this matter is also apparent. The development of IVC leads to increased water consumption					Nourani, Vahid/F-4051-2017; Andaryani, Soghra/ABG-6020-2021; Haghighi, Ali/AAE-6862-2021; Stisen, Simon/Q-2832-2017; Koch, Julian/D-2509-2015	Andaryani, Saghar (Soghra)/0000-0002-3806-7513; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				MAY 15	2023	873								162326	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162326	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162326		MAR 2023						36842572					WOS:000991950700001

Historical environmental change, including population growth, nutrient loading, introduced invasive species, and rising temperatures, has resulted in eutrophication and persistent cyanobacterial harmful algae blooms (cyanoHABs) over recent decades, particularly in the shallower gulfs, bays, and inlets. CyanoHABs impact fisheries and food web dynamics and compromise food and water security for nearshore fisher populations. In this study, we examine the social-ecological impact of freshwater blooms on fisher health in one of these eutrophic regions, Winam Gulf in Lake Victoria. CyanoHABs persist for months and produce microcystins and hepatotoxins at levels unsafe for human health. We assessed potential risk and contribution of microcystin exposure through fish consumption, in addition to exposure through water source, and conducted 400 fisher and 400 household surveys. Average microcystin concentrations exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline for drinking water consistently during the long dry season, and cyanobacterial cell counts surpassed WHO standards for recreational risk in 84% of samples. Hazard quotients for fish consumed by young children were 5 to 10 times higher than permissible levels. In addition, fishers chronicled profound ecosystem changes with direct impact on livelihood, fisheries, and water quality with 77.4% reporting a decline in profit or catch, 83.1% reporting adverse impacts of cyanoHABs on fish in the lake, and 98.2% reporting indicators of declining water quality in the lake overall. Through the application of a social-ecological lens to a public health model, we identified spheres of influence that modify how fishers experience HABs related stressors and risks to provide a starting point at which to identify sustainable strategies to improve food and water security and livelihood for the millions in nearshore communities.					; Roegner, Amber/NFT-6196-2025	Roegner, Amber/0000-0002-8650-3789; Corman, Jessica/0000-0002-2633-8080; 													1708-3087					MAR	2023	28	1							49	10.5751/ES-13860-280149	http://dx.doi.org/10.5751/ES-13860-280149								39669889					WOS:000958363000002

Recent advances of viral metagenomic have greatly expanded our understanding of aquatic viral communities. However, little is known about the difference of viral communities and driving factors in freshwater lake. This study seeks to understand the spatio-temporal variation, differences, and driving factors of viral communities in two plateau lakes (Dianchi and Fuxian Lakes) with significant nutritional differences. The viral communities exhibited apparent seasonal variation in Dianchi Lake, while seasonal influences on the viral communities were greater than location-based influences. Two-thirds of all detected viral taxa were shared in two lakes, but there was variation in the composition of viral communities. Correlations between prokaryotic communities, environmental factors and viral communities were analyzed. The nutrients, chlorophyll a were primarily environmental parameters affecting viral communities, and the prokaryotic community was significantly correlated with the viral community. In addition, several viruses infecting humans were identified in two lakes, with the most abundant being Herpesviridae and Poxviridae. Overall, these findings provide information on the dynamics, composition, and differences of viral and prokaryotic communities in plateau lakes with different nutrient levels. These results suggest that nutritional levels and prokaryotic communities could play an important role in shaping viral communities in freshwater lakes.					shiying, zhang/JJD-0690-2023														0048-9697	1879-1026				SEP 15	2022	839								156033	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156033	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156033		MAY 2022						35597355					WOS:000833542600002

Highly abundant taxa were shared in a high percentage between bulk (DNA-based) and active (RNA-based) bacterial communities, whereas a high proportion of rare species was detected only in either an active or bulk community, indicating the existence of a potentially active rare biosphere and the possible underestimation of diversity detected when using only one nucleic acid pool. Most taxa identified as generalists were abundant, and those identified as specialists were more likely to be rare in the bulk community. The overall number of environmental parameters that could explain the variation was higher for abundant taxa in comparison to rare taxa. Clustering analysis based on operational taxonomic units (OTUs at 0.03 cutoff) level revealed significant and systematic microbial community composition shifts with depth. In the oxic zone, Actinobacteria were found highly dominant in the bulk community but not in the metabolically active community. In the oxic-anoxic transition zone, highly abundant potentially active Nitrospira and Methylococcales were observed. The co-occurrence of potentially active sulfur-oxidizing and sulfate-reducing bacteria in the anoxic zone may suggest the presence of an active yet cryptic sulfur cycle.

Analysis of spatio-temporal climate variability of a shallow lake catchment in Tanzania	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE												This study analyzed the trends and spatio-temporal variability in rainfall and temperature, and the length of the rainy season (LRS) in the Lake Manyara catchment, Tanzania, covering a period between 1988 and 2018 using stations and satellite climate product. The Mann-Kendall statistical test, Sen's slope estimator, and inverse distance weighting interpolation techniques were used to detect the trends, magnitude of trends and spatial distribution of rainfall and temperature. A modified Stern's method and water balance concept were used for rainfall onset, cessation and LRS analysis, while a standardized precipitation index (SPI) was used to investigate the wetness or dryness of the area. The results showed high variability and decreasing trend (4 mm/y) in annual rainfall, and non-significant increasing trend for minimum and maximum temperature. Rainfall increased from the western to the northern part of the catchment whereas a reversal pattern was noticed for temperature. The SPI shows a signal of normal condition (about 65%) for all stations - with few years showing evidence of wetter and drier conditions. The LRS showed a decreasing trend indicating a potential negative influence on rain-dependent activities. There is a need, therefore, for adaptation measures such as improving water productivity and irrigation at the farm and catchment level.

For extending the saline-soil deformation monitoring capability, this paper presents an improved TS-InSAR approach, based on the interferometric coherence statistics and high-coherence interferogram refinement. By constructing a network of the refined interferograms, high-accuracy ground deformation can be extracted through the weighted least square estimation and the coherent target refinement. To extract the high-accuracy deformation of a representative saline soil area in the Qarhan Salt Lake, 119 C-band Sentinel-1A images collected between May 2015 and May 2020 are selected as the data source. Subsequently, 845 refined interferograms are selected from all possible interferograms to conduct the network inversion, based on the related thresholds (the temporal baseline <49 days, the average spatial coherences >0.5, respectively). Compared with the conventional TS-InSAR measurements, both the accuracy and reliability of the extracted deformation results of the saline soil increased dramatically. Furthermore, the testing results indicate that the improved TS-InSAR method has advantages on the deformation extraction in the saline soil region, and is adaptive to reflecting the typical seasonal variations of the saline soil.					mao, wenfei/JXN-3224-2024; xiang, wei/IWD-8393-2023; wu, tingting/H-8032-2012; liu, guoxiang/I-8174-2013	Fu, Yin/0000-0003-3839-2794; xiang, wei/0000-0002-8756-2211; Zhang, Bo/0000-0002-7056-1124; WANG, Xiaowen/0000-0001-6532-9606; Zhang, Rui/0000-0002-0809-7682; 														2220-9964				MAR	2021	10	3							112	10.3390/ijgi10030112	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi10030112													WOS:000633711300001

Primary production in a tropical large lake: The role of phytoplankton composition	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Phytoplankton biomass and primary production in tropical large lakes vary at different time scales, from seasons to centuries. We provide a dataset made of 7 consecutive years of phytoplankton biomass and production in Lake Kivu (Eastern Africa). From 2002 to 2008, hi-weekly samplings were performed in a pelagic site in order to quantify phytoplankton composition and biomass, using marker pigments determined by HPLC. Primary production rates were estimated by 96 in situ C-14 incubations. A principal component analysis showed that the main environmental gradient was linked to a seasonal variation of the phytoplankton assemblage, with a clear separation between diatoms during the dry season and cyanobacteria during the rainy season. A rather wide range of the maximum specific photosynthetic rate (P-Bm) was found, ranging between 1.15 and 7.21 g carbon g(-1) chlorophyll a h(-1), and was best predicted by a regression model using phytoplankton composition as an explanatory variable. The irradiance at the onset of light saturation (I-k) ranged between 91 and 752 mu E m(-2) s(-1) and was linearly correlated with the mean irradiance in the mixed layer. The inter-annual variability of phytoplankton biomass and production was high, ranging from 53 to 100 mg chlorophyll a m(-2) (annual mean) and from 143 to 278 g carbon m(-2) y(-1), respectively. The degree of seasonal mixing determined annual production, demonstrating the sensitivity of tropical lakes to climate variability. A review of primary production of other African great lakes allows situating Lake Kivu productivity in the same range as that of lakes Tanganyika and Malawi, even if mean phytoplankton biomass was higher in Lake Kivu.

Here, we compiled biodiversity inventories to infer food web structure of 67 French lakes using an allometric niche-based model and tested how environmental variables (temperature, productivity, and habitat) influence them. By applying a multivariate analysis on 20 metrics of food web topology, we found that food web structural variations are represented by two distinct complementary and independent structural descriptors. The first is related to the overall trophic diversity, whereas the second is related to the vertical structure. Interestingly, the trophic diversity descriptor was mostly explained by habitat size (26.7% of total deviance explained) and habitat complexity (20.1%) followed by productivity (dissolved organic carbon: 16.4%; nitrate: 9.1%) and thermal variations (10.7%). Regarding the vertical structure descriptor, it was mostly explained by water thermal seasonality (39.0% of total deviance explained) and habitat depth (31.9%) followed by habitat complexity (8.5%) and size (5.5%) as well as annual mean temperature (5.6%). Overall, we found that temperature, productivity, and habitat characteristics collectively shape lake food web structure. We also found that intermediate levels of productivity, high levels of temperature (mean and seasonality), as well as large habitats are associated with the largest and most complex food webs. Our findings, therefore, highlight the importance of focusing on these three components especially in the context of global change, as significant structural changes in aquatic food webs could be expected under increased temperature, pollution, and habitat alterations.

Thermocline stratification causes heterogeneous resource distribution, however, the effect of thermocline stratification on phytoplankton dynamic in-depth profiles is still unclear. To understand the underlying mechanism behind the effects of thermocline stratification on phytoplankton species diversity in stratified lakes, the monthly changes in thermocline parameters, deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM) parameters, spatial overlap (SO) among major phytoplankton taxonomic groups, and phytoplankton species diversity were evaluated in Lake Qiandaohu in the Zhejiang Province of China from April 2017 to December 2018. Thermocline depth (TD) was significantly negatively related to thermocline strength (TS). The monthly air temperature was the main driver behind the thermocline and the seasonal thermal-stratification cycle was divided into two stratification stages. Significant linear relationships were observed between the DCM parameters (depth, concentration, and thickness) and TD during the strong stratification period. TD was significantly positively related to phytoplankton species diversity and the SO between Cryptophyta and Chlorophyta as well as between Cryptophyta and Bacillariophyta during weak stratification periods. Significant positive correlations were observed between SO and Shannon diversity during both periods. Structural equation modeling (SEM) showed that air temperature significantly decreased TD and increased species diversity by increasing SO during the strong stratification period. Strong stratification under warming favored the formation of shallower and thinner DCMs, leading to phytoplankton coexistence and maintenance of high species diversity through a preclusion of dominance. This study characterized the temporal dynamics of phytoplankton dynamic in-depth profiles in response to strong stratification from warming.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				FEB 25	2024	913								169712	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169712	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169712		JAN 2024						38160822					WOS:001154448800001

Fluxes of biomass and essential polyunsaturated fatty acids from water to land via chironomid emergence from a mountain lake	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												The taxonomic composition, seasonal dynamics, and emergence intensity of chironomid adults (the Chironomidae family) emerging from Oiskoe mountain oligotrophic lake (Western Sayan, Southern Siberia) have been established. The value of the annual emergence of chironomid adults averages 0.42 g wet weight m(-2) in the lake area and approaches the value of potential emergence, which is calculated based on the estimate of zoobenthos secondary production. For the first time the fatty-acid composition and contents of essential omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are compared between the larvae and adult stages of chironomids. The PUFA content per wet weight unit in adults is more than 7 times higher than that in larvae. The PUFA flux per lake area unit resulting from the chironomid emergence amounted to 1.752 mg m(-2) y(-1), which is over 10 times lower than the global estimate for the emergence of amphibiotic insects. Calculations show that the PUFA flux brought with the chironomid emergence per land unit of the studied mountain territory is very low when compared to that for other landscapes, with the exception of the shoreline part of the territory with a width of 15 m, in which the PUFA flux is comparable to that in productive landscapes.

The temperature, precipitation and actual evapotranspiration grid monthly climate data and land cover were analysed and processed on a seasonal basis to compute the annual crop evapotranspiration. The land cover evapotranspiration rate was assigned through evapotranspiration coefficients from the literature. Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques, such as conversions from vector to raster data and the 'Raster Calculator' function, were used to assess the spatial distribution of the crop evapotranspiration at a regional scale. In particular, two datasets from different periods (1961-1990 and 1990-2010) were used to compute the seasonal and annual crop evapotranspiration for the Carpathian region. The results of climate parameters indicate a rise in temperature and crop evapotranspiration values between the first and the second period. In addition, significant spatial changes were observed with a shift of maximum values from south to north.

In view of the characteristics of annual water level variation formed by the Three Gorges Dam Project (TGDP), our understanding about how these changes affect phytoplankton structure and dynamics is still very limited due to the shortage of long-term observation data. In this study, we used Huan Jing 1 charge-coupled device images over the past decade to examine the phytoplankton succession dates between cyanobacterial and green algal blooms in the backwater area of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR). The results indicated continuous wavelet transform-based peak analysis is an efficiency tool that can illustrate the temporal pattern of phytoplankton succession using satellite-derived chlorophyll a and Cyano-Chlorophyta index thresholds. Water level, air temperature, pH and total nitrogen/total phosphorus ratio were four important factors affecting the decline and rise phase of cyanobacterial blooms in the TGR from 2008 to 2018. Given that the upstream dam operation is likely to alter ecological and environmental conditions in the backwater area, this mechanism, so-called "waterlevel linkage", could alleviate the persistent period of cyanobacterial and green algal blooms. Remote sensing together with time series analysis provided a useful method to examine the seasonal succession of phytoplankton assemblages in the TGR, and these findings provided strategic insight for the water-quality management in the post-TGDP period.

Imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, acetamiprid, and clothianidin were dominant NEOs in surface waters. High levels of & sum;NEOs were found in the upper reaches of Guangzhou section of the Pearl River (PR_GZ), indicating multiple input sources of NEOs in PR_GZ. Additionally, the decreased influence of terrestrial input and human activities was observed along with the flow direction, where the order of & sum;NEOs concentration was PR_GZ (inland river, 64.5 ng/L) > Pearl River Estuary (estuary, 33.9 ng/L) > Xisha Islands of the South China Sea (SS_XS, open sea area, 27.0 ng/L); and the level in Northwestern South China Sea (coastal sea, 49.9 ng/L) was also higher than that in open sea area. The estimated annual fluxes of NEOs released into the South China Sea totaled 34.8 +/- 20.4 tons, most of which come from the Pearl River basin. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the concentrations, distribution, and source analysis of NEOs in river-estuary-ocean systems in South China.

We measured trace metal concentrations and lead (Pb) isotope ratios in lake water, river water, ground water, and aerosol total suspended particles (TSP), as well as nutrient (NO3-, NH4+, PO43-) concentrations in TSP in the Tahoe Basin. The contribution of TSP deposition to the lake trace metal budget was assessed. Our results show seasonality in TSP and associated trace metal concentrations with higher concentrations during Oct - April. However, trace metal solubilities are higher during May - Sept, resulting in a higher contribution of soluble trace metals to the lake water. The source of most of the trace metals in TSP in the Lake Tahoe Basin is mineral dust; however, Zn, Cu, and Cd also have an anthropogenic origin. Among major nutrients, NO3- concentrations are slightly higher during Oct - April, while NH4+ and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) are higher during May - Sept. The distributions of trace metal concentrations and Pb isotopic ratios are homogenous throughout the lake water column, suggesting that the residence time of the trace metals in the lake is longer than the lake water mixing time. The contribution of atmospheric TSP deposition to the upper 20 m of lake water trace metal inventory is low, ranging from 0.03% for V to 5.7% for Mn. A triple-isotopes plot of Pb indicates that riverine and groundwater inputs are the major Pb sources, but aerosols still contribute some Pb to the lake.

Total PAHs (a 26 PAH) ranged from 1.21 to 91.7 A mu g/L. The 4- and 5-ring compounds were the principal PAHs detected in most of 5 sites examined. Diagnostic concentration ratios and molecular indices were performed to identify the PAH sources. Results show that PAHs could originate from petrogenic, pyrolytic and mixed sources. According to the ecotoxicological assessment, the potential risk associated with PAHs affecting agricultural and industrial effluents ranged from moderate to high for both aquatic ecosystem and human health. The toxic equivalency factor (TEF) approach indicated that benzo[a]pyrene and benz[a]anthracene were the principal responsible for carcinogenic power of samples.

River Water Level and Water Surface Slope Measurement From Spaceborne Radar and LiDAR Altimetry: Evaluation and Implications for Hydrological Studies in the Ganga River	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												Satellite altimetry has revolutionized river monitoring, particularly for hydrologists working on river flow monitoring in sparsely or ungauged areas. Despite this, there is a lack of a comprehensive evaluation of radar and LiDAR altimeters with varying sensor specifications for river water level retrieval, seasonal change characterization, and water surface slope (WSS) using gauged long-term water level and global navigation satellite system data. This study addresses this gap by combined evaluation of radar (ENVISAT to Sentinel-3) and LiDAR (ICESat-1, ICESat-2) altimeters along the Ganga River, from Prayagraj to Varanasi. We found that all the radar altimetry missions showed better accuracy for water level retrievals (R-2 > = 0.8; RMSE 0.11 to 1.16 m) and water level change quantification (RMSE 0.59 m). However, Sentinel-3 with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) acquisition mode outperformed (RMSE 0.11 to 0.14 m) all the radar missions having low resolution mode. Despite LiDAR missions' high vertical accuracy, they show relatively lower accuracy in water level time series generation due to nonrepeating characteristics. In contrary, ICESat-2 demonstrates potential in capturing spatial and seasonal variability of WSS, enhancing the accuracy of surface water and ocean topography (SWOT) discharge products when combined with SWOT River database. This study provides a comprehensive baseline for end-users interested in utilizing radar and LiDAR missions for various hydrological applications, including river discharge estimation. Moreover, the studied river reach shares the SWOT calibration orbit, allowing the utilization of generated satellite and in-situ databases for the effective evaluation of SWOT measurements.					; Agarwal, Ankit/X-6301-2018; AGARWAL, ANKIT/X-6301-2018; Thakur, Praveen/G-4295-2010; Paris, Adrien/GPK-7691-2022	Dhote, Pankaj R./0000-0002-3483-0059; Thakur, Praveen Kumar/0000-0002-2719-7021; Agarwal, Ankit/0000-0001-8572-7046; Paris, Adrien/0000-0003-2304-5132; 													1939-1404	2151-1535					2024	17						7825	7840		10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3379874	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3379874													WOS:001205080600022

Multiple Strategies for Light-Harvesting, Photoprotection, and Carbon Flow in High Latitude Microbial Mats	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Microbial mats are ubiquitous in polar freshwater ecosystems and sustain high concentrations of biomass despite the extreme seasonal variations in light and temperature. Here we aimed to resolve genomic adaptations for light-harvesting, bright-light protection, and carbon flow in mats that undergo seasonal freeze-up. To bracket a range of communities in shallow water habitats, we sampled cyanobacterial mats in the thawed littoral zone of two lakes situated at the northern and southern limits of the Canadian Arctic permafrost zone. We applied a multiphasic approach using pigment profiles from high performance liquid chromatography, Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the 16S and 18S rRNA genes, and metagenomic analysis. The mats shared a taxonomic and functional core microbiome, dominated by oxygenic cyanobacteria with light-harvesting and photoprotective pigments, bacteria with bacteriochlorophyll, and bacteria with light-driven Type I rhodopsins. Organisms able to use light for energy related processes represented up to 85% of the total microbial community, with 15-30% attributable to cyanobacteria and 55-70% attributable to other bacteria. The proportion of genes involved in anaplerotic CO2 fixation was greater than for genes associated with oxygenic photosynthesis. Diverse heterotrophic bacteria, eukaryotes (including metazoans and fungi) and viruses co-occurred in both communities. The results indicate a broad range of strategies for capturing sunlight and CO2 , and for the subsequent flow of energy and carbon in these complex, light-driven microbial ecosystems.

Phototransformation of pesticides in prairie potholes: effect of dissolved organic matter in triplet-induced oxidation	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												Photochemical reactions involving a variety of photosensitizers contribute to the abiotic transformation of pesticides in prairie pothole lakes (PPLs). Despite the fact that triplet excited state dissolved organic matter (DOM) enhances phototransformation of pesticides by acting as a photosensitizer, it may also decrease the overall phototransformation rate through various mechanisms. In this study, the effect of DOM on the phototransformation of four commonly applied pesticides in four different PPL waters was investigated under simulated sunlight using photoexcited benzophenone-4-carboxylate as the oxidant with DOM serving as an anti-oxidant. For atrazine and mesotrione, a decrease in phototransformation rates was observed, while phototransformations of metolachlor and isoproturon were not affected by DOM inhibition. Phototransformation rates and the extent of inhibition/enhancement by DOM varied spatially and temporally across the wetlands studied. Characterization of DOM from the sites and different seasons suggested that the DOM type and variations in the DOM structure are important factors controlling phototransformation rates of pesticides in PPLs.					; Karpuzcu, Mahmut Ekrem/L-8420-2014	Arnold, William/0000-0003-0814-5469; Karpuzcu, Mahmut Ekrem/0000-0002-6245-9621													2050-7887	2050-7895				FEB	2016	18	2					237	245		10.1039/c5em00374a	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5em00374a								26745785					WOS:000370690900008

Water quality differs temporally and spatially and is affected by several factors. Typically, water quality inspection systems are cost- and labour-intensive depending on water quality indicator count and sampling frequency. Optimising the frequency and location of water quality sampling is crucial. This study focused on collecting water samples from 22 locations in Kenyir Lake during different seasons (normal, dry, and wet). The study aimed to assess the spatial and temporal variations in the water quality of Kenyir Lake based on multivariate statistical methods. In this study, the following water quality parameters were selected for analysis: temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS), and ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N). In addition, a water quality index was also calculated. GIS software was used to assess water quality data, and various multivariate statistical methods like cluster analysis (CA), discriminant analysis (DA), and principal component analysis (PCA) were employed. The outcome shows minor spatial differences concerning Kenyir Lake; however, the temporal variations were noteworthy during this study duration. Cluster analysis divided the locations into 3 clusters with TSS being key parameter affecting the spatial differences in water quality. Stepwise discriminant analysis based on three parameters, pH, temperature, and TSS, produced the associated classification matrix that correctly estimated 69.7% of the input. NH3-N and TSS were found to be the two critical aspects that affect water quality during dry, wet, or normal climatic conditions.

The co-occurrence of phylogenetically distant bacterial groups such as PSB and GSB in the same ecological niche, makes the chemocline of Lake Cadagno an ideal system for studying the conditions and consequences of coexistence of photosynthetic bacteria populations. In this study, we applied flow cytometry (FCM) as a fast tool to identify metabolic changes due to the production and consumption of inclusion bodies such as sulfur globules (SGBs), and follow population dynamics of closely related anoxygenic photosynthetic sulfur bacteria in their natural environment. Large-celled PSB Chromatium okenii and GSB Chlorobium populations were reliably separated and identified due to differences in auto-fluorescence and cell size. Moreover, we showed that these dominant taxa share the same ecological niche over seasonal periods. Taking advantage of FCM detection of dynamic cellular complexity variation during phases of photosynthetic activity, we identified an unexpected alternation in PSB versus GSB metabolic activity, indicating dynamic interspecific interactions between these two populations.					; Storelli, Nicola/AAP-5061-2021	Storelli, Nicola/0000-0002-1318-115X; Ludin, Samuel/0000-0002-2803-2536; 													1932-6203					DEC 15	2017	12	12							e0189510	10.1371/journal.pone.0189510	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0189510								29245157					WOS:000418184700035

Anaerobic methane oxidation and aerobic methane production African great lake (Lake Kivu) in an east	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH					African Great Lakes Conference (AGLC) - Conservation and Development in a Changing Climate	MAY, 2017	Entebbe, UGANDA					We investigated CH4 oxidation in the water column of Lake Kivu, a deep meromictic tropical lake with CH4-rich anoxic deep waters. Depth profiles of dissolved gases (CH4 and N2O) and a diversity of potential electron acceptors for anaerobic CH4 oxidation (NO3-, SO42-, Fe and Mn oxides) were determined during six field campaigns between June 2011 and August 2014. Denitrification measurements based on stable isotope labelling experiments were performed twice. In addition, we quantified aerobic and anaerobic CH4 oxidation, NO3- and SO42- consumption rates, with and without the presence of an inhibitor of SO42--reducing bacteria activity. Aerobic CH4 production was also measured in parallel incubations with the addition of an inhibitor of aerobic CH4 oxidation. The maximum aerobic and anaerobic CH4 oxidation rates were estimated to be 27 +/- 2 and 16 +/- 8 mu mol/L/d, respectively. We observed a difference in the relative importance of aerobic and anaerobic CH4 oxidation during the rainy and the dry season, with a greater role for aerobic oxidation during the dry season. Lower anaerobic CH4 oxidation rates were measured in presence of molybdate in half of the measurements, suggesting the occurrence of linkage between SO42- -reduction and anaerobic CH4 oxidation. NW consumption and dissolved Mn production rates were never high enough to sustain the measured anaerobic CH4 oxidation, reinforcing the idea of a coupling between SO42--reduction and CH4 oxidation in the anoxic waters of Lake Kivu. Finally, significant rates (up to 0.37 mu mol/L/d) of pelagic CH4 production were also measured in oxygenated waters. (C) 2018 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Cyanobacteria facilitate parasite epidemics in Daphnia	ECOLOGY												The seasonal dominance of cyanobacteria in the phytoplankton community of lake ecosystems can have severe implications for higher trophic levels. For herbivorous zooplankton such as Daphnia, cyanobacteria have poor nutritional value and some species can produce toxins affecting zooplankton survival and reproduction. Here we present another, hitherto largely unexplored aspect of cyanobacteria, namely that they can increase Daphnia susceptibility to parasites. In a 12-yr monthly time-series analysis of the Daphnia community in Greifensee (Switzerland), we observed that cyanobacteria density correlated significantly with the epidemics of a common gut parasite of Daphnia, Caullerya mesnili, regardless of what cyanobacteria species was present or whether it was colonial or filamentous. The temperature from the previous month also affected the occurrence of Caullerya epidemics, either directly or indirectly by the promotion of cyanobacterial growth. A laboratory experiment confirmed that cyanobacteria increase the susceptibility of Daphnia to Caullerya, and suggested a possible involvement of cyanotoxins or other chemical traits of cyanobacteria in this process. These findings expand our understanding of the consequences of toxic cyanobacterial blooms for lake ecosystems and might be relevant for epidemics experienced by other aquatic species.					; Pomati, Francesco/G-2367-2010; Wolinska, Justyna/N-6455-2014	Tardent, Nadine/0009-0008-6460-4475; Keller, Barbara/0000-0002-7903-8938; Tellenbach, Christoph/0000-0002-9088-2187													0012-9658	1939-9170				DEC	2016	97	12					3422	3432		10.1002/ecy.1576	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.1576								27912017					WOS:000389444800019

Environmental filtering in the dry season and spatial structuring in the wet: different fish community assembly rules revealed in a large subtropical floodplain lake	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Although environmental filtering and spatial structuring are commonly regarded as two key factors shaping community dynamics, their relative contribution remains unknown for numerous aquatic ecosystems, particularly highly dynamic floodplain lakes. This issue is here addressed by examining the seasonal metacommunity dynamics of freshwater fishes in Lake Dongting, a large subtropical lake of the middle Chang-Jiang basin in southern China. Physicochemical variables and fish assemblages were recorded at 20 sampling sites during the wet, normal, and dry seasons. Distance-based redundancy analysis and associated variation partitioning were used to examine the relative role of environmental variables and spatial factors in fish community assembly in each season. Analysis results demonstrated that the relative contribution of environmental filtering and spatial structuring varied depending on environmental features and the extent of hydrological connectivity in different seasons. Intensified physicochemical parameters in the dry season convinced the enhanced environmental filtering, whereas high hydrological connectivity in the wet season favored the stronger spatial process. Specifically, the community assembly processes were temporally dynamic; spatial structuring (or mass effects), resulting from excessively high dispersal rates, was dominant during the flooding season, and environmental filtering was stronger than spatial structuring (or dispersal limitation) during the non-flooding season. These findings highlight the importance of conserving local habitats of Lake Dongting during the dry and normal seasons, and maintaining of the flood pulse of the lake and its natural variability during the wet season. Apparently, the construction of a water-level regulation project at the Chenglingji Channel, the outlet watercourse of Lake Dongting, is not supported because it will change the flood pulse of this lake and thus impact habitat heterogeneity or variability.

In this study, the removal of Mn2+ by using pristine (BC), pre-alkali (Pre-BC) and post-alkali (Post-BC) modified biochar originating from rice straw was investigated. The maximum adsorption capacities obtained for BC, Pre-BC, and Post-BC were 20.59, 28.37, and 8.06 mg g(-1), respectively. The Langmuir isotherm model and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model were suitable fitting models to describe the adsorption process. The investigation of adsorption functions was carried out that revealed that the predominant forces were precipitation and cation exchange with the proportions of 43.38-69.15% and 38.05-55.79%, respectively. With regard to precipitation, Mn(ii) particles (Al-Si-O-Mn and MnCO3) and insignificantly oxidized insoluble Mn(iv) particles (MnO2) were formed on the biochar surface. Alkali and alkaline earth metals facilitated the behavior of cation exchange, where the primary contributing ions for cation exchange were Na+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ during the adsorption process. These outcomes suggest that alkali pre-treated modification of biochar is practical for the application of manganese pollution control in lakes and reservoirs.

The estuary was subjected to two conditions based on the water and salt balance: a short hyposaline and a long hypersaline period. They were marked by considerable differences in precipitation, evaporation and water flushing time that resulted in noticeable variations in the salinity gradients, nutrient concentrations and total phytoplankton biomass (TPB). TPB peaked at the middle and end of the dry season, when salinity reached maximum levels (up to 63) and the water residence time was higher. Higher TPB was also related to a decline in inorganic nitrogen due to phytoplankton uptake and a decline in water transparency due to phytoplankton shading. Rainfall rather than drought constituted a disturbance for the phytoplankton as TPB declined in the rainy period despite available nutrients. Given the prevalent climate change, increases are predicted in the frequency and intensity of droughts and salinity in estuaries. Although the phytoplankton community seemed adapted, the limits of its adaptability and the effects of hypersalinity should be further evaluated.

The objective of this study was to assess the effects of land use and land cover and river discharge on water quality in the Migina catchment, southern Rwanda. Rainfall, discharge and water quality (total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total suspended solids, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, pH, and temperature) were measured in different periods from May 2009 to June 2013. In 2011, measurements were done at the outlets of 3 sub-catchments (Munyazi, Mukura and Akagera). Between May 2012 and May 2013 the measurements were done in 16 reaches of Munyazi dominated by rice, vegetables, grass/forest or ponds/reservoirs. Water quality was also measured during two rainfall events. Results showed seasonal trends in water quality associated with high water flows and farming activities. Across all sites, the total suspended solids related positively to discharge, increasing 2-8 times during high flow periods. Conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH decreased with increasing discharge, while total nitrogen and total phosphorus did not show a clear pattern. The total suspended solids concentrations were consistently higher downstream of reaches dominated by rice and vegetable farming. For total nitrogen and total phosphorus results were mixed, but suggesting higher concentration of total nitrogen and total phosphorus during the dry and early rainy (and farming) season, and then wash out during the rainy season, with subsequent dilution at the end of the rains.

The relative verrucomicrobial 16S rRNA gene abundance accounted for 0.02% to 1.98% of the particle-associated bacteria and 0.52% to 1.64% of the free-living bacteria. In total, 71 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (n = 303 clones) were identified for particle-associated bacteria, and 59 OTUs (n = 292 clones) were identified for the free-living fraction. This study determined six new putative freshwater Verrucomicrobia clusters. Of these newly defined clusters, two were exclusively represented by particle-associated bacteria (FukuS27, BourFIV). The freshwater Verrucomicrobia clusters CRE-PA29, FukuN18 and CL120-10 appeared to be dominant, comprising 22.3%, 16.15% and 14.61% of the total retrieved OTUs, respectively. The seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton communities resulted in changes in the distinct bacterial phylotypes for both the particle-associated and free-living verrucomicrobial communities. According to canonical correspondence analysis, the diversity of the particle-associated verrucomicrobial communities appeared to be primarily influenced by phytoplankton richness, rotifer abundance and inorganic nutrients, whereas the free-living fraction was correlated with the biomass dynamics of some phytoplankton classes (Chlorophyceae, Chrysophaceae, Desmidiaceae and Zygnemataceae).

T.			First report on the occurrence of Vibrio cholerae nonO1/nonO139 in natural and artificial lakes and ponds in Serbia: Evidence for a long-distance transfer of strains and the presence of Vibrio paracholerae	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY REPORTS												Vibrio cholerae are natural inhabitants of specific aquatic environments. Strains not belonging to serogroups O1 and O139 are usually unable to produce cholera toxin and cause cholera. However, non-toxigenic V. cholerae (NTVC) are able to cause a variety of mild-to-severe human infections (via seafood consumption or recreational activities). The number of unreported cases is considered substantial, as NTVC infections are not notifiable and physicians are mostly unaware of this pathogen. In the northern hemisphere, NTVC infections have been reported to increase due to global warming. In Eastern Europe, climatic and geological conditions favour the existence of inland water-bodies harbouring NTVC. We thus investigated the occurrence of NTVC in nine Serbian natural and artificial lakes and ponds, many of them used for fishing and bathing. With the exception of one highly saline lake, all investigated water-bodies harboured NTVC, ranging from 5.4 x 10(1) to 1.86 x 10(4) CFU and 4.5 x 10(2) to 5.6 x 10(6) genomic units per 100 ml. The maximum values observed were in the range of bathing waters in other countries, where infections have been reported. Interestingly, 7 out of 39 fully sequenced presumptive V. cholerae isolates were assigned as V. paracholerae, a recently described sister species of V. cholerae. Some clones and sublineages of both V. cholerae and V. paracholerae were shared by different environments indicating an exchange of strains over long distances. Important pathogenicity factors such as hlyA, toxR, and ompU were present in both species. Seasonal monitoring of ponds/lakes used for recreation in Serbia is thus recommended to be prepared for potential occurrence of infections promoted by climate change-induced rise in water temperatures.

However, the feedback loop of nutrient fluxes and water quality changes is still an open question. An integrated three-dimensional flux tracking approach based on the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code model was established to quantify the long-term dynamic changes in external and internal processes in Lake Dianchi (one of the three most hyper-eutrophic lakes in China), and to explore the potential causes of water quality improvement during 2012-2018. The long-term trends and relative influences of nutrient fluxes on water quality were identified. The results showed that the inflow flux was the largest input source and declined by 50% between 2003 and 2012, which was followed by a stable trend from 2012 to 2018. The second largest input source was benthic release, which exhibited a significant interannual reduction. Algae sedimentation was the largest removal process, and declined by 45% between 2012 and 2018. An integrated analysis demonstrated that, following an external loading reduction prior to 2012, the positive feedback of internal fluxes promoted water quality improvement during 2012-2018. Considering the long timescale of the nutrient-flux feedback mechanism, reducing external loading is still the top priority for a long-term virtuous cycle of water quality in the process of eutrophic lake restoration.

Pathways of river water to the surface layers of stratified reservoirs	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												This study uses tracer experiments to characterize the fate of a cold plunging river into a Mediterranean reservoir under different stratification conditions. Three tracer experiments in Lake Beznar, Spain, demonstrate that a significant fraction of the inflow may be quickly entrained into the surface mixed layer (SML), rather than flowing to lower depths. We observe that a fraction (and possibly all) of river inflow entrains into the SML when the density current forms intrusions at the top of the metalimnetic layer. Intrusions near the base of the SML form due to lighter interfacial fluid at the top of the density current, with intermediate properties between river-reservior water when there is sufficient dilution of the cold inflow, and abrupt density changes at the base of the SML. Consequently, a layer of fluid splits from the denser part of the current and intrudes just below the SML, while any remaining fluid flows to lower depths. We parameterize this splitting behavior in terms of the transition Richardson number, Ri(12) = Gamma X (rho(2) - rho(1))/(rho(0) - rho(1)), where rho(0), rho(1), and rho(2) are densities of the inflow, the SML, and the metalimnetic layer underneath, respectively; and C is the total dilution through the plunge zone and subsequent entrainment. Splitting occurs when Ri(12) >= 1, consistent with previous laboratory experiments. We use this theory to predict the seasonal fate of river water during the stratification of Lake Beznar and identify the conditions that favor the formation of intrusions near the base of the SML.

Periphytic algae often used as a potential biological assessment method for its environmental sensitivity characteristics. Here we studied the characteristics of the periphytic algae community and diatom species in the subtropical urban landscape lake known as West Lake, Hangzhou, China, which is in the process of ecological restoration. The changes in species composition, biomass and the community diversity of periphytic algae were determined. 71 taxa of 54 genera of periphytic algae were observed. The Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta and Cyanophyta dominated in the community. The Bacillariophytes exhibited the highest species richness, whereas the Cyanophytes showed the highest cell density. Principal component analysis environmental variables showed that the TN was main nutrient factor to periphytic algae in the West Lake. In terms of the relatively high TN contents characteristics in subtropical urban landscape lake West Lake, the ecological optimum values and tolerance values of TN about diatom were calculated by weighted regression method. Synedra capitata, Achnanthes minutissima, Gomphonema acuminatum, Navicula graciloides were extracted as indicator species for environmental gradients of TN in the West Lake. Those findings provide a theoretical basis for the use of diatoms biological index to improve the effectiveness of monitoring and evaluating the nutritional level of TN in urban landscape lakes system. It would be significant to identify the nutritional status of the subtropical shallow water bodies and advise related management.																			0925-8574	1872-6992				AUG 1	2020	155								105958	10.1016/j.ecoleng.2020.105958	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2020.105958													WOS:000549835000007

D.; Balshine, Sigal			Demography and substrate affinity of the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) in Hamilton Harbour	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The invasive round goby, Neogobius melanostomus, consumes eggs and fry of other fishes, competes for resources with native fish species, and hence poses a threat to Great Lakes aquatic communities. We provide the first description of round goby demographic patterns in Hamilton Harbour, in the western tip of Lake Ontario, and the connected Cootes Paradise Marsh, a recently restored wetland. By monitoring round goby populations on a variety of distinct habitats for 7 years (2002-2008), we found that populations have declined at all sample locations and that average fish body size also has decreased. We also related abundance, body size, and reproductive patterns to seasonality, to substrate types (mud, sand, cobble and boulder) and to water quality in all locations. Round gobies were found on all substrates sampled including mud, although they were less abundant on mud than on other substrates, and to date have not extensively colonized Cootes Paradise Marsh. Our work confirms previous studies, which have suggested that habitats lacking hard structures will have fewer round gobies because they lack substrates on which round gobies can breed. However, our results also indicate that muddy and sandy substrates are not resistant to round goby invasion and will not prevent round goby colonization. a potential concern for Cootes Paradise Marsh an important spawning, nursery, and refuge habitat for warmwater native fishes and for other similar wetlands.

To quantitatively analyze the characteristics of water level variations in 2006 and 2011, a new calculation method was proposed, and the daily water level and discharge from 1955-2016 were collected in this study. The findings are as follows: in 2006 and 2011, the water level in the dry season significantly increased, but that in the flood season obviously decreased compared with the levels in 1978 and 1986. Here, we described this phenomenon as "no low-water-level in dry season, no high-water-level in flood season". Based on the calculation method, the contributions of climate variability and the Three Gorges Dam operation to water level variations in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River were calculated, and the contributions indicated that climate variability was the main reason for the phenomenon of "no low-water-level in dry season, no high-water-level in flood season" instead of flood peak reduction in the flood season and drought runoff implementation in the dry season, which are both induced by TGD.					; li, sixuan/KGR-3943-2024; yang, yunping/ACF-3066-2022	chai, yuanfang/0000-0003-4781-0812; 													2095-0195	2095-0209				SEP	2019	13	3					510	522		10.1007/s11707-018-0739-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11707-018-0739-3													WOS:000490321200005

Most of the soils in Pakistan have poor status of available plant nutrients and cannot support optimum levels of crop productivity. The present study statistically analyzed ten soil quality parameters in five subwatersheds (Bari Imam, Chattar, Rumli, Shahdra, and Shahpur) of the Rawal Lake. Analysis of variance (ANOVA), cluster analysis (CA), and principal component analysis (PCA) were performed to evaluate correlation in soil quality parameters on spatiotemporal and vertical scales. Soil organic matter, electrical conductivity, nitrates, and sulfates were found to be lower than that required for good quality soil. Soil pH showed significant difference (p < 0.05) in mean values at different sampling sites and sampling months indicating that it is affected and determined by land uses and seasons. Pearson correlation revealed a strong positive correlation (r - 0.437) between nitrates and organic matter. Application of principal component analysis resulted in three major factors contributing 76 % of the total variance. For factor 1, temperature, sand, silt, clay, and nitrates had the highest factor loading values (>0.75) and indicated that these were the most influential parameters of first factor or component. Cluster analysis separated five sampling sites into three statistically significant clusters: I (Shahdra-Bari Imam), II (Chattar), and III (Shahpur-Rumli). Among the five sites, Shahdra was found to have good quality soil followed by Bari Imam. The present study illustrated the usefulness of multivariate statistical approaches for the analysis and interpretation of complex datasets to understand variations in soil quality for effective watershed management.

Use of MODIS satellite images for detailed lake morphometry: Application to basins with large water level fluctuations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Lake morphometry is essential for managing water resources and limnetic ecosystems. For reservoirs that receive high sediment loads, frequent morphometric mapping is necessary to define both the effective life of the reservoir and its water storage capacity for irrigation, power generation, flood control and domestic water supply. The current study presents a methodology for updating the digital depth model (DDM) of lakes and reservoirs with wide intra and interannual fluctuations of water levels using satellite remote sensing. A time series of Terra MODIS satellite images was used to map shorelines formed during the annual water level change cycle, and were validated with concurrent Landsat ETM+ satellite images. The shorelines were connected with in-situ observation of water levels and were treated as elevation contours to produce the DDM using spatial interpolation. The accuracy of the digitized shorelines is within the mapping accuracy of the satellite images, while the resulting DDM is validated using in-situ elevation measurements. Two versions of the DDM were produced to assess the influence of seasonal water fluctuation. Finally, the methodology was applied to Lake Kerkini (Greece) to produce an updated DDM, which was compared with the last available bathymetric survey (1991) and revealed changes in sediment distribution within the lake.

A global review of the spatial, taxonomic, and temporal scope of freshwater fisheries hydroacoustics research	ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS												This review assessed the status and scope of freshwater hydroacoustic fisheries research in global aquatic ecosystems with emphasis on (i) geographical and spatial scope, (ii) taxonomic range at the species and family levels (restricted to bony fishes of the Actinopterygii and Sarcopterygii), and (iii) temporal scope. Hydroacoustic measures have been used by ecologists and managers of freshwater systems for several decades, with major progress in technology and methods in recent years. A literature review indicated 296 research contributions that employed hydroacoustics to study freshwater fisheries in 294 different aquatic ecosystems. Spatially, hydroacoustics research in freshwater systems have thus far been concentrated in developed countries, particularly in North America and Northern and Central Europe (83% of the studies reviewed here). Most studies were small in spatial scale and short-term, with 80% including only a single body of water and 63% conducted over a single year or season (75% spanning less than two years). In addition, effects of fish morphology and behavior on acoustic target strength (TS) and taxonomic identification are not well parameterized, with only 21 species receiving empirical study of TS. Despite progress, the present study reveals gaps in the knowledge needed for wider applications to management. These include larger biogeographical and temporal scales of study and further empirical research on TS and taxonomic identification. Recent advances in size rather than species-based methods and theory offer potential solutions to this issue but require further investigation. We conclude with recommendations for systematic hydroacoustic research to enable more effective monitoring, management, and conservation of fisheries and freshwater ecosystems.					; Pollom, Riley/AAA-9167-2020	Pollom, Riley/0000-0001-8260-4614; 													1208-6053	1181-8700				SEP	2016	24	3					333	347		10.1139/er-2016-0017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/er-2016-0017													WOS:000382160800008

The response of planktonic (phytoplankton, ciliates, rotifers and crustaceans) and littoral (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Heteroptera: Nepomorpha) assemblages to chemical recovery was studied over a twelve-year period (1999-2011) in eight glacial lakes in the Bohemian Forest (central Europe). The region suffered from high atmospheric pollution from the 1950s to the late 1980s, but has since been recovering from acidification due to 86% and 44% decrease in sulphur and nitrogen deposition, respectively, during the 1990s-2000s. Despite the rapid improvement in water chemistry of all the eight studied lakes, only four have partly recovered so far (low-aluminium lakes), while the other four lakes still remain strongly acidic (high-aluminium lakes). 2. All present lake assemblages are dissimilar by 40-90% from those during the early phase of chemical recovery as a result of species (re) colonisation (ciliates, crustaceans and insects) in the high-Al lakes, and considerable species replacement (zooplankton) and (re) colonisation (insects) in the low-Al lakes. Phytoplankton remained very similar in the high-Al lakes, but changed (loss and/or replacement of some acid-tolerant species) in the low-Al lakes. 3. Aluminium (Al) concentrations were dominant in structuring the assemblages of phytoplankton, rotifers and Nepomorpha, but also affected crustaceans through the seston carbon to phosphorus (P) ratio. Both direct (toxicity) and indirect (P availability) effects of Al control biological recovery in the Bohemian Forest lakes. A concentration of 200 mu g L-1 of total Al is the main barrier preventing the high-Al lakes from recovery. In contrast, pH and total P rather than Al significantly influenced Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera. 4. Although biotic responses (especially in the low-Al lakes) showed important signs of recovery, such as reappearance of some indigenous or acid-sensitive species, decline in eurytopic acid-tolerant species and colonisation by vagile species, the assemblages of all the lakes still suffer from acid stress. Our results also indicate an increasing role of biotic interactions between colonisers and residents leading to the reconstruction of aquatic food webs in the low-Al lakes.

Heavy metal contamination in suspended solids of Changjiang River - environmental implications	GEODERMA												Spatial and temporal changes of contamination of As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn in sediment and suspended solid during dry and flood seasons were investigated in 75 locations along the Changjiang River basin. As and Cd had higher I-geo values both in sediment and suspended solid of Changjiang River. In a principal component analysis with Varimax rotation, the Panzhihua-Northeast Yunnan and Nanling mining areas were plotted out as the most important heavy metal contamination sources for Changjiang River. Poyang Lake region was contaminated strongly by heavy metals and a clear enrichment of heavy metals in suspended solid occurred in Three Gorges Reservoir. Comparing heavy metals in sediment and suspended solid from main channel and tributaries showed that in flood season, erosion of tributaries increased, and the contamination levels of heavy metals in tributaries were higher than in the main channel.

The diatoms exhibited six marked changes in Diatom Zones (DZ) with included water/sediment interface, as the record of environmental changes detected by marine and other terrestrial palaeoclimate records. The diatoms recorded at the deepest sediments were interpreted to represent Pleistocene/Holocene transition. The dated Holocene history is top 810 cm core section, ca. 8.1 cal kyr BP to the present. The first zone record (1101-1050 cm) was interpreted as alkaline, oligo-mesotrophic, oxic lentic ecosystem of the karstic flooding plain based on the dominance of Epithemia adnata. Enhanced bioproductivity of the shallow and unstable environment was noticed in the second diatom zone (1050-815 cm), which was interpreted as the beginning of the Holocene and it was divided into 4 subzones because of rapid environmental fluctuations. A warmer period of temperate climate with a pluvial phase initiated development of the oligo-beta mesosaprobic shallow lake in the early Holocene. The expansion of the macrophytes and higher cyanobacteria production that caused acidification and oxygen depletion at the lake bottom was determined in the mid-Holocene (810-713 cm; 8.1-7.1 cal kyr BP). Mid-Holocene (8.1-4.7 cal kyr BP) is marked by oligohalobic freshwater Epithemia argus characteristic for alkaline water. High cyanobacteria production was determined as a consequence of algal production that induced anoxic conditions in the lake bottom sediments from the warmer period till today. The initial marine influx through the permeable karst underground was observed in the sediment record from ca. 5 cal kyr BP. The discovered marine influence on the lake indicating brackish water conditions related to the Holocene sea-level high stand. The sea intrusion had different intensities through time and is still observed today in the seasonal fluctuation of lake water salinity. The Late Holocene (2.7 cal kyr BP to the present) sediment record is characterized with the strongest marine influxes and highest biodiversity of the beta mesosaprobic lake. Major changes in the water/sediment interface of very shallow karstic lake were caused by anthropogenic agricultural activity in Vrana. Diatom compositions of Lake Vrana indicate that they are sensitive to both paleoclimatic changes, freshwater influx and sea level rise (marine intrusion through permeable karst).

Recent temperature variability and change in the Altiplano of Bolivia and Peru	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												This work analysed the changes in air temperature in 25 meteorological stations in the Altiplano and the surrounding Andean slopes of Bolivia and Peru, and their relationship with El Nino-Southern Oscillation (SO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The analysis focused on annual, warm season (DJF) and cold season (JJA) maximum and minimum temperatures. All analyses were undertaken during 1965-2012, but some analyses were also from 1945 and 1955 when data were available. Principal component analysis was applied to the annual and seasonal series to identify spatial differences of changes in maximum and minimum air temperature. There was an overall increase of temperatures since the mid-20th century. The most intense and spatially coherent warming was observed for annual and warm season maximum temperature, with warming rates from 0.15 to 0.25 degrees C decade(-1). Changes in the cold season maximum temperature were more heterogeneous, and statistically significant trends were mostly in the Bolivian Altiplano. Minimum temperatures increased, but there was higher spatial variability and lower rates of warming. Maximum temperature was negatively correlated with the Southern Oscillation index (SO) in the warm season, and positively correlated with the SO in the cold season; there were less statistically significant correlations with the PDO, that exhibited inverse sign than those for SO. The strongest correlations were in the region near Lake Titicaca. The negative correlation of minimum temperatures with SO and the positive correlation of minimum temperatures with PDO were lower than the observed for maximum temperature. The changes in temperature and correlations with SO and PDO were highly dependent on the selected period, with stronger trends in the last 30-40 years. This suggests reinforcement of warming rates that cannot be only explained by SO and PDO variability.

No evidence for environmental and spatial processes in structuring phytoplankton communities	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The relative importance of local and regional processes in shaping natural communities within a metacommunity context has been a focus of intense debate in recent years. Floodplain lakes provide a good system for testing this theoretical approach, as they undergo seasonal variations in physical, chemical and biological factors, as well as in their degree of connectivity. Here. we investigated how local phytoplankton communities in lakes of a tropical river-floodplain system (Araguaia River floodplain - Central Brazil) were affected by environmental and spatial (dispersal) predictors in two rainy and two dry seasons (two consecutive years). Partial redundancy analysis indicated that during the periods analyzed the effects of neither predictor were significant. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that these tropical phytoplankton communities could be regulated by stochastic events, we suggested that further studies will have greater explanatory power if they include other variables related to biotic interactions (e.g., abundance of grazers) and fine-scale environmental variation.

Fatty acid and stable isotope (δ13C, δ15N) signatures of particulate organic matter in the lower Amazon River: Seasonal contrasts and connectivity between floodplain lakes and the mainstem	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Fatty acid (FA) composition and stable isotope (delta C-13, delta N-15) signatures of four aquatic plants, plankton, sediment, soil and suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM) collected from open floodplain lakes (Varzea) and rivers of the central Brazilian Amazon basin were gathered during high and low water stages in 2009. SPOM from Varzea had a major contribution of autochthonous material from phytoplankton and C-3 aquatic plants. As shown from stable isotope composition of SPOM (delta C-13 -31.3 +/- 3.2 parts per thousand; delta N-15 3.6 +/- 1.5 parts per thousand), the C-4 aquatic phanerogam (delta C-13 -13.1 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand; delta N-15 4.1 +/- 1.7 parts per thousand) contribution appeared to be weak, although these plants were the most abundant macrophyte in the Varzea. During low water season, increasing concentration of 18:3 omega 3 was recorded in the SPOM of lakes. This FA, abundant mainly in the Varzea plants (up to 49% of total FAs), was due to the accumulation of their detritus in the ecosystem. This dry season, when connectivity with the river mainstem was restricted, was also characterized by a high concentration in the SPOM of the cyanobacteria marker 16:1 omega 7 (up to 21% of total FAs). The FA compositions of SPOM from the Amazon River also exhibited significant seasonal differences, in particular a higher concentration of 16:1 omega 7 and 18:3 omega 3 during the dry season. This suggests a seasonal contribution of autochthonous material produced in Varzea to the Amazon River SPOM. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Semen samples were collected from fishes in the middle of the spawning season, at Toya Lake station, Hokkaido University, and the end of the spawning season, at the Nanae freshwater station, Hokkaido University. The semen was diluted with the extender at a 1:5 ratio (semen:extender) and then equilibrated for 15 min. The final concentration was 0.15 M and 7.5% for glucose and methanol, respectively. Sperm motility was assessed for fresh, fresh-diluted, and post-thaw semen using computer-assisted sperm analysis. The post-thaw sperm showed lower motility, compared with those of fresh and fresh-diluted sperm, which ranged from 33.9% to 82.9% and 1.5% to 27.1% in the semen collected in the middle and end the spawning season, respectively. Sperm concentration, pH, and electric conductivity of the semen collected at the end of the spawning season were lower than those of semen collected in the middle of the spawning season. Moreover, remarkably high DNA concentrations were detected in the semen at the end of the spawning season, although no difference was observed in protein concentration. Finally, semen cryopreserved using the aforementioned method could be used for artificial fertilization to produce offspring. These results indicate that the glucose-methanol extender is useful for sperm cryopreservation in masu salmon and that the suitability of semen for cryopreservation is affected by the condition of the parental fish.

Spatio-temporal patterns of groundwater depths and soil nutrients in a small watershed in the Ethiopian highlands: Topographic and land-use controls	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Soil and water conservation structures, promoted by local and international development organizations throughout rural landscapes, aim to increase recharge and prevent degradation of soil surface characteristics. This study investigates this unexamined relationship between recharge, water table depths, and soil surface characteristics (nutrients) in a small sub-watershed in the northwestern Ethiopian highlands. These highland watersheds have high infiltration rates (mean 70 mm hr(-1) median 33 mm hr(-1)), recharging the shallow unconfined hillslope aquifer with water transport occurring via subsurface pathways down the slope. The perched water tables reflect the subsurface flux and are deep where this flux is rapid in the upland areas (138 cm below surface). Soil saturation and overland flow occur when the subsurface flux exceeds the transport capacity of the soil in the lower downslope areas near the ephemeral stream (19 cm below surface). Land use is directly related to the water table depth, corresponding to grazing and fallowed (saturated) land in the downslope areas and cultivated (unsaturated) land in the middle and upper parts where the water table is deeper. Kjeldahl Total Nitrogen (TN), Bray II available phosphorus (AP), and exchangeable potassium (K+) averages exhibit different behaviors across slope, land use transects, or saturation conditions. TN was moderate to low (0.07% +/- 0.04) in various land uses and slope regions. Bray II AP had very low concentrations (0.25 mg kg(-1) +/- 0.26) among the different slope regions with no significant differences throughout (p > .05). The exchangeable cation (K+, Ca2+, Mg2+) concentrations and pH, however, were greater in non-cultivated (seasonally saturated) lands and in a downslope direction (p < .001, p < .005, p < .05, and p < .005, respectively). These results show that the perched groundwater plays an important role in influencing land use, the amount of water seasonally available for crop growth, and exchangeable cations, but have no clear effect on the concentration of the two primarily applied nutrients in fertilizers (N, P).

Epidemiology and Genetic Diversity of Grapevine Leafroll-Associated Viruses in British Columbia	PLANT DISEASE												Grapevine leafroll disease (GLD) is a complex associated with one or more virus species belonging to the family Closteroviridae. The majority of viruses in this complex are vectored by one or more species of mealybugs (Pseudococcidae) and/or scale insects (Coccidae). Grape-growing regions of British Columbia (BC), including Okanagan, Similkameen, and Fraser valleys and Kamloops (BC central interior), Vancouver, and Gulf islands, were surveyed during the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons for the presence of four major grapevine leafroll-associated viruses, including Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 1 (GLRaV-1), GLRaV-2, GLRaV-3, and GLRaV-4. In total, 3,056 composite five-vine samples were collected from 153 Vitis vinifera and three interspecific hybrid vineyard blocks. The results showed GLRaV-3 to be the most widespread, occurring in 16.7% of the composite samples, followed by GLRaV-4 (3.9%), GLRaV-1 (3.8%), and GLRaV-2 (3.0%). Mixed infections of two or more GLRaVs were found in 4.1% of the total samples. The relative incidence of GLRaVs differed among regions and vineyard blocks of a different age. Characterization of partial CO1 region from a total of 241 insect specimens revealed the presence of Pseudococcus maritinmus, Parthenolecanium corni, and other Pulvinaria sp. in BC vineyards. Spatial patterns of GLRaV-3 infected grapevines in three vineyard blocks from three different regions in the Okanagan Valley showed variable degrees of increase in disease spread ranging from 0 to 19.4% over three growing seasons. Regional differences in the relative incidence and spread of GLD underline the need for region-based management programs for BC vineyards.					; Poojari, Sudarsana/Y-7587-2019	Poojari, SUDARSANA/0000-0001-9258-1612; 													0191-2917	1943-7692				DEC	2017	101	12					2088	2097		10.1094/PDIS-04-17-0497-RE	http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-04-17-0497-RE								30677387					WOS:000414888800016

Reporting on the status, trends, and drivers of algal blooms on Lake of the Woods using satellite-derived bloom indices (2002-2021)	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Despite significant declines in external phosphorus loads, Lake of the Woods continues to experience sev-ere recurring cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cHABs) covering as much as 80% of the lake surface area. Satellite-derived bloom indices were used to assess the status, trends, and drivers of cHAB condi-tions for the period 2002 to 2021 in support of developing ecosystem objectives and response indicators for the lake. Areas of greatest potential concern, with the most prolonged bloom occurrences, were in the southeast of the lake. Significant decreases in bloom indices suggest the lake may now be responding to historical nutrient reductions. The greatest rates of decrease were within the main water flow paths, with little change in the more isolated embayments, suggesting flushing plays a key role in regulating regional bloom severity. Significant inter-annual variability in bloom phenology was observed, with blooms peak-ing later in recent years, which may be in response to climate-induced changes in the lake and watershed. The absence of a direct relationship between external phosphorus loads and annual bloom severity reflects the complexity of the lake's response to eutrophication and the potential roles of other drivers including climate and a strong legacy effect of sedimentary nutrients. A case study of the 2017 bloom sea-son captures the compounding interaction of meteorological variability and seasonal nutrient delivery in regulating the bloom response. Results highlight the need for greater understanding of seasonal and regional variability of bloom drivers to aid in forecasting the lake's recovery under both nutrient manage-ment and climate change scenarios.Crown Copyright (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of International Association for Great Lakes Research.

J	Gou, LF; Xu, Y; Tong, FT; Jin, ZD				Gou, Long-Fei; Xu, Yang; Tong, Fengtai; Jin, Zhangdong			Li isotopic seasonality in a small catchment at the northeastern Tibetan Plateau: Roles of hydrology and temperature dependency	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Silicate weathering is critical to sustain our habitable planet. Lithium (Li) isotopes enable us to investigate the nature of silicate weathering. A number of riverine Li isotope (87Lirw) investigations have been made from polar to equatorial terrains, but there remains no consensus about the controlling mechanisms of both weathering and 87Lirw. Here we investigated 87Lirw response to climate by collecting weekly river water samples in a small catchment (the Buha River within the Lake Qinghai basin) on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, with stable tectonic, lithology, and topography. In the hydrology year of 2007 of the Buha River, we find that during the dry seasons, 87Lirw ratios show temperature dependency typically, when the groundwater fed the river. During the monsoon seasons, 87Lirw were obviously lower than the temperature dependency predicted values, when abundant rock dissolved and thereby fresh Li release into rivers. We propose that the hydrology and temperature dependency together play important roles in regulating 87Lirw ratios in such an alpine small catchment. The mechanism is that long residence time facilitates the equilibrium chemical and Li isotopic fractionation during the dry seasons, so a temperature dependency of 87Lirw is achieved.

Using measured data from 2014 to 2018, the monthly and seasonal variations of the water temperature, thermal stability, and their influencing factors were addressed by using empirical models. The results showed substantial variability and seasonality in the reservoir water temperature, which correlated highly with the air temperature, inflow water temperature, and discharge. Correspondingly, there was a seasonal varying thermal stratification in the reservoir's yearly cycle, with its duration being up to 4 similar to 5 months, the maximum surface-bottom water temperature difference being up to 7 similar to 10 degrees C. There were significant positive correlations between Schmidt's stability index of the thermal structure and inflow-reservoir temperature difference and the surface-bottom temperature differences, while negative correlations with large discharge. Moreover, the inflow tends to influence thermal stability by retaining hypolimnion cold water, with its maximum bottom hysteresis residence time being up to similar to 4 months. Research findings indicated that climate warming in the recent 30 years (1988 similar to 2017) would cause a 0.213 degrees C/decade and 0.153 kJ/m(2)/decade increase in reservoir surface water temperature and Schmidt's stability index, respectively. Among these variations, the inflow temperature increase caused by climate change accounted for the largest proportion, i.e., 0.16 degrees C/decade and 0.115 kJ/m(2)/decade. Therefore, climate warming significantly affected the thermal regimes in this large reservoir, and the inflow water temperature increase due to warm air was the main factor altering the reservoir's thermal structure. Findings from the present study provide a fresh perspective on how to best optimize the deep channel-type reservoirs' water quality in the face of anticipated climate change.

The averaged CH4 and CO2 fluxes across the air-water interface from the site were much less than those reported from reservoirs in tropic and temperate regions, and from the natural river channels of the Yangtze River. CH4 Fluxes at the site were very low compared to most other reservoirs or natural lakes. One of the most important reasons may be due to the oxidation of CH4 in the water column owing to the great water depth and high DO in water in the Three Gorges Reservoir. The averaged monthly CH4 and CO2 fluxes at the site during the observation year were 0.05 mg/(m(2).hr) and 104.43 mg/(m(2).hr) respectively with the maximum occurred in July 2010. The monthly CO2 fluxes during the observation year were positively correlated to the surface water temperature, and negatively correlated to the air pressure and the surface water pH. The CO2 flux showed a positive correlation with DOC to some extent, although not significantly, which indicated that allochthonous organic C was a major source of CO2 and biogeochemical processes in this reservoir were C-limited. The significantly positive correlation between the reservoir outflow and the seasonal gas flux indicate the disturbance condition of the water body dominated the seasonal gas emission.

The new field sampler allows SPME fibers and silicone hollow fibers to be immersed and equilibrated in situ, whereas an automated liner exchanger (ALEX) facilitates the quantitative transfer of analytes to the GC without the use of extraction solvents. The sampler was developed for environmental monitoring as follows: (1) It is of very solid construction and can be reused practically ad infinitum. (2) Fibers with varying surface to volume ratios can be exposed in parallel in order to confirm that equilibrium was reached between sampler and sediment. (3) The equilibrium times allow a temporal resolution that is suited for monitoring of both long-term trends and seasonal effects. The automated thermal desorption reduced sample treatment to a minimum and ensured cost- and time-efficient measurements while minimizing potential error sources after the sampling. The sampler is applicable in a multitude of aquatic environments, especially where currents are low and sediments are muddy and well-mixed, e.g. by bioturbation. Examples for such environments are mud flats, harbor basins, river banks, and lakes.

This study aims to address this question by investigating the influence of bioconvection on the eco-physiology of the anoxygenic phototrophic sulfur bacteria community of meromictic Lake Cadagno.MethodsHere we comprehensively explore its effects by comparing the physicochemical profiles of the water column and the physiological traits of the main populations of the bacterial layer (BL). The search for eco-physiological effects of bioconvection involved a comparative analysis between two time points during the warm season, one featuring bioconvection (July) and the other without it (September).ResultsA prominent distinction in the physicochemical profiles of the water column centers on light availability, which is significantly higher in July. This minimum threshold of light intensity is essential for sustaining the physiological CO2 fixation activity of Chromatium okenii, the microorganism responsible for bioconvection. Furthermore, the turbulence generated by bioconvection redistributes sulfides to the upper region of the BL and displaces other microorganisms from their optimal ecological niches.ConclusionThe findings underscore the influence of bioconvection on the physiology of C. okenii and demonstrate its functional role in improving its metabolic advantage over coexisting phototrophic sulfur bacteria. However, additional research is necessary to confirm these results and to unravel the multiscale processes activated by C. okenii's motility mechanisms.					; SEPULVEDA STEINER, Oscar/IZE-0774-2023; Sengupta, Anupam/AAO-1025-2020; Sepúlveda Steiner, Oscar/IZE-0774-2023; Buetti-Dinh, Antoine/HNB-4313-2023; Storelli, Nicola/AAP-5061-2021	Storelli, Nicola/0000-0002-1318-115X; SEPULVEDA STEINER, Oscar/0000-0001-7919-0297; 														1664-302X				DEC 13	2023	14								1253009	10.3389/fmicb.2023.1253009	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1253009								38163082					WOS:001135984800001

Dominance-diversity architecture of a mixed hygromorphic-to-xeromorphic flora from a botanically rich locality in western equatorial Pangea (lower Permian Emily Irish site, Texas, USA	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Here we describe the Leonardian-age flora from "Emily Irish" (Russell Ranch), a small oxbow lake deposit, which is believed to be one of the most extensively collected, single-excavation floras of this age from any place in the world, including ca. 5200 hand specimens housed at the US National Museum of Natural History. The flora is dominated by a mixture of xeromorphic and meso-hygromorphic elements. The xeromorphs include conifers, taeniopterids, cordaitaleans, and noeggerathialeans. The mesomorphic-to-hygromorphic elements include marattialean tree ferns, sphenopsids, lycopsids, callipterids, and medullosan pteridosperms. This co-dominance of hygromorphic and xeromorphic elements is made especially conspicuous by the intimate co-mingling of plant remains from each group on the same hand specimens, and by the relative preservation-state of the macrofossils, which does not differ between the two groups. These observations suggest that they inhabited the same landscape immediately surrounding the depositional environment, and were likely only differentiated by micro habitat. We suggest that the Emily Irish flora grew under seasonally dry climate, but that areas adjacent to the lake and feeder streams retained sufficient moisture to support patches of taxa requiring consistently high soil moisture. These patches, thus, were embedded within a landscape of periodic moisture deficit that supported vegetation composed mostly of xeromorphic elements. This is more likely than requiring the xeromorphic taxa to be transported to the site from extrabasinal habitats, the nearest of which were hundreds of kilometers away at the time the deposit formed.					; DiMichele, William/K-4301-2012	DiMichele, William/0000-0002-7270-220X; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				FEB 1	2021	563								110132	10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.110132	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.110132													WOS:000607210300001

Insights from stoichiometric three-dimensional numerical modeling	AQUATIC SCIENCES												One debate about lake restoration is whether there is overemphasis of a "Phosphorus (P)-only" paradigm, while overlooking the limiting effect of nitrogen (N). In particular, the roles of internal nutrient cycling which could act as drivers of algal blooms are not yet well assessed. However, it is hardly possible to identify the complex mechanisms of nutrient limitation patterns in lakes only by in-situ experiments or monitored data. Numerical modeling can serve as a complementary approach by providing quantitative internal variations with high spatial and temporal resolutions. A three-dimensional model-based N:P stoichiometric approach was developed to explore the storage pools and fluxes that affect the limiting nutrient in hyper-eutrophic Lake Dianchi, the most eutrophic large lake in China with seasonal N limitation. The results highlighted the role of benthic P fluxes, which fluctuated considerably within a year and could supply enough P for algae, contributing over 50% of P input and leading to relative N deficiency during algal bloom. Further insights into N cycling indicated that N deficiency could be attributed to low N fixation and extremely high N losses from denitrification (similar to 50% of total loss). Considering the continuous sediment P release and N losses that promote N deficiency, controlling both N and P loadings will benefit lake restoration.					, jiangqingsong/H-4356-2019; Liu, Yong/B-1826-2008; Wu, Zhen/GZG-5518-2022; Zhao, Lei/F-4258-2018; Elser, James/AAL-6199-2020	Liu, Yong/0000-0001-8181-1080; Wu, Zhen/0000-0001-8474-4274; 													1015-1621	1420-9055				JUL 22	2020	82	4							70	10.1007/s00027-020-00744-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-020-00744-w													WOS:000555091100002

Due to the complexity and small vertical extent of this region, however, previous modeling studies of the Baltic Sea have so far not been able to provide a numerically and physically sound representation of boundary mixing. Here we discuss first results from a nested high-resolution simulation of the central Baltic Sea that aims at a realistic description of the turbulent bottom boundary layer with the help of new numerical techniques (adaptive coordinates) and state-of-the-art turbulence modeling. Using a comprehensive data set from the Baltic Sea Tracer Release Experiment, we show that the model is able to reproduce the key dynamical processes (near-inertial waves, topographic waves, and a rim current) with excellent accuracy. Boundary mixing triggered by these processes was found to result in simulated basin-scale mixing rates in close agreement with observations, including a seasonal variability that has been emphasized in previous studies. These results may be relevant also for the description of mixing in large lakes and other stratified basins.					; Gräwe, Ulf/D-4493-2016; Umlauf, Lars/B-5521-2012; Holtermann, Peter/M-7668-2017; Grawe, Ulf/D-4493-2016	Klingbeil, Knut/0000-0002-6736-1260; Holtermann, Peter/0000-0002-2108-259X; Grawe, Ulf/0000-0003-4007-9764													2169-9275	2169-9291				FEB	2014	119	2					1465	1487		10.1002/2013JC009483	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2013JC009483													WOS:000336261200047
J	Badger, AM; Bjarke, N; Molotch, NP; Livneh, B				Badger, Andrew M.; Bjarke, Nels; Molotch, Noah P.; Livneh, Ben			The sensitivity of runoff generation to spatial snowpack uniformity in an alpine watershed: Green Lakes Valley, Niwot Ridge Long-Term Ecological Research station	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Seasonal water storage in high-elevation alpine catchments are critical sources of water for mountainous regions like the western U.S. The spatial distribution of snow in these topographically complex catchments is primarily governed by orography, solar radiation, and wind redistribution. While the effect of solar shading is relatively consistent from year-to-year, the redistribution of snow due to wind is more variable - capable of producing snowpacks that have varying degrees of uniformity across these hydrologically-important catchments. A reasonable hypothesis is that a warmer climate will cause snowfall to become more dense (i.e. wetter and heavier), possibly leading to less wind redistribution and thus produce a more uniformly distributed snowpack across the landscape. In this study, we investigate the role of increasingly uniform spatial snowpack distributions on streamflow generation in the Green Lakes Valley Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research station, within the headwaters of the Boulder Creek watershed in Colorado. A set of idealized hydrologic simulation experiments driven by reconstructed snowpacks spanning 2001-2014 show that more a more uniform spatial snowpack distribution leads to an earlier melt-out of 31 days on average and tends to produce less total streamflow, with maximum decreases as large as 7.5%. Isolating the role of snowpack heterogeneity from melt-season precipitation, we find that snowpack uniformity reduces total streamflow by as much as 13.2%. Reductions in streamflow are largely explained by greater exposure to solar radiation in the uniformly distributed case relative to a more heterogeneous snowpack, with this exposure driving shifts towards earlier snowmelt and changes in soil water storage. Overall, we find that the runoff efficiency from shallower snowpacks is more sensitive to the effects of uniformity than deeper snowpacks, which has potential implications for a warming climate where shallower snowpacks and enhanced sensitivities may be present.

Characterizing spatial and temporal distributions of turbulent mixing and dissipation in Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The knowledge about the distribution of small-scale turbulence in Lake Erie is limited. The present study analyzed 12 m; Group Central: 12-25 m; Group East: 25 m), with the Group Central divided into seasonally stratified and unstratified period. Group West had the highest mean epsilon = 3.8 x 10-8m(2)s(-3), over all depths and lowest mean K-z 10(-5)m(2)s(-1) through the bottom layer. Due to the shear instability, generated by internal waves, elevated epsilon similar to 5 x 10(-8)m(2)s(-3) was observed in the metalimnion of the Group Central, during the seasonally stratified period, when K-z was limited. The hypolimnion was calm in Group Central (epsilon 10(-8) 10(-9)m(2)s(-3)), except when entrainment or basin-scale seiches accelerated the flow, leading to enhanced epsilon 10(-7)m(2)s(-3) and Kz 10(-3)m(2)s(-1). We extended the turbulent kinetic energy budget, in Lake Erie, to include the surface layer. Around 58% of the energy flux entering the lake dissipated in the surface layer, and the remaining 42% in the lake interior. Both lake surface area and Wedderburn numbers provided predictions on the magnitude of K-z, which decreased with increasing Wedderburn numbers at a rate slower than with increasing lake number.

Simultaneous determination of mercury and organic carbon in sediment and soils using a direct mercury analyzer based on thermal decomposition-atomic absorption spectrophotometry	ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA												The purpose of this work was to study the feasibility of using a direct mercury analyzer (DMA) to simultaneously determine mercury (Hg) and organic matter content in sediment and soils. Organic carbon was estimated by re-weighing the sample boats post analysis to obtain loss-on-ignition (LOI) data. The DMA-LOI results were statistically similar (p < 0.05) to the conventional muffle furnace approach. A regression equation was developed to convert DMA-LOI data to total organic carbon (TOC), which varied between 0.2% and 13.0%. Thus, mercury analyzers based on combustion can provide accurate estimates of organic carbon content in non-calcareous sediment and soils; however, weight gain from moisture (post-analysis), measurement uncertainty, and sample representativeness should all be taken into account. Sediment cores from seasonal wetland and open water areas from six oxbow lakes in the Mississippi River alluvial flood plain were analyzed. Wetland sediments generally had higher levels of Hg than open water areas owing to a greater fraction of fine particles and higher levels of organic matter. Annual loading of Hg in open water areas was estimated at 4.3, 13.4, 19.2, 20.7, 129, and 135 ng cm (2) yr (1) for Beasley, Roundaway, Hampton, Washington, Wolf and Sky Lakes, respectively. Generally, the interval with the highest Hg flux was dated to the 1960s and 1970s. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The lake's quality is deteriorating due to the untreated wastewater, and sediment inflow resulting in the death of fish was observed during the dry season. The research aims to determine the water quality status using water quality indices, in addition to identifying the reason for the death of fish in the dry season in Chamo Lake. The water samples were drawn from 5 sampling points by composite sampling method during the dry and wet seasons of the year, and we analyzed 22 water quality parameters. Ammonia (14-23.6 mg/l), phosphates (0.30-1.10 mg/l), BOD (25.32-60 mg/l), COD (40-160 mg/l), and chlorophyll (19.64-31.87 mu g/L) concentrations were above the permissible limits, and DO (5.20-6.70 mg/l) was below the acceptable limit in the lake as per EPA standards concerning temperature. The values of both the water quality indices of CCMEWQI (13.90-18.40) and NSFWQI (38.59-49.63) indicated that the water quality was "poor" and "bad," respectively. The death of fish might be due to high concentrations of ammonia and nutrients in the dry season.

Concentrations of Cd (64.21 mu g g(-1)) and Cr (28.51 mu g g(-1)) were found to be high in sediment, whereas in green algae concentration of Pb (8.32 mu g g(-1)) was higher than water and sediment samples. The relative abundance of these heavy metals in U. lactuca and sediment were found to be in the order Cd > Cr > Pb, whereas in water the ratio was found to be Cr > Pb > Cd. The seasonal variations in Cd and Pb followed a similar pattern in both seaweeds and sediments, but not in water samples.

Bays were deemed to be the most critical zone for water management of TGR; thus, a 3.5-year temporal and spatial investigation was performed to disclose water quality variation in TGR bays and to elucidate the potential affecting factors based on an integrated hydrographical analysis. The results showed that TGR bays had been moderately polluted with averaged nitrogen (N) concentration over 2 mg L-1 and phosphorus (P) concentration less than 0.1 mg L-1 in dry season and while high P over 0.2 mg L-1 and low N of 1.54 mg L-1 in average in flooding season. The interaction of dam regulation and flooding events influenced the temporal pattern of water quality in the TGR bays, in which particulate nutrients dynamic played an important role.

J	Zhai, SJ; Hu, WP; Zhu, ZC				Zhai, Shuijing; Hu, Weiping; Zhu, Zecong			Ecological impacts of water transfers on Lake Taihu from the Yangtze River, China	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												As an ecosystem responds to external environmental changes slowly due to its reorganization compared with the water quality and it has great influence on lake ecosystems, it is indispensable to evaluate ecological impacts from water transfers for the security of the water source in Lake Taihu. Evaluations were conducted by comparing the indicators exergy (Ex), structural exergy (Ex(st)) and phytoplankton buffer capacity (beta(((TP)/(Phy)))) changes after water transfers from 2002 to 2007 with those reference statuses where the water transfers were not implemented from 1998 to 2001. Besides those three ecological indicators, affiliated indicators such as ratio of zooplankton biomass to phytoplankton biomass. diversity index and trophic state index were also involved in the evaluation. The results showed the water transfers altered the ecosystem status and had positive effects on Lake Taihu and most of its sub-zones, such as Gonghu Bay, Northwest Zone, Southwest Zone and Centre Zone in the post-transfer period. The seasonable trends indicated that the ecosystem health with environmental influences excluded in November and February was better than that in May and August during the water transfers from 2002 to 2007 and there were significant differences in the ecosystem health of the first and second stages during water transfers. The ecosystem health in May and August was better than in November and February during the first stage of the water transfers (from 2002 to 2004). while the opposite obtained during the second stage from 2005 to 2007 in Dongtaihu Bay and East Epigeal Zone. On the whole, water transfers serve to deter algal congregation in Lake Taihu. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J	Crétaux, JF; Birkett, C				Cretaux, Jean-Francois; Birkett, Charon			Lake studies from satellite radar altimetry	COMPTES RENDUS GEOSCIENCE												For more than 10 years, satellite radar altimetry has been a successful technique for monitoring the variation in elevation of continental surface water, such as inland seas, lakes, rivers, and more recently wetland zones. The surface water level is measured within a terrestrial reference frame with a repeatability varying from 10 to 35 days depending on the orbit cycle of the satellite. With several decades of technique refinement, current data processing can be fairly simple or complex depending on the mission and the instrument tracking methods. Data acquisition is not affected by weather conditions, but the technique can have a number of limitations. Rapidly varying topography or complex terrain may inhibit the retrieval of good elevation data. The instruments can only operate in a profiling mode and do not have a true global view. Stage accuracies are also dependent on target size and surface roughness, which will limit worldwide surveying and limnological applications. However, there is the scope for systematic continental scale monitoring and the provision of new stage information where gauge data is absent. The technique is sufficiently advanced to have enabled a number of inland water case studies. Focussing on the large lakes, the links between lake evolution and the local climate cycle on seasonal to interannual timescales have been explored, and water storage balance for water management has also been brought into focus. Typically altimetric stage measurements can range in accuracy from a few centimetres (e.g., Great Lakes, USA) to tens of centimetres (e.g., Lake Chad, Africa), depending on size and wind conditions. In the case of the Aral Sea, contributing E-P (1.5 km(3) yr(-1)), river run-off (3.0 km(3) yr(-1)) and altimetry (1.5 km(3) yr(-1)) errors combine to give a similar to 3.5 km(3) yr(-1) water mass balance error. Of particular interest are those lakes in and and semi-arid regions where water is an essential economical resource. Anthropogenic influences (irrigation and the construction of dams) may strongly affect lake and inland sea evolution or affect the global water cycle in general, noting the worldwide development of large reservoirs over the last 50 years. With regards to societal and economic issues then, this article reviews several of the case studies focussing on the Aral and Caspian Seas, and Lakes Issykkul and Chad.																			1631-0713					NOV-DEC	2006	338	14-15					1098	1112		10.1016/j.crte.2006.08.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crte.2006.08.002													WOS:000242791600015

In this research, we used long-term empirical data about the plankton community of a small mountain lake (Lake Santo, northern Apennines, Italy) to reconstruct its developmental trajectory during a period comprised between early 1970 s and 2010 s. We exploited these data to build yearly ecological networks and from their configuration of energy flows we computed network information indices. The trends of these indices enlighten about the developmental trajectory of this ecosystem during the period covered by the data set. In particular, they indicate that Lake Santo evolved in the direction of increasing stability at the expense of efficiency in energy transfer. We compared these results with current hypotheses about the directionality of ecosystem development, which are rooted in ecosystem theory, and discussed the possibility that, counter to some theoretical models of ecosystem development, Lake Santo followed an unimpeded direction of development rather than a trajectory typical of an ecosystem under stress. Finally, the long-term trends of flow network indices provided insights about the health status of the ecosystem.

Small Changes in Flooding Have Large Consequences: Experimental Data from Ten Wetland Plants	WETLANDS												Flooding regime is a major determinant of vegetation composition in wetlands. Flooding regimes are also commonly altered by human activity. We used an experimentally-created elevation gradient on mineral soil to measure the responses of ten common marsh species to flood regimes ranging from 0 to 100 % of the growing season. We asked three questions. (1) What are the minimum and maximum tolerances of these ten species to a flood duration gradient? (2) Is there one duration of flooding that is physiologically optimal for a majority of the species? (3) How sensitive are these species to minor changes in flood duration? We found that the number of species, the cover and the aboveground biomass were highest when flood duration was less than a third of the growing season. All species showed a pattern of inclusive fundamental niches for flooding duration, with a preference for shorter periods of flooding, for less than a third of the growing season. Narrow-leaved graminoids became relatively more common with longer flooding duration. This study challenges our notions of the fundamental niches of these wetland emergent plants. Other factors beyond flooding tolerance must be acting to structure wetland communities along wetland depth gradients.																			0277-5212	1943-6246				JUN	2016	36	3					457	466		10.1007/s13157-016-0754-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-016-0754-7													WOS:000376658700005

Environmental parameters and MCs in sediment, phytoplankton and water column also were examined. L hoffineisteri accumulated extremely high MC concentrations during the warmest months, with a maximum value of 11.99 mu g/g (MC-LR: 1.76 mu g/g, MC-RR: 2.51 mu g/g, and MC-YR: 7.73 mu g/g). Total MC concentrations in L. hoffmeisteri declined after October (2013) and began to increase in May (2014). Between July and October, MC-YR concentration was higher than MC-LR and MC-RR. MC concentrations in L. hoffineisteri were positively correlated with pH, water temperature, conductivity, chlorophyll a, nitrite and the biomass of Microcystis, and negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrate, total nitrogen (TN), dissolved total inorganic carbon and the biomass of Bacillariophyta. In addition, MCs in phytoplankton were more strongly correlated with MCs in L. hoffmeisteri than in the water column or sediment. Our results demonstrated that L. hoffineisteri could accumulate high MC concentrations in the bloom season, which might transfer to the edible zoobenthos and fish through trophic transfer, thereby posing a significant health threat to humans.

J	Ngochera, MJ; Bootsma, HA				Ngochera, Maxon J.; Bootsma, Harvey A.			Spatial and temporal dynamics of pCO2 and CO2 flux in tropical Lake Malawi	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Numerous studies have documented CO2 dynamics in temperate lakes, but few such studies have been conducted on tropical lakes. Spatial and seasonal variation of air and water pCO(2), along with supporting limnological and meteorological variables, were measured aboard a vessel of opportunity along the north-south axis of Lake Malawi. These measurements were used to estimate annual net lake-atmosphere CO2 flux and infer mechanisms regulating it. Surface pCO(2) and CO2 flux varied significantly with season and location. Temporally, the lake was CO2-undersaturated during the rainy season and the mixing season, and supersaturated at the onset of the mixing season and during the hot, stratified season. Concurrent measurements of lake temperature, weather conditions, phytoplankton biomass, and seston delta C-13 suggest that periods of net CO2 flux into the lake correspond with higher phytoplankton growth rates resulting from internal nutrient loading in the mixing season and allochthonous nutrient inputs in the rainy season. Unlike the rest of the lake, the southernmost region of the lake was usually CO2 supersaturated even though phytoplankton productivity is highest in this region. While the upwelling of hypolimnetic water at the southern end of the lake is a major source of nutrients that drive phytoplankton photosynthesis and CO2 uptake, the CO2 introduced in upwelled water appears to overwhelm photosynthetic capacity locally, especially at the onset of the mixing season. Lake Malawi appears to be a net CO2 sink with an annual whole-lake CO2 flux of -2.17 +/- 0.25 x 10(10) mol C yr(-1) and a mean daily CO2 flux of -2.05 +/- 0.27 mmol C m(-2) d(-1). A comparison of deep-water C : P ratios with epilimnetic seston C : P ratios suggests that P is recycled more efficiently than C in the lake's anoxic hypolimnion, and so P vertical mixing creates a carbon deficit that is met by flux from the atmosphere into the lake.

Species sorting affects bacterioplankton community composition as determined by 16S rDNA and 16S rRNA fingerprints	ISME JOURNAL												To understand the mechanisms determining community composition, it is essential to distinctively unravel the importance of local from that of regional processes. In this effort, the mechanisms underlying bacterioplankton community assembly were analysed in eight lakes of short water residence time (WRT) during a four-season sampling campaign. Bacterioplankton community composition (BCC) was determined using terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-RFLP) on the 16S rRNA gene (16S rDNA) and 16S rRNA. The relationship between similarity in BCC between a lake and its major inlet on the one hand and cell import per cell production rate from the inlet to the lake epilimnion on the other was used as a measure of the importance of cell dispersal (mass effects) for community assembly. Low similarities in BCC between lakes and their inlets were observed even at short WRTs, and the degree of similarity correlated better with the environmental conditions in lakes and streams than with cell import per cell production rates. Thus, mass effects seemed less important for local lake BCC in comparison to environmental habitat characteristics (species sorting). Analyses of 16S rDNA and 16S rRNA community fingerprints yielded similar results, indicating that species-sorting dynamics exerted an equally important effect on both the abundant and active fraction within the studied bacterioplankton communities.

The STDDM was done in three stages: (1) up-sampling grid-observations and GCM simulations for spatially continuous finer grids, (2) creating the mapping relationship between the observations and the simulations differently in space and time, and (3) correcting the simulation and producing downscaled data to a spatially continuous grid scale. We applied the STDDM to precipitation downscaling in the Poyang Lake watershed using the MRI-CGCM3 (Meteorological Research Institute Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere General Circulation Model 3), with an acceptable uncertainty of <= 4.9 %. Then we created future precipitation changes from 1998 to 2100 (1998-2012 in the historical scenario and 2013-2100 in the RCP8.5 scenario). The precipitation changes increased heterogeneities in temporal and spatial distribution under future climate warming. In terms of temporal patterns, the wet season become wetter, while the dry season become drier. The frequency of extreme precipitation increased, while that of the moderate precipitation decreased. Total precipitation increased, while rainy days decreased. The maximum continuous dry days and the maximum daily precipitation both increased. In terms of spatial patterns, the dry area exhibited a drier condition during the dry season, and the wet area exhibited a wetter condition during the wet season. Analysis with temperature increment showed precipitation changes can be significantly explained by climate warming, with p < 0.05 and R >= 0.56. The precipitation changes indicated that the downscaling method is reasonable, and the STDDM could be successfully applied to the basin-scale region based on a GCM. The results implied an increasing risk of floods and droughts under global warming, which were a reference for water balance analysis and water resource planning.					; Xu, QiangQiang/MFJ-3601-2025; Fu, Xiaokang/HHS-7155-2022; Zhang, Ling/AAP-2477-2021; Lu, Jianzhong/E-5698-2013; Liang, Dong/A-3335-2011	Lu, Jianzhong/0000-0002-6432-8481; Fu, Xiaokang/0000-0002-3396-6720; 													1027-5606	1607-7938				MAR 21	2019	23	3					1649	1666		10.5194/hess-23-1649-2019	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-1649-2019													WOS:000461938000001

The D-C23 record co-varies with other eastern Mediterranean records, suggesting relatively wetter conditions c. 6-4.5ka, followed by progressively drier conditions leading up to maximum aridity c. 2.8 ka. This arid phase was interrupted by a shift in D-C23 between 3.3 and 3.1ka inferring wetter conditions and/or tentative responses to anthropogenic water regulating activities during the Late Bronze Age. After 2.7ka, a return to more humid conditions was followed by increased dryness and stronger seasonality contrasts from c. 2.0ka. The D-C23 record shows three short-lived excursions (5.7, 5.3, 2.8ka), where isotope values dropped by >20 parts per thousand and immediately stabilized again. The events were paralleled by abrupt increases in sedimentation rates. We hypothesize that the isotopic shifts represent a response to mixing of ground water systems during tectonic events, followed by sealing of seismically derived cracks in the active fault. The outcome of the study is promising for future expansion of isotope-based proxies on sediments in the region, to reconstruct both hydroclimate and past seismic activity.

J	Sadki, M; Munier, S; Boone, A; Ricci, S				Sadki, Malak; Munier, Simon; Boone, Aaron; Ricci, Sophie			Implementation and sensitivity analysis of the Dam-Reservoir OPeration model (DROP v1.0) over Spain	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT												The prediction of water resource evolution is considered to be a major challenge for the coming century, particularly in the context of climate change and increasing demographic pressure. Water resources are directly linked to the continental water cycle, and the main processes modulating changes can be represented by global hydrological models. However, anthropogenic impacts on water resources, and in particular the effects of dams-reservoirs on river flows, are still poorly known and generally neglected in coupled land surface-river routing models. This paper presents a parameterized reservoir model, DROP (Dam-Reservoir OPeration), based on Hanasaki's scheme to compute monthly releases given inflows, water demands and the management purpose. With its significantly anthropized river basins, Spain has been chosen as a study case for which simulated outflows and water storage variations are evaluated against in situ observations over the period 1979-2014. Using a default configuration of the reservoir model, results reveal its positive contribution in representing the seasonal cycle of discharge and storage variation, specifically for large-storage capacity irrigation reservoirs. Based on a bounded version of the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) index, called C2M, the overall outflow representation is improved by 43 % in the median. For irrigation reservoirs, the improvement rate reaches 80 %. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis of DROP model parameters was conducted based on the performance of C2M on outflows and volumes using the Sobol method. The results show that the most influential parameter is the threshold coefficient describing the demand-controlled release level. The analysis also reveals the parameters that need to be focused on in order to improve river flow or reservoir water storage modeling by highlighting the difference in the individual effects of the parameters and their interactions depending on whether one focuses on outflows or volume mean seasonal patterns. The results of this generic reservoir scheme show promise for modeling present and future reservoir impacts on the continental hydrology within global land surface-river routing models.

The use of BMWP and ASPT indices for evaluation of water quality according to macroinvertebrates in Kucuk Menderes River (Turkey)	BIOLOGIA					13th International Symposium on Aquatic Oligochaeta (ISAO)	SEP 07-11, 2015	Brno, CZECH REPUBLIC	Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Botany & Zoology				This study was carried out in the Kucuk Menderes River basin in order to determine the water quality and investigate the environmental quality and the applicability of both the Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) and Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT). Monitoring took place in May, July and September 2014 at 10 stations (7 rivers and 3 lakes) according to the method of Intercalibration Common Metrics. Some metrics (BMWP, ASPT, Family Biotic Index, Simpson Diversity Index, Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index, Margalef Diversity Index, dominance, frequency and existence of sensitive species) were calculated. In total, 69 taxa comprising 5,814 individuals were detected. The taxa having the highest frequency rate were Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri (70%), Chironomus (Camptochironomus) tentans (70%), Psammoryctides albicola (60%), Physella acuta (60%), Nais elinguis (60%) and Stylaria lacustris (50%), which are alpha mesosaprobic and polysaprobic species, respectively. The presence and high dominance and frequency rate of these species have indicated basin pollution. Positive indicator species for water quality are Gomphus schneideri, Trithemis annulata, Lindenia tetraphylla, Orthetrum cancellatum, Hydropsyche angustipennis, Cricotopus (Cricotopus) fuscus and Cricotopus (Cricotopus) annulator, while negative indicator species are Culex pipiens, Chironomus (Camptoch.) tentans, Chironomus thummi, Stylaria lacustris and Eristalis tenax. Habitat quality of the Kucuk Menderes River basin was not high (it was found to be heavily polluted/polluted/slightly polluted according to the physicochemical data, BMWP and ASPT) due to physical habitat degradation, urban waste waters, touristic, seasonal dwelling and agricultural activities.					; Kalyoncu, Hasan/JXW-8301-2024; Odabaşı, Deniz/AAG-4271-2019; Mercan, Deniz/AFB-7998-2022	salur, ali/0000-0003-0761-3857; kalyoncu, hasan/0000-0001-7764-5809; Mercan, Deniz/0000-0002-5526-8501													0006-3088	1336-9563				JAN	2016	71	1					49	57		10.1515/biolog-2016-0005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/biolog-2016-0005													WOS:000372095600008

O.; Gucker, Bjorn; Giani, Alessandra			From intermittent to persistent cyanobacterial blooms: identifying the main drivers in an urban tropical reservoir	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Eutrophication has impacted water bodies around the world. Knowledge on how to manage and restore these systems is urgently needed in order to maintain adequate water quality. However, causes and consequences of eutrophication may differ among lakes located in tropical and temperate regions. The eutrophication process is better understood for temperate lakes due to the availability of a larger number of studies and longer time-series of data sets. In tropical regions, long-term studies are rare, but could exemplify the particularities of eutrophication speed under conditions of higher temperatures. The purpose of this work was to analyze the evolution of the eutrophication process in an urban tropical reservoir, using a 15-year time series (with occasional interruptions). The dataset comprised monthly sampling of several environmental variables and the phytoplankton community. We found a continuous process of water quality deterioration, mainly related to increasing levels of nutrient and phytoplankton biomass, as well as decreasing water transparency, even after the installation of a municipal wastewater treatment plant. The ongoing eutrophication resulted in a steep trend of increasing cyanobacteria biomass that turned from a seasonal appearance into more persistent blooms in the most recent decades, while the relative contribution of other algal phyla to total phytoplankton biomass declined, which resulted in a loss of phytoplankton diversity. Phosphorus was the major determinant of the persistent blooms. Even though nitrogen concentrations were very high in this system, they were not significantly correlated with phytoplankton or cyanobacteria biomass. Total-P concentrations increased about three times during the study period, indicating that the reservoir did not respond to recent restoration efforts. The average water temperature, always sufficiently high to allow phytoplankton growth all year round, is an additional factor that makes tropical reservoirs especially sensitive to eutrophication. In contrast to temperate systems, the constantly favorable temperatures in the tropics may facilitate the persistence and dominance of cyanobacteria in the plankton community.

Factor analysis model with non-negative constraints (FA-NNC) combined with local and literature PAH source fingerprints was successful in source identification of particulate PAHs in the atmospheric samples. The results suggested that, in heating period, the main pollution sources were identified as coal-fired boiler emission (56%), residential coal combustion (33%) and traffic emissions (11%). As for non-heating period, the main sources were gasoline engine emission, traffic tunnel emission and coal-fired power plant, and the overall source contributions of traffic emission (gasoline engine + traffic tunnel) were 79% and coal-fired power plant 21%. The current results support our previous study and provide new insights. This can be the first attempt to quantitatively apportion air organic pollutants using receptor models combined with local source fingerprints. The source fingerprints can be used as reference data for source apportionment of atmospheric PAHs of China. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We used long-term monitoring data from Lake Geneva (from 1974 to 2010) to test if changes in phytoplankton seasonal succession across years is related to re-oligotrophication, inter-annual variability in thermal conditions, and Daphnia sp. density. We used a Bayesian method to identify species assemblages and wavelet analysis to detect transient dynamics in seasonal periodicity. A decrease in phosphorus concentrations appeared to play a major role in the inter-annual replacement of species assemblages. Furthermore, some species assemblages exhibited a change in their seasonal periodicity that was most likely induced by changes in Daphnia sp. density. Finally, we demonstrated that flexibility in the pattern of phytoplankton seasonal successions played a stabilizing role at the community level. The results suggest that phenology and inter-annual changes in seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton assemblages are important components to consider for explaining long-term variability in phytoplankton community.

The time series exceeded 3 months (from January 13, 2011 to April 25, 2011). The three analytical methods reflected the trends in the water temperature and DO concentration, while Gaussian fitting determined the trends in the water temperature and DO concentration under the ice as a function of time. We also analyzed the changes in the water temperature and DO cycles using spectral analysis. Between January 13, 2011 and April 5, 2011, water temperature and DO concentration were positively correlated in the upper layer of the water column from 20 cm to 295 cm, with the correlation coefficients (R) of 0.8 to 0.9. However, the correlation was negative (-0.6) at a depth of 395 cm, mainly because DO was depleted, but water temperature remained at ca. 4 degrees C throughout the ice-covered period. There was a negative correlation from April 6, 2011 until the ice broke up (April 26, 2011), while DO tended to decrease as the water temperature increased in the stage between the beginning of melting and the time until the ice broke up. Initially (January 13, 2011), the lower layer temperature remained nearly constant, whereas the upper layer cooled at a rate of 0.5 degrees C per 80 days. When the ice broke up, the upper layer was already 3 degrees C. DO concentration decreased until the ice broke up. In January, the rate of decrease was higher in the lower layer. According to the deepest sensor, DO consumption was 0.15 mg L-1 day(-1) and the bottom was anoxic after almost three months from the freezing date. When the ice broke up, the oxygen content increased in the lower layer and decreased in the upper layer due to convection. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A.; Da Silva, Carolina J.; Diez, Sergi			Cyanobacteria enhance methylmercury production: A hypothesis tested in the periphyton of two lakes in the Pantanal floodplain, Brazil	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The toxic potential of mercury (Hg) in aquatic systems is due to the presence and production of methylmercury (MeHg). Recent studies in tropical floodplain environments showed that periphyton associated with the roots of aquatic macrophytes produce MeHg. Periphyton communities are the first link in the food chain and one of the main MeHg sources in aquatic environments. The aim of this work was to test the hypotheses that the algal community structure affects potential methylation, and ecologically distinct communities with different algal and bacterial densities directly affect the formation of MeHg in the roots of macrophytes. To evaluate these, net MeHg production in the roots of Eichhornia crassipes in relation to the taxonomic structure of associated periphytic algae was evaluated. Macrophyte root samples were collected in the dry and flood season from two floodplain lakes in the Pantanal (Brazil). These lakes have different ecological conditions as a function of their lateral hydrological connectivity with the Paraguay River that is different during times of drought. Results indicated that MeHg production was higher in the flood season than in the dry season. MeHg production rates were higher in the disconnected lake in comparison to the connected lake during the dry season. MeHg production exhibited a strong positive co-variation with cyanobacteria abundance (R-2 = 0.78; p <0.0001 in dry; R-2 = 0.40; p = 0.029 in flood) and with total algal biomass (R-2 = 0.86; p < 0.0001), and a negative co-variation with Zygnemaphyceae (R-2 = 0.50; p = 0.0018) in the lake community in dry season. This indicates that ecological conditions that favour the establishment and development of cyanobacteria are associated with higher rates of methylation in aquatic systems. This suggests that cyanobacteria could be a proxy for sites of MeHg production in some natural aquatic environments. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Since allelopathy has been suggested as a factor that could promote or stabilize harmful algal blooms, we investigated potential allelopathic effects of C. raciborskii on M. aeruginosa. Microcystis aeruginosa was exposed to exudates of a C. raciborskii monoculture and exudates of mixed cultures of both species. Significant growth inhibition of M. aeruginosa was observed only when it was exposed to exudates from the mixed culture with high proportion of C. raciborskii. This result suggests that the production of growth inhibitors seems to depend on stress (competition) and on the density of the producer species. In contrast to the control, M. aeruginosa formed colonies when exposed to filtrates of mixed cultures. As far as we know, this is the first report on colony induction resulting from the interaction between cyanobacteria. Our results suggest that compounds produced by C. raciborskii may induce defense mechanisms in M. aeruginosa. Our results also indicate specificity in this interaction, since another strain of M. aeruginosa showed different responses.					; Soares, Maria/E-9397-2013; Roland, Fabio/C-7918-2013; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012; Mello, Mariana/H-8688-2012	Mendes e Mello, Mariana/0000-0001-9067-9093; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X; 													0142-7873	1464-3774				NOV	2012	34	11					987	994		10.1093/plankt/fbs056	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbs056													WOS:000309467200006

The Searsville Lake Site (California, USA) as a candidate Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point for the Anthropocene Series	ANTHROPOCENE REVIEW												Cores from Searsville Lake within Stanford University's Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve, California, USA, are examined to identify a potential GSSP for the Anthropocene: core JRBP2018-VC01B (944.5 cm-long) and tightly correlated JRBP2018-VC01A (852.5 cm-long). Spanning from 1900 CE +/- 3 years to 2018 CE, a secure chronology resolved to the sub-annual level allows detailed exploration of the Holocene-Anthropocene transition. We identify the primary GSSP marker as first appearance of Pu-239,Pu-240 (372-374 cm) in JRBP2018-VC01B and designate the GSSP depth as the distinct boundary between wet and dry season at 366 cm (6 cm above the first sample containing Pu-239,Pu-240) and corresponding to October-December 1948 CE. This is consistent with a lag of 1-2 years between ejection of Pu-239,Pu-240 into the atmosphere and deposition. Auxiliary markers include: first appearance of Cs-137 in 1958; late 20th-century decreases in delta N-15; late 20th-century elevation in SCPs, Hg, Pb, and other heavy metals; and changes in abundance and presence of ostracod, algae, rotifer, and protozoan microfossils. Fossil pollen document anthropogenic landscape changes related to logging and agriculture. As part of a major university, the Searsville site has long been used for research and education, serves users locally to internationally, and is protected yet accessible for future studies and communication about the Anthropocene.					; Spanbauer, Trisha/P-6916-2019; Redondo, Sergio/GXF-4904-2022; Hajdas, Irka/C-6696-2011; Cundy, Andy/AAE-3234-2020; Rose, Neil/C-5739-2008; Hay, Elizabeth/HKF-8621-2023	Rose, Neil/0000-0002-5697-7334; Spanbauer, Trisha/0000-0002-4014-4995; Gaca, Pawel/0000-0003-0786-3143; Weaver, Karrie/0000-0002-7094-3501; Redondo, Sergio/0000-0003-2620-4311; Viteri, Maria/0000-0002-3751-1045; Cundy, Andy/0000-0003-4368-2569													2053-0196	2053-020X				APR	2023	10	1			SI		116	145		10.1177/20530196221144098	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/20530196221144098		JAN 2023						37213212					WOS:000914230800001

The Amazon undergoes extreme seasonal variations in water level, which produces changes in landscape and diversifies sources of organic inputs into floodplain systems. Although these changes should affect bacterioplankton community composition (BCC), little is known about which factors drive spatial and temporal patterns of bacterioplankton in these Amazonian floodplains. We used high-throughput sequencing (Illumina MiSeq) of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene to investigate spatial and temporal patterns of BCC of two size fractions, and their correlation with environmental variables in an Amazon floodplain lake (Lago Grande do Curuai). We found a high degree of novelty in bacterioplankton, as more than half of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) could not be classified at genus level. Spatial habitat heterogeneity and the flood pulse were the main factors shaping free-living (FL) BCC. The gradient of organic matter from transition zone lake -Amazon River was the main driver for particle-attached (PA) BCC. The BCC reflected the complexity of the system, with more variation in space than in time, although both factors were important drivers of the BCC in this Amazon floodplain system.

The eddy covariance (EC) technique was also used for CO2 fluxes on the lake. The comparison of fluxes obtained by FC and EC showed little discrepancies mainly due to differences in measurements durations which resulted in different average wind speeds. When comparing the gas transfer velocity (k(600)) for a given wind speed, both methods gave similar results. On the lake and excluding rainy events, we obtained an exponential relationship between k(600) and U-10, with a significant intercept at 1.7 cm h(-1), probably due to thermal effects. Gas transfer velocity was also positively related to rainfall rates reaching 26.5 cm h(-1) for a rainfall rate of 36 turn h(-1). During a 24-h experiment in dry season, rainfall accounted for as much as 25% of the k(600). In the river downstream of the dam, k(600) values were 3 to 4 times higher than on the lake, and followed a linear relationship with U-10. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers in Pleistocene loess-paleosol sequences: Three case studies	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY					25th International Meeting on Organic Geochemistry (IMOG)	SEP 18-23, 2011	Interlaken, SWITZERLAND					Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (branched GDGTs) are membrane lipids presumably derived from anaerobic, heterotrophic soil bacteria. Empirical studies have shown that the composition of branched GDGTs in topsoils varies in degree of cyclization and methylation (expressed as CBT and MBT, i.e. cyclization and methylation index of branched tetraethers) depending on soil pH and mean annual air temperature (MAT). Here we present results from three case studies, namely three well-studied loess-paleosol sequences (LPSs), in which we measured the branched GDGTs in order to test the applicability of these biomarkers for paleoclimate reconstruction. The results show that major disagreements exist between expectations based on available stratigraphic, pedological and geochemical data on the one hand, and GDGT-derived reconstructions on the other hand. Caution is therefore advised when interpreting the respective indices in LPS studies. We discuss several potential directions for future research: (i) Some of the target peaks in the HPLC chromatograms consist of multiple, unidentified compounds. This needs to be addressed by way of improved component separation, identification and new calibration studies. (ii) Factors other than MAT and soil pH that could affect membrane composition should be further investigated, e. g. nutrient availability and redox conditions, as well as seasonality and changes in bacterial communities. (iii) GDGTs may be produced in non-negligible amounts at depth and thus overprint the original in situ signal, a concern that could be termed 'growth depth effect'. (iv) GDGTs should also be analyzed in dust source regions and contemporaneous eolian sediments in order to address a potential redeposition effect. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Stable isotope fingerprint of open-water evaporation losses and effective drainage area fluctuations in a subarctic shield watershed	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Stable isotopes of water, oxygen-18 and deuterium, were measured at biweekly to monthly intervals during the open-water season in a small, headwater lake (Pocket Lake, 4.8 ha) near Yellowknife Northwest Territories, and concurrently in a nearby string-of-lakes watershed (Baker Creek, 137 km(2)) situated in the subarctic Precambrian Shield region. As measured in water samples collected over a 12 year period (1997-2008), the levels of evaporative isotopic enrichment in both lake and watershed outflow were differentially offset, and seasonal variations were found in both to be driven by variations in open-water evaporation. Systematic differences measured in the magnitude of the offset between the lake and watershed outflow are interpreted as being caused by changes in the effective drainage area contributing to runoff. Based on the observed and extremely consistent relationship between isotopic compositions of lake water and watershed outflow (r(2) = 0.849, p < 0.001) we extend the analysis of open-water evaporation losses and effective drainage areas back to 1991 when less-frequent water sampling at the sites commenced. This 18-year record serves to demonstrate for the first time the expected variability in the evaporation and transpiration partitioning, upper limits on the effective drainage area, and isotopic signals transferred downstream in a typical shield drainage system within the Mackenzie Basin.

It experienced its first major algal bloom in March-April 2015 that had devastating consequences in the southern shallow lake basin. Such events are expected to intensify in the future and call for a more active and quantitative management of the lake and its watershed. In this paper we describe a coupled ecohydrodynamic model to predict the lake's water quality and, more particularly, the risk of harmful algal blooms. We have coupled a nitrogen-phytoplankton-zooplankton-detritus (NPZD) ecosystem model to the unstructured-mesh 3D hydrodynamic model SLIM. Our high-resolution multi-scale model explicitly represents the exchanges between the two basins composing the lake, through the narrow Strait of Tiquina. This allowed us to study the biophysical processes driving the entire lake over the period of January 2014 to May 2015. The model has been validated against temperature profiles at several locations throughout the lake. It correctly reproduces the seasonal temperature variations that drive the lake stratification and impact the vertical distributions of phytoplankton. Our model was able to replicate the space-time dynamics of the March-April 2015 algal bloom similarly to what was observed on satellite imagery. We believe that our multi scale ecohydrodynamic model is a promising tool to complement field observations and hence support water management in the lake and its watershed.

J	Hites, RA				Hites, Ronald A.			Atmospheric Concentrations of PCB-11 Near the Great Lakes Have Not Decreased Since 2004	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY LETTERS												3,3'-Dichlorobiphenyl (PCB-11) is thought to be a byproduct of the production of yellow pigments, and thus, it has sources to the environment that differ both in type and magnitude compared to the PCBs that made up the, now banned, Aroclor commercial products. To assess these differences, the temporal trends of atmospheric concentrations of PCB-11 relative to those of 31 specific Aroclor-related congeners and relative to those of total Aroclor-PCBs at six sites near the North American Great Lakes were investigated. About 1800 atmospheric samples were collected over the period of 2004-2015 (inclusive). A multiple linear regression approach was used to isolate the variations in the atmospheric concentrations due to the human population near the sampling sites, seasonal effects, and long-term temporal changes. The atmospheric concentrations of the Aroclor-PCBs are decreasing with halving times of about 12 years, but the atmospheric concentrations of PCB-11 have not changed significantly over this time period. These results suggest that PCB-11 is still leaking into the environment, while at the same time sources of Aroclor-PCBs are coming under control. This effect is particularly notable at the most remote site on Lake Superior, where PCB-11 levels are, on average, 11% of those of total Aroclor-PCBs; this is a not insignificant abundance of a single PCB congener.																			2328-8930					MAR	2018	5	3					131	135		10.1021/acs.estlett.8b00019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.estlett.8b00019													WOS:000427661200001

As carp respond to flows, there is concern that environmental watering may cause floodplain inundation and provide access to spawning habitats subsequently causing unwanted population increase. This is a management conundrum that needs to be carefully considered within the context of contemporary river flow management (natural, environmental, irrigation). This paper uses a population model to investigate flow-related carp population dynamics for three case studies in the Murray-Darling Basin: (1) river and terminal lakes; (2) wetlands and floodplain lakes; and (3) complex river channel and floodplain system. Results highlight distinctive outcomes depending on site characteristics. In particular, the terminal lakes maintain a significant source carp population regardless of river flow; hence any additional within-channel environmental flows are likely to have little impact on carp populations. In contrast, large-scale removal of carp from the lakes may be beneficial, especially in times of extended low river flows. Case studies 2 and 3 show how wetlands, floodplain lakes and the floodplain itself can now often be inundated for several months over the carp spawning season by high volume flows provided for irrigation or water transfers. Such inundations can be a major driver of carp populations, compared to within channel flows that have relatively little effecton recruitment. The use of a population model that incorporates river flows and different habitats for this flow-responsive species, allows for the comparison of likely population outcomes for differing hydrological scenarios to improve the management of risks relating to carp reproduction and flows.

Inter-comparison of time series models of lake levels predicted by several modeling strategies	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Five modeling strategies are employed to analyze water level time series of six lakes with different physical characteristics such as shape, size, altitude and range of variations. The models comprise chaos theory, Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) - treated for seasonality and hence SARIMA, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Gene Expression Programming (GEP) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). Each is formulated on a different premise with different underlying assumptions. Chaos theory is elaborated in a greater detail as it is customary to identify the existence of chaotic signals by a number of techniques (e.g. average mutual information and false nearest neighbors) and future values are predicted using the Nonlinear Local Prediction (NLP) technique. This paper takes a critical view of past inter-comparison studies seeking a superior performance, against which it is reported that (i) the performances of all five modeling strategies vary from good to poor, hampering the recommendation of a clear-cut predictive model; (ii) the performances of the datasets of two cases are consistently better with all five modeling strategies; (iii) in other cases, their performances are poor but the results can still be fit-for-purpose; (iv) the simultaneous good performances of NLP and SARIMA pull their underlying assumptions to different ends, which cannot be reconciled. A number of arguments are presented including the culture of pluralism, according to which the various modeling strategies facilitate an insight into the data from different vantages.

Changes in biomass burning mark the onset of an ENSO-influenced climate regime at 42°S in southwest Tasmania, Australia	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We use macroscopic charcoal and sediment geochemistry analysis of two proximal upper montane lakes located at 42 degrees S in southwest Tasmania, Australia, to test the role of the southern hemisphere westerly winds (SWW) and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in governing the climate of this sector of the southern mid-to high-latitudes. Inter-annual climate anomalies in the study area are driven by changes in both ENSO and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM - an index that describes seasonal to decadal shifts in the SWW), making it an ideal location to test assumptions about the varying influence of the SWW and ENSO, two important components of the global climate system, through time. We find multi-millennial scale trends in fire activity that are remarkably consistent with trends in hydroclimate reconstructed at the same latitude in southern South America, providing empirical support for the notion of zonally symmetric changes in the SWW governing the climate at this latitude in the Southern Hemisphere between 12 and 5 cal ka BP. A transition from multi-millennial scale to sub-millennial scale trends in fire activity occurs after ca 5 cal ka BP in concert with the onset of high frequency and amplitude ENSO variability in the tropical Pacific Ocean region. We conclude that the onset of sub-millennial scale trends in ENSO drove changes in fire activity in our study region over the last ca 5 cal ka. Geochemical data reveals divergent local impacts at the two study sites in response to these major climate transitions that are related to local topography and geography. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Using MODIS-Aqua measurements from 2002 to 2010, seasonal and spatial distributions of the normalized water-leaving radiance nL(w)(lambda) spectra from visible to the near-infrared (NIR) and SWIR (1240 nm) are derived and used for study and characterization of Lake Taihu water optical properties. In particular, for the first time, spatial and seasonal variations of nL(w)(lambda) at the SWIR 1240 nm (nL(w)(1240)) are derived for the lake and show some different features from those of the red and NIR nL(w)(lambda) (nL(w)(645) and nL(w)(859)). Time series of monthly MODIS-derived nL(w)(lambda) spectra for Lake Taihu are obtained and analyzed, showing important seasonal and interannual variations. The results indicate that the SWIR nL(w)(1240) contributions in the lake are mainly due to the presence of significant amounts of algae, while the red and NIR nL(w)(lambda) variations result from changes of total suspended sediment (TSS) amounts in the water column. Furthermore, this study shows that all three SWIR bands at 1240, 1640, and 2130 nm are useful and required for satellite water quality remote sensing for extremely turbid near-shore and inland waters.

The droughts of 1997 and 2005 in Amazonia: floodplain hydrology and its potential ecological and human impacts	CLIMATIC CHANGE												It is well known that most of the severe droughts in Amazonia, such as that of 1997, are El Nio-related. However, in 2005, the Amazon was affected by a severe drought that was not El Nio-related, as most of the rainfall anomalies that have happened in southwestern Amazonia are driven by sea surface temperature anomalies in the tropical North Atlantic. Earlier studies have analyzed both droughts in terms of their meteorological causes and impacts in terra firme (non-flooded) forests. This study compares the hydrological effects of both droughts on the Amazonian floodplain and discusses their potential ecological and human impacts based on an extensive literature review. The results revealed that the effects of the 2005 drought were exacerbated because rainfall was lower and evaporation rates were higher at the peak of the dry season compared to the 1997 drought. This induced a more acute depletion of water levels in floodplain lakes and was most likely associated with higher fish mortality rates. Based on the fact that the stem growth of many floodplain species is related to the length of the non-flooded period, it is hypothesized that the 1997 drought had more positive effects on floodplain forest growth than the 2005 drought. The fishing community of Silves in central Amazonia considered both droughts to have been equally severe. However, the 2005 drought was widely broadcasted by the press; therefore, the governmental mitigation efforts were more comprehensive. It is suggested that the availability of new communication technology and greater public awareness regarding environmental issues, combined with the new legal framework for assessing the severity of calamities in Brazil, are among the primary factors that explain the difference in societal response between the two droughts.

Asymmetric impacts of climate change on thermal habitat suitability for inland lake fishes	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Climate change is altering the thermal habitats of freshwater fish species. We analyze modeled daily temperature profiles from 12,688 lakes in the US to track changes in thermal habitat of 60 lake fish species from different thermal guilds during 1980-2021. We quantify changes in each species' preferred days, defined as the number of days per year when a lake contains the species' preferred temperature. We find that cooler-water species are losing preferred days more rapidly than warmer-water species are gaining them. This asymmetric impact cannot be attributed to differences in geographic distribution among species; instead, it is linked to the seasonal dynamics of lake temperatures and increased thermal homogenization of the water column. The potential advantages of an increase in warmer-water species may not fully compensate for the losses in cooler-water species as warming continues, emphasizing the importance of mitigating climate change to support effective freshwater fisheries management. Climate change is warming freshwater fish thermal habitats. Here, the authors examine daily temperature profiles from 12,688 lakes and thermal habitats of 60 fish species, finding that cold-water fishes are losing preferred thermal habitats at a faster rate than warm-water fishes are gaining them.					; Feiner, Zachary/A-2117-2009; Hansen, Gretchen/ABE-3860-2022	Ladwig, Robert/0000-0001-8443-1999; Xu, Luoliang/0000-0002-7991-4221; Hansen, Gretchen/0000-0003-0241-7048; Verhoeven, Michael/0000-0002-6340-9490; Feiner, Zachary/0000-0001-7880-0778; Jensen, Olaf/0000-0001-7850-6616; Paukert, Craig/0000-0002-9369-8545														2041-1723				NOV 27	2024	15	1							10273	10.1038/s41467-024-54533-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54533-2								39604352					WOS:001366217500016

The rise of air temperature and change of precipitation patterns lead to dramatic responses of snow and ice heat and mass balance. Sustainable field observations on lake air-snow-ice-water temperature regime have been carried out in Lake Orajarvi in the vicinity of the Finnish Space Centre, a Flagship Supersite in Sodankyla in Finnish Lapland since 2009. A thermistor-string-based snow and ice mass balance buoy called "Snow and ice mass balance apparatus (SIMBA)" was deployed in the lake at the beginning of each ice season. In this paper, we describe snow and ice temperature regimes, snow depth, ice thickness, and ice compositions retrieved from SIMBA observations as well as meteorological variables based on high-quality observations at the Finnish Space Centre. Ice thickness in Lake Orajarvi showed an increasing trend. During the decade of data collection (1) the November-May mean air temperature had an increasing trend of 0.16 degrees C per year, and the interannual variations were highly correlated (r = 0.93) with the total seasonal accumulated precipitation; (2) the maximum granular ice thickness ranged from 15% to 80% of the maximum total ice thickness; and (3) the snow depth on lake ice was not correlated (r = 0.21) with the total precipitation. The data set can be applied to investigate the lake ice surface heat balance and the role of snow in lake ice mass balance and to improve the parameterization of snow to ice transformation in snow and ice models.					cheng, Yubing/GYR-3104-2022; Vihma, Timo/ABC-9771-2020; Qiu, Yubao/P-8103-2016; Zheng, Fei/O-8876-2016; Lemmetyinen, Juha/B-3739-2016; Cheng, Bin/D-4354-2013; Pulliainen, Jouni/Y-4810-2019; Kontu, Anna/O-8886-2014	Lemmetyinen, Juha/0000-0003-4434-9696; Cheng, Bin/0000-0001-8156-8412; Cheng, Yubing/0000-0002-1341-5913; qiu, yu bao/0000-0003-1313-6313; Kontu, Anna/0000-0001-6880-6260													1866-3508	1866-3516				AUG 13	2021	13	8					3967	3978		10.5194/essd-13-3967-2021	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-3967-2021													WOS:000685635200002

Combining contemporary ecology and palaeolimnology to understand shallow lake ecosystem change	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												P>1. Palaeolimnology and contemporary ecology are complementary disciplines but are rarely combined. By reviewing the literature and using a case study, we show how linking the timescales of these approaches affords a powerful means of understanding ecological change in shallow lakes. 2. Recently, palaeolimnology has largely been pre-occupied with developing transfer functions which use surface sediment-lake environment datasets to reconstruct a single environmental variable. Such models ignore complex controls over biological structure and can be prone to considerable error in prediction. Furthermore, by reducing species assemblage data to a series of numbers, transfer functions neglect valuable ecological information on species' seasonality, habitat structure and food web interactions. These elements can be readily extracted from palaeolimnological data with the interpretive assistance of contemporary experiments and surveys. For example, for one shallow lake, we show how it is possible to infer long-term seasonality change from plant macrofossil and fossil diatom data with the assistance of seasonal datasets on macrophyte and algal dynamics. 3. On the other hand, theories on shallow lake functioning have generally been developed from short-term (< 1-15 years) studies as opposed to palaeo-data that cover the actual timescales (decades-centuries) of shallow lake response to stressors such as eutrophication and climate change. Palaeolimnological techniques can track long-term dynamics in lakes whilst smoothing out short-term variability and thus provide a unique and important means of not only developing ecological theories, but of testing them. 4. By combining contemporary ecology and palaeolimnology, it should be possible to gain a fuller understanding of changing ecological patterns and processes in shallow lakes on multiple timescales.

The engineering demonstration (a 7,500 m(3)storage tank and a 3,436 m(2)CW) has been built to treat the combined sewer overflows (CSOs) at the largest combined rainwater/wastewater overflow outlet in the middle reaches of the Xinbaoxiang River, which is the second largest river in the Dianchi Lake Basin. During the rainfall period, CSOs enter the storage tank. After sedimentation purification, the higher concentration CSOs at the bottom enter the STP, and the upper low-concentration CSOs enter CWs, thereby linking the multiple means of treating CSOs and minimizing the impact of CSOs on the STP. During the dry season, CWs can also assist in purification of polluted river water. The supernatant (COD <80 mg/L) and the bottom part water (COD >200 mg/L) of the storage tank were sent to CWs and STP, respectively, for treatment. The project was stably operated over 6 months. The final effluent qualities were 12, 1.79, and 0.18 mg/L for COD, TN, and TP, respectively, which achieved the surface water class V standard. Practitioner points A combined system of storage tank-wastewater treatment plant-wetland was proposed to advanced treat overflow wastewater of rainy season. The SWMM could calculate the water quality and volume of overflow under different rainfall conditions in the runoff area.

In lake biomonitoring, false alarms have often been triggered due to the presence of abundant dead or dormant bacterial cells. Thus, quantification of the metabolically active and dormant cells is required for effective biomonitoring. In this study, 120 sites were seasonally sampled in a large, shallow, eutrophic lake (Taihu, China) to quantify the total bacterial (TB) and active bacterial (AB) abundances and explore their spatiotemporal distribution. Generalized additive models (GAMS) were used to identify the major environmental drivers of TB and AB dynamics. TB ranged from 7.57 x 10(4) to 1.84 x 10(8) cells mL(-1), while AB ranged from 4.42 x 10(3) to 5.56 x 10(6) cells mL(-1). The proportion of AB was significantly higher in May (mean: 18.7%; cyanobacterial bloom thriving season) than in January or September (6.8% and 4.7%, respectively). GAMS indicated that dissolved oxygen, total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), total dissolved phosphorus and turbidity explained 47.8% of the TB variation, while TDN, dissolved organic carbon, water temperature and total phosphorus explained 72.7% of the AB variation. Our study showed that nutrients and physical factors are the major drivers of the TB and AB abundance variations in Lake Taihu. Bacterial responses to environmental variation were mostly nonlinear. The high proportion of AB variation (72.7%) explained by environmental parameters indicates that active bacteria are more sensitive to environmental changes and could be more effective bioindicators for long-term monitoring in shallow eutrophic lakes.					; Tang, Xiangming/ABG-7095-2021; Gao, Guang/AAJ-8676-2021	Xie, Guijuan/0009-0006-0756-1937; Tang, Xiangming/0000-0002-2816-1004; Martin, Robbie/0000-0001-5284-7156; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				JUL	2020	114								106335	10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106335	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106335													WOS:000567458800001

This study uses a coupled modelling system (Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and a two-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model (CE-QUAL-W2) to analyze the nitrogen retention effect and influential factors at annual, monthly, and daily scales in Shanmei Reservoir in southeast China. The results showed that there was a positive retention effect of total nitrogen (TN), nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) and ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) in most years, with average retention rates up to 12.7%, 7.83% and 26.17%, respectively. The reservoir serves mainly as a nitrogen sink at an annual scale. The monthly retention performances of TN and NO3-N were observed during the wet season (April-October) with higher water temperature and lower velocity, while a release effect occurred during the dry season (November-March). For NH4-N, which is prone to nitrification, the retention effect lasted longer, from May to December. The daily nitrogen retention process changed more dramatically, with the retention rate varying from -292.49 to 58.17%. During the period of dispatch, the regulated discharge was the primary factor of daily retention performance, while the hydraulic residence time, velocity and water level were all significantly correlated with nitrogen retention during the period without dispatch.

Evaluation of factors influencing accumulation of stable Sr and Cs in lake and coastal fish	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY												As a result of nuclear accidents and weapons tests, the radionuclides Cs-137 and Sr-90 are common contaminants in aquatic ecosystems. Concentration ratios (CR) based on concentrations of stable Cs and Sr in biota and media are used for the estimation of transfer of their radioisotopes for radiation dose calculations in environmental and human safety assessments. Available element-specific CRs vary by over an order of magnitude for similar organisms, thus affecting the dose estimates proportionally. The variation could be reduced if they were based on a better understanding of the influence of the underlying data and how that affects accumulation and potential biomagnification of stable Cs and Sr in aquatic organisms. For fish, relationships have been identified between water concentrations of K and CR of Cs-137, and between water concentrations of Ca and CR of Sr-90. This has not been confirmed for stable Cs and Sr in European waters. In this study, we analysed an existing dataset for stable Cs and Sr, as well as K and Ca, in four Swedish lakes and three Baltic Sea coastal areas, in order to understand the behaviour of these elements and their radioisotopes in these ecosystems. We found significant seasonal variations in the water concentrations of Cs, Sr, K and Ca, and in electrical conductivity (EC), especially in the lakes. CR values based on measurements taken at single or few time points may, therefore, be inaccurate or introduce unnecessarily large variation into risk assessments. Instead, we recommend incorporating information about the underlying variation in water concentrations into the CR calculations, for example by using the variation of the mean. The inverse relationships between fish CRCs -[K](water) and fish CRSr-[Ca](water), confirmed that stable Cs and Sr follow the same trends as their radioisotopes. Thus, they can be used as proxies when radioisotope data are lacking. EC was also strongly correlated with K and Ca concentrations in the water and could potentially be used as a quick and cost-effective method to estimate water chemistry to obtain less variable CR. We also recommend some simple improvements to data collection that would greatly enhance our ability to understand Cs and Sr uptake by fish. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Seasonal prediction of lightning activity in North Western Venezuela: Large-scale versus local drivers	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												The Lake Maracaibo Basin in North Western Venezuela has the highest annual lightning rate of any place in the world (similar to 200 fl km(-2) yr(-1)), whose electrical discharges occasionally impact human and animal lives (e.g., cattle) and frequently affect economic activities like oil and natural gas exploitation. Lightning activity is so common in this region that it has a proper name: Catatumbo Lightning (plural). Although short-term lightning forecasts are now common in different parts of the world, to the best of the authors' knowledge, seasonal prediction of lightning activity is still non-existent. This research discusses the relative role of both large-scale and local climate drivers as modulators of lightning activity in the region, and presents a formal predictability study at seasonal scale. Analysis of the Catatumbo Lightning Regional Mode, defined in terms of the second Empirical Orthogonal Function of monthly Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS-TRMM) and Optical Transient Detector (OTD) satellite data for North Western South America, permits the identification of potential predictors at seasonal scale via a Canonical Correlation Analysis. Lightning activity in North Western Venezuela responds to well defined sea-surface temperature patterns (e.g., El Nino-Southern Oscillation, Atlantic Meridional Mode) and changes in the low-level meridional wind field that are associated with the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone migrations, the Caribbean Low Level Jet and tropical cyclone activity, but it is also linked to local drivers like convection triggered by the topographic configuration and the effect of the Maracaibo Basin Nocturnal Low Level Jet. The analysis indicates that at seasonal scale the relative contribution of the large-scale drivers is more important than the local (basin-wide) ones, due to the synoptic control imposed by the former. Furthermore, meridional CAPE transport at 925 mb is identified as the best potential predictor for lightning activity in the Lake Maracaibo Basin. It is found that the predictive skill is slightly higher for the minimum lightning season (Jan-Feb) than for the maximum one (Sep-Oct), but that in general the skill is high enough to be useful for decision-making processes related to human safety, oil and natural gas exploitation, energy and food security.

Productivity and Resilience: Long-Term Trends and Storm-Driven Fluctuations in the Plant Community of the Accreting Wax Lake Delta	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												River deltas are dynamic geologic features where the plant community engages in critical feedbacks with geomorphology, and plant community development is impacted by both riverine and coastal drivers. A vegetation index (NDVI) calculated from a time series of 54 peak growing season Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-7 ETM+ images was used to assess the long-term trends and storm event-driven changes in the vegetation community associated with the Wax Lake Delta, an actively accreting subdelta of the Mississippi River. Multiple regression models were developed to explain variation in the vegetated area of the delta and mean delta NDVI from 1984 to 2011 as a function of date, hydrology, and seasonality. The models indicate that both vegetated area and mean NDVI increased over time from 1984 to 2011. Productivity measures following Hurricanes Lili (2002), Rita (2005), and Ike (2008) represented statistical outliers; significant decreases in NDVI following these storms suggest that hurricanes passing directly over or to the west of the delta result in short-term disturbance to the plant community, most likely related to saltwater intrusion associated with storm surge. However, in each case, both vegetated area and mean NDVI recovered to the long-term trend by the following growing season. These results demonstrate that the freshwater marshes within this mineral-rich, accreting delta are increasing in productivity as the delta matures and are extremely resilient to coastal storm disturbance.					; Carle, Melissa/D-6931-2012	Carle, Melissa/0000-0002-9360-8394; 													1559-2723	1559-2731				MAR	2016	39	2					406	422		10.1007/s12237-015-0005-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-015-0005-9													WOS:000369527900008

Bacterial Pathogen Gene Abundance and Relation to Recreational Water Quality at Seven Great Lakes Beaches	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Quantitative assessment of bacterial pathogens, their geographic variability, and distribution in various matrices at Great Lakes beaches are limited. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to test for genes from E. coli O157:H7 ((eae)O157), shiga-toxin producing E. coli (stx2), Campylobacter jejuni (mapA), Shigella spp. (ipaH), and a Salmonella enterica-specific (SE) DNA sequence at seven Great Lakes beaches, in algae, water, and sediment. Overall, detection frequencies were mapA>stx2>ipaH>SE>(eae)O157. Results were highly variable among beaches and matrices; some correlations with environmental conditions were observed for mapA, stx2, and ipaH detections. Beach seasonal mean mapA abundance in water was correlated with beach seasonal mean log10 E. coli concentration. At one beach, stx2 gene abundance was positively correlated with concurrent daily E. coli concentrations. Concentration distributions for stx2, ipaH, and mapA within algae, sediment, and water were statistically different (Non-Detect and Data Analysis in R). Assuming 10, 50, or 100% of gene copies represented viable and presumably infective cells, a quantitative microbial risk assessment tool developed by Michigan State University indicated a moderate probability of illness for Campylobacter jejuni at the study beaches, especially where recreational water quality criteria were exceeded. Pathogen gene quantification may be useful for beach water quality management.

J	Aslam, A; Ahmad, T; Ranjan, RK				Aslam, Alvia; Ahmad, Tauseef; Ranjan, Rajesh Kumar			Differential responses of hydrochemical factors and LULC changes on the spatial and temporal hydrogeochemistry of the eco-sensitive Baraila wetland, Bihar, India	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Freshwater scarcity, deterioration and associated water management remain to be one of the most challenging aspects of high-population density economies especially in subtropical/tropical regions. The present research deals with hydrogeochemical analysis of the eco-sensitive Baraila wetland and possible sources of anthropogenic pollution. The hydrochemical characterization was performed in GIS environment, considering meteorologically induced parameters and spatial variability. Temporal variations were assessed through different seasons, namely pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon with the help of multivariate statistics. The changes in water depth across the seasons showed significant hydrochemical variations in the vertical profile of the wetland apart from thermal demarcation. Seasonal variations in the hydrogeochemistry were induced by multiple physicochemical parameters, geochemical processes, geomorphology of the surrounding area and land use and land cover (LULC) changes. The pre-post flooding changes revealed that aquatic vegetation was increased by 15.36% whereas a major decrease in water bodies (- 73.2%) occurred. Dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, temperature and carbonates are fundamental towards establishing wetland's water chemistry. The water type is primarily of Ca-HCO3 type, mostly derived from rock-water interactions and cation exchange processes. Irrigational quality of water was assessed through multiple indices (sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), %Na, residual sodium carbonate (RSC), magnesium hazard (MH) and total hardness (TH)) and plots. The heavy aquatic vegetation abundance and eutrophication because of agricultural run-off is currently the major issue with the Baraila wetland and may be playing a simultaneous role in regulating the water chemistry to a large extent apart from other geochemical processes. The hydrogeochemical interactions between sediment and overlying water have created distinct effects on biota and land use/land cover changes. Their role in the landscape is prominent in this respect and may be utilized for environmental management, eco-tourism and employment boost. Serious lack of hydrogeochemical studies in this important floodplain wetland and its rapid deterioration deems it necessary to focus on the comprehensive research and wetland management options for its conservation and sustainable usage in future.

J	Beamish, AL; Coops, N; Chabrillat, S; Heim, B				Beamish, Alison Leslie; Coops, Nicholas; Chabrillat, Sabine; Heim, Birgit			A Phenological Approach to Spectral Differentiation of Low-Arctic Tundra Vegetation Communities, North Slope, Alaska	REMOTE SENSING												Arctic tundra ecosystems exhibit small-scale variations in species composition, micro-topography as well as significant spatial and temporal variations in moisture. These attributes result in similar spectral characteristics between distinct vegetation communities. In this study we examine spectral variability at three phenological phases of leaf-out, maximum canopy, and senescence of ground-based spectroscopy, as well as a simulated Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) and simulated Sentinel-2 reflectance spectra, from five dominant low-Arctic tundra vegetation communities in the Toolik Lake Research Area, Alaska, in order to inform spectral differentiation and subsequent vegetation classification at both the ground and satellite scale. We used the InStability Index (ISI), a ratio of between endmember and within endmember variability, to determine the most discriminative phenophase and wavelength regions for identification of each vegetation community. Our results show that the senescent phase was the most discriminative phenophase for the identification of the majority of communities when using both ground-based and simulated EnMAP reflectance spectra. Maximum canopy was the most discriminative phenophase for the majority of simulated Sentinel-2 reflectance data. As with previous ground-based spectral characterization of Alaskan low-Arctic tundra, the blue, red, and red-edge parts of the spectrum were most discriminative for all three reflectance datasets. Differences in vegetation colour driven by pigment dynamics appear to be the optimal areas of the spectrum for differentiation using high spectral resolution field spectroscopy and simulated hyperspectral EnMAP and multispectral Sentinel-2 reflectance spectra. The phenological aspect of this study highlights the potential exploitation of more extreme colour differences in vegetation observed during senescence when hyperspectral data is available. The results provide insight into both the community and seasonal dynamics of spectral variability to better understand and interpret currently used broadband vegetation indices and also for improved spectral unmixing of hyperspectral aerial and satellite data which is useful for a wide range of applications from fine-scale monitoring of shifting vegetation composition to the identification of vegetation vigor.					; Coops, Nicholas/J-1543-2012; Beamish, Alison/AAR-2169-2020; Heim, Birgit/B-2815-2017; Chabrilat, Sabine/H-6432-2019	Chabrillat, Sabine/0000-0001-8600-5168; Coops, Nicholas/0000-0002-0151-9037; Heim, Birgit/0000-0003-2614-9391; 													2072-4292					NOV	2017	9	11							1200	10.3390/rs9111200	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs9111200													WOS:000416554100114

Spatiotemporal trends of mercury in walleye and largemouth bass from the Laurentian Great Lakes Region	ECOTOXICOLOGY												The risk of mercury (Hg) exposure to humans and wildlife from fish consumption has driven extensive mercury analysis throughout the Great Lakes Region since the 1970s. This study compiled fish-Hg data from multiple sources in the region and assessed spatiotemporal trends of Hg concentrations in two representative top predator fish species. Walleye (Sander vitreus) and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) were chosen for the trend analysis because they had more Hg records (63,872) than other fish species that had been sampled from waters throughout the region. Waterbody types were inland lakes (70%), the Great Lakes, impoundments, and rivers. The compiled datasets were analyzed with a mixed effects statistical model having random effects of station, year, and fish length; and fixed effects of year, tissue type, fish length, habitat, and season. The results showed a generally declining temporal trend in fish-Hg for the region (1970-2009), with spatial trends of increasing Hg concentration from south to north and from west to east across the region. Nonlinearity was evident in the general downward trends of Ontario walleye, with a shift to an upward trend beginning in the 1990s. Only ongoing monitoring can reveal if this upward shift is an oscillation in a long-term decline, a statistical anomaly, or a sustained declining temporal trend in regional fish-Hg concentrations.

Tested parameters include physical parameterizations of atmospheric convection, cloud microphysics, planetary boundary layer, land-surface model and radiation schemes, as well as land-use categories (USGS vs. MODIS), lateral forcings (ERA-Interim and ERA40 reanalyses), and domain geometry (size and vertical resolution). Results show that (1) uncertainties, defined as the differences between the experiments, are larger than the biases; (2) the parameters exerting the largest influence on simulated rainfall are, in order of decreasing importance, the shortwave radiation scheme, the land-surface model, the domain size, followed by convective schemes and land-use categories; (3) cloud microphysics, lateral forcing reanalysis, the number of vertical levels and planetary boundary layer schemes appear to be of lesser importance at the seasonal scale. Though persisting biases (consisting of conditions that are too wet over the Indian Ocean and the Congo Basin and too dry over eastern Kenya) prevail in most experiments, several configurations simulate the regional climate with reasonable accuracy.

Spatiotemporal Variations in Microcystin Concentrations and in the Proportions of Microcystin-Producing Cells in Several Microcystis aeruginosa Populations	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												With the aim of explaining the variations in microcystin (MC) concentrations during cyanobacterial blooms, we studied several Microcystis aeruginosa populations blooming in different freshwater ecosystems located in the same geographical area. As assessed by real-time PCR, it appeared that the potentially MC-producing cells (mcyB(+)) were predominant (70 to 100%) in all of these M. aeruginosa populations, with the exception of one population in which non-MC-producing cells always dominated. Apart from the population in the Grangent Reservoir, we found that the proportions of potentially MC-producing and non-MC-producing cells varied little over time, which was consistent with the fact that according to a previous study of the same populations, the intergenic transcribed spacer (ITS) genotype composition did not change (38). In the Grangent Reservoir, the MC-RR variant was the dominant microcystin variant throughout the bloom season, despite changes in the ITS composition and in the proportions of mcyB(+) cells. Finally, the variations in total MC concentrations (0.3 to 15 mu g liter(-1)) and in the MC cellular quotas (0.01 to 3.4 pg cell(-1)) were high both between and within sites, and no correlation was found between the MC concentrations and the proportion of mcyB(+) cells. All of these findings demonstrate that very different results can be found for the proportions of potentially MC-producing and non-MC-producing cells and MC concentrations, even in M. aeruginosa populations living in more or less connected ecosystems, demonstrating the importance of the effect of very local environmental conditions on these parameters and also the difficulty of predicting the potential toxicity of Microcystis blooms.					; Delphine, Latour/JOZ-2138-2023; Briand, Enora/P-6074-2016; Briand, Enora/AAS-8520-2020	Humbert, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-1519-5651; Briand, Enora/0000-0001-8996-0072; 													0099-2240	1098-5336				JUL	2010	76	14					4750	4759		10.1128/AEM.02531-09	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02531-09								20511422					WOS:000279611500020

Despite nonlinear water quality responses being widely mentioned by studies, there is a lack of comprehensive assessment on the extent and type of nonlinear responses considering the seasonal changes. This study aimed to measure the strength of nonlinearity of theoretically possible water quality responses and explore their potential types in shallow eutrophic water bodies. Hereto, we generated 14,710 numerical water body cases that describe the water quality processes using the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) and applied eight load reduction scenarios on each water body case. Inflows are simplified from Lake Dianchi. The climate conditions consider three cases: Lake Dianchi, Wissahickon Creek, and Famosa Slough. We then developed a nonlinearity strength indicator to quantify the strength and frequency of nonlinear water quality responses. Based on the quantification of nonlinearity, we clustered all the samples of water quality responses using K-Means, an unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm, to find the potential types of nonlinear water quality responses for TN (total nitrogen), TP (total phosphorus), and Chla (chlorophyll a). Results show linear or near-linear response types account for 90%, 69%, and 20% of TN, TP, and Chla samples respectively. TP and Chla could perform more types of nonlinearity. Representative nonlinear water quality responses include disproportional improvement, peak change (disappear, move forwards or afterward), and seasonal deterioration of TN after load reduction. This study would contribute to the current understanding of nonlinear water quality responses to load reduction and provide a basis to study under which conditions the nonlinear responses may emerge.

J	McKenzie, D; Gedalof, Z; Peterson, DL; Mote, P				McKenzie, D; Gedalof, Z; Peterson, DL; Mote, P			Climatic change, wildfire, and conservation	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Climatic variability is a dominant factor affecting large wildfires in the western United States, an observation supported by palaeoecological data on charcoal in lake sediments and reconstructions from fire-scarred trees. Although current fire management focuses on fuel reductions to bring fuel loadings back to their historical ranges, at the regional scale extreme fire weather is still the dominant influence on area burned and fire severity. Current forecasting tools are limited to short-term predictions of fire weather but increased understanding of large-scale oceanic and atmospheric patterns in the Pacific Ocean (e.g., El Nino Southern Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation) may improve our ability to predict climatic variability at seasonal to annual leads. Associations between these quasi-periodic patterns and fire occurrence, though evident in some regions, have been difficult to establish in others. Increased temperature in the future will likely extend fire seasons throughout the western United States, with more fires occurring earlier and later than is currently typical, and will increase the total area burned in some regions. If climatic change increases the amplitude and duration of extreme fire weather we can expect significant changes in the distribution and abundance of dominant plant species in some ecosystems, which would thus affect habitat of some sensitive plant and animal species. Some species that are sensitive to fire may decline, whereas the distribution and abundance of species favored by fire may be enhanced. The effects of climatic change will partially depend on the extent to which resource management modifies vegetation structure and fuels.

Results of complex experimental studies at Vostok station in Antarctica	JOURNAL OF MINING INSTITUTE												Scientific research in the area close to the Russian Antarctic station Vostok has been carried out since its founding on December 16, 1957. The relevance of work to study the region is steadily increasing, which is confirmed by the Strategy for the Development of Activities of the Russian Federation in the Antarctica until 2030. As part of the Strategy implementation, Saint Petersburg Mining University solves the comprehensive study issues of the Vostok station area, including the subglacial Lake Vostok, related to the development of modern technologies and technical means for drilling glaciers and underlying rocks, opening subglacial reservoirs, sampling water and bottom sediments, as well as carrying out comprehensive geological and geophysical research. For the successful implementation of the Strategy, at each stage of the work it is necessary to identify and develop interdisciplinary connections while complying with the requirements for minimizing the impact on the environment. During the season of the 68th Russian Antarctic Expedition, the staff of the Mining University, along with the current research works, began research of the dynamic interactions between the forces of the Earth, from the deepest depths to the surface glacier. Drilling and research programs have been completed. The drilling program was implemented jointly with colleagues from the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute at the drilling complex of the 5G well. The research program included: shallow seismic studies, core drilling of snow-firn strata, study of the snow-firn strata petrostructural features, studies of cuttings collection filters effectiveness when drilling snow-firn strata and the process of ice destruction in a reciprocating rotational method, bench testing of an acoustic scanner. As a result of drilling in 5G well at the depth range of 3453.37-3534.43 m, an ice core more than 1 million years old was obtained. The research work implemented an interdisciplinary approach to the study of snow-firn strata, which made it possible to analyze the reliability of the results achieved by different methods. The data necessary for the development of new technologies for drilling glaciers were obtained.					; Vasil'ev, Dmitriy/E-4607-2014; Kadochnikov, Viacheslav/ADT-4671-2022; Bolshunov, Alexey/ABC-8907-2020	Serbin, Danil/0000-0002-9855-7178; 													2411-3336	2541-9404					2023	263						724	741																WOS:001169653200007

A total of 94 water bodies across the globe were studied using satellite data in the optical and microwave wavelengths from Landsat 8, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2. The uncertainty in volume estimation as a function of geography and geophysical factors, such as cloud cover, precipitation, and water surface temperature, was studied. The key finding that emerged from this global study is that uncertainty is highest in regions with a distinct precipitation season, such as in the monsoon dominated South Asia or the Pacific Northwestern region of the USA. This uncertainty is further compounded when small lakes and wetlands are seasonal with alternating land use as a water body and agricultural land, such as the wetlands of Northeastern Bangladesh. On an average, 45% of studied lakes could be estimated of their volume change with a statistical significant uncertainty that is less than the expected volume in South Asia. In North America, this statistically significant uncertainty in volume estimation was found to be around 50% in lakes eastward of the 108th meridian with lowest uncertainty found in lakes along the East coast of the USA. The article provides a baseline for understanding the current state of the art in estimating volumetric change of lakes and wetlands using citizen science in anticipation of the recently launched Surface Water and Ocean Topography Mission.					; Ahmed, Shakeel/B-7057-2008; Hossain, Faisal/L-9100-2015; Das, Pritam/HJA-8035-2022; COMPIN, Arthur/D-3826-2014; Bhuyan, Mohammad/P-3204-2015; Minocha, Sanchit/KCX-9820-2024; Khan, Shahzaib/JLL-2583-2023; Ashraf, Muhammad/JUF-3049-2023	Das, Pritam/0000-0003-4795-4736; Hasan, Faizan ul/0000-0002-7274-467X; Hossain, Faisal/0000-0001-6192-3157; Parkins, Grant/0000-0002-8167-6787; Compin, Arthur/0000-0002-0756-8649; Khan, Shahzaib/0000-0002-0851-0385													1939-1404	2151-1535					2023	16						2386	2401		10.1109/JSTARS.2023.3250354	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2023.3250354													WOS:000952892000001
J	Li, CW; Xu, Y; Song, WW				Li, Chunwei; Xu, Yuan; Song, Weiwei			Pollution Characteristics and Risk Assessment of Typical Antibiotics and Persistent Organic Pollutants in Reservoir Water Sources	WATER												The major task of Chinese water governance has gradually shifted away from water environment protection to water ecology remediation, and the governance of trace organic pollutants, including persistent organic pollutants and antibiotics, has attracted growing concern. The present study examined the seasonal distribution and sources of typical persistent organic pollutants and antibiotics in six representative water sources in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, as well as their ecological risk to the environment. Six representative surface water and surface sediment samples were collected at different time intervals, i.e., December 2018, March 2019, and June 2019, and the concentrations of nineteen organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), seventeen polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and eight polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were analyzed by GC-MS. The major findings are listed below: Endosulfan sulfate, Beta-endosulfan, and methoxychlor were the major persistent organic pollutants (POPs) detected in the sediments from Gaoyou Lake, Gonghu Lake, and Gehu Lake, with concentrations ranging from 9.0 to 10.6 ng/g. The target antibiotics in water sources were at relatively low levels. Occurrences of sulfonamide antibiotics in water and surface sediments were NF similar to 37.4 ng center dot L-1 and NF similar to 47.3 ng center dot g(-1). Concentrations of quinolone antibiotics in the two media were NF similar to 5.3 ng center dot L-1, 0.4 similar to 32.5 ng center dot g(-1). The combined toxicity of antibiotics (risk quotient, RQ) in Lake Gehu was 0.18, which was at a moderate risk level. There was no obvious ecological risk in most water sources affected by POPs. However, there were certain ecological risks in the water sources of Gaoyou Lake, Gonghu Lake, and Sanjiangying, induced by OCPs and PCBs. This study provides a scientific basis for the treatment of antibiotics and organic pollutants in reservoir water sources.					song, weiwei/ADA-3788-2022; li, chunwei/KCZ-1881-2024	Song, Weiwei/0000-0002-7430-730X														2073-4441				JAN	2023	15	2							259	10.3390/w15020259	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15020259													WOS:000918646500001

However, there are still limitations in understanding water use patterns of different four plantations (Populus sylvestris, Salix cheliophe, Hippophae rhamnoides and Artemisia ordosica) in the Qinghai Lake basin. Stable isotopes of xylem water of four individual species were analysed at different dunes located at the eastern shore of Qinghai Lake in 2018 and 2019. The purpose of this study was to explore potential water sources used by different life form plants, to identify whether the soil moisture content and root distribution determined the plants water use patterns. Results from the Bayesian mixing model MixSIAR showed that all species mainly uses three levels of soil water, but they extracted soil water from different layers in different growing seasons among species. All species primarily depended on water from upper soil layers at the early growing stage, but P. sylvestris and S. cheliophe also absorbed much proportion middle and deep soil layers' water in dry year of 2019. All four species shift to use middle or deep soil layer water rather than shallow water in July with the most rainfall and soil water content (SWC). However, it was only used by P. sylvestris and H. rhamnoides in 2018. In all, seasonal water use pattern of different species was affected by SWC, soil texture and root distribution. Compared with moratorium plantations such as S. cheliophe, mixed afforestation of P. sylvestris and H. rhamnoides maximized of soil water sources absorbed by the plants. The study can shed light on plant-water relationships to facilitate the woody species for afforestation and desertification restoration management in the semi-arid desert ecosystem.																			0885-6087	1099-1085				JAN	2023	37	1							e14798	10.1002/hyp.14798	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14798													WOS:000907942000001

Accordingly, two groups of fish were used in this study: 30 flathead grey mullets, M. cephalus, caught in Lake Faro, Italy, and 30 golden grey mullets, C. auratus, caught in the estuarine channel system of Keycegiz-Dalyan, Turkey. Statistical evaluations (unpaired t-test) revealed that there were no significant differences in weight or total length values between the two mullet groups. However, the differences between all the evaluated blood parameters (except alanine aminotransferase) between the Italian and the Turkish mullet were significant (P < 0.0001). The present study demonstrated that there were significant hematological and biochemical differences between the Italian (M. cephalus) and the Turkish (C. auratus) mullet. Our findings also contribute to expanding the knowledge on the hematology and biochemistry of two different species of mullet originating from two different habitats. Since the evaluation of blood parameters represents an essential tool in examining the effects of environmental conditions on fish physiology and, consequently, on fish health status, further research in this field is encouraged and would be very useful.

Most studies achieved satisfactory Chl-a estimation and focused solely on the spectral regions from near-infrared (NIR) to red spectral bands. However, the optical complexity of turbid waters may vary with locations and seasons, which renders the selection of spectral bands challenging. Accordingly, this study proposes an optimization process utilizing available spectral models to achieve optimal Chl-a retrieval. The method begins with the generation of a set of feature candidates, followed by candidate selection and optimization. Each candidate links to a Chl-a estimation model, including two-band, three-band, and normalized different chlorophyll index models. Moreover, a set of selected candidates using available spectral bands implies an optimal composition of estimation models, which results in an optimal Chl-a estimation. Remote sensing images and in situ Chl-a measurements in Lake Kasumigaura, Japan, are analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively to evaluate the proposed method. Results indicate that the model outperforms related Chl-a estimation models. The root-mean-squared errors of the Chl-a concentration obtained by the resulting model (OptiM-3) improve from 11.95 mgm-3to 6.37 mgm-3, and the Pearson's correlation coefficients between the predicted and in situ Chl-aimprove from 0.56 to 0.89.					; Syariz, Muhammad Aldila/HSF-4859-2023; Jaelani, Lalu Muhamad/M-8299-2016; Chu, HoneJay/AAB-2543-2020	Nguyen, Manh Van/0000-0001-6758-0626; Lin, Chao-Hung/0000-0001-8126-8794; Chu, HoneJay/0000-0001-8062-462X; Jaelani, Lalu Muhamad/0000-0003-2663-9016; 													1661-7827	1660-4601				JAN	2020	17	1							272	10.3390/ijerph17010272	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17010272								31906028					WOS:000509391500272

Pseudorasbora parva is considered one of the major invasive species worldwide. The present study investigated the fish resources of the Chabalang Wetland (Lhasa, Tibet) during different seasons in 2009 and 2013. Four hundred and twelve individuals were subsampled to estimate age, growth, and feeding habit of P. parva. Furthermore, food relationships between P. parva and the native Schizothoracinae fish were also examined. The results revealed a significant shift in species composition and community structure characterized by the disappearance of native fish and outbreak of non-native fish. The percentage of nonnative P. parva in the fish collections significantly increased from 33.64% in 2009 to 64.08% in 2013. The standard length (SL) ranged from 22.00 to 78.71 mm, and their age was 1-5 yr. The von Bertalanffy function was used to model the observed length-at-age data as L-t =112.19(1-e(-0.1495 ( t +0.8012)) ) for females and as L-t =123.12 (1-e(-0.1500 ( t +0.7132))) for males. The results indicated that P. parva in Tibet has lower growth and mortality rates compared with that from the native ranges. Ninety-seven prey taxa belonging to 9 prey categories were identified in the gut of 38 P. parva. P. parva can be considered a generalized and opportunistic predator, competing with the native fish, especially Schizothorax o'connori, Schizopygopsis younghusbandi younghusbandi, and Ptychobarbus dipogon, for Bacillariophyta and Chironomid larvae. This is an important reason for the decline in native fish population.

Based on the basic reproduction number R-0, a threshold type result on the dynamics of the model is established. Especially, various features of R-0 with respect to the vertical turbulent diffusion rate, the buoyant or sinking rate, and the evolution rate of water column depth are derived. Our theoretical results and numerical simulations show that big evolution rate, vertical diffusion rate and water column depth all have an adverse effect on survival of phytoplankton.

The recent developments in smart feature extraction mainly rely on different machine learning and data mining algorithms as powerful classifiers to improve prediction accuracy. This article presents an innovative ensemble learning algorithm for integrated data and classifier fusion via higher order singular value decomposition (IDCF-HOSVD). Based on the fused data, different analytical, semiempirical, and empirical classifiers can be selected and applied to perform information retrieval that can be further synergized via a tensor flow based feature extraction scheme over the classifier space. When preserving core fused image patterns via HOSVD, the final step of IDCF-HOSVD helps rank the contributions from different classifiers via nonlinear correlation information entropy. Practical implementation of the IDCF-HOSVD algorithm was assessed through its application to map the seasonal water quality conditions in Lake Nicaragua, Central America.					; Gao, Wei/HLH-2787-2023	Sun, Zhibin/0000-0002-3772-5713; 													1939-1404	2151-1535					2021	14						3345	3360		10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3055798	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3055798													WOS:000637532600004

It is so fragile that great efforts should be made to strengthen wetland protection. Based on wetland type classification for seven periods by the object-oriented classification method, we quantitatively discussed dynamically changes of wetland cover types and their driving forces. Conclusions show that alpine meadows accounts for 44.59% of the whole area of the county, and the transition between alpine meadows and swamp meadows mostly occurs in the process of wetland landscape changes. Changes of wetland cover types have taken place in Zoige County from 1990 to 2018 in which wetland loss was mainly caused by the decrease of marsh areas during 1995-2005. Particularly, shift from alpine meadows to swamp meadows led to wetland slightly expansion in two periods, i.e., 1990-1995 and 2005-2018. There is a significant negative correlation between marsh area and average temperature in growing season, average wind speed and rural population, and a significant negative correlation between water area and maximum wind speed. The increase of air temperature and wind speed lead to an enhancement of surface evapotranspiration and a decrease of water retention capacity. Whereas, positive feedback of ecosystem lead to an increase in air temperature and a decrease of marsh area. Both climatic changes and human activities have caused changes in wetland cover type, especially temperature in growing season, wind speed, agricultural development, and animal husbandry.

Influence of vegetation type and climatological conditions on evapotranspiration from extensive green roofs	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Evapotranspiration (ET) is the key hydrologic process governing the capacity of a green roof to retain rainfall as it regenerates available water storage space in the green roof substrate (soil) between rainfall events. In this field study, the impact of climatological conditions, vegetation type, and substrate depth on ET rates were evaluated from experimental, modular extensive green roofs installed in three climate regions in Canada: Calgary AB (Prairies), London ON (Great Lakes/St. Lawrence), and Halifax NS (Atlantic/ Maritime). Daily ET rates and cumulative ET over two field seasons were quantified for two substrate depths (10 and 15 cm), substrate only treatments (no vegetation), and four vegetation treatments (monoculture treatments of Sedum spurium, Spor-obolus heterolepis, and Aquilegia canadensis, and a mixed species treatment consisting of the three aforementioned species). 73 %, 67 % and 33 % of the cumulative rainfall was returned to the atmosphere via ET over the two field seasons in Calgary, London and Halifax, respectively. Importantly, ET rates were shown to be a strong function of substrate moisture content as well as atmospheric forcing with the relative importance of each varying between the different cities. ET rates were typically greater in the mixed species treatment in comparison to the three monoculture treatments (Sedum spurium, Sporobolus heterolepis, and Aquilegia canadensis) and for deeper substrate depths, although ET rate enhancement with substrate depth was comparatively small. This study provides valuable insights on the impact of climatological conditions and green roof design parameters (i. e., vegetation type and substrate depth) on ET rates.					; O'Carroll, Denis/E-6382-2013; Robinson, Clare/E-4625-2012	O'Carroll, Denis/0000-0001-6557-226X; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				FEB	2023	617		B						128951	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.128951	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.128951		DEC 2022											WOS:000919628500001

Natural waters were hard-fresh water with an alkaline nature and a Ca2+-HCO3 (-) water type. Although much of physicochemical parameters were under the highest desirable limits set by the Chinese Government for drinking purpose, some samples were not suitable for drinking with reference to the concentrations of NO3 (-) and SO4 (2-). The sodium adsorption ratio and sodium percentage (%Na) values indicated that most waters were suitable for irrigation. Seasonal variations of ion concentrations and water quality were minor. Saturation index in waters showed that most of the waters were oversaturated with respect to aragonite, calcite, dolomite and magnesite, whereas under-saturated to gypsum and halite. Carbonate weathering and evaporite dissolution were the primary and secondary sources of the dissolved ions, whereas anthropogenic input played a minor role. For the sustainable development of Bosten Lake, a reduction of discharge water from salt washing and an increase in the fresh water inflow to the lake are needed.

Short- and Long-Term Effects of Leaf Removal and Gibberellin on Chardonnay Grapes in the Lake Erie Region of Pennsylvania	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ENOLOGY AND VITICULTURE												Over six seasons from 2007 to 2012, the effects of the timing of cluster zone leaf removal and bloom gibberellin applications on Botrytis bunch rot, cluster morphology, yield, and juice composition were evaluated on Vitis vinifera Chardonnay grapevines. All experimental plots received Botrytis-specific fungicide applications at preclosure and veraison. Leaf removal at veraison, postfruit-set, or trace bloom reduced Botrytis severity by an average of 14, 47, or 71%, respectively, compared to no leaf removal. Leaf removal at trace bloom (LRTB) reduced Botrytis incidence and severity in five and four seasons, respectively, and was as effective as (2007 to 2010), or more effective than (2011 and 2012) two additional fungicide applications (at bloom and at preharvest), suggesting potential to reduce fungicide inputs. Gibberellin was less effective than LRTB, but reduced the incidence of Botrytis in 2008 at 5 mg/L and the severity of Botrytis in 2010 at 25 mg/L. Botrytis development increases with number of berries per cluster and berries per centimeter of cluster (compactness). Berries per cluster was reduced by LRTB in 2007, 2010, and 2011, and by 10 mg/L gibberellin in 2007 and 25 mg/L in 2011. Berries per centimeter was reduced by LRTB and gibberellin in 2007, 2008, and 2011. Leaf removal at postfruit-set produced the most noteworthy effects on juice composition, reducing titratable acidity in 2007, 2011, and 2012. Yields were reduced by LRTB in 2008, but no significant yield effects were observed in subsequent seasons. The efficacy of LRTB for reducing Botrytis bunch rot was highest in years with the most compact clusters, suggesting that the value of this treatment increases with increasing potential for bunch rot development.																			0002-9254	1943-7749				FEB	2015	66	1					22	29		10.5344/ajev.2014.14034	http://dx.doi.org/10.5344/ajev.2014.14034													WOS:000348769100003

Sediment respiration and lake trophic state are important predictors of large CO2 evasion from small boreal lakes	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												We show that sediment respiration is one of the key factors contributing to the high CO2 supersaturation in and evasion from Finnish lakes, and evidently also over large areas in the boreal landscape, where the majority of the lakes are small and shallow. A subpopulation of 177 randomly selected lakes (< 100 km(2)) and 32 lakes with the highest total phosphorus (P-tot) concentrations in the Nordic Lake Survey (NLS) data base were sampled during four seasons and at four depths. Patterns of CO2 concentrations plotted against depth and time demonstrate strong CO2 accumulation in hypolimnetic waters during the stratification periods. The relationship between O-2 departure from the saturation and CO2 departure from the saturation was strong in the entire data set (r(2)=0.79, n=2 740, P < 0.0001). CO2 concentrations were positively associated with lake trophic state and the proportion of agricultural land in the catchment. In contrast, CO2 concentrations negatively correlated with the peatland percentage indicating that either input of easily degraded organic matter and/or nutrient load from agricultural land enhance degradation. The average lake-area-weighted annual CO2 evasion based on our 177 randomly selected lakes and all Finnish lakes > 100 km(2) (Rantakari & Kortelainen, 2005) was 42 g C m(-2) LA (lake area), approximately 20% of the average annual C accumulation in Finnish forest soils and tree biomass (covering 51% of the total area of Finland) in the 1990s. Extrapolating our estimate from Finland to all lakes of the boreal region suggests a total annual CO2 evasion of about 50 TgC, a value upto 40% of current estimates for lakes of the entire globe, emphasizing the role of small boreal lakes as conduits for transferring terrestrially fixed C into the atmosphere.					; Kortelainen, Pirkko/AAN-7045-2020; Mattsson, Tuija/ABA-1524-2020	Alm, Jukka/0000-0002-1470-8849; Mattsson, Tuija/0000-0002-5629-8374; Kortelainen, Pirkko/0000-0002-1448-0688													1354-1013	1365-2486				AUG	2006	12	8					1554	1567		10.1111/j.1365-2486.2006.01167.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2006.01167.x													WOS:000239004700017

The reduction of ground observations of freshwater ice has led to an increased reliance on the use of satellite remote sensing data. There is currently interest in the retrieval of lake ice properties (e.g., ice thickness, bubble radius, roughness) using synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Roughness at the ice-water interface is particularly important as it has been identified as the dominant mechanism for increasing SAR backscatter throughout the ice season and must be considered in numerical radiative transfer models. Therefore, this study determines optimal ice-water interface roughness height for two subarctic lakes in northern Canada and models backscatter throughout two ice seasons using the snow microwave radiative transfer (SMRT) model. The two lakes for this study are Noell Lake and Malcolm Ramsay Lake. Field observations of ice thickness, snow depth, snow density, and the Canadian Lake Ice Model (CLIMo) are used to parameterize SMRT. Modelled L, C, and X-band backscatter at different incidence angles is assessed using SAR imagery from multiple satellite missions. Root mean square errors ranged from 0.38 to 1.45 dB for Noell Lake and 0.70 to 2.33 dB for Malcolm Ramsay Lake. Discrepancies between modelled and observed backscatter were found to be connected to the representation of roughness at different interfaces within the ice column and changes that occurred during freeze-melt events. These results provide insight into how changes in ice properties impact backscatter throughout the ice season. SMRT is valuable for modelling backscatter from lake ice during the cold season and could be used to develop retrieval algorithms for estimating ice-water interface roughness. This would allow for the development of other inversion models for retrieval of surface ice conditions and ice thickness.

However, to date, not much is known about how the cryosphere in these mountainous regions is responding to climate change. Therefore, using an integrated approach including geo-spatial technology, climate data, a mass balance study, as well as topographic analysis, we present the first systematic study of glacier fluctuations in the Kokcha sub-basin of the Afghanistan Range for the last 25 years (1990 to 2015). The glacier cover and the number of glaciers in the basin have reduced from 576 km(2) and 1007 in 1990 to 492 km(2) and 998 in 2015 respectively, losing similar to 84 km(2) (similar to 15%) of the total glaciated area. Besides the mass loss of the glaciers ranges from -0.65 m water equivalent per year and -0.02 m water equivalent per year with an average of -0.20 m water equivalent per year as estimated by the geodetic method. The equilibrium line altitude changes since the Late Pleistocene to the present vary from 810 +/- 145 m to 1060 +/- 145 m with an average of 722 +/- 145 m. The increasing trend of temperature and shifting precipitation seasons have resulted in enhanced glacier recession and the formation of numerous glacial lakes in the basin. In addition to the climatic variables and glacier size, the topographic parameters slope, and elevation are observed to be the dominant factors influencing glacier recession and mass changes in the basin.					; Murtaza, Khalid/AAC-1126-2021; Dar, Reyaz/HQZ-0020-2023	Murtaza, Khalid Omar/0000-0002-9466-5286; DAR, REYAZ/0000-0001-6599-6767													1367-9120	1878-5786				OCT 1	2021	219								104897	10.1016/j.jseaes.2021.104897	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jseaes.2021.104897		JUL 2021											WOS:000691791800001

A millennium-length reconstruction of Bear River stream flow, Utah	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The Bear River contributes more water to the eastern Great Basin than any other river system. It is also the most significant source of water for the burgeoning Wasatch Front metropolitan area in northern Utah. Despite its importance for water resources for the region's agricultural, urban, and wildlife needs, our understanding of the variability of Bear River's stream flow derives entirely from the short instrumental record (1943-2010). Here we present a 1200-year calibrated and verified tree-ring reconstruction of stream flow for the Bear River that explains 67% of the variance of the instrumental record over the period from 1943 to 2010. Furthermore, we developed this reconstruction from a species that is not typically used for dendroclimatology, Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma). We identify highly significant periodicity in our reconstruction at quasi-decadal (7-8 year), multi-decadal (30 year), and centennial (>50 years) scales. The latter half of the 20th century was found to be the 2nd wettest (similar to 40-year) period of the past 1200 years, while the first half of the 20th century marked the 4th driest period. The most severe period of reduced stream flow occurred during the Medieval Warm Period (ca. mid-1200s CE) and persisted for 70 years. Upper-level circulation anomalies suggest that atmospheric teleconnections originating in the western tropical Pacific are responsible for the delivery of precipitation to the Bear River watershed during the October-December (OND) season of the previous year. The Bear River flow was compared to recent reconstructions of the other tributaries to the Great Salt Lake (GSL) and the GSL level. Implications for water management could be drawn from the observation that the latter half of the 20th century was the 2nd wettest in 1200 years, and that management for future water supply should take into account the stream flow variability over the past millennium.

Machine-learning methods have been suggested as means to express the stressor-response relationships that are found when applying mechanistic water quality models. The objective of this work was to evaluate the efficiency of regression trees in the development of a stressor-response model for chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations, using the results from site-specific mechanistic water quality modeling. The 2-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model (CE-QUAL-W2) model was applied to simulate water quality using four-year observational data and additional scenarios of air temperature increases for the Yeongsan Reservoir in South Korea. Regression tree modeling was applied to the results of these simulations. Given the well-expressed seasonality in the simulated Chl-a dynamics, separate regression trees were developed for months from May to September. The regression trees provided a reasonably accurate representation of the stressor-response dependence generated by the CE-QUAL-W2 model. Different stressors were then selected as split variables for different months, and, in most cases, splits by the same stressor variable yielded the same correlation sign between the variable and the Chl-a concentration. Compared to physical variables, nutrient content appeared to better predict Chl-a responses. The highest Chl-a temperature sensitivities were found for May and June. Regression tree splits based on ammonium concentration resulted in a consistent trend of greater sensitivity in the groups of samples with higher ammonium concentrations. Regression tree models provided a transparent visual representation of the stressor-response relationships for Chl-a and its sensitivity. Overall, the representation of relationships using classification and regression tools can be considered a useful approach to assess the state of aquatic ecosystems and effectively determine significant stressor variables.

The contribution of groundwater discharge to the overall water budget of two typical Boreal lakes in Alberta/Canada estimated from a radon mass balance	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Radon-222, a naturally-occurring radioisotope with a half-life of 3.8 days, was used to estimate groundwater discharge to small lakes in wetland-dominated basins in the vicinity of Fort McMurray, Canada. This region is under significant water development pressure including both oil sands mining and in situ extraction. Field investigations were carried out in March and July 2008 to measure radon-222 distributions in the water column of two lakes as a tracer of groundwater discharge. Radon concentrations in these lakes ranged from 0.5 to 72 Bq/m(3), while radon concentrations in groundwaters ranged between 2000 and 8000 Bq/m(3). A radon mass balance, used in comparison with stable isotope mass balance, suggested that the two lakes under investigation had quite different proportions of annual groundwater inflow (from 0.5% to about 14% of the total annual water inflow). Lower discharge rates were attributed to a larger drainage area/lake area ratio which promotes greater surface connectivity. Interannual variability in groundwater proportions is expected despite an implied seasonal constancy in groundwater discharge rates. Our results demonstrate that a combination of stable isotope and radon mass balance approaches provides information on flowpath partitioning that is useful for evaluating surface-groundwater connectivity and acid sensitivity of individual water bodies of interest in the Alberta Oil Sands Region.					; Santos, Isaac/A-3960-2019; Gibson, John/D-1897-2009; Schubert, Michael/B-1771-2016	Gibson, John Joseph/0000-0001-5952-0228; Santos, Isaac/0000-0003-0524-842X; Weiss, Holger/0000-0002-9736-9757; 													1027-5606	1607-7938					2010	14	1					79	89		10.5194/hess-14-79-2010	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-14-79-2010													WOS:000274058900005

Orbital Influence on Precipitation, Fire, and Grass Community Composition From 1.87 to 1.38 Ma in the Turkana Basin, Kenya	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												The Turkana Basin in northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia has yielded hundreds of hominin fossils and is among the most important localities in the world for studying human origins. High resolution climate and vegetation reconstructions from this region can elucidate potential linkages between hominin evolution and environmental change. Microcharcoal and phytoliths were examined from a 216 m (1.87-1.38 Ma) drill core (WTK13), which targeted paleo-Lake Lorenyang sediments from the Nachukui Formation of the Turkana Basin. A total of 287 samples were analyzed at similar to 32-96 cm intervals, providing millennial-scale temporal resolution. To better understand how basin sediments record fire and vegetation from the watershed, the paleorecord was compared with nine modern sediment samples collected from Lake Turkana along a transect of increasing distance from the 1978 to 1979 shoreline. This included vegetation surveys and phytolith production data for species from areas proximal to the basin. We found that phytolith and microcharcoal concentrations decreased predictably moving off shore. However, phytoliths from plants sourced in the Ethiopian Highlands increased moving off shore, likely the result of increased exposure to the Omo River sediment plume. In our down-core study, microcharcoal was well-preserved but phytolith preservation was poor below similar to 60 m (similar to 1.50 Ma). Spectral analysis revealed that microcharcoal often varied at precessional (similar to 21 kyr) periodicities, and through a correlation with delta D-wax, linked orbitally forced peaks in precipitation with elevated fire on the landscape. Phytoliths revealed that alternating mesic C-4 versus xeric C-4 grass dominance likely varied at precessional periodicities as well, but that grass community composition was also mediated by basin geometry. Two high eccentricity intervals of particularly high amplitude and abrupt environmental change were centered at similar to 1.72 and 1.50 Ma, with the intervening period experiencing high fire variability. With the switch from lacustrine to fluvial-deltaic deposition at the core site by 1.5 Ma, mesic C-4 grasses dominated and fire activity was high. This upper interval correlated to the time interval from which Nariokotome Boy (Homo erectus/ergaster) was discovered 3 km east of our drill site. Phytoliths indicated a seasonally wet and open landscape dominated by xeric C-4 grasses, sedges, and other herbaceous plants.					; Yost, Chad/J-7156-2019; Lupien, Rachel/HJI-2324-2023	Yost, Chad/0000-0002-8867-7854; Lupien, Rachel/0000-0002-5618-8829; 														2296-6463				JUL 28	2021	9								568646	10.3389/feart.2021.568646	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2021.568646													WOS:000683568600001

Relating dissolved organic matter fluorescence and functional properties	CHEMOSPHERE												The fluorescence excitation-emission matrix properties of 25 dissolved organic matter samples from three rivers and one lake are analysed. All sites are sampled in duplicate, and the 25 samples include ten taken from the lake site, and nine from one of the rivers, to cover variations in dissolved organic matter composition due to season and river flow. Fluorescence properties are compared to the functional properties of the dissolved organic matter; the functional assays provide quantitative information on photochemical fading, buffering capacity, copper binding, benzo[a]pyrene binding, hydrophilicity and adsorption to alumina. Optical (absorbance and fluorescence) characterization of the dissolved organic matter samples demonstrates that (1) peak C (excitation 300-350 nm; emission 400-460 nm) fluorescence emission wavelength; (2) the ratio of peak T (excitation 220-235 nm; emission 330-370 nm) to peak C fluorescence intensity; and (3) the peak C fluorescence intensity: absorbance at 340 nm ratio have strong correlations with many of the functional assays. Strongest correlations are with benzo[a]pyrene binding. alumina adsorption, hydrophilicity and buffering capacity, and in many cases linear regression equations with a correlation coefficient >0.8 are obtained. These optical properties are independent of freshwater dissolved organic carbon concentration (for concentrations < 10 mg L-1) and therefore hold the potential for laboratory. field and on-line monitoring and prediction of organic matter functional properties.

The water samples, measured by ten parameters, were collected every month for three years (2008-2010) from eight sampling stations located along the river. The hierarchical CA classified the 12 months into three periods (First, Second and Third Period) and the eight sampling sites into three groups (Groups 1, 2 and 3) based on seasonal differences and various pollution levels caused by physicochemical properties and anthropogenic activities. DA identified three significant parameters (temperature, pH and E.coli) to distinguish temporal groups with close to 76% correct assignment. The DA also discovered five parameters (temperature, electricity conductivity, total nitrogen, chemical oxygen demand and total phosphorus) for spatial variation analysis, with 80.56% correct assignment. The non-parametric correlation coefficient (Spearman R) explained the relationship between the water quality parameters and the basin characteristics, and the GIS made the results visual and direct. The PCA identified four PCs for Groups 1 and 2, and three PCs for Group 3. These PCs captured 68.94%, 67.48% and 70.35% of the total variance of Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Although natural pollution affects the Xin'anjiang River, the main sources of pollution included agricultural activities, industrial waste, and domestic wastewater.

Multi-wavelength Pulse Amplitude Modulated fluorometry (Phyto-PAM) reveals differential effects of ultraviolet radiation on the photosynthetic physiology of phytoplankton pigment groups	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The effects of UV-B, UV-A and PAR on the photochemistry of phytoplankton from Hamilton Harbour, Lake Ontario, were measured to assess how well a multi-wavelength Pulse Amplitude Modulated fluorometer (Phyto-PAM) could discriminate among different pigment groups and to test whether bloom-forming cyanobacteria in this embayment have comparatively high resistance to sunlight stress. 2. Estimates of abundance for the three groups (blues, greens and browns) identified by the Phyto-PAM generally agreed with microscope counts, but the maximum quantum efficiency of photochemistry (F-v:F-m) was usually quantified only for the dominant group. 3. In acute exposure experiments, the average inhibition of F-v:F-m by PAR, UV-A and UV-B was <10, 30 and 60% respectively. More inhibition was observed in the cyanobacteria compared to the eukaryotic phytoplankton, due to higher rates of photosystem damage rather than lower rates of recovery based on the Kok model for photoinhibition. Both F-v:F-m and photosynthetic carbon incorporation showed similar patterns of inhibition. 4. Based on F-v:F-m our results showed no evidence that cyanobacteria are more resistant to UVR stress compared to other groups, however, their success as bloom-forming species suggests they must have other mechanisms to tolerate if not thrive under high irradiance conditions. These results demonstrate both the utility and limitations of the Phyto-PAM for the assessment of group-specific abundance and physiological responses in a natural community:general seasonal and inter-group variation can be captured, but improved resolution of less abundant groups would enhance its application.

Traditional ecological knowledge reveals the extent of sympatric lake trout diversity and habitat preferences	ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY												Multidisciplinary approaches to conservation have become increasingly important in northern regions. Because many First Nations communities have relied on freshwater fish populations for essential food over millennia, community members often possess traditional ecological knowledge (TEK). We consulted Cree First Nation fishers to collate TEK for one of Canada's most important subsistence fishes (lake trout) in Quebec's largest lake (Mistassini, 2335 km(2)). We further integrated TEK with what was regionally known scientifically about the species, toward effective fisheries conservation. Cree fishers described a richer diversity of sympatric lake trout forms than did scientific research that was conducted simultaneously, based on color, size, fin accent patterns, scale texture and depth, and spatial preferences. Traditional ecological knowledge also provided descriptions of lake trout seasonal movements, spawning locations, and reproductive timing that were not captured by scientific research, and highlighted several concerns or temporal changes of import to future management initiatives. Our study highlights the wealth of TEK on harvested species in First Nations communities. It further illustrates how TEK can reveal not only distinctions within species of relevance to natural resource management and taxonomy, but also informs upon the extent of such population differentiation, thereby providing important conservation benefits for remote and northern regions.

Yet the current understanding of hydrological and flood pattern changes associated with infrastructural development still contains several knowledge gaps, such as the interactions between multiple drivers, which may have serious implications for water management, agricultural production, and ecosystem services. This research attempts to conduct a cumulative assessment of basin-wide hydropower dam construction and irrigation expansion, as well as climate change, implications on discharge, and flood changes in the Cambodian Mekong floodplain. These floodplains offer important livelihoods for a considerable part of the 6.4 million people living on them, as they are among the most productive ecosystems in the world - driven by the annual flood pulse. To assess the potential future impacts, we used an innovative combination of three models: Mekong basin-wide distributed hydrological model IWRM-VMod, with the Mekong delta 1D flood propagation model MIKE-11 and 2D flood duration and extent model IWRM-Sub enabling detail floodplain modelling. We then ran scenarios to approximate possible conditions expected by around 2050. Our results show that the monthly and seasonal hydrological regimes (discharges, water levels, and flood dynamics) will be subject to substantial alterations under future development scenarios. Projected climate change impacts are expected to decrease dry season flows and increase wet season flows, which is in opposition to the expected alterations under development scenarios that consider both hydropower and irrigation. The likely impact of decreasing water discharge in the early wet season (up to -30 %) will pose a critical challenge to rice production, whereas the likely increase in water discharge in the mid-dry season (up to +140 %) indicates improved water availability for coping with drought stresses and sustaining environmental flows. At the same time, these changes would have drastic impacts on total flood extent, which is projected to decline by around 20 %, having potentially negative impacts on floodplain productivity and aquaculture, whilst reducing the flood risk to more densely populated areas. Our findings demonstrate the substantial changes that planned infrastructural development will have on the area, potentially impacting important ecosystems and people's livelihoods, calling for actions to mitigate these changes as well as planning potential adaptation strategies.					; Kummu, Matti/C-4797-2011	Horton, Alexander/0000-0003-3067-7138; Hok, Panha/0000-0001-5555-8528; Hoang, Long/0000-0003-4503-1305; Heng, Sokchhay/0000-0003-3786-266X; Kummu, Matti/0000-0001-5096-0163													1561-8633	1684-9981				MAR 22	2022	22	3					967	983		10.5194/nhes-22-967-2022	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/nhes-22-967-2022													WOS:000773392000001
J	Pinheiro, VM; Stockwell, JD; Marsden, JE				Pinheiro, Victoria M.; Stockwell, Jason D.; Marsden, J. Ellen			Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) spawning site use in Lake Champlain	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The decline of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) populations in the Laurentian Great Lakes stimulated research on restoration, addressing many knowledge gaps of lake trout behavior and ecology. However, studies focused on lake trout spawning behavior are relatively recent, and little is known about sex-specific differences in spawning site use. To test several hypotheses about spawning movements, we surgically implanted acoustic telemetry tags in 45 male and 48 female lake trout and tracked their movements within and among three spawning seasons and eight spawning sites up to 56 km apart in Lake Champlain. Both sexes traveled similar distances throughout the lake and visited a similar number of sites during the spawning season. Males spent more days during the spawning season on a spawning site, were more likely to return to the same preferred site each year, spent more time per day on a site, and tended to stay closer to site-center than females. Twenty of 86 fish (23%) preferred a site in their tagging year other than the site at which they were tagged, so the assumption that a tagging site is the spawning site should be treated with caution. Only 61 to 74% of lake trout returned to the same site in a second year (repeat homing).

Nitrous oxide and methane seasonal variability in the epilimnion of a large tropical meromictic lake (Lake Kivu, East-Africa)	AQUATIC SCIENCES												We report a data-set of monthly vertical profiles obtained from January 2012 to October 2013, from the surface to 70 m depth of nitrous oxide (N2O) and dissolved methane (CH4) in Lake Kivu, a large and deep meromictic tropical lake (East Africa). Vertical variations of N2O were modest, with ranges of 6-9 and 0-16 nmol L-1 in surface and bottom waters, respectively, and occasionally peaks of N2O (up to 58 nmol L-1) were observed at the oxic-anoxic interface. On the contrary, steep vertical gradients of CH4 were observed with values changing several orders of magnitude from surface (19-103 nmol L-1) to 70 m (similar to 113,000-520,000 nmol L-1). Seasonal variations of CH4 were caused by annual cycles of mixing and stratification, during the dry and rainy seasons, respectively. This mixing allowed the establishment of a thick oxic layer (maximum 65 m deep), leading to decreased CH4 concentrations (minimum of 8 nmol L-1), presumably due to bacterial CH4 oxidation. During the stratification period, the oxic mixed layer was thinner (minimum 25 m deep), and an increase of CH4 concentrations in surface waters was observed (maximum of 103 nmol L-1), probably due to a lower integrated CH4 oxidation on the water column. Lake Kivu seasonally alternated between a source and a sink for atmospheric N2O, but on an annual scale was a small source of N2O to the atmosphere (on average 0.43 A mu mol m(-2) day(-1)), while it was a small source of CH4 to the atmosphere throughout the year (on average 86 A mu mol m(-2) day(-1)). Vertical and seasonal variations of N2O are discussed in terms of nitrification and denitrification, although from the present data-set it is not possible to unambiguously identify the main drivers of N2O production.					; Borges, Alberto/C-4989-2008; Morana, Cedric/AAL-5025-2021	Morana, Cedric/0000-0002-5521-0414; Borges, Alberto V./0000-0002-5434-2247													1015-1621	1420-9055				APR	2017	79	2					209	218		10.1007/s00027-016-0491-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-016-0491-2													WOS:000397570900001

Previous palaeoecological investigations of the Dinarides Lake System were established using stratigraphical, palaeofloral, and malacological data. However, large mammal remains have so far not been used to reconstruct the terrestrial palaeoenvironment of this important fossil ecosystem. Here, the palaeodietary preferences of large mammals were investigated, using a multiproxy approach by employing dental microwear and dental mesowear analysis, in order to provide new perspectives on the terrestrial palaeoecology of the Dinarides Lake System. The dental microwear of all available adult mammalian teeth was analysed. Dental mesowear analysis was employed for ungulate and proboscidean taxa, using mesowear scores and mesowear angles, respectively. The analysis reveals the presence of browsing, "dirty browsing", and mixed-feeding herbivorous taxa, with seasonal fruit, or even grass intake. Additionally, the analysis of the carnivores suggests the presence of hyaena- and cheetah-like hypercarnivores, as well as generalists. The palaeodietary traits of the fossil mammals suggest a closed canopy-like environment, which is supported by the fossil plant assemblage. Palaeopalynological data confirm the omnipresence of fleshy fruit-bearing plants, herbaceous taxa, as well as grasses, which justifies the seasonal fruit browsing, the common "dirty browsing", and the occasional grazing behaviour visualized for some of the fossil mammals from Gracanica.					; Xafis, Alexandros/AAU-9327-2020; Grimsson, Fridgeir/A-9943-2012	Bastl, Katharina/0000-0002-8200-9708; Xafis, Alexandros/0000-0001-5528-3106; Grimsson, Fridgeir/0000-0002-1874-6412; 													1867-1594	1867-1608				JUN	2020	100	2			SI		457	477		10.1007/s12549-020-00435-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12549-020-00435-2		JUN 2020						32647552					WOS:000539787700001

Adequacy of planctomycetes as supplementary food source for Daphnia magna	ANTONIE VAN LEEUWENHOEK INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL AND MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY					3rd Meeting of the Planctomycetes-Verrucomicrobia-Chlamydiae Superphylum Community	MAY 10-12, 2017	Porto, PORTUGAL					The nutritional quality of daphnids diet can influence their growth, reproduction and survival. In aquatic ecosystems, bacteria can contribute significantly to Daphnia diet by supporting, for instances, their high needs for phosphorus. The laboratory feeding of the model organisms Daphnia spp. is algal based, but should be improved to allow their better performance. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of two planctomycetes, Gemmata obscuriglobus and Rhodopirellula rubra, from exponential and stationary growth phases as alternative or supplementary food source for Daphnia magna. The actinobacterium Arthrobacter sp. was used for comparison. The feeding with only bacteria showed the inefficacy of both planctomycetes and actinobacteria as the only food source. However, when used in supplement to Raphidocelis subcapitata, a decrease in the age of first reproduction, a significant increase in reproductive output, in somatic growth and in rate of population increase was found for the highest cell densities of bacteria tested. The typical pink coloration of these bacteria present in daphnids body and eggs confirmed bacterial absorption and metabolization of their pigment. Planctomycetes yielded better results than the actinobacteria Arthrobacter but G. obscuriglobus that possesses sterols did not induce a better performance comparatively to R. rubra. No relation could be established between the feeding treatments that allowed improvement of Daphnia performance and the different kind of Daphnia' Fatty Acid Methyl Esters. The use of sonication to separate planctomycetal cells before feeding the daphnids proved to be efficient. We confirmed that R. subcapitata supplemented by bacteria allows a better growth performance of D. magna.

Seasonal and centennial cycles of carbonate mineralisation during the past 2500 years from varved sediment in Lake Shira, South Siberia	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Shira Lake is a good representative object for detail weather-climate modeling due to its local hydroclimatic information and annually laminated bottom sediments. Carbonate biochemical mineralization in Shira Lake shows not only seasonal but also centennial pulses over each 450-500 years. An age-depth model has been built by layer counting combined with Cs-137 and C-14 isotopic dates. Thermodynamic estimation of the rock-water multisystem in conformity with local conditions and source matter provides grounds for interpretation of measured geochemical parameters in sediments including environmental indicators such as temperature, salinity, and pH. Scanning X-ray fluorescence for sub-millimeter microstratigraphic study of varves connects geochemical oscillations of microelement content (Rb, Ti, Ca, Sr, Br, XRD) with seasonality, as well as revealing centennial pulses of environmental change. Quantitative environmental reconstruction using multiple regression for precipitation calibrated by hydrometeorological time series year by year was carried out for the lake over the last 2500 years.

We analyzed whether the way the species exploit food resources may help explain their coexistence. Fish samples were collected in a lake in the Upper Parana River floodplain in September (dry period) and December (rainy period) of 2010. The diet of six species was evaluated through stomach content analysis, which showed that the most consumed resources were microcrustaceans, aquatic insects, aquatic higher plant and algae. Diet composition was significantly different between periods for all species studied. Diet overlap values were low in both periods, but trophic segregation was even higher in the rainy period, indicating that with greater abundance of food resources, species could exploit preferential resources. Trophic segregation, evidenced by the low overlap values in both periods, indicates the absence of interspecific competition, which may explain the coexistence of these species in the littoral zone of this small lake.					; Fugi, Rosemara/D-5708-2016; Carniatto, Natália/F-5121-2016; Quirino, Bárbara/GZA-5089-2022	Quirino, Barbara Angelio/0000-0002-7734-3795; Vallim Gaiotto, Juliana/0000-0002-0961-8494; Fugi, Rosemara/0000-0002-7230-0817													1386-2588	1573-5125				DEC	2015	49	4					431	440		10.1007/s10452-015-9535-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-015-9535-2													WOS:000363963300003

Each lake was sampled seasonally, over a period of one year. Water quality variables and metals in sediments were measured. Lakes along the lowest part of the river, within the Yangtze River Delta, had highest nutrient concentrations and were eutrophic or hypereutrophic. Lakes displayed a gradient in many water chemistry variables, from the middle to the lower Yangtze River. Lakes of the Delta region had the highest conductivity, sulfate, turbidity, and Chl-a values, and the lowest dissolved oxygen concentrations. A number of lakes near urban areas in the study region also displayed similar conditions. Lakes polluted by heavy metals were found in the upper part of the lower Yangtze River and had high Cu, Cr, and Co concentrations in sediments. The mean I-geo (index of geoaccumulation) values for Cu, Cr, and Co classes ranged from 0 to 4, indicating moderate to heavy contamination, contributed mainly from untreated industrial waste water produced within the lake catchments. Lakes of the middle Yangtze River are generally in relatively better condition, except for those around urban zones, which experience higher nutrient and heavy metal loading. The spatial distribution of lake conditions in the area can be related to the policy of regional economic development. The Delta region in China is developed and includes such cities as Shanghai and Suzhou. Heavy industries have moved into the interior region of China too, and development of modern cities is now occurring under some level of environmental protection. Nevertheless, lakes in the central part are becoming seriously polluted with both heavy metals and nutrients because local authorities promote industrialization and urbanization to improve economic conditions, while often ignoring environmental protection. Pollution is increasingly occurring in upstream reaches, a tendency that will bring more environmental problems. Interior lakes of China require immediate attention to prevent further declines in water quality.					; Qin, Boqiang/E-5900-2013; ma, long/JHU-2289-2023	Ma, Long/0000-0002-8233-8640; 													0920-4741	1573-1650				SEP	2012	26	12					3601	3618		10.1007/s11269-012-0093-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-012-0093-2													WOS:000307354300013
J	Gillis, PL				Gillis, Patricia L.			Cumulative impacts of urban runoff and municipal wastewater effluents on wild freshwater mussels (Lasmigona costata)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Aquatic biota living in urban watersheds, are chronically exposed to a complex mixture of contaminants from various sources, including municipal wastewater effluents and road runoff. This study examined the general condition, immune function and contaminant load of wild freshwater mussels collected from a large urbanized river over three consecutive field seasons. Four study sites along the Grand River (ON) were selected to represent an incremental contaminant exposure, such that mussels collected from the final downstream site were exposed to the cumulative inputs from 11 municipal wastewater treatment plants and road runoff from four cities. Wild mussels collected downstream of the urban area had significantly lower (p<0.05) condition factor and did not live as long (significantly reduced mean age) as the mussels collected upstream of the cities. There appears to be a trend of increasing proportions of gravid females at the downstream sites, but whether this trend indicates feminization of the mussel population or is simply an artifact of sampling effort is unclear. An examination of hemocyte phagocytosis revealed a pattern of increasing immune activity at the downstream sites, but only in one of the years sampled. The significant and cumulative increase in Cu, Pb, Zn, Al, Cr, and Ni in the gills of downstream mussels indicates that metals are bioavailable in this ecosystem and that tissue concentrations increase with multiple urban inputs. While the complex nature of the exposure prevents identification of the cause(s) of the observed effects, some contaminants such as ammonia and chloride reach levels known to be toxic to freshwater mussels at the downstream sites. These results indicate that chronic exposure to multiple contaminants negatively impacts mussel health and longevity and corroborates previous assumptions that waterborne contaminants contributed to the decline of the freshwater mussel populations in this watershed.

Vegetation changes associated with independently derived histories of El Nino Southern Oscillation variability provided evidence of shifts in the relative abundance of individual species rather than immigration or extinction. Droughts associated with the Medieval Climate Anomaly induced rapid ecological change that was followed by a reversion to the previous state. The paleoecological data suggested nonneutral responses to climatic forcing in this ecosystem prior to the period of human influence. Human impacts on the islands are evident in the record. A marked decline in long-term codominants of the pollen record, Alternanthera and Acalypha, produced a flora without modern analogue before 1930. Intensified animal husbandry after ca. 1930 may have induced the local extinction of Acalypha and Alternanthera. Reductions in populations of grazing animals in the 1970s and 1980s did not result in the return of the native flora, but in invasions by exotic species. After ca. 1970 the trajectory of habitat change accelerated, continuously moving the ecosystem away from the observed range of variability in the previous 2690 years toward a novel ecosystem. The last 40 years of the record also suggest unprecedented transport of lowland pollen to the uplands, consistent with intensified convection and warmer wet seasons.

Evaluation of mercury cycling and hypolimnetic oxygenation in mercury-impacted seasonally stratified reservoirs in the Guadalupe River watershed, California	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Surface water reservoirs trap inorganic mercury delivered from their watersheds, create conditions that convert inorganic mercury to highly toxic methylmercury (MeHg), and host sportfish in which MeHg bioaccumulates. The Santa Clara Valley Water District (District) actively manages and monitors four mercury-impaired reservoirs that help to serve communities in South San Francisco Bay, California. The Guadalupe River watershed, which contains three of those reservoirs, also includes the New Almaden mercury-mining district, the largest historic mercury producer in North America. Monthly vertical profiles of field measurements and grab samples in years 2011-2013 portray annual cycling of density stratification, dissolved oxygen (DO), and MeHg. Monitoring results highlight the role that hypolimnetic hypoxia plays in MeHg distribution in the water column, as well as the consistent, tight coupling between MeHg in ecological compartments (water, zooplankton, and bass) across the four reservoirs. Following the 2011-2013 monitoring period, the District designed and installed hypolimnetic oxygenation systems (HOS) in the four reservoirs in an effort to repress MeHg buildup in bottom waters and attain regulatory targets for MeHg in water and fish tissue. Initial HOS operation in Calero Reservoir in 2014 enhanced bottom water DO and depressed hypolimnetic buildup of MeHg, but did not substantially decrease mercury levels in zooplankton or small fish.

Responses of phytoplankton functional groups to the mixing regime in a deep subtropical reservoir	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The present study was carried out in Faxinal Reservoir, a warm monomictic, meso-eutrophic reservoir in subtropical southern Brazil, with a long-standing, well-stratified condition, low epilimnetic nutrient concentrations, and a relatively clear epilimnion. In this study, we analyzed the dynamics of the phytoplankton functional groups, recognizing their driving forces in Faxinal Reservoir. Samples were taken at monthly intervals from January 2004 to January 2005 in surface waters. According to the reservoir's mixing regime, three periods were identified during the study: stratification 1 (January-May 2004); mixing period (June-August 2004); and stratification 2 (September 2004-January 2005). The nutrient dynamics were driven by the mixing regime. The H1, F, and C phytoplankton functional groups were the most important in biomass, mainly represented by the N-fixing cyanobacterium Anabaena crassa, the colonial green alga with thick mucilaginous sheaths Nephrocytium sp., and the diatom Asterionella formosa, respectively. Tendencies pointed out by redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that the mixing regime was the main determining factor of the seasonal dynamics of the phytoplankton community. The dominant functional groups showed a close relationship with the relative water-column stability (RWCS), and also, as a consequence of the mixing regime, with nutrient availability. The study also revealed the important role of physical processes in the seasonal gradient, in selecting for phytoplankton functional groups and, consequently, in the assessment of ecological status. Q index (assemblage index) of water quality based on functional groups revealed ecological status varying from very poor to tolerable in the stratification 1 period and from tolerable to medium in the mixing and stratification 2 periods.					; Becker, Vanessa/G-6189-2015; Crossetti, Luciane/K-5218-2012; Huszar, Vera/J-7126-2012	Huszar, Vera/0000-0002-8096-1404; Crossetti, Luciane/0000-0002-0049-4229; Becker, Vanessa/0000-0002-7326-4328; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL	2009	628	1					137	151		10.1007/s10750-009-9751-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-009-9751-7													WOS:000266007900010

In the present study we developed a Lake Kasumigaura, Japan, zooplankton DNA barcode library to increase the sensitivity of future zooplankton monitoring for detecting lake ecosystem condition changes. Specifically, the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (mtCOI) haplotype, i.e., the primary DNA barcode, was examined for each zooplankton taxon. In crustaceans, 37 mtCOI haplotypes were obtained from 99 individuals, representing four and 15 morpho-species of Copepoda and Cladocera, respectively. Comparing these sequences with those in GenBank shows that the lake harbors putative non-indigenous species, such as Daphnia ambigua. In rotifers, 132 mtCOI haplotypes were obtained from 302 individuals, representing 11 genera and one unclassified taxon. The automatic barcode gap discovery (ABGD) algorithm separated these haplotypes into 43 species. Brachionus cf. calyciflorus was divided into five ABGD species, and different ABGD species tended to occur in different seasons. Seasonal ABGD-species succession was also observed within Polyarthra spp. and Synchaeta spp. These seasonal successions were not detected by inspections of external morphology alone. Accepting up to 7% sequence divergence within the same species, mtCOI reference sequences were available in GenBank for three, 13, and 17 species in Copepoda, Cladocera, and Rotifera, respectively. The present results, therefore, reveal the serious shortage of mtCOI reference sequences for rotifers, and underscore the urgency of developing rotifer mtCOI barcode libraries on a global scale.					; Makino, Wataru/GLS-2518-2022	Makino, Wataru/0000-0003-3240-3763; 													0912-3814	1440-1703				JUL	2017	32	4					481	493		10.1007/s11284-017-1458-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-017-1458-z													WOS:000404385500005

Lake breezes and their interactions with urban heat islands are of great importance to air quality and weather forecasting. In this study, surface observations at a dense network and Wind Profile Radar measurements were utilized to characterize the lake breezes at Lake Taihu and assess the impact of geophysical factors on the development and intensity of the lake breezes. The lake breezes were characterized by a low occurrence frequency of 12%-17% (defined as the percentage of days with lake breezes in a given month), weak speed (annual mean ranging from 1.5 to 3.3 ms(-1)), late onset [average onset around 1110 local standard time (LST), with a range of 0900-1300 LST], short duration (annual mean 3.5 h), and low circulation depth (average depth of 400 m from 1200 to 1400 LST). The lake breezes were greatly suppressed when the geostrophic winds were higher than 4.1 m s(-1). The low heat capacity of shallow water (mean depth 2.0 m) led to small temperature differences between the land and the lake, which was the main factor responsible for the low occurrence frequency along Lake Taihu. All of the characteristic parameters showed distinct seasonal variations. Increased frequencies, earlier onset times, and longer durations on the northern lakeshore were indicative of the impact of the urban heat island on the lake breezes.

J	Morrison, TA; Bolger, DT				Morrison, Thomas A.; Bolger, Douglas T.			Wet season range fidelity in a tropical migratory ungulate	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												1. In migratory populations, the degree of fidelity and dispersal among seasonal ranges is an important population process with consequences for demography, management, sensitivity to habitat change and adaptation to local environmental conditions. 2. Characterizing patterns of range fidelity in ungulates, however, has remained challenging because of the difficulties of following large numbers of marked individuals across multiple migratory cycles and of identifying the appropriate scale of analysis. 3. We examined fidelity to wet season (i.e. breeding) ranges in a recently declining population of wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus Burchell in northern Tanzania across 3 years. We used computer-assisted photographic identification and capture-recapture to characterize return patterns to three wet season ranges that were ecologically discrete and topographically isolated from one another. 4. Among 2557 uniquely identified adult wildebeest, we observed 150 recaptures across consecutive wet seasons. Between the two migratory subpopulations, the probability of remaining faithful to wet season areas ranged between 0 82 and 1 00. Animals from a non-migratory segment of the population (near Lake Manyara National Park) were rarely observed in other wet season ranges, despite proximity to one of the migratory pathways. 5. We found no effect of sex on an individuals' probability of switching wet season ranges. However, the breeding status of females in year i had a strong influence on patterns of range selection in year i + 1, with surviving breeders over three times as likely to switch ranges as non-breeders. 6. Social-group associations between pairs of recaptured animals were random with respect to an individual's wet season range during the previous or forthcoming wet seasons, suggesting that an individual's herd identity during the dry season does not predict wet season range selection. 7. Examining fidelity and dispersal in terrestrial migrations improves our understanding of the constraints that migrants experience when they face rapid habitat changes or fluctuations in environmental conditions.																			0021-8790	1365-2656				MAY	2012	81	3					543	552		10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01941.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01941.x								22256947					WOS:000302613300005

Ten AMS radiocarbon dates suggest that the sediment covers at least the last 73,000 years. Shifts between tropical forests and savanna, changes in species composition, as well as changes in fire frequency indicate several wet and dry periods during this time interval. During the assumed early Pleniglacial (73-50 ka), the dominance of savanna vegetation reflects drier conditions, whereas vegetation changes in the mid-Pleniglacial (50-40 ka) suggest alternating wet and dry phases under generally cool conditions. The recorded next period before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) shows a transition to wetter and cooler conditions, followed by a cold and dry LGM and Late glacial. At the beginning of the Holocene, between 11.4 and 10.2 cal ka, tropical forest expanded, reflecting stable and very humid conditions. During the early to mid-Holocene an increasingly seasonal, generally warm and dry climate established. Dry seasons were longer than at present during mid-Holocene times with a pronounced dry phase from 9 to 3.4 cal ka. Only after 3.4 cal ka did modern tropical rainforests became established under present-day climatic conditions. Comparison with other palaeoecological studies in the Amazon basin and eastern Andean regions suggests that environmental changes in Serra Sul were strongly coupled with large scale climatic changes and sea surface temperature variability in the tropical Atlantic.

Infra and inter-annual structure of zooplankton communities in floodplain lakes: a long-term ecological research study	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												Water flow management has significantly changed the natural dynamic of floods, 'which are responsible for the structure and dynamic of aquatic communities in river-floodplain systems. With the aim to elaborate a conceptual framework that describes the main ecological factors associated with zooplankton community structure in the Upper Parana River, we investigated the mechanisms that regulate the communities structure and their response to inter-annual and hydro-sedimentological variations in the floodplain and the biological factors associated with species abundance in those communities. For this we conducted samplings every six months (potamophase in March and limnophase in September) to characterize intra and inter-annual variations in community structure between 2000 and 2008. The intra-annual differences on the species richness, abundance, Shannon diversity index, and evenness, were conducted using Bayesian procedures to show probabilistic predictions of the data fit to main variation sources. Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS), multi-response permutation procedure (MRPP), and indicator species analysis (IndVal) were run to assess and characterize the seasonality of the community structure. During high water (potamophase), hydrologic connectivity favoured exchange and dispersal of species in some lakes, increasing local diversity; during low water (limnophase), higher local productivity favoured opportunistic taxa, increasing species dominance and decreasing local diversity. Food resources and density of small-size fish were biological factors associated with the seasonal dynamic of the zooplankton community; these factors were dependent on hydrosedimentological phase (potamophase or limnophase). Water levels and limnological modifications related to water flow management have promoted replacement and impoverishment of aquatic biota in affected lakes and have indicated the ecological importance of a natural dynamic flood, which displays regular flood pulses. The conceptual model presented encompassed interactions between diverse environmental variables to more understandable mechanisms of the main sources of community variation. Rev. Biol.

In the Lake Como basin (Italy), we monitored water-depleted reaches below hydropower reservoirs and intakes and reaches unimpacted by water withdrawal. Our aim was to verify if the gradient in streamflow alterations resulted in detectable differences in the structure and functions of benthic assemblages, possibly identifying streamflow metrics explaining the observed differences. The macroinvertebrate assemblages sampled below reservoirs showed significant differences from those from unimpacted reaches, including the reduced relative richness of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (mainly stoneflies) and the higher abundance and richness of dipterans. These differences were well explained by the corresponding streamflow pattern, characterized by a rather constant flow throughout the year, occasionally interrupted by sharp peaks related to spilling episodes. In contrast, the shift from unimpacted conditions was minor for benthic assemblages collected at reaches below intakes, where the seasonal streamflow variation was partly preserved. Our results suggest that an increase of the e-flow released by hydropower dams during the seasons characterized by larger run-offs could support improved benthic assemblages. Dewatered river sections below reservoirs could thus be prioritized for updating the current MF management, in the study area as well as in comparable contexts. At least to our knowledge, specific investigations are so far unavailable regarding the exploration of the different responses of benthic macroinvertebrates to intakes and reservoirs operations.					; Quadroni, Silvia/T-1972-2019	Quadroni, Silvia/0000-0003-1295-2108; 													1936-0584	1936-0592				JUL	2021	14	5							e2267	10.1002/eco.2267	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eco.2267		DEC 2020											WOS:000598308300001

Interannual variability of ground surface thermal regimes in Livingston and Deception islands, Antarctica (2007-2021)	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												The absence of vegetation in most ice-free areas of Antarctica makes the soil surface very sensitive to atmosphere dynamics, especially in the western sector of the Antarctic Peninsula, an area within the limits of the permafrost zone. To evaluate the possible effects of regional warming on frozen soils, we conducted an analysis of ground surface temperatures (GSTs) from 2007 to 2021 from different monitoring sites in Livingston and Deception islands (South Shetlands archipelago, Antarctica). The analysis of the interannual evolution of the GST and their daily regimes and the freezing and thawing indexes reveals that climate change is showing impacts on seasonal and perennially frozen soils. Freezing Degree Days (FDD) have decreased while Thawing Degree Day (TDD) have increased during the study period, resulting in a balance that is already positive at the sites at lower elevations. Daily freeze-thaw cycles have been rare and absent since 2014. Meanwhile, the most common thermal regimes are purely frozen - F1 (daily temperatures < = -0.5 degrees C), isothermal - IS (ranging between -0.5 degrees C to +0.5 degrees C), and purely thawed - T1 (> = +0.5 degrees C). A decrease in F1 days has been observed, while the IS and T1 days increased by about 60 days between 2007 and 2021. The annual number of days with snow cover increased between 2009 and 2014 and decreased since then. The GST and the daily thermal regimes evolution point to general heating, which may be indicative of the degradation of the frozen soils in the study area.					; Vieira, Goncalo/G-5958-2010; Prieto, Manuel/K-8822-2014; de Pablo, Miguel Angel/J-6442-2014; Ramos, Miguel/K-2230-2014; Molina, Antonio/AAE-1314-2020; Prieto Mateo, Manuel/K-8822-2014	Ruiz-Fernandez, Jesus/0000-0001-7161-3320; Vieira, Goncalo/0000-0001-7611-3464; de Pablo, Miguel Angel/0000-0002-4496-2741; Ramos, Miguel/0000-0003-3648-6818; Molina, Antonio/0000-0002-5038-2022; Prieto Mateo, Manuel/0000-0003-3050-3445													1085-3278	1099-145X				JAN 15	2024	35	1					378	393		10.1002/ldr.4922	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.4922		OCT 2023											WOS:001090769000001

CDOM research spans in many fields, including chemistry, marine environment, biomass cycling, physics, hydrology, and climate change. In recent years, a series of remarkable research milestone have been achieved. On the basis of reviewing the research process of CDOM, combined with a bibliometric analysis, this study aims to provide a comprehensive review of the development and applications of remote sensing in monitoring CDOM from 2003 to 2022. The findings show that remote sensing data plays an important role in CDOM research as proven with the increasing number of publications since 2003, particularly in China and the United States. Primary research areas have gradually changed from studying absorption and fluorescence properties to optimization of remote sensing inversion models in recent years. Since the composition of oceanic and freshwater bodies differs significantly, it is important to choose the appropriate inversion method for different types of water body. At present, the monitoring of CDOM mainly relies on a single sensor, but the fusion of images from different sensors can be considered a major research direction due to the complex characteristics of CDOM. Therefore, in the future, the characteristics of CDOM will be studied in depth inn combination with multi-source data and other application models, where inversion algorithms will be optimized, inversion algorithms with low dependence on measured data will be developed, and a transportable inversion model will be built to break the regional limitations of the model and to promote the development of CDOM research in a deeper and more comprehensive direction.

Under the premise that shallow lakes are sentinels of global climate and eutrophication, a 3-year research in ten lakes located across a climatic gradient explored which factors drove the dynamics of cyanobacterial assemblages frequently driving to bloom prevalence. Contrarily to what is expected, the effect of seasonal temperature on cyanobacteria was subordinated to both the light environment of the water column, which was on turn highly affected by water level conditions, and to nutrient concentrations. Monthly samplings evidenced that cyanobacterial assemblages presented a broad-scale temporal dynamics mostly reflecting inter-annual growth patterns driven by water level fluctuations. Both species composition and biovolume gradually changed across a gradient of resources and conditions and hence, the scenario in each individual lake was unique with patterns at different temporal and spatial scales. More than 35 filamentous and colonial morphospecies constituted the assemblages of Pampean lakes: nostocaleans and chroococcaleans were inversely correlated in the prevailing interannual 3cycled patterns.

To reveal the specific roles of these three major factors in changing the seasonal discharges of the whole Yangtze River, this paper analyzes daily discharges during 1961-2014 at 16 hydrological stations from the far upper reach (the Jinshajiang Reach) to the estuary. We found that precipitation has only homogenized in areas 427 km downstream of the TGR, contributing 9.5-23.6% to the homogenized discharges. Even though the TGR is the largest hydraulic works in the world, it only contributes 17.5-27.2% to the downstream homogenization of seasonal discharge. By comparison, dams in sub-regions are a major contributor (61.1-100%) in the homogenized reach either upper or lower to the TGR. Of all the sub-basins, dams in Hanjiang River basin have the most significant effect (16.9%) on changing the allocations of seasonal discharges to the sea, followed by Wujiang (11.5%), Jialingjiang (10.1%), Yalongjiang (9.4%), Qingjiang (8.4%), and Daduhe-Minjiang (4.7%) river basins.					yang, yunping/ACF-3066-2022; li, sixuan/KGR-3943-2024; ZHU, BOYUAN/B-3108-2014; Yan, Xia/KWU-4093-2024	chai, yuanfang/0000-0003-4781-0812; 													0029-1277	2224-7955				JUN	2020	51	3					470	483		10.2166/nh.2020.143	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/nh.2020.143													WOS:000540590800007

Water quality models still lack the capability to capture the connection between both environments. The hydrodynamic-ecological model CE-QUAL-W2 is being applied to a eutrophic drinking water reservoir on the Canadian Prairies as part of larger collaborative research project. CE-QUAL-W2 is one of the few water quality models that includes an ice algorithm, yet is restricted by a fixed albedo coefficient. Field studies have shown albedo to change through the ice cover season - varying the solar radiation that reaches the ice-water interface as a result. In order to better represent the light and heat environment during the under ice periods we modify the ice algorithm to incorporate a variable albedo rate. While assessing the modified version of CE-QUAL-W2 on the reservoir we encounter a number of challenges during the calibration process. These challenges pertain to difficulties with modelling the under ice environment, and with modelling shallow lakes and reservoirs. We recommend a targeted monitoring program to supplement available data that will reduce the uncertainty associated with the results of the reservoir model.

John			Seasonal and regional controls of phytoplankton production along a climate gradient in South-West Greenland during ice-cover and ice-free conditions	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Across a small geographic area (< 180 km), the region of South-West Greenland covers a natural climate gradient. Variation in temperature and precipitation result in marked differences in limnology at three discrete locations: ice sheet margin, inland, and the coast. Replicate lakes from each location were sampled for physical (temperature, light), chemical (dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, nutrients), and biological (chlorophyll a [Chl a], photosynthetic pigments) variables on three occasions within a 12-month period: July-August 2010, April-May 2011, and June-July 2011 spanning ice cover. Variation in ice phenology was linked to the climate gradient; however, phytoplankton production and community composition did not differ regionally. Large-scale seasonal fluctuations in temperature and nutrient availability were the strongest predictors of phytoplankton production, with a shift from nitrate to phosphorus controlled production between ice-cover and ice-free conditions. Underlying seasonal drivers, variables predicting production were unique to each location-ice sheet margin (soluble reactive phosphorus), inland (temperature), and coast (silicate)-and reflect local differences in nutrient availability. Results from the current study have important consequences when controls over phytoplankton production in Arctic lakes are inferred from a limited number of sites, but up-scaled to represent pan-Arctic trends.

J	Anic, I; Mikac, S				Anic, Igor; Mikac, Stjepan			STRUCTURE, TEXTURE AND REGENERATION OF DINARIC BEECH-FIR VIRGIN FOREST OF CORKOVA UVALA	SUMARSKI LIST												Not so very long ago (the end of the 19(th) century) a large part of the Dinaric Mountain range in Croatia was covered by beech-fir and beech virgin forests. These forests have since been gradually converted into natural managed forests (Prpic et al. 2001). Nevertheless, several Dinaric beech-fir virgin forests have remained until the present day, including Corkova Uvala, Devcica Tavani, Nadzak-Bilo, Pljesivicka Uvala, Javorov Kal and Stirovaca (Prpic et al. 2001, Vukelic and Tomljanovic 2001). Their total area amounts to 360 ha. The best investigated of these is Corkova Uvala. The first scientific forest research in this forest dates back to 1957. Its structure has since been analyzed on several occasions: in a permanent sample plot Of one hectare (Tikvic et al. 2006, 2004, Prpic and Seletkovic 1996, Prpic 1979, 1972), in 12 sample plots of 2,500 m(2) each, systematically placed in the form of a network at a distance of 250 m from each other (Kramaric and Iuculano 1989) and in 153 sample plots, each sized 200 M and systematically set up in the central part of the old growth stand in the form of a network 50 m from one another (Mayer et al. 1980). In addition, several inventories have also been conducted as part of the management program for the management unit of Corkova Uvala (1987), and the structure of a wider area of Corkova Uvala - Cudinka reserve has been analyzed (Cestar et al. 1983). Most of these investigations and inventories provide an average picture of the old growth stand structure. Apart from the results of Mayer et al. (1980), there have been no in-depth analyses of its structure and regeneration. More recently, research into natural regeneration in the old growth stand of Corkova Uvala has been intensified and initial results have been published (Rozenberger et al. 2007). This work presents the results of initial comparative research into the structure, texture and regeneration in the old growth stand of Corkova Uvala. This research was undertaken in the Dinaric beech-fir virgin forest of Corkova Uvala in Plitvice Lakes National Park in the period 2004-2005. The research involved a systematic sample of 68 plots of 805 m 2 each. The plots, set up in the form of a network, were placed 100 m from one another The activities in each plot included measuring the terrain slope, describing the relief assessing the canopy, identifying life stages of the virgin forest, measuring breast diameters on all trees (d(1.30) > 3 cm) and classifying them by tree species. Dead trees were recorded separately. A height sample was measured in the plots and in their immediate proximity. The young growth was measured in each plot over an area of 80 m(2) and classified by tree species and height. Research provided the condition of the structure, texture and regeneration in the old growth stand extending over 80.50 ha. The old growth stand is made up of 440 trees per hectare on average. Common beech and other hard-woods (OHW) account for almost half of the trees (49%). There are 45% of fir trees (Abies alba Mill) and 6% of common spruces (Picea abies Karst.). The total tree number declines with an increase in breast diameters. The coefficient (q) of tree distribution by breast diameter is 1.20. Stand volume is 671.23 m(2)/ha, of which fir accounts for 52%, broadleaves account for 42%, and the remaining 6% relates to spruce. 7.55% of the total volume is accumulated among thinner trees with breast diameters up to 30 cm. Trees with mean breast diameters between 31 and 50 cm contain 19.92% of the total stand volume. The remaining volume of 72.53% is accumulated on trees with breast diameters above 50 cm. Different developmental stages have been identified, albeit over small areas, allowing its to conclude that the stand profile has the selection form. The initial developmental stage was determined in 9% of the cases, the optimal stage in 18% of the cases, the terminal stage in 65% of the cases (ageing and decomposition), and the typical selection developmental stage in 8% of the cases. The late optimal stage and the ageing stage are the most common due to the depression-like relief of Corkova Uvala, which protects it from severe winds and allows mature and dead trees to remain standing for long periods. The decomposition stage occurs over small areas as a consequence of fall of singe trees or small groups of trees. In the area of the old growth stand the typical initial stage is relatively modest. It occurs in gaps but also under the canopy The typical selection stage was found in the smallest number of cases. It is the densest (548 trees/ha), with a volume of 434.70 m(3)/ha and the highest participation of the silver fir There are on average ten dead (dry and rotten) trees per one hectare of the old growth stand, of which seven are trees of silver fir The highest number of dead fir trees was recorded in the 11-20 cm diameter class. The total abundance of the young growth was found in the localities in which a transitional initial/selection developmental stage was recorded. These localities are the least represented. There are 6,190 seedlings on average per one hectare of the old growth stand. Fir accounts for 60%, beech for 28%, spruce for 2% and sycamore for 10% of the total number of the young growth. Two thirds of the seedlings are up to 50 cm tall. On average, a fir taller than 50 cm is found on every 12 m 2 of the area and one taller than 100 cm on every 30 m(2) of the area. Unlike beech and sycamore, no fir taller than 300 cm was found up to the taxation limit. Of the total number of the young growth up to 100 cm in height, beech accounts for 15%, spruce for 2% and sycamore for 9%. Beech and sycamore prevail in height classes above 100 cm. The young growth of spruce has a secondary role and occurs sporadically, reaching a height of up to 175 cm.

The seasonal variability in the quantity of inflowing water and their mixing in the lake controls the mobilization and precipitation of various elements. Seasonal sediment samples were collected from both the river and seawater influenced regions of the lake to understand the spatio-seasonal distributions of various elements along the salinity gradient. The major elements present in the sediments are mostly derived from the parent rock weathering in the source region and subsequently transported into the lake by the rivers. Seasonal variations in trace element concentrations are more prominent in the north-eastern part of the lake (i.e., low salinity region), and their higher concentrations have been observed during the post-rainy period. The affinity of the elements (Al, Fe, Mn, Li, V, Co, Cr, Cu, Th, and Zn) towards fine-grain sediments suggests that the size distribution pattern controls their accumulation, retention, and remobilization. The concentrations of Cr, Cu, and Pb exceeded the effects range low, and effects range median benchmarks indicating the potential biological risk in the low salinity region as compared to the high salinity region. The statistical analysis indicated that the concentrations of elements in the region proximal to the sea mouth are controlled by grain size and physicochemical condition of the lake water. In contrast, the element concentrations in the interior region are associated with anthropogenic activities and weathering processes. Continuous monitoring and assessment of element concentrations of the lake sediments can help to protect the lake ecology from the harmful element contaminations.

A general model of temporary aquatic habitat use: Water phenology as a life history filter	FISH AND FISHERIES												Temporary aquatic habitats are not widely appreciated fish habitat. However, fish navigate the transient waters of intertidal zones, floodplains, intermittent and ephemeral streams, lake margins, seasonally frozen lakes and streams, and anthropogenic aquatic habitats across the globe to access important resources. The selective pressures imposed by water impermanence (i.e., freezing, drying, tidal fluctuations), however, operate similarly across taxa and ecosystems. These similarities are formalized into a conceptual model relating habitat use to surface water phenology. Whereas all necessary life history functions (spawning, foraging, refuge, and dispersal) can be accomplished in temporary habitats, the timing, duration, and predictability of water act as a "life history filter" to which habitats can be used and for what purpose. Habitats wet from minutes to months may all be important-albeit in different ways, for different species. If life history needs co-occur with accessibility, temporary habitats can contribute substantially to individual fitness, overall production and important metapopulation processes. This heuristic is intended to promote research, recognition and conservation of these frequently overlooked habitats that can be disproportionately important relative to their size or brevity of existence. There is a pressing need to quantify how use of temporary aquatic habitats translates to individual fitness benefits, population size and temporal stability, and ecosystem-level consequences. Temporary aquatic habitats are being impacted at an alarming rate by anthropogenic activities altering their existence, phenology, and connectivity. It is timely that scientists, managers and policymakers consider the role these habitats play in global fish production.

Larger body size and earlier run timing increase alewife reproductive success in a whole lake experiment	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Environmental conditions can influence biological characteristics, such as phenology and body size, with important consequences for organismal fitness. Examining these fitness consequences under natural conditions through genetic pedigree reconstruction offers a lens into potential population responses to changing environments. Over 3 years (2013-2015), we introduced adult alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), anadromous, iteroparous clupeids, into one Massachusetts (USA) lake to complete the first detailed examination of this species' mating system and assess relationships among body size, reproductive timing, and seasonal reproductive success. We reconstructed pedigrees using 15 microsatellites and genotypes from all possible parents and samples of naturally produced offspring within 4 months of hatching. In each of the 3 study years, spawning adults had multiple mates and spawned multiple times. Larger females that arrived and were translocated earlier had higher reproductive success. Declining body size and altered migration timing, through an influence on reproductive success, can influence population vital rates and productivity over time.

However, upgradient groundwater processes and changing dynamics in N biogeochemistry at the groundwater-lake interface are complex. In this study, seasonal water-level variations in a groundwater flow-through lake altered discharge patterns of a wastewater-derived groundwater contaminant plume, thereby affecting biogeochemical processes controlling N transport. Pore water collected 15 cm under the lakebed along transects perpendicular to shore varied from oxic to anoxic with increasing nitrate concentrations (10-75 mu M) and corresponding gradients in nitrite and nitrous oxide. Pore water depth profiles of nitrate concentrations and stable isotopic compositions largely reflected upgradient groundwater N sources and N cycle processes, with minor additional nitrate reduction in the near-surface lakebed sediments. Potential denitrification rates determined in laboratory microcosms were 10-100 times higher in near-surface sediments (0-5 cm) than in deeper sediments (5-30 cm) and were correlated with sediment carbon content and abundance of denitrification genes (nirS, nosZI, and nosZII). Potential anammox-driven N-2 production was detectable in deeper anoxic sediments. Injection of bromide and nitrite in the lake sediments showed that the highest net nitrite consumption rates were within the top 10 cm. However, short transit times owing to rapid upward pore water velocities (4-5 cm hr(-1)) limited removal of the contaminant nitrate transiting through the sediments. Results demonstrate that local hydrologic and biogeochemical processes at the point of discharge affect the distribution and discharge rate of N through lakebed sediments, but processes in the upgradient groundwater can be more important for affecting N speciation and concentration.					; Smith, Richard/A-6733-2008	Kent, Douglas/0000-0003-3758-8322; Stoliker, Deborah/0000-0002-7956-2975; Song, Bongkeun/0000-0002-6645-7025; LeBlanc, Denis/0000-0002-4646-2628; Bohlke, John Karl/0000-0001-5693-6455; McCobb, Timothy/0000-0003-1533-847X; Smith, Richard/0000-0002-3829-0125													2169-8953	2169-8961				JUL	2019	124	7					2186	2207		10.1029/2018JG004635	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JG004635													WOS:000481443800027

The watershed regularly experiences snowfall from three distinctive weather patterns: coastal mid-latitude cyclones, overrunning systems, and lake-effect or Great Lakes enhanced storms. Using synoptic weather classification techniques, these distinct regional atmospheric patterns impacting the watershed are isolated and analysed in conjunction with daily snowfall observations from 1960 to 2009 to allow the influence of each synoptic weather pattern on snowfall to be evaluated independently. Results indicate that snowfall-producing events occur on average approximately 63 days/year, or once every 4 days during the October-May season, leading to an average of 213 cm/year of snowfall within the watershed. Snowfall from Great Lakes enhanced storms and overrunning systems contribute nearly equally to seasonal totals, representing 38 and 39%, respectively. Coastal mid-latitude cyclones, while producing the highest amount of snowfall per event on average, contribute only 16% to the watershed average total snowfall. Predicted climate change is expected to impact snowfall differently depending on the specific atmospheric pattern producing the snow. As such, quantifying the contribution of snowfall to the watershed by synoptic pattern can inform future water management and reservoir operation practices for the New York City Water Supply Management System.

Subglacial hydrology at Rink Isbrae, West Greenland inferred from sediment plume appearance	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY					International Symposium on Hydrology of Glaciers and Ice Sheets	JUN, 2015	Hofn, ICELAND	Univ Iceland, Univ Iceland, Inst Earth Sci, Iceland Meteorol Off, Natl Power Co Iceland, Iceland Road & Coastal Adm, Iceland Glaciol Soc, Geoscience Soc Iceland				Marine-terminating outlet glaciers discharge most of the Greenland ice sheet's mass through frontal ablation and meltwater runoff. While calving can be estimated by in situ and remote sensing observations, submarine melting and subglacial meltwater transport are more challenging to quantify. Here we investigate the subglacial hydrology of Rink Isbrae, a fast-flowing West Greenland tidewater glacier, using time-lapse photography, modeled runoff estimates and daily satellite imagery from 2007 to 2011. We find that sediment plumes appear episodically at four distinct locations across the terminus, and last between 2 h and 17 d. This suggests short-term variability in discharge and the existence of persistent pathways. The seasonal onset of sediment plumes occurs before supraglacial lake drainages, shortly after the onset of runoff, and only after the wintertime ice melange has begun disintegrating. Plumes were also visible after the cessation of runoff (23 +/- 5 d), which is indicative of subglacial storage. The lack of either a seasonal velocity change or a correspondence between meltwater availability and plume occurrence suggests that the subglacial system persists in a state of inefficient drainage. Subglacial hydrology at tidewater glaciers is of critical importance in understanding dynamics at the ice front.

The use of property-scale portable X-ray fluorescence data in gold exploration: advantages and limitations	GEOCHEMISTRY-EXPLORATION ENVIRONMENT ANALYSIS												This study examines field portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) data for unsieved B-and C-horizon soil samples from two contrasting Au exploration programs in northern Canada and compares them to laboratory results from sieved samples to determine if a minimalist approach to sample preparation, equipment calibration and analysis produces results that are adequate for exploration purposes. The collection of 14 651 residual soil samples on detailed grids at the Whiskey Au project in the Black Hills of the Yukon Territory, Canada during the 2011 field season allows a comparison of pXRF data from unsieved samples with inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) data from the <100-mu m grain size fraction digested in aqua regia. XRF data were generated on two devices: an Innov-X Delta handheld and a Niton FXL desk-top unit. Data for selected elements from the pXRF units show trends in gridded percentile plots comparable to the ICP-MS data, although the continuity of these trends reflects the degree to which the pathfinder element concentrations exceed the lower orders of detection. Acceptable merged gridded images for As and Cu from the two devices were generated without data levelling, whereas the Pb, Mo and Ni data require leveling prior to gridding in order to provide a reasonable fit to the laboratory data. Data for elements that occur in concentrations close to the lower limit of detection by pXRF, such as Sb, may provide some useful information but must be used with caution. Data for Fe also show a poor correlation, possibly due to heterogeneity of Fe in the samples, as well as due to incomplete digestion of all Fe-bearing minerals in some samples using an aqua regia digestion. A total of 680 till samples collected from regional and detailed sampling grids on the Kiyuk Lake Au property in southern Nunavut, Canada during the 2012 field season were analysed by pXRF and also by ICP-MS following an aqua regia digestion. pXRF data were generated on an Innov-X Delta using unsieved samples for comparison with ICP-MS data from the <70-mu m grain size fraction. The pathfinder element As shows good agreement with the laboratory data, whereas Ni, Mo and Sb data give poor matches due to proximity of the data to the lower orders of detection by pXRF. The use of pXRF data on soil samples with no sample preparation other than drying and no instrument calibration is a robust approach for Au exploration using particular elements, such As and Cu, provided the data are monitored for consistency. Even greater compatibility between pXRF and laboratory data would be expected where sample preparation and site-specific calibrations are implemented. Other pathfinder elements for Au, including W, Sb, Bi, Ag and Te, as well as Au itself, typically occur at levels in soil either close to or below the lower order of detection of the current generation of field-portable analytical devices. The use of pXRF in Au exploration allows for quick decision-making and provides near-real time sampling guidance in the field where 'fit for purpose' data for suitable pathfinder and lithologically-controlled elements can be obtained.																			1467-7873	2041-4943				AUG	2014	14	3					233	244		10.1144/geochem2013-233	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/geochem2013-233													WOS:000339383300004

We investigated the abundance, species composition, and seasonal patterns of seed and bud banks in two dominant macrophyte communities, Carex and Miscanthus, in the Dongting Lake wetlands. The seed densities of both communities were lower from November (after flooding) to March and increased dramatically before flooding (in May). The bud densities of the two dominant communities peaked in the coldest month of the year (January), decreased markedly in March, and were the lowest before flooding. The seed banks of the two macrophyte communities were mainly composed of annual species and a few perennial species, whereas the bud banks were composed of only dominant perennials. Furthermore, the perennial species present in bud banks did not occur in seed banks. Among the soil variables, the bud densities of both plant communities were negatively associated with soil bulk density, whereas the seed density of the Miscanthus community was positively associated with soil bulk density. Our results suggest that seed and bud banks are complementary in the potential recruitment of macrophyte communities; that is, bud banks regulate the demography of dominant perennials, and seed banks contribute to the recruitment and dispersal of annual species. Given the high abundance of annuals and near absence of the most dominant perennials in the seed bank, the bud banks of dominant perennial species should be more widely used in wetland restoration and management.

Cassini Radar Team	Cassini SAR, radiometry, scatterometry and altimetry observations of Titan's dune fields	ICARUS												Large expanses of linear dunes cover Titan's equatorial regions. As the Cassini mission continues, more dune fields are becoming unveiled and examined by the microwave radar in all its modes of operation (SAR, radiometry, scatterometry, altimetry) and with an increasing variety of observational geometries. In this paper, we report on Cassini's radar instrument observations of the dune fields mapped through May 2009 and present our key findings in terms of Titan's geology and climate. We estimate that dune fields cover similar to 12.5% of Titan's surface, which corresponds to an area of similar to 10 million km(2), roughly the area of the United States. If dune sand-sized particles are mainly composed of solid organics as suggested by VIMS observations (Cassini Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer) and atmospheric modeling and supported by radiometry data, dune fields are the largest known organic reservoir on Titan. Dune regions are, with the exception of the polar lakes and seas, the least reflective and most emissive features on this moon. Interestingly, we also find a latitudinal dependence in the dune field microwave properties: up to a latitude of similar to 11 degrees, dune fields tend to become less emissive and brighter as one moves northward. Above similar to 11 degrees this trend is reversed. The microwave signatures of the dune regions are thought to be primarily controlled by the interdune proportion (relative to that of the dune), roughness and degree of sand cover. In agreement with radiometry and scatterometry observations, SAR images suggest that the fraction of interdunes increases northward up to a latitude of similar to 14 degrees. In general, scattering from the subsurface (volume scattering and surface scattering from buried interfaces) makes interdunal regions brighter than the dunes. The observed latitudinal trend may therefore also be partially caused by a gradual thinning of the interdunal sand cover or surrounding sand sheets to the north, thus allowing wave penetration in the underlying substrate. Altimetry measurements over dunes have highlighted a region located in the Fensal dune field (similar to 5 degrees latitude) where the icy bedrock of Titan is likely exposed within smooth interdune areas. The hemispherical assymetry of dune field properties may point to a general reduction in the availability of sediments and/or an increase in the ground humidity toward the north, which could be related to Titan's asymmetric seasonal polar insolation. Alternatively, it may indicate that either the wind pattern or the topography is less favorable for dune formation in Titan's northern tropics. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In addition to environmental factors, physiological characteristics are also crucial for benthic recruitment of Microcystis, although the exact details remain poorly understood. In the present study, we studied the involvement of physiological characteristics in benthic recruitment from three aspects: photosynthetic activity, colony size and intracellular microcystin (MC) content. After UV irradiation the Microcystis cells were damaged and in poor physiological state. Normal benthic Microcystis (NBM) exhibited higher recruitment than damaged benthic Microcystis (DBM). This might be explained by the difference in photosynthetic activity. Small benthic colonies (20-60 mu m) could reinvade the water column from sediments more easily than large colonies. Furthermore, poor physiological state was correlated with lower survival of large colonies (140-220 mu m) which might decompose into smaller colonies (40-80 mu m). Toxic Microcystis not only survived more easily than non-toxic ones in sediments but also recruited more readily into the water column from sediments. This might be due to the presence of intracellular MCs. During the benthic phase, toxic Microcystis might consume or release intracellular MCs to acclimate to benthic environment. We also found that sediment mixing in the form of passive suspension facilitated recruitment, but physiological characteristics, an active process, played a more decisive role. This knowledge on the physiological characteristics of Microcystis expands our understanding of benthic recruitment.					; Wu, Xingqiang/AFA-5107-2022; Wang, Zhi/W-5911-2019	?, ??/0000-0003-0341-288X; 													0921-8971	1573-5176				FEB	2019	31	1					223	233		10.1007/s10811-018-1508-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-018-1508-0													WOS:000458698200021

Regional and seasonal variability in planktonic photosynthesis and planktonic community respiration in Amazon floodplain lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Results from two regional surveys and multi-lake seasonal studies were used to investigate the variability of phytoplankton photosynthesis and planktonic community respiration in central Amazon floodplain lakes. Hypothesized effects of optical and chemical variables on planktonic photosynthesis and respiration were examined statistically. Changes in dissolved oxygen in light and dark bottles distributed along light-gradients in a shipboard incubator or in situ were used to calculate volumetric community respiration (R (c)), volumetric gross photosynthesis (P), daily integral gross photosynthesis (I ), and daily integral community respiration rates (I >). I varied significantly among all lakes with source-water river stage and source-water river type. I > also varied significantly with source-water river stage. Variation in maximum depth linked to source-water river stage was a key factor controlling seasonal variations in I through its influence on total suspended solids and total phosphorus concentrations which affected light extinction and light-saturated photosynthesis, respectively. The predominance of sub-saturated dissolved O-2 in the pelagic surface waters of Amazon floodplain lakes was attributed to high integral R (c):P ratios, indicating the existence of large sustained inputs of non-phytoplankton organic carbon to these environments.					forsberg, bruce/AAE-4092-2020														0018-8158	1573-5117				OCT	2017	800	1					187	206		10.1007/s10750-017-3222-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-017-3222-3													WOS:000406385800014

Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily snow products, the lake ice phenology of 23 lakes in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China from 2001 to 2018 was extracted based on thresholds of ice/water pixel numbers, and their change trends over 18 years were calculated. The results of MODIS-derived lake ice phenology showed consistent variations with existing ice phenology data sets derived from passive microwave data. Generally, lakes in Xinjiang begin to freeze from October to December every year, and their ice cover periods end from March to June. The average ice cover duration for the 23 lakes is 167 days, of which 16 lakes have an average shortening rate of - 1.08 days/year and seven lakes have an average extending rate of 1.18 days/year. The majority of lakes experienced later freeze-up (17 lakes) and earlier break-up (18 lakes) from 2001 to 2018. Lake ice phenology is affected by both climatic factors and lake physicochemical characteristics, in which freeze-up dates are more easily affected by lake-specific factors such as lake area (r = 0.535), while climatic factors especially water surface temperature have greater impacts on lake break-up dates (r = - 0.874). Compared to air temperature, water surface temperature changes have a more direct influence on the variations in lake ice phenology, 1 degrees increase in water surface temperature may cause the ice cover duration to decrease by 12 days, while precipitation changes have almost no effect on the lakes in Xinjiang. In some cases, lake changes such as changes to the area and mineralization may also have dominant impacts on lake ice phenology.

COMPOSITIONAL SIMILARITIES AND DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN TITAN'S EVAPORITIC TERRAINS	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL												We document the similarities in composition between the equatorial basins Tui Regio, Hotei Regio, and other 5-mu m-bright materials, notably the north polar evaporites, by investigating the presence and extent of an absorption feature at 4.92 mu m. In most observations, Woytchugga Lacuna, Ontario Lacus, MacKay Lacus, deposits near Fensal, some of the lakes and dry lake beds south of Ligeia, and the southern shores of Kraken Mare share the absorption feature at 4.92 mu m observed in the spectra of Tui and Hotei. Besides Woytchugga and at Fensal, these 5-mu m- bright deposits are geomorphologically substantiated evaporites. Thus, the similarity in composition strengthens the hypothesis that Tui and Hotei once contained liquid. Other evaporite deposits, however, do not show the 4.92 mu m absorption, notably Muggel Lacus and the shores of Ligeia Mare at the north pole. This difference in composition suggests that there is more than one kind of soluble material in Titan's lakes that can create evaporite and/or that the surface properties at the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer wavelength scale are not uniform between the different deposits (crystal size, abundance, etc.). Our results indicate that the surface structure, composition, and formation history of Titan's evaporites may be at least as dynamic and complex as their Earth counterparts.

J	Liang, K; Li, YZ				Liang, Kang; Li, Yanzhong			Changes in Lake Area in Response to Climatic Forcing in the Endorheic Hongjian Lake Basin, China	REMOTE SENSING												Endorheic lakes are key components of the water cycle and the ecological system in endorheic basins. The endorheic Hongjian Lake wetland is China's national nature reserve for protecting the vulnerable species of Relict Gull. The Hongjian Lake, once China's largest desert freshwater lake, has been suffering from severe shrinkage in the last two decades, yet the variations in the lake area and its responses to climate change are poorly understood due to a lack of in situ observations. In this study, using Landsat remote sensing images, the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index, and nonparametric tests, we obtained the Hongjian Lake area changes on the annual, seasonal, and quasi-monthly scales during 1988-2014, analyzed the corresponding variations of the six climatic factors in the Hongjian Lake Basin (HJLB) using satellite-based products, and investigated the multi-scale response characteristics of lake area to climatic forcing using correlation analysis. The results showed that the lake area decreased during 1988-2014, and this process can be divided into two sub-stages, namely the first slight increasing sub-phase in 1988-1999 and the second significant declining sub-phase in 2000-2014. The shifts in patterns of the seasonal cycle had three types: as the natural rhythm of the lake changes has been broken by intensive human activities since the late 1990s, the natural bimodal type I has obviously changed into non-natural bimodal type II and unimodal type III, featured by a declining peak in July-September. The climatic wet/dry regime on multi-scales during 1988-2014 in the HJLB was generally warming and drying, mainly reflected by the increase in temperature (T), arid index (AI) and evaporation (ET0, ETa), and the decrease in the precipitation (Pre) and actual water difference (AWD). There were large differences in the climatic factors at different time scales, especially in the wet and dry seasons. When the lagged effect, the cumulative effect, and the lagged and cumulative combined effect were gradually considered, the correlation coefficient significantly increased, and the direction of the correlation coefficient became coincident with common sense. The correlation analysis identified a lag period of approximately 1-3 years on an annual scale, and a lag period of approximately 1-3 months on a monthly scale. This study could provide a certain scientific reference for climate change detection, water resource management, and species habitat protection in the HJLB and similar endorheic basins or inland arid regions.					; Kang, liang/C-4169-2013	yanzhong, li/0000-0003-0154-386X; 														2072-4292				DEC 2	2019	11	24							3046	10.3390/rs11243046	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11243046													WOS:000507333400160

On-farm field experiments were conducted for two seasons in the Mt Elgon High Farmlands and Lake Victoria Crescent agro-ecological zones in Uganda to determine the potential of biofertilizers, specifically arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), to increase sweet potato yields (NASPOT 11 cultivar). Two kinds of biofertilizers were compared to different rates of phosphorus (P) fertilizer when applied with or without nitrogen (N) and potassium (K). The sweet potato response to treatments was variable across sites (soil types) and seasons, and significant tuber yield increase (p < 0.05) was promoted by biofertilizer and NPK treatments during the short-rain season in the Ferralsol. Tuber yields ranged from 12.8 to 20.1 t ha(-1) in the Rhodic Nitisol (sandy-clay) compared to 7.6 to 14.9 t ha(-1) in the Ferralsol (sandy-loam) during the same season. Root colonization was greater in the short-rain season compared to the long-rain season. Biofertilizers combined with N and K realized higher biomass and tuber yield than biofertilizers alone during the short-rain season indicating the need for starter nutrients for hyphal growth and root colonization of AMF. In this study, N0.25PK (34.6 t ha(-1)) and N0.5PK (32.9 t ha(-1)) resulted in the highest yield during the long and the short-rain season, respectively, but there was still a yield gap of 11.9 and 13.6 t ha(-1) for the cultivar. Therefore, a combination of 90 kg N ha(-1) and 100 kg K ha(-1) with either 15 or 30 kg P ha(-1) can increase sweet potato yield from 4.5 to > 30 t ha(-1). The results also show that to realize significance of AMF in nutrient depleted soils, starter nutrients should be included.					; AbdelGadir, AbdelAziz/AAH-3929-2020; Mukhongo, Ruth/JRW-6477-2023	Ebanyat, Peter/0000-0002-5873-2453; AbdelGadir, AbdelAziz Hamid/0000-0003-1373-1681; Tumuhairwe, John Baptist/0000-0001-9766-9170; 													1664-462X					MAR 13	2017	8								219	10.3389/fpls.2017.00219	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2017.00219								28348569					WOS:000396081600001
J	Ali, SA; Sridhar, V				Ali, Syed A.; Sridhar, Venkataramana			Deriving the Reservoir Conditions for Better Water Resource Management Using Satellite-Based Earth Observations in the Lower Mekong River Basin	REMOTE SENSING												The Mekong River basin supported a large population and ecosystem with abundant water and nutrient supply. However, the impoundments in the river can substantially alter the flow downstream and its timing. Using limited observations, this study demonstrated an approach to derive dam characteristics, including storage and flow rate, from remote-sensing-based data. Global Reservoir and Lake Monitor (GRLM), River-Lake Hydrology (RLH), and ICESat-GLAS, which generated altimetry from Jason series and inundation areas from Landsat 8, were used to estimate the reservoir surface area and change in storage over time. The inflow simulated by the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model from 2008 to 2016 and the reservoir storage change were used in the mass balance equation to calculate outflows for three dams in the basin. Estimated reservoir total storage closely resembled the observed data, with a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency and coefficient of determination more than 0.90 and 0.95, respectively. An average decrease of 55% in outflows was estimated during the wet season and an increase of up to 94% in the dry season for the Lam Pao. The estimated decrease in outflows during the wet season was 70% and 60% for Sirindhorn and Ubol Ratana, respectively, along with a 36% increase in the dry season for Sirindhorn. Basin-wide demand for evapotranspiration, about 935 mm, implicitly matched with the annual water diversion from 1000 to 2300 million m(3). From the storage-discharge rating curves, minimum storage was also evident in the monsoon season (June-July), and it reached the highest in November. This study demonstrated the utility of remote sensing products to assess the impacts of dams on flows in the Mekong River basin.					; Sridhar, V/AAT-6676-2020; Ali, Syed/LZH-4165-2025	Ali, Syed/0000-0003-4278-167X; Sridhar, Venkataramana/0000-0002-1003-2247														2072-4292				DEC 1	2019	11	23							2872	10.3390/rs11232872	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11232872													WOS:000508382100153

This warming could further stimulate methane (CH4) emissions from northern wetlands and enhance the greenhouse impact of this region. Arctic wetlands are extremely heterogeneous in terms of geochemistry, vegetation, microtopography, and hydrology, and therefore CH4 fluxes can differ dramatically within the metre scale. Eddy covariance (EC) is one of the most useful methods for estimating CH4 fluxes in remote areas over long periods of time. However, when the areas sampled by these EC towers (i.e. tower footprints) are by definition very heterogeneous, due to encompassing a variety of environmental conditions and vegetation types, modelling environmental controls of CH4 emissions becomes even more challenging, confounding efforts to reduce uncertainty in baseline CH4 emissions from these landscapes. In this study, we evaluated the effect of footprint variability on CH4 fluxes from two EC towers located in wetlands on the North Slope of Alaska. The local domain of each of these sites contains well developed polygonal tundra as well as a drained thermokarst lake basin. We found that the spatiotemporal variability of the footprint, has a significant influence on the observed CH4 fluxes, contributing between 3% and 33% of the variance, depending on site, time period, and modelling method. Multiple indices were used to define spatial heterogeneity, and their explanatory power varied depending on site and season. Overall, the normalised difference water index had the most consistent explanatory power on CH4 fluxes, though generally only when used in concert with at least one other spatial index. The spatial bias (defined here as the difference between the mean for the 0.36 km(2) domain around the tower and the footprint-weighted mean) was between vertical bar 51 vertical bar% and vertical bar 18 vertical bar% depending on the index. This study highlights the need for footprint modelling to infer the representativeness of the carbon fluxes measured by EC towers in these highly heterogeneous tundra ecosystems, and the need to evaluate spatial variability when upscaling EC site-level data to a larger domain.					; Oechel, Walter/F-9361-2010; Levy, Peter/K-6523-2012; Oechel, Walter/M-1347-2019; Zona, Donatella/G-4039-2010	Reuss-Schmidt, Kassandra/0000-0002-8382-5547; Oechel, Walter/0000-0002-3504-026X; Zona, Donatella/0000-0002-0003-4839													1748-9326					DEC	2019	14	12							125010	10.1088/1748-9326/ab4d32	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab4d32													WOS:000514834300006
J	Gilhooly, WP; Reinhard, CT; Lyons, TW				Gilhooly, William P., III; Reinhard, Christopher T.; Lyons, Timothy W.			A comprehensive sulfur and oxygen isotope study of sulfur cycling in a shallow, hyper-euxinic meromictic lake	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Mahoney Lake is a permanently anoxic and sulfidic (euxinic) lake that has a dense plate of purple sulfur bacteria positioned at mid-water depth (similar to 7 m) where free sulfide intercepts the photic zone. We analyzed the isotopic composition of sulfate (delta S-34(SO4) and delta O-18(SO4)), sulfide (delta S-34(H2S)), and the water (delta O-18(H2O)) to track the potentially coupled processes of dissimilatory sulfate reduction and phototrophic sulfide oxidation within an aquatic environment with extremely high sulfide concentrations (> 30 mM). Large isotopic offsets observed between sulfate and sulfide within the monimolimnion (delta S-34(SO4-H2S) = 51 parts per thousand) and within pore waters along the oxic margin (delta S-34(SO4-H2S) > 50 parts per thousand) are consistent with sulfate reduction in both the sediments and the anoxic water column. Given the high sulfide concentrations of the lake, sulfur disproportionation is likely inoperable or limited to a very narrow zone in the chemocline, and therefore the large instantaneous fractionations are best explained by the microbial process of sulfate reduction. Pyrite extracted from the sediments reflects the isotopic composition of water column sulfide, suggesting that pyrite buried in the euxinic depocenter of the lake formed in the water column. The offset between sulfate and dissolved sulfide decreases at the chemocline (delta S-34(SO4-H2S) = 37 parts per thousand), a trend possibly explained by elevated sulfate reduction rates and inconsistent with appreciable disproportionation within this interval. Water column sulfate exhibits a linear response in delta O-18(SO4)-delta S-34(SO4) and the slope of this relationship suggests relatively high sulfate reduction rates that appear to respond to seasonal changes in the productivity of purple sulfur bacteria. Although photosynthetic activity within the microbial plate influences the delta O-18(SO4)-delta S-34(SO4) relationship, the biosignature for photosynthetic sulfur bacteria is restricted to the oxic/anoxic transition zone and is apparently minor relative to the more prevalent process of sulfate reduction operative throughout the light-deprived deeper anoxic water column and sediment pore waters.

This study was conducted to investigate climate change and its impact on the hydrological processes of the Baro-Akobo River basin in Ethiopia. Five bias-corrected regional climate models and their ensemble were developed to examine future climate changes in the 2030s (2021-2050) and 2080s (2071-2100) periods under the two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios compared to a baseline (1981-2010) period. The calibrated model performed well with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency and coefficient of determination of each 0.73 for daily and 0.89 and 0.9 for monthly simulation, respectively. Though all RCMs agree concerning the increasing direction of the 2030 and 2080s maximum and minimum temperature changes, there is inconsistency in the magnitude and direction of monthly projected rainfall changes. With the ensemble, the maximum and minimum temperatures will increase by 2.6 and 3.6 ?, respectively, and rainfall will decrease by 5% in the 2080s under RCP8.5 scenarios. The dry and wet season rainfall are expected to decrease by 19 and 3.7% under the RCP8.5 scenarios in the 2080s. Consequently, future climate change could cause a decrease in the annual surface runoff and water yield, while evapotranspiration could increase under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. This study provides useful insights about potential climate change impacts on the hydrology of the basin, which could be useful to inform decision-makers in developing strategies such as water harvesting to mitigate the impact of climate change.					; Bayabil, Haimanote/M-8241-2019; Woldesenbet, Tekalegn/I-6352-2019	Bayabil, Haimanote/0000-0003-3480-3154; 													1895-6572	1895-7455				AUG	2023	71	4					1915	1935		10.1007/s11600-022-00956-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11600-022-00956-8		NOV 2022											WOS:000912912000001

For seasonal wetlands that are a major source of water for rice and fish production, this physical understanding is key to planning for water-food security and ecosystem services. This study quantified variations in volumetric storage for the numerous seasonal wetlands of northeastern Bangladesh, locally known as "haors." These haors receive transboundary runoff from densely vegetated and mountainous terrain in India and face persistent monsoonal cloud cover as they become full. We estimated volumetric storage for 13 haors by using extensive remote sensing data on water surface extent and elevation that was complemented with citizen-contributed gauge data. Assuming a trapezoidal bathymetry, an area-volume relationship was developed for selected haors. This relationship was assumed to be valid for extrapolating volumetric estimations over all the haors in the region. Results suggested that as haors get filled with the onset of monsoon rains, total estimated storage relative to the lowest observable level varied from 6.5 (+/- 0.4) km(3) in May to 30.9 (+/- 2.0) km(3) in July (peak of monsoon). Choosing a rectangular bathymetry can lead to 47% higher estimates compared to trapezoidal cross section. Estimating this intra-annual/interannual increase in storage is important for the region to plan water management policies that balance the human and ecosystem needs. Our analytical approach has potential for application to wetlands worldwide in light of the upcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission.					; Haque, Md.

Numerous classification techniques, including morpho-functional approaches, have been developed. This study examined changes in phytoplankton assemblages and water quality, which were sampled quarterly from July 2018 to April 2019. The purpose was to contrast the applicability of three classification approaches (functional, morpho-functional and morphological-based functional groupings) for understanding the spatial and seasonal distribution of the biomass variance in phytoplankton functional groups and their driving environmental factors in the ecological zones of the Shanxi Reservoir through multivariate analysis. The results showed that the phytoplankton biomass was highest in the watercourse zone and lowest in the transition zone. Furthermore, the Shanxi Reservoir was characterized by several cyanobacteria (Microcystis spp.) and numerous bacillariophytes (Asterionella sp., Navicula spp. and Aulacoseira granulata). After evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of morpho-functional classifications, we determined that water temperature appeared to be an essential factor, and the morphology-based functional group approach provided the best results for demonstrating phytoplankton succession, despite having lower sensitivity than the others. Nevertheless, these approaches are all appropriate for identifying and monitoring phytoplankton community structure in aquatic systems of reservoirs with complex terrains.

J	Williams, K; Chamberlain, J; Buontempo, C; Bain, C				Williams, Karina; Chamberlain, Jill; Buontempo, Carlo; Bain, Caroline			Regional climate model performance in the Lake Victoria basin	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Lake Victoria, the second largest freshwater lake in the world, plays a crucial role in the hydrology of equatorial eastern Africa. Understanding how climate change may alter rainfall and evaporation patterns is thus of vital importance for the economic development and the livelihood of the region. Regional rainfall distribution appears, up to a large extent, to be controlled by local drivers which may be not well resolved in general circulation model simulations. We investigate the performance over the Lake Victoria basin of an ensemble of UK Met Office Hadley Centre regional climate model (HadRM3P) simulations at 50 km, driven by five members of the Hadley Centre global perturbed-physics ensemble (QUMP). This is part of the validation of an ensemble of simulations that has been used to assess the impacts of climate change over the continent over the period 1950-2099. We find that the regional climate model is able to simulate a lake/land breeze over Lake Victoria, which is a significant improvement over the driving global climate model and a vital step towards reproducing precipitation characteristics in the region. The local precipitation correlates well with large-scale processes in the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean, which is in agreement with observations. We find that the spatial pattern of precipitation in the region and the diurnal cycle of convection is well represented although the amount of rainfall over the lake appears to be overestimated in most seasons. Reducing the observational uncertainty in precipitation over the lake through future field campaigns would enable this model bias to be better quantified. We conclude that increasing the spatial resolution of the model significantly improves its ability to simulate the current climate of the Lake Victoria basin. We suggest that, despite the higher computational costs, the inclusion of a model which allows two-way interactions between the lake and its surroundings should be seriously considered for any new climate projections for the region.					; Buontempo, Carlo/GLQ-7538-2022	Buontempo, Carlo/0000-0002-1874-5380; Williams, Karina/0000-0002-1185-535X; Bain, Caroline/0000-0002-2993-9308; 													0930-7575	1432-0894				MAR	2015	44	5-6					1699	1713		10.1007/s00382-014-2201-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-014-2201-x													WOS:000350364500031

We discuss the results of a cooperative effort between the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission (GLIFWC) and USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis Program (FIA). At the urging of member tribes, GLIFWC staff worked with tribal gatherers to document TEK regarding desired characteristics of birch bark for traditional uses and translated this into an inventory field guide. The guide was provided to FIA, which incorporated the methods into its field manual and trained inventory crews in implementation of the protocol.

A new empirical procedure for estimating intra-annual heat storage changes in lakes and reservoirs: Review and analysis of 22 lakes	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Evaporation is an important component of the water and energy balance of lakes and reservoirs. The energy balance combination method for estimating evaporation requires the heat storage changes (Q(t)) to be known. The lack of data on water temperature profiles and water depth fluctuations hinders routine computations of Q. Following successful estimation of the soil heat flux density of land surfaces (G) and heat storage change of urban areas and wetlands from net all wave radiation (Rn), we investigated in this paper whether a similar generic Q(t)(Rn) empirical relationship can be developed for lakes and reservoirs. A comprehensive literature survey was conducted and experimental datasets for 22 lakes with different characteristics were collected. A linear Q(t)(Rn) model with a hysteresis function to describe seasonal warming and cooling effects was developed (Q(t) = a * Rn + b + c * dRn/dt) that fits the 22 independently gathered datasets satisfactory (R-2 of 0.83 and RMSE of 22 W m(-2)) for bi-weekly and monthly time scales. Predictive models for the coefficients a, b and c were also developed, using Rn and water surface temperature measurements that can be retrieved from routine earth observation measurements. The average R2 between measured and modeled Q(t) was 0.84 and the RMSE was 37 W m(-2) if predictive models were used for the assessment of lake specific Q(t)(Rn) functions. Two independent satellite-derived products were explored: the ARC-Lake (ATSR Reprocessing for Climate) product for water surface temperature using the ATSR (Along Track Scanning Radiometer) series data, and the CM SAP (Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring) product for solar radiation Rs based on the AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) data. The proposed procedure using purely satellite-derived data as inputs resulted in comparably good Q(t) estimates as those using in-situ measurements. The new Q(t) hysteresis model can thus be applied together with satellite measurements for supporting the computation of evaporation from open water bodies based on energy balance equations.

Steady-state solutions for subsurface chlorophyll maximum in stratified water columns with a bell-shaped vertical profile of chlorophyll	BIOGEOSCIENCES												A bell-shaped vertical profile of chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration, conventionally referred to as a subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM) phenomenon, has frequently been observed in stratified oceans and lakes. This profile is assumed to be a general Gaussian distribution in this study. By substituting the general Gaussian function into ecosystem dynamical equations, the steady-state solutions for SCM characteristics (i.e., SCM layer depth, thickness, and intensity) in various scenarios are derived. These solutions indicate that (1) the maximum concentration of Chl a occurs at or below the depth of maximum growth rates of phytoplankton located at the transition from nutrient limitation to light limitation, and the depth of SCM layer deepens logarithmically with an increase in surface light intensity; (2) thickness and intensity of the SCM layer are mainly affected by nutrient supply, but independent of surface light intensity; and (3) intensity of the SCM layer is proportional to the diffusive flux of nutrients from below, which becomes stronger as a result of this layer being shrunk by a higher light attenuation coefficient or a larger sinking velocity of phytoplankton. In addition, the limitation and potential application of the analytical solutions are also presented.

J	Möller, P; Alexanderson, H; Funder, S; Hjort, C				Moeller, Per; Alexanderson, Helena; Funder, Svend; Hjort, Christian			The Taimyr Peninsula and the Severnaya Zemlya archipelago, Arctic Russia: a synthesis of glacial history and palaeo-environmental change during the Last Glacial cycle (MIS 5e-2)	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We here suggest a glacial and climate history of the Taimyr Peninsula and Severnaya Zemlya archipelago in arctic Siberia for the last about 150 000 years (ka). Primarily it is based on results from seven field seasons between 1996 and 2012, to a large extent already published in papers referred to in the text and on data presented by Russian workers from the 1930s to our days and by German colleagues working there since the 1990s. Although glaciations even up here often started in the local mountains, their culminations in this region invariably seems to have centred on the shallow Kara Sea continental shelf - most likely due to expanding marine ice-shelves grounding there, as a combined effect of thickening ice and eustatically lowered sea-levels. The most extensive glaciation so far identified in this region (named the Taz glaciation) took place during Marine Isotope Stage 6 (MIS 6), i.e. being an equivalent to the late Saale/Illinoian glaciations. It reached c. 400 km southeast of the Kara Sea coast, across and well beyond the Byrranga Mountain range and ended c. 130 ka. It was followed by the MIS 5e (Karginsky/Eemian) interglacial, with an extensive marine transgression to 140 m above present sea level - facilitated by strong isostatic downloading during the preceding glaciation. During the latest (Zyryankan/Weichselian/Wisconsinan) glacial cycle followed a series of major glacial advances. The earliest and most extensive, culminating C. 110-100 ka (MIS 5d-5e), also reached south of the Byrranga mountains and its post-glacial marine limit there was c. 100 m a.s.l. The later glacial phases (around 70-60 ka and 20 ka) terminated at the North Taimyr Ice Marginal Zone (NTZ), along or some distance inland from the present northwest coast of Taimyr. They dammed glacial lakes, which caused the Taimyr River to flow southwards where to-day it flows northwards into the Kara Sea. The c. 20 ka glacial phase, contemporary with the maximum (LGM) glaciation in NW Europe, was this glacial cycle's least extensive one up here probably an effect of precipitation shadow caused by the major glaciations to the west. From the Kara Sea shelf this advance only reached c. 100 km inland, over some limited parts of NW Taimyr. The Severnaya Zemlya islands were only locally glaciated at this time. The lowlands south of the Byrranga Mountains have been a terrestrial "Mammoth steppe" environment during the last c. 50 ka and periglacial permafrosted sediments here have preserved excellent information on its megafauna and vegetation. The latter, according to new DNA-data, had considerably more (for grazing animals nourishing) flowering plants growing than earlier pollen-based (grass dominated) spectra have suggested.

We found the lytic phenomenon under natural conditions and during densification experiments, and also observed the species change of the cyanobacteria during the lysis processes, in which Microcystis finally became dominant. The species change of the cyanobacteria was strongly suggested to depend on the suscepti-bility of the cyanobacteria toward the VOCs. To verify this suggestion, the susceptibility of the species was evaluated by the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) using axenic cyanobacterial strains against beta-cyclo-citral, its oxidation products and beta-ionone with the aid of log D. It was found that the difference depended on the susceptibility of the cyanobacteria toward the VOCs, in which beta-cyclocitral played a crucial role and Microcystis had a significantly protective ability compared to the other cyanobacteria. In addition, the species change of cyanobacteria was consistent with the cyanobacterial seasonal succession in Lakes Sagami and Tsukui, based on data that had been accumulated for 10 years. Conventionally, although this phenomenon could be explained by nutrient availability or the physical structure of the environment, the results of this study revealed that it was controlled by the VOCs, particularly beta-cyclocitral produced by the cyanobacteria.					; Harada, Ken-ichi/ISU-7680-2023	Bober, Beata/0000-0003-3520-4639; 													0045-6535	1879-1298				DEC	2021	284								131378	10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.131378	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.131378		JUL 2021						34217930					WOS:000703855900003
J	Simis, SGH; Peters, SWM; Gons, HJ				Simis, SGH; Peters, SWM; Gons, HJ			Remote sensing of the cyanobacterial pigment phycocyanin in turbid inland water	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The pigment phycocyanin (PC) is a marker for cyanobacterial presence in eutrophic inland water. We present a reflectance band-ratio algorithm for retrieval of cyanobacterial PC. The model conforms to the band settings of the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer. The parameters of the algorithm were optimized using reflectance and absorption data from two highly eutrophic lakes. Using measured specific absorption coefficients for PC [a(pc)*(620)] PC for every sample, the error in the predicted PC concentrations was 19.7% (r(2) = 0.94, n = 34) for measured PC concentrations Up to 80 mg m(-3). Applying a fixed value of a(pc)*(620) caused an overestimation of the PC content that increased toward lower PC concentrations. The PC prediction best matched observed values during periods of high relative abundance of cyanobacteria in the plankton community. The results suggest strong seasonal variation in a(pc)*(620). The presence of pigments other than PC and chlrophyll a (Chla) and a variable influence of Chla on retrieved absorption at 620 nm are potential causes of errors in PC retrieval. The algorithm in its current form is considered to be suitable for detection of the PC concentration in turbid, cyanobacteria-dominated waters.

Development and application of a molecular assay to detect and monitor geosmin-producing cyanobacteria and actinomycetes in the Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Geosmin is a potent earthy-smelling sesquiterpene responsible for the majority of biologically induced taste-andodor (T/O) episodes in drinking and recreational water, and major economic losses to commercial, farmed and sports fisheries. Geosmin is produced by a range of microorganisms, notably by cyanobacteria and actinomycetes. However, the effective management of geosmin T/O episodes has been hindered by our inability to identify the major biological sources, and absence of sensitive methods for early detection of T/O events. The main goal of this study was to develop taxon-specific PCR and RT-PCR assays that facilitate early detection of potential geosmin releases and identification of the likely biological sources. We developed a molecular assay for the detection and expression of geosmin synthase (geoA), a gene involved in geosmin biosynthesis in cyanobacteria and actinomycetes. Using the molecular probes, we detected geoA in a wide range of geosmin-producing taxa in both laboratory cultures and environmental samples which provided an important new database of geoA sequences from a diversity of GSM producers, allowing an evaluation of their phylogenetic relationships based on this gene. This study indicated that potential geosmin producers in the Laurentian Great Lakes water and sediment samples are predominantly represented by members of the Nostocaceae, and in particular Anabaena spp. No correlations were apparent between gene expression and ambient temperature, nutrient concentrations and total phytoplankton biomass. Rather, evaluation of the geoA expression pattern in the environmental samples tested from various watersheds and seasons suggested constitutive gene expression.

J	Xu, D; Gao, J; Lin, WP; Zhou, WY				Xu, Di; Gao, Jun; Lin, Wenpeng; Zhou, Wenying			Differences in the ecological impact of climate change and urbanization	URBAN CLIMATE												Urbanization is an important driver of climate change. It changes the characteristics of biological and non-biological elements in and around urban areas. The response of ecosystems to urbanization and climate change is complex. It occurs on all temporal and spatial scales due to the interaction of resources, energy and information among social, natural and biological systems. However, the extent to which climate change and urbanization affect the ecology has not yet been quantified. Here we choose the Qinghai Lake basin and 5 nature reserves as areas affected by climate change, and take Shanghai and 34 provincial capitals as representatives affected by urbanization. The results show that from 2000 to 2014, the advancement of growing season start and end in Shanghai was 46.18 and 73.36 times that of the Qinghai Lake Watershed. From 2001 to 2017, the growth rate of daytime and nighttime land surface temperature in Shanghai was 20 and 1.91 times that of the Qinghai Lake Watershed. The start of phenology in Hefei City is increasing 11.5 times earlier than Yellow River source area and 78 times earlier than that in Tibet. The mature day of phenology in Haikou City is increasing 9.5 times earlier than that in Yellow River source area and 123 times earlier than that in Qinghai Lake Watershed.					lin, wenpeng/CAI-0545-2022; Zhou, Wenying/I-2055-2019	LIN, Wenpeng/0000-0002-7974-6408													2212-0955					JUL	2021	38								100891	10.1016/j.uclim.2021.100891	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2021.100891		JUN 2021											WOS:000679338800005

K.; Tipdecho, Taravudh			Ecosystem evaluation (1989-2012) of Ramsar wetland Deepor Beel using satellite-derived indices	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The unprecedented urban growth especially in developing countries has laid immense pressure on wetlands, finally threatening their existence altogether. A long-term monitoring of wetland ecosystems is the basis of planning conservation measures for a sustainable development. Deepor Beel, a Ramsar wetland and major storm water basin of the River Brahmaputra in the northeastern region of India, needs particular attention due to its constant degradation over the past decades. A rule-based classification algorithm was developed using Landsat (2011)-derived indices, namely Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalised Difference Water Index (MNDWI), Normalised Difference Pond Index (NDPI), Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and field data as ancillary information. Field data, ALOS AVNIR and Google Earth images were used for accuracy assessment. A fuzzy accuracy assessment of the classified data sets showed an overall accuracy of 82 % for MAX criteria and 90 % for RIGHT criteria. The rules were used to classify major wetland cover types during low water season (January) in 1989, 2001 and 2012. The statistical analysis of the classified wetland showed heavy manifestation in aquatic vegetation and other features indicating severe eutrophication over the past 23 years. This degradation was closely related to major contributing anthropogenic factors, such as a railway line construction, growing croplands, waste disposal and illegal human settlements in the wetland catchment. In addition, the landscape development index (LDI) indicated a rapid increase in the impact of the surrounding land use on the wetland from 1989 to 2012. The techniques and results from this study may prove useful for top-down landscape analyses of this and other freshwater wetlands.					; Mozumder, Chitrini/OGO-4404-2025	Tripathi, Nitin/0000-0001-5618-2841; Mozumder, Chitrini/0000-0003-3094-2210; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				NOV	2014	186	11					7909	7927		10.1007/s10661-014-3976-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-014-3976-2								25092138					WOS:000343051400071
J	Pizarro, J; Vergara, PM; Cerda, S; Briones, D				Pizarro, Jaime; Vergara, Pablo M.; Cerda, Sergio; Briones, Daniela			Cooling and eutrophication of southern Chilean lakes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Understanding the impacts of global warming and human-disturbances on lakes is required for implementing management strategies aimed at mitigating the decline of the quality and availability of water for humans. We assessed temporal trends in water parameters, and the contribution of land use to the eutrophication of the largest lakes of central-southern Chile. The mean values of water parameters varied seasonally, with lakes Chapo and Caburgua exhibiting lower pH, temperature, and N/P ratio values. Over the assessed period (19 years), we found a temporal reduction in water conductivity and temperature of the lakes. The concentration of NO3--N, PO43 -P and dissolved oxygen increased in all the lakes, but pH increased in eight out of the ten lakes. The negative temporal trend in temperature was more pronounced as he depth level increased. Lakes whose basins had a higher percentage of forest. plantation and urban areas had larger values of Chlorophyll a and pH, as well as, smaller values of dissolved oxygen. Lakes whose basins included larger percentages of native forest had smaller nutrient. (NO3--N, -P) concentrations. Our findings suggest. that decreased rainfall in central-southern Chile due to climate change may cause a decrease of particulate material that is carried by tributaries into the lakes. The observed temporal decrease in temperature, especially at the deeper levels, may be explained by he rapid melting of glaciers. Although the studied lakes are classified as oligotrophic, deforestation and expansion of urban areas around the lakes have led to increased nutrient. input, thus accelerating their eutrophication.

J	van der Kamp, G; Hayashi, M; Bedard-Haughn, A; Pennock, D				van der Kamp, Garth; Hayashi, Masaki; Bedard-Haughn, Angela; Pennock, Dan			Prairie Pothole Wetlands - Suggestions for Practical and Objective Definitions and Terminology	WETLANDS												Prairie pothole wetlands are subject to large year-to-year and decadal variability of precipitation, resulting in large variations in ponded area, plant communities and ecological functionality that obscure trends in wetland conditions caused by changes in climate and land use. Descriptions and analyses of these variations and trends require practical and objective definitions of pothole wetlands that can be used to establish the boundaries of individual wetlands, detect long-term changes of these boundaries, and distinguish wetlands from lakes and from small non-wetland depressions. The boundaries of prairie pothole wetlands should ideally be defined on the basis of wetland soils, which are more stable and persistent than vegetation and ponded water. The latter are necessarily used as indicators of wetland conditions through time because they are amenable to remote sensing and regional wetland inventories. However, the relationships between wetland ponds, vegetation and soil zones need improved documentation. Wetlands are persistent and stable landscape features (unless they are drained or filled). Some ecological functions of wetlands such as waterbird habitat may be seasonal, but other important hydrological and biochemical functions act year-round whether or not a pond is present. Phrases such as "seasonal wetland" that refer to the duration of ponded water should be avoided and terms such as "wetland", "depression" and "pond" should be used with clear definitions that are accepted across the wetland disciplines. Commonly used wetland classifications based on vegetation zones and duration and salinity of ponds should incorporate reference to the decadal-scale time period for which the descriptions apply.

Amplification of the water cycle, including the increasing frequency and severity of droughts and wet extremes, is expected to alter spatial and temporal hydrological patterns in arid wetlands globally, with potential threats to ecosystem services and their functioning. Despite these pressing challenges, the ecohydrological interactions and resilience of arid wetlands to highly variable water regimes over long time periods remain largely unknown. Recent broad-scale drought and floods over Australia provide unique opportunities to improve our understanding of arid wetland ecosystem responses to hydroclimatic extremes. Here we analysed the ecohydrological dynamics of the Coongie Lakes arid wetland in central Australia, one of the world's largest Ramsar-designated wetlands, using more than two decades (1988-2011) of vegetation and floodwater extent retrievals derived from Landsat satellite observations. To explore the impacts of large-scale hydrological fluctuations on the arid wetland, we further coupled Landsat measurements with Total Water Storage Anomaly (TWSA) data obtained from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites. Pronounced seasonal and inter-annual variabilities of flood and vegetation activities were observed over the wetland, with variations in vegetation growth extent highly correlated with flood extent (r = 0.64, p < 0.05) that ranged from nearly zero to 3456 km(2). We reported the hydrological dynamics and associated ecosystem responses to be largely driven by the two phases (El Nino and La Nina) of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) ocean-atmosphere system. Changes in flood and vegetation extent were better explained by GRACE-TWSA (r = 0.8, lag = 0 month) than rainfall (r = 034, lag = 3 months) over the water source area, demonstrating that TWS is a valuable hydrological indicator for complex dryland river systems. The protracted Millennium Drought from 2001 to 2009 resulted in long-term absence of major flood events, which substantially suppressed wetland vegetation growth. However, the 2010-11 La Nina induced flooding events led to an exceptionally large resurgence of vegetation, with a mean vegetation growth extent anomaly exceeding the historical average (1988-2011) by more than 1.5 standard deviations, suggesting a significant resilience of arid wetland ecosystems to climate variability. This study showed the ecological functioning of arid wetlands is particularly sensitive to large-scale hydrological fluctuations and extreme drought conditions, and vulnerable to future altered water regimes due to climate change. The methods developed herein can be applied to arid wetlands located in other dryland river systems across the globe. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Distinct spatial and seasonal variations were observed for all physico-chemical parameters, except DO (ANOVA: p < 0.05). In total, 72 taxa, Bacillariophyta (55 taxa), Chlorophyta (seven taxa), Cyanobacteria (six taxa), Euglenophyta (two taxa), Dinophyta (one taxon) and Charophyta (one taxon) were identified. Phytoplankton abundance and biomass ranged from 5 789.3 cells ml(-1) to 1 516.2 cells ml(-1), with a mean of 8 756.9 cells ml(-1) and 9.8 mu g l(-1) to 25.8 mu g l(-1), with a mean of 17.1 mu g l(-1), respectively, and showed seasonal variations (p < 0.05). Based on RDA analysis, most species were abundant in Shala Gike Shore station. Their distribution was negatively correlated with salinity and EC, whereas pH, alkalinity, NO3-N, SRP, TP, NH3-N and SiO2 had a positive correlation. Previously Lake Shala was dominated by Cryptophyta but this has switched to a diatom-dominant community. Such changes in phytoplankton taxa may be suggestive of ecological change. This study provides baseline data on the phytoplankton community structure of Lake Shala associated with physico-chemical changes, against which future community structure can be evaluated.

The STP in Shihezi was chosen as representative to investigate the distribution of antibiotics in a sludge-sewage system. Results showed that the concentrations of most detected antibiotics ranged from tens to hundreds of nanograms per liter in influent samples and under 100 ng L-1 in effluent samples. QNs and TCs were dominant species with concentrations of 2.33 mg kg (-1) to 3.34 mg kg (-1) and 0.36 mg kg (-1) to 0.47 mg kg (-1) in sludge samples, respectively. The elimination rates of target antibiotics by various STPs ranged from 17% to 100%. The STP with anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic and membrane bio-reactor technology removed antibiotics more efficiently than those with anaerobic/anoxic/oxic and oxidation ditch technology. The elimination capacities of treatment units from the three STPs were also investigated. SAs were mainly degraded in biological treatment units; conversely, QNs and TCs were significantly eliminated in sedimentary treatment units. Ozonation effectively removed remaining antibiotics but not UV and chlorination disinfection in this study.

Aquatic bacterial diversity: Magnitude, dynamics, and controlling factors	MICROBIAL PATHOGENESIS												The primary aspiration in the microbial observatory is to advance the understanding of freshwater bacterioplankton, whose diversity and population dynamics are currently the least understood off all freshwater planktonic organisms. Through identification and characterization of bacterial populations in a suite of fresh water bodies, we are able to gain significant new insight into the ecological niches of bacteria in diverse freshwater ecosystems. Given the facts that lakes and other inland freshwaters play a more critical role in the global carbon budget and that lakes have been described as early indicators of both regional and global environmental change, the role of microbes in these processes is of renewed interest. In this review, general overview will be given highlighting the characteristic features of bacterial species thriving in different water bodies. In the following sections, different cultural approaches vis a vis the controlling factors of bacterial diversity have been elaborated. In the concluding sections, the prospects of aquatic microbial diversity are well mentioned. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In large lakes, even extensive monitoring programs leave some of the patterns undiscovered and unresolved. Lake models can complement measurements in higher spatial and temporal resolution. These models require a set of driving data, particularly meteorological input data, which are compulsory to the models but at many locations not available at the desired scale or quality. It remains an open question whether these meteorological input data can be acquired in a sufficient quality by employing atmospheric models. In this study, we used the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts' (ECMWF) ERA-Interim atmospheric reanalysis data as meteorological forcing for the three-dimensional hydrodynamic General Estuarine Transport Model (GETM). With this combination, we modelled the spatio-temporal variation in water temperature in the large, shallow Lake Chaohu, China. The model succeeded in reproducing the seasonal patterns of cooling and warming. While the model did predict diurnal patterns, these patterns were not precise enough to correctly estimate the extent of short stratification events. Nevertheless, applying reanalysis data proved useful for simulating general patterns of stratification dynamics and seasonal thermodynamics in a large shallow lake over the year. Utilising reanalysis data together with hydrodynamic models can, therefore, inform about water temperature dynamics in the respective water bodies and, by that, complement local measurements.

Aims: We synthesise the results of hydrological and hydrochemical studies during the period 1995-2014, building on a long history of earlier work focused on snow and water on Niwot Ridge and the adjacent Green Lakes Valley (GLV), which is part of the Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research site (NWT LTER). Methods: These studies are discussed in the context of how snow, snowmelt and runoff reflect changing local climate. We review recent results of snow, snowmelt, hydrology and hydrochemistry from the plot to the basin scale, utilising new tools such as continuous global positioning system (GPS) measurements of snow depth, along with remotely-sensed measurements of snow-covered area and melt, combined with long-term measurements of snow properties, discharge and solute and isotopic content of water. Results and Conclusions: Surface-groundwater interactions are important components of water quantity and quality in alpine basins. Some or most snowmelt infiltrates underlying soils and bedrock, transporting soil and bedrock products to surface waters. Infiltrating snowmelt, along with increased melt of stored ice, increases the hydrologic connectivity between the terrestrial and aquatic systems. Alpine basins are being impacted by increases in atmospheric nitrogen deposition, which has caused changes in soil microbial processes such as nitrification. Nitrate, dissolved organic carbon and dissolved organic nitrogen are thus flushed from soils and talus to streams. Our long-term results show that alpine catchments, such as Green Lake 4 at NWT LTER+, have the greatest sensitivity and least resilience to climate warming, with any warming leading to increased water yields.					; Liu, Fengjing/AFB-2641-2022; Molotch, Noah/C-8576-2009	MOLOTCH, NOAH/0000-0003-4733-8060; , Fengjing/0000-0001-8743-321X; 													1755-0874	1755-1668				NOV 2	2015	8	5-6			SI		639	661		10.1080/17550874.2015.1123318	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17550874.2015.1123318													WOS:000371707500003
J	Abdelhady, HU; Troy, CD				Abdelhady, Hazem U.; Troy, Cary D.			A reduced-complexity shoreline model for coastal areas with large water level fluctuations	COASTAL ENGINEERING												A new reduced-complexity, 1-D shoreline model has been developed, calibrated, and tested with a set of shoreline positions detected from high-resolution satellite images. Motivated by recent large interannual water level fluctuations and associated shoreline changes in the Great Lakes, the model is built on previous models that are based on the disequilibrium concept, with extensions for water level effects. Unlike other shoreline models, the model includes two different sources of disequilibrium, wave disequilibrium and water level disequilibrium. The model also includes a passive flooding term to account for the instantaneous effect of the water level changes on the shoreline position. Case studies forced by seasonally-varying waves and water levels varying on seasonal and interannual timescales highlight the model's ability to enhance wave-driven shoreline change when water level variations are additionally present. The model was applied to two sites along the Lake Michigan shoreline, Jeorse Park and West Beaches, with shoreline time series extracted from multispectral satellite imagery. When calibrated and applied to an eleven year period of decreasing water levels, the new model shows significant skill in simulating and forecasting the shoreline position in the two study areas, with modest improvement over existing models. The simulation results additionally highlight the dominance of water level disequilibrium over wave disequilibrium for the study sites. When applied to a nearly forty year simulation of West Beach, the new model shows excellent ability to model the shoreline response to water level and wave fluctuations over a range of timescales. Comparison models are seen to be incapable of capturing the water level effects, particularly when water level trends differ from the calibration period. Overall, the model results and parameters show the importance of the newly introduced water level disequilibrium in modulating wave-driven shoreline change. Finally, while the shoreline model was motivated by Great Lakes coastal processes, it may provide new predi-cation abilities for coastlines where water level fluctuations and trends play a role in shoreline changes.

J	Corrales-González, M; Rochera, C; Picazo, A; Camacho, A				Corrales-Gonzalez, Maykoll; Rochera, Carlos; Picazo, Antonio; Camacho, Antonio			Effect of wastewater management on phosphorus content and sedimentary fractionation in Mediterranean saline lakes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The La Mancha Humeda Biosphere Reserve is the largest wetland district in the Iberian Peninsula, containing many temporary saline lakes undergoing different anthropogenic pressures. Eleven of these lakes were selected to assess phosphorus (P) burial, fractionation and mobilization in their sediments. Wastewater inputs, wherever they occurred, favored accumulation of all P sedimentary fractions, which took place mainly via precipitation with divalent cations (i.e. calcium or magnesium) and as buried organic matter, both representing relatively occluded P forms, although they can also be involved in P release. P immobilization would be partially restrained in the volcanic lakes of the region, making them more prone to eutrophication. Our seasonal survey indicated that the natural drying and re-flooding of lakes replenishes the availability of labile-P in water, and often contributed to the lakes productivity. However, artificial flooding alters redox conditions and thereby enhances a reductive dissolution of P. This further suggests that the internal P supply might not diminish in the polluted lakes after external input shortcomings, thus counteracting any restoration measures. On the other hand, condensed P. which occurs when the excess P is taken up by microorganisms and stored as polyphosphate, was also important in sediments. Aside from the wastewater purification performed in treatment plants, we propose additional countermeasures such as extending the use of tributary slow flow channels and/or artificial wetlands. These can act as "tertiary treatments" that would promote biogeochemical transformations involving P binding before treated wastewater is poured into the lakes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, little is known about soil carbon emission and their environmental controls from inland floodplain wetlands. This study aimed to determine the effects of hydrologic and edaphic controllers (water table depth [WTD], soil temperature [Ts], and soil water content [SWC]) on soil C emission in Dongting Lake wetland, China. One-year emissions were measured in Carex meadow and mudflat using static chambers during 2013 to 2014, including nonflooded season (NFs) and flooded season (Fs). The results showed that soil C emission in the Carex meadow and mudflat was 307.8 and 264.3gCm(-2)year(-1), respectively, and 50-66% of soil C were emitted during NFs. Compared with NFs, CO2 emission was significantly decreased by 57% but CH4 emission was significantly increased by 38 times during Fs in the Carex meadow. Stepwise regression combined with structural equation model analysis showed that CO2 and CH4 flux were mainly influenced by Ts during NFs, and they were controlled by water temperature (Tw) during Fs. During NFs, CO2 flux increased with increasing Ts and SWC but decreased significantly when SWC was over 66% and 52% in the Carex meadow and mudflat, respectively. CH4 flux showed an emission pulse at SWC and Ts of 65% and 17.2 degrees C, respectively. These results indicate that flooding significantly inhibited soil CO2 emission but stimulated CH4 emission. The continuous decrease of flooding days caused by anthropogenic disturbances may induce soil C loss in Dongting Lake wetlands.

Continuous Seasonal and Large-Scale Periglacial Reservoir Sedimentation	SUSTAINABILITY												Sustainable reservoir use is globally threatened by sedimentation. It has been generally recognized that inadequate consideration of reservoir sedimentation has caused the worldwide decline of net storage. Numerical models are useful tools to simulate sedimentation processes and can be used to derive efficient counter-measures and sediment management strategies. They can be applied to both existing and potential future reservoirs to predict long-term sedimentation. In this study, an application of a simple, robust, and stable numerical 1D model to Gebidem reservoir in Switzerland accompanied by field measurements is presented. It focusses on seasonal and large-scale reservoir sedimentation processes that occur continuously throughout the whole deposition season, while episodic events like turbidity currents are not taken into account. The model simulates both the delta formation of coarse sediments and the lake-wide sedimentation from homopycnal flows. The model is used to assess the effects and significance of varying boundary conditions like inflow, suspended sediment concentration, particle size distribution (PSD), or reservoir operation. It will be demonstrated that future reservoir operation and PSD are as important as future runoff evolution. Based on these findings, implications on future reservoir operation, also considering climate change, are discussed. Finally, an outlook on pending research topics is given.

Investigation of an early season river flood pulse: Carbon cycling in a subtropical estuary	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The January 2016 Bonnet Carre Spillway (BCS) opening resulted in a large-scale Mississippi River (MR) flood discharge that qualitatively and quantitatively impacted the dissolved organic matter (DOM) cycling in the Lake Pontchartrain Estuary (LPE) located in Louisiana, USA. This early season flood event was a result of the delay of snow formation caused by warmer than normal watershed temperatures. During the diversion period and the subsequent weeks, the LPE water temperature remained lower than pre-flood water temperatures, suppressing carbon cycling. Following that period, the water temperature increased, leading to an increase in the rate of abiotic and biological carbon processing (i.e., mineralization, degradation, and consumption). There were multiple and abnormally high discharges into LPE from the northern tributaries, totaling 43% of the MR flood discharge. As a secondary DOM source, the northern tributaries discharge was qualitatively and quantitatively different from the discharge originating from the river or estuarine sources. The dominant DOM source was determined using satellite images in conjunction with UV-Vis, fluorescence EEMs, and PARAFAC indicators. Overall, the three sources (MR, northern tributaries, and LPE) characteristics were identified by UV-Vis, fluorescence EEMs, and PARAFAC parameters, namely: i) spectral slope (S-275), serving as an indicator of lignin-like compounds' molecular weights, with a trend of MR > northern tributaries > LPE; ii) biological index (BIX), indicating freshness of DOM, with a trend of LPE > MR > northern tributaries; and iii) Fluorophore T intensity, serving as an indicator of the amount of terrestrial-like sourced DOM, with a trend of northern tributaries > LPE > MR. It was possible to identify DOM sources and monitor DOM transformation in the water column, increasing our understanding of DOM, carbon, and nitrogen ecological processing. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The model is a cascade of validated hydrological and hydraulic sub-models. The model was applied to simulating the surface water flows of the Tonle Sap Lake and its floodplain in Cambodia using the roughness coefficient value calibrated comparing with a remote-sensing data set. The resulting model reasonably handles backwater flows during the rainy season and simulates the propagations of wet and dry interfaces without numerical instability, owing to a proper setting of time step supported by a novel numerical stability analysis. Sensitivity analysis of the surface water dynamics focusing on the setting of roughness coefficient and the backwater effect was also carried out. Overall, utilizing the 2-D local inertial equation in the assessment of lake water dynamics is a new modelling approach, which turns out to be an efficient simulation tool.					; Fujihara, Yoichi/G-6724-2012; Hoshikawa, Keisuke/AAK-5162-2020; Yoshioka, Hidekazu/Q-8786-2019	Ly, Sarann/0000-0002-8676-5885; Siev, Sokly/0000-0002-1916-1598; Yoshioka, Hidekazu/0000-0002-5293-3246; Tanaka, Tomohiro/0000-0002-8884-9089; Fujihara, Yoichi/0000-0001-5129-5548; Hoshikawa, Keisuke/0000-0002-7664-3956; 														2073-4441				SEP	2018	10	9							1213	10.3390/w10091213	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10091213													WOS:000448821900105

However, studies of zooplankton from tropical regions are relatively rare. Our objective was to construct zooplankton trait-based functional groups (ZFG) to study tropical reservoirs that differ with respect to precipitation, eutrophication and hydrological operations. We selected and analysed zooplankton and associated environmental variables from four tropical reservoirs that were sampled during dry and rainy seasons for three years. Eight traits were evaluated to construct ZFGs using hierarchical clusters and classification trees. Six ZFGs were identified based on three non-redundant functional traits: habitat type, feeding and predatory escape response. Significant differences in the density and biomass of ZFGs were observed as indicated by regression models showing reservoir morphometry, hydrology, rainfall, and phytoplankton biomass as main environmental drivers. Our results highlight the usefulness of ZFG to monitoring programmes and for predicting zooplankton community changes in tropical reservoirs, allowing a greater understanding of plankton dynamics and ecosystems functioning.

The high revisit frequency of Sentinel-1A and -1B make these images ideal for studies in hydrology that require data during the wet seasons and intense precipitation events. The aim of our study consisted in determining the attainable accuracy in delineating water bodies using Sentinel-1 data and propose a scheme for the extraction of the water surface. We chose a study site of three small reservoirs in the Pampulha area of Belo Horizonte, Brazil. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was used to separate water surfaces from the land using a probability threshold of 95%. In our scheme, we combined a SVM classification with a probability map to estimate the partial water area of the pixels within the transition zone between water and land. The VV polarization provided the best separation between water and land and the best geometric accuracy for the study area. Following the proposed approach, adding the water area of the marginal pixels to the water surface yielded accuracies better than 90% and above 80% when the geometry errors were also considered. Our results demonstrated the applicability of using high-resolution Sentinel-1 SAR data for the accurate mapping of water surfaces.					; Maillard, Philippe/C-4956-2015	Maillard, Philippe/0000-0003-3405-5096; 													0703-8992	1712-7971					2018	44	3			SI		179	190		10.1080/07038992.2018.1478723	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07038992.2018.1478723													WOS:000455642200002

Although normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series (NTS) shows great potential in land cover mapping and crop classification, the effectiveness of various NTS with different spatial and temporal resolution has not been evaluated for seasonal wetland classification. To address this issue, we conducted comparisons of those NTS, including the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) NTS with 500m resolution, NTS fused with MODIS and Landsat data (MOD_LC8-NTS), and HJ-1 NDVI compositions (HJ-1-NTS) with finer resolution, for wetland classification of Poyang Lake. Results showed the following: (1) the NTS with finer resolution was more effective in the classification of seasonal wetlands than that of the MODIS-NTS with 500-m resolution and (2) generally, the HJ-1-NTS performed better than that of the fused NTS, with an overall accuracy of 88.12% for HJ-1-NTS and 83.09% for the MOD_LC8-NTS. Future work should focus on the construction of satellite image time series oriented to highly dynamic characteristics of seasonal wetlands. This study will provide useful guidance for seasonal wetland classification, and benefit the improvements of spatiotemporal fusion models.

J	Fink, G; Schmid, M; Wüest, A				Fink, Gabriel; Schmid, Martin; Wueest, Alfred			Large lakes as sources and sinks of anthropogenic heat: Capacities and limits	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The goal of reducing carbon fuel and thereby saving energy will increase the use of lake water for heating and cooling of riparian infrastructures. This raises the question of which heat use designs meet the ecological and technical requirements for lakes, particularly in regard to climate warming. Thus, this study explores heat use effects on the temperature and stratification of a large, deep, temperate lake by applying the one-dimensional k-epsilon model SimStrat to various forcing scenarios. Several design parameters, such as extraction and discharge depth, and their effects were assessed. Additionally, 21st century climate projections were used to evaluate the effects of climate change relative to those of heat use. Generally, the study showed only minor effects for a realistic heat demand of 2 W m(-2) quite independent of the heat extraction/discharge modes. Mean water temperature changed less than 0.2 degrees C as long as there was no discharge into the deepest layers. Water extraction and discharge at the surface had the least thermal influence. To relate to climate change, heat use was scaled up to +85 W m(-2). Resultant simulations showed that such (unrealistic) anthropogenic, lake-based thermal pollution would have a comparable influence to that of climate change. Conversely, heat extraction could damp or even compensate climate-induced warming. The present study concludes that (i) there are minor effects on water temperatures, stratification, and seasonal mixing due to heat use of up to 2 W m(-2) and (ii) those influences are insignificant relative to the expected climate change.

Phytoplankton chlorophyll a in Lake Poyang and its tributaries during dry, mid-dry and wet seasons: a 4-year study	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												Variations in phytoplankton chlorophyll a were studied in Lake Poyang, and these variations were compared with those observed in its tributaries. Samples were collected from January 2009 to January 2013 during the dry, mid-dry and wet seasons. The study showed that chlorophyll a concentrations were significantly higher in the wet season than in the dry and mid-dry seasons (p < 0.0001) in the lake; a comparative analysis of Lake Poyang and its tributaries showed significant differences in chlorophyll a between the two ecosystems during the wet season but not during the dry and mid-dry seasons. During the wet season, the underwater light conditions were significantly elevated and water retention time increased substantially (25.5 d). In combination, these factors contributed to a significantly higher chlorophyll a concentration during the wet season than that during the dry and mid-dry seasons in the lake; the effect of nutrients on the phytoplankton was not obvious. The large variations in water retention time during the three seasons indicated that Lake Poyang has the combined characteristics of a river and a lake. The short retention times during the dry and mid-dry seasons produced no difference in chlorophyll a between the lake and its tributaries, whereas the long retention time during the wet season facilitated phytoplankton growth in the lake.					; LAI, Xijun/F-8722-2010; Wu, Zhaoshi/ABG-7886-2021	Lai, Xijun/0000-0002-3973-6539; 													1961-9502						2014		412							06	10.1051/kmae/2013088	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/kmae/2013088													WOS:000332760100006
J	Xiao, J; Jin, ZD; Wang, J				Xiao, Jun; Jin, Zhangdong; Wang, Jin			Assessment of the Hydrogeochemistry and Groundwater Quality of the Tarim River Basin in an Extreme Arid Region, NW China	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The concentrations of the major and trace elements in the groundwater of the Tarim River Basin (TRB), the largest inland river basin of China, were analyzed before and during rainy seasons to determine the hydrogeochemistry and to assess the groundwater quality for irrigation and drinking purposes. The groundwater within the TRB was slightly alkaline and characterized by high ionic concentrations. The groundwater in the northern sub-basin was fresh water with a Ca2+-HCO3 (-) water type, whereas the groundwater in the southern and central sub-basins was brackish with a Na+-Cl- water type. Evaporite dissolution and carbonate weathering were the primary and secondary sources of solutes in the groundwater within the basin, whereas silicate weathering played a minor role. The sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), water quality index (WQI), and sodium percentage (%Na) indicated that the groundwater in the northern sub-basin was suitable for irrigation and drinking, but that in the southern and central sub-basins was not suitable. The groundwater quality was slightly better in the wet season than in the dry season. The groundwater could be used for drinking after treatment for B3+, F-, and SO4 (2-) and for irrigation after control of the sodium and salinity hazards.

Assessing the exploitation status of main fisheries resources in Ghana's reservoirs based on reconstructed catches and a length-based bootstrapping stock assessment method. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XXX-XXX. The cichlid species Oreochromis niloticus, Sarotherondon galilaeus, and Coptodon zillii, which are among the most exploited resources in the small-scale fisheries of the Tono, Bontanga, and Golinga reservoirs in northern Ghana, were assessed based on length frequency samples. Growth, mortality, exploitation status, stock size, and relative yield per recruit reference points were determined using bootstrapping fish stock assessment (BFSA), a novel framework that allows for the estimation of uncertainties around the life-history parameters and reference levels (e.g., L-infinity, K, and F-0.1). The results suggest that the 3 species studied are heavily exploited in all 3 reservoirs, but with no alarming signs of overexploitation. The fishing effort at Golinga is comparatively low as a result of insignificant fishing during the agriculture season, which relates to low exploitation rates. Sarotherondon galilaeus and C. zillii have the highest and lowest biomass (t/km(2)) respectively in all the 3 reservoirs. The small shallow reservoir (Golinga) has the highest biomass of the target resources per unit area. According to a second assessment approach, based on length-based indicators, all species at Bontanga and O. niloticus and S. galilaeus populations at Golinga have spawning stock biomasses below 40% of the unfished biomass. This points to a situation of a possible ongoing recruitment overfishing of those species in the 2 reservoirs and suggests that a further increase in fishing effort should be prevented. Further monitoring of these fisheries will be needed for the improvement of assessments and thus management advice.					; Abobi, Seth/AAW-8545-2021; Mildenberger, Tobias/K-3951-2019	Abobi, Seth Mensah/0000-0001-5538-8573; Mildenberger, Tobias/0000-0002-6631-7524; Kolding, Jeppe/0000-0002-2643-1285													1040-2381	2151-5530				OCT 2	2019	35	4			SI		415	434		10.1080/10402381.2019.1616340	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2019.1616340		JUN 2019											WOS:000473949800001

Mineralogy and origin of surficial uranium deposits hosted in travertine and calcrete from central Jordan	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Secondary uranium encrustations are hosted in thick travertine and calcrete deposits of Pleistocene-Recent age in central Jordan. The central Jordan varicolored marble and travertine are equivalent to the active metamorphic area in Maqarin, north Jordan. More than 100 samples were collected from the outcrops of the varicolored marble, travertine, calcrete, and the yellow uranium encrustations. The secondary yellow encrustations are mainly composed of uranyl vanadate complexes. Tyuyamunite Ca(UO2)(2) V25+O8 . 3(H2O)-strelkinite Na-2(UO2)(2)V2O8 6(H2O) solid solution series are the major components and their composition reflects changes in the Ca/Na ratio in solution. Potentially, new vanadium free calcium uranate phases (restricted to the varicolored marble) were identified with CaO:UO3 ratios different from the known mineral vorlanite (CaU6+)O-4. Carbon and oxygen isotope data from calcite in the varicolored marble are characterized by Rayleightype enrichment in light isotopes associated with release of C-13 and O-18 enriched CO2 by high temperature decarbonation during combustion of the bituminous marl. Stable isotope results from uranium hosted travertine and calcrete varieties exhibit a wide range in isotopic values, between decarbonated and normal sedimentary carbonate rocks. The depleted delta C-13 and delta O-18 values in the travertine are related to the kinetic reaction of atmospheric CO2 with hyperalkaline Ca(OH)(2) water. The gradual enrichment of delta C-13 and delta O-18 values in the calcrete towards equilibrium with the surrounding environment is related to continuous evaporation during seasonal dry periods. Uranium mineralization in central Jordan resulted from the interplay of tectonic, climatic, hydrologic, and depositional events. The large distribution of surficial uranium occurrences hosted in travertine and calcrete deposits is related to the artesian ascending groundwater that formed extensive lakes along NNW-SSE trending depressions. Fresh groundwater moved upward through the highly fractured phosphate, bituminous marl and varicolored marble to form unusual highly alkaline water (hydroxide-sulfate type) enriched with sensitive redox elements among which were U and V.

Here, we test if the significant increase in TOC (total organic carbon, 90-95% DOC) in three acid-sensitive catchments in Norway of 14 to 36% between 1985 and 2003 is related to climate, hydrology, and/or acid deposition. Catchment TOC export increased between 10 and 53%, which was significant at one site only. The seasonal variation in TOC was primarily climatically controlled, while the deposition of SO4 and NO3-negatively related to TOC-explained the long-term increase in TOC. We propose increased humic charge and reduced ionic strength-both of which increase organic matter solubility-as mechanistic explanations for the statistical relation between reduced acid deposition and increased TOC. Between 1985 and 2003, ionic strength decreased significantly at all sites, while the charge density of TOC increased at two of the sites from 1-2 meq g(-1) C to about 5 meq g(-1) C and remained constant at the third site at 5 meq g(-1) C. The solubility of organic matter is discussed in terms of the pH-dependent deprotonation of carboxylic groups and the ionic strength-dependent repulsion of organic molecules.					de Wit, Heleen/ABO-9056-2022	de Wit, Heleen A/0000-0001-5646-5390													0013-936X					NOV 15	2007	41	22					7706	7713		10.1021/es070557f	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es070557f								18075078					WOS:000250974700021

Lake Taihu, one of China's largest freshwater lakes, frequently experiences cyanobacterial blooms primarily driven by nutrient over-enrichment and hydrological changes, posing severe threats to water quality, aquatic life, and surrounding human populations. This study explored how varying water flow disturbances influence microbial diversity and community assembly within the interconnected river-lake systems of the East and South of Lake Taihu (ET&ST). The Taipu River in the ET region accounts for nearly one-third of Lake Taihu's outflow, while the ST region includes the Changdougang and Xiaomeigang rivers, which act as inflow rivers. These two rivers not only channel water into Lake Taihu but can also cause the backflow of lake water into the rivers, creating distinct river-lake systems subjected to different intensities of water flow disturbances.Methods Utilizing high-throughput sequencing, we selected 22 sampling sites in the ET and ST interconnected river-lake systems and conducted seasonally assessments of bacterial and microeukaryotic community dynamics. We then compared differences in microbial diversity, community assembly, and co-occurrence networks between the two regions under varying hydrological regimes.Results and discussion This study demonstrated that water flow intensity and temperature disturbances significantly influenced diversity, community structure, community assembly, ecological niches, and coexistence networks of bacterial and eukaryotic microbes. In the ET region, where water flow disturbances were stronger, microbial richness significantly increased, and phylogenetic relationships were closer, yet variations in community structure were greater than in the ST region, which experienced milder water flow disturbances. Additionally, migration and dispersal rates of microbes in the ET region, along with the impact of dispersal limitations, were significantly higher than in the ST region. High flow disturbances notably reduced microbial niche width and overlap, decreasing the complexity and stability of microbial coexistence networks. Moreover, path analysis indicated that microeukaryotic communities exhibited a stronger response to water flow disturbances than bacterial communities. Our findings underscore the critical need to consider the effects of hydrological disturbance on microbial diversity, community assembly, and coexistence networks when developing strategies to manage and protect river-lake ecosystems, particularly in efforts to control cyanobacterial blooms in Lake Taihu.					zuo, jun/M-8772-2018; geng, ruozhen/JVZ-4590-2024; Zuo, Jun/M-8772-2018; Xiao, Peng/AAL-9601-2021; Grossart, Hans-Peter/E-6705-2017; zhang, hejuan/OGN-5476-2025	zuo, jun/0000-0003-4788-9559; 														1664-302X				SEP 30	2024	15								1479158	10.3389/fmicb.2024.1479158	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2024.1479158								39411429					WOS:001334575900001

The role of agricultural drainage, storm-events, and natural filtration on the biogeochemical cycling capacity of aquatic and sediment environments in Lake Erie's drainage basin	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Lake Erie is the most at risk of the Great Lakes for degraded water quality due to non-point source pollution caused by agricultural activities in the lake's watershed. The extent and temporal patterns of nutrient loading from these agricultural activities is influenced by the timing of agronomic events, precipitation events, and water flow through areas of natural filtration within the watershed. Downstream impacts of these nutrient loading events may be moderated by the co-loading of functionally relevant biogeochemical cycling microbial communities from agricultural soils. This study quantified loading patterns of these communities from tile drain sources, assessed whether functional communities from agricultural sources influenced downstream microbial functionality, and investigated how distance from agricultural sources, storm events, and areas of natural filtration altered nutrient cycling and nutrient fluxes in aquatic and sediment environments. Water and sediment samples were collected in the Wigle Creek watershed in Ontario, from tile drains through to Lake Erie, from May to November 2021, and microbial nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) cycling capacity (quantitative PCR), and nutrient levels were evaluated. Results showed that N and P functional groups were co-loaded with nutrients, with increased loading occurring during storm events and during agricultural activities including fertilization and harvest. Overall functional capacity in the aquatic environment decreased with distance from the agricultural sources and as water transited through natural filtration areas. In contrast, the sediment environment was more resilient to both agricultural disturbances and abiotic factors. This study expands our under-standing of when and where different stages of N and P cycling occurs in agriculturally impacted watersheds, and identifies both seasons and regions to target with nutrient mitigation strategies.

The investigations were conducted from October 2014 to September 2015 and 384 specimens per species for each season were caught in Trasimeno lake and examined for the presence of larvae in the abdominal cavity and muscle. The presence of nematodes in the abdominal cavity and musculature was revealed in three fish species. The prevalence of Eustrongylides spp. infection was 6.84, 1.89 and 0.13% in perch, largemouth black bass and sand smelt, respectively. The number of parasites per fish was only one in largemouth black bass and sand smelt and ranged from one up to three in perch.

Despite the absence of dispersal barriers, we expected a clear separation of the phytoplankton communities between basins based on their physical distinctions: a shallow and a deep basin with low and high water residence time, respectively. To investigate seasonal succession and spatiality, taxa were classified according to their functional groups (FGs) and traits (FTs). Relationships between functional classifications and environmental parameters were assessed by non-metric multidimensional scaling integrated with cluster analysis. Clustering of FGs and FTs was complementary and reflected different hydrological conditions of each basin: (i) more stable conditions and higher functional variation across seasons in the deep basin and (ii) less stable conditions and lower functional variation across seasons in the shallow basin. Phytoplankton functional composition evidenced how local conditions selected for corresponding functional attributes adapted to each basin's environment. These results, together with the presence of rare, cold-tolerant taxa such as PseudotetraA << driella kamillae and Stephanocostis chantaicus, highlighted the need for long-term phytoplankton studies, and the creation of a FG that includes cold-adapted, oligotrophic taxa.

Predicting anoxia in the wet and dry periods of tropical semiarid reservoirs	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The dissolved oxygen (DO) level in the hypolimnion of lakes and reservoirs can reach anoxic conditions, which favor the release of phosphorus from the sediment bed to the water column. However, to estimate nutrient release from sediment is extremely important to quantify the duration of anoxia. In low latitude regions, the water-sediment layer is warmer than in temperate regions and eutrophication is usually more severe, potentially accelerating oxygen depletion and extending the anoxia period. Considering that the available equations to quantify the duration of anoxia were developed for temperate lakes, there is a need to effectively quantify this period in lakes and reservoirs located in other climate regions, such as the semiarid. In this study, the dynamics of thermal stratification was analyzed as a function of the Relative Water Column Stability coefficient (RWCS) and then correlated with DO dynamics for nineteen tropical semiarid reservoirs. RWCS values were higher during the rainy season, when anoxia duration was longer and the hypolimnion was thicker with respect to total water depth. Then, two new equations for quantification of anoxia duration, based on the equation originally devel-oped for temperate climate, were adapted for the wet and dry seasons of the tropical semiarid region. The results showed that the proposed equations presented a better performance compared to the original one, which tends to underestimate anoxia in tropical semiarid reservoirs. This work intended to provide simple and locally adjusted tools to better quantify anoxic events and support the water quality and internal phosphorus load modeling for tropical semiarid reservoirs.					; Lima Neto, Iran Eduardo/B-2980-2012; Lima Neto, Iran/B-2980-2012	Delmiro Rocha, Maria de Jesus/0000-0001-9874-358X; Duarte Souza Carneiro, Brenda Lara/0000-0002-9463-7058; Lima Neto, Iran Eduardo/0000-0001-8612-5848; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				JAN 15	2023	326		A						116720	10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.116720	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.116720		NOV 2022						36356542					WOS:000889344500007

Stable Isotopes and Movement of Walleye Change Following Ecological Shifts Driven by Dreissenid Mussels	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												The Great Lakes support some of the most productive fisheries for Walleye Sander vitreus in North America, although system-level change from overexploitation, pollution, and invasive species has dramatically changed these fisheries over time. More recently, the widespread establishment of dreissenid mussels (zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha and quagga mussel D. bugensis) has strongly altered energy flow by sequestering nutrients in nearshore benthic habitats, thereby influencing primary, secondary, and prey fish production with implications for Walleye. While the impacts of dreissenids on the open-water food web are well established, little is known about their influence on fish populations occupying nearshore or embayment habitats. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that ecosystem changes resulting from dreissenid mussels have altered the stable isotope ratios and displacement of Walleye in Little Bay de Noc, an embayment of Lake Michigan. Retrospective isotope analysis of fin spines over a 31-year time series coincident with the invasion of dreissenid mussels suggests that alterations in energy dynamics have increased Walleye reliance on nearshore benthic energy. From reports of jaw-tagged Walleye caught over the same time period, we found significant temporal changes in Walleye displacement distances from the tagging site that were strongly size dependent following the invasion of dreissenid mussels. These results potentially suggest that the spatial distribution of large Walleye shifted in response to prey availability or habitat conditions. Additionally, sex-specific differences in Walleye displacement indicate that females move greater distances than males, possibly driven by higher energetic and reproductive demands. Our findings suggest that the largest Walleye are seasonally leaving Little Bay de Noc, potentially altering the dynamics of the sport fishery in Green Bay and impacting management programs that occur across state lines.

Home Range of Yellow-Spotted Amazon River Turtles (Podocnemis unifilis) (Testudines: Podocnemididae) in the Trombetas River Biological Reserve, Para, Brazil	CHELONIAN CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY												Adult Podocnemis unifilis were monitored using VHF radio tracking from September 2013 to September 2014 in the Rio Trombetas Biological Reserve, Para, Brazil. Our aim was to analyze the use of space by this species near the nesting beach base by describing size and overlap of estimated home ranges. Transmitters were attached to 10 males and 10 females. The mean home range size calculated through the fixed-kernel (FK) method with 95% of the fixes was 79.28 +/- 77.08 ha (056-215.07 ha; n = 13). The mean of overlapping areas was 14% with FK95% (0.02%-81%; n = 13) and 5% with FK50% (0.1%-23%; n = 9). There was a significant difference in the mean overlapping areas between females and males. The analysis of the overlap of activity centers estimated by FK50% is extremely important for the establishment of conservation strategies in the management plan for this species in the reserve. We were able to identify 2 critical areas for the maintenance of this population where there was a frequent overlap of activity centers: the first, identified during the dry season, was composed of small overlaps among 7 turtles and was near the nesting areas on the clay banks within the Lago Jacare; the second, identified during the rainy season, was composed of a concentration of overlap areas of larger size among 6 turtles and was an open area in the flooded forest. It is important not only to protect the nesting areas during the dry season but also to protect flooded forest areas with the major intensity of use along with the canals that link the flooded forests to the lakes in the rainy season. For conservation purposes, it is necessary to continue the protection of the nesting beaches throughout the savannas inside the lake where the species nests in the dry season. The flooded forest areas that are zones of intense use during the rainy season, and the canals where the turtles can move between lakes must be protected throughout the year.

Understanding these influences is important to guide land use planning and avoid the undesirable consequences of artificial eutrophication. We investigated how land use and natural landscape attributes such as edge density, mean shape index, cohesion, and contagion were related to nitrate (N-NO3) and phosphate (P-PO4) concentrations in Brazilian streams and Mexican lakes. Data on nutrient concentrations were collected by citizen science volunteers from 2013 to 2016, and we calculated land use classes and landscape metrics for each watershed. We developed models to predict nutrient concentrations based on landscape metrics, watershed slope, and season after excluding autocorrelated predictors. We used the Generalized Additive Model for Location, Shape and Scale framework and found the distribution (gamma or lognormal) that provided the best fit to the data based on the Akaike Information Criterion. The best predictors were selected following a stepwise strategy. We found relatively high N-NO3 (5-10 mg/L) and P-PO4 (0.5-1.0 mg/L) concentrations in the watersheds in both countries. Landscape composition (percentages of urban and agricultural areas) and configuration (mean shape indexes for urban and agricultural land use) metrics were the key predictors in the model for P-PO4 in Brazilian streams. In Mexican lakes, the predictors of nutrient concentrations were configuration metrics such as contagion and edge density of natural areas for P-PO4, and cohesion of urban areas for N-NO3. Our findings can be used as a starting point for land use planning, as well as for helping managers predict nutrient enrichment in watersheds within existing urban and agricultural areas. Our study highlights the importance of community-based monitoring that supplements regular monitoring initiatives because we were able to use data collected by citizen scientists to assess potential drivers of nutrient pollution and differences between countries.

Ebullition is a complex process that is spatially dependent on factors acting over large distances (atmospheric pressure changes, wind) and factors acting locally (sediment characteristics, gas production) and is temporally variable due to the parameters' oscillation with time. Its quantification through measurements is still limited, as is the identification of production processes and triggers for ebullition. This research focused on obtaining high temporal resolution measurements of gas ebullition from a water supply reservoir located in Brazil, to compare its temporal variability with changes in reservoir conditions, and obtain insights on its spatial patterns. Three automated bubble traps were deployed in the reservoir and measured gas flux from February 2017 to March 2018. The time series data showed a large temporal variability in ebullition. Less intense fluxes occurred with higher frequency, and short-duration events made a larger contribution to the total amount of gas emitted. A strong seasonal variation was observed, in which the mean flux recorded during periods when the reservoir was stratified was 2-16 fold the bubbling rates recorded during colder months and mixed water column. In addition, high flux events were correlated with decreasing atmospheric pressure and increased wind intensities. Lastly, we show that the mean gas emission flux tends to be underestimated during short sampling periods (probability >41% for sampling periods shorter than 10days).

The Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) is an imperiled, disturbance-dependent, shorebird species that nests on broad, sparsely vegetated beaches, sandbars, and lakeshores. In areas minimally affected by human use, plover habitat loss occurs through vegetation encroachment and erosion. Alternatively, habitat availability may be increased by sand deposition caused by storm-or flood-induced sediment transport or scouring that removes vegetation, or by receding lake levels. To test the hypothesis that plover populations are limited by available breeding habitat, we estimated the amount of habitat available before and after four significant storm and flooding events (i.e., disturbance) by classifying pre- and postdisturbance aerial imagery. We then evaluated the population changes that occurred after disturbance-related habitat alterations. Additionally, we report on population changes from four population increases that occurred after habitat creation events for which we did not have imagery suitable for classification. The storm and flood effects considered were those from hurricanes and nor'easters on barrier islands of Virginia, North Carolina, New York, and Maryland, USA, and those from floods and high water output from the Gavins Point Dam on the Missouri River between South Dakota and Nebraska, USA. The amount of nesting habitat increased 27-950% at these sites, and plover populations increased overall 72-622% after these events (increase of 8-217 pairs in 3 to 8 years after the disturbance, average 12-116% increase annually). The demographic changes were driven by productivity in some cases and probably by increases in immigration in others, and occurred simultaneously with regional increases. Our results support our hypothesis that the focal plover populations were at or near carrying capacity and are habitat limited. Currently, human interventions such as beach stabilization, the construction of artificial dunes, and dams reduce natural disturbance, and therefore, the carrying capacity, in many plover breeding areas. If these interventions were reduced or modified in such a way as to create and improve habitat, plover populations would likely reach higher average numbers and the potential for achieving recovery goals would be increased.

A set of maps prepared after 1764, space photographs captured in 1970 and current satellite images from 2015 and 2017 were studied to reconstruct the fluvial dynamics of the Torsa River on the foreland basin of Sikkim-Bhutan Himalaya considering a time span of nearly 250 years. Evidence collected from colonial literature, the above-mentioned satellite images and a field survey, were combined to verify results taken from the old maps used as the base of the study. The application of satellite remote sensing and analysis of the topographic signatures of the palaeo-courses in the form of the palaeo-levee, abandoned courses and ox-bow lakes were the major operational attributes in this study. As a consequence of the channel migration of Torsa River since 1764, the historical floodplain of Torsa has been topographically marked by beheaded old distributaries, a misfit channel system and the presence of abandoned segments. Morphometric changes in the old courses, major flood events and neo-tectonic activity guided an overall trend of channel migration eastwards and has led to a couple of channel oscillation events in the Torsa River over the last 250 years. The mechanism of the avulsion events was thoroughly driven by sedimentation-induced channel morphometric changes and occasional high discharge.						saha, Ujwal Deep/0000-0002-0225-7710													2080-7686	2300-8490				JUN	2019	16	1					99	114		10.2478/bgeo-2019-0007	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/bgeo-2019-0007													WOS:000472035000007

VARIATION IN BIRD-WINDOW COLLISION MORTALITY AND SCAVENGING RATES WITHIN AN URBAN LANDSCAPE	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												Avian mortality from collisions with windows and buildings is one of the top sources of anthropogenic mortality of birds. Each year in the United States, an estimated 100 million to one billion birds die from window collisions. Many studies of bird-window collision mortality have aimed to identify architectural, landscape, and species-specific factors that may influence collision rates, but little research has assessed the potential for spatiotemporal variation in collision mortality. We studied window collision mortality at 42 residential houses located within an urban landscape, along the shores of Lake Superior in Duluth MN, USA from 2006-2009 to quantify window-related fatalities during migration. The rate of window collision mortality was modeled as a function of house location and season using Poisson regression. We also conducted carcass distribution trials to estimate scavenging and detection rates, and analyzed the resulting data using a multistate Markov model. We used hierarchical models of scavenging probability to compare the relationship between scavenging rates and six measured covariates. Models for collision mortality and scavenging were evaluated using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC). The adjusted number of birds killed (N-k) over the full course of monitoring was estimated using the Horvitz-Thompson estimator. A total of 40 species and 108 individual birds were recorded as window kills. Fatalities increased with distance from the city center, were higher at houses on the lake side of the study site, and on windows facing Lake Superior. Scavenging rates also increased with distance from the city center, with small carcasses being removed more quickly than large carcasses, and removal rates decreasing over time for all carcass sizes. Because of the low detection probability of homeowners, combined detection by both homeowners and researchers was <20%. Although mortality and scavenging rates were not uniformly distributed, we estimated an adjusted mortality rate of similar to 11-16 birds per house during the study period. Mortality estimates for all residential houses on Minnesota Point (n = 520) during the study period (n = 211 days) was 5,819-8,382 birds, similar to 1,421 birds per season. Results suggest spatiotemporal variation in both mortality and scavenging rates within our study area, both of which increased with distance from the city center. Houses with highest collision mortality also had the highest scavenging rates. Our results are consistent with other studies that have observed heterogeneity in mortality and scavenging rates associated with local structural and landscape level variables. Documenting patterns associated with increased collision mortality will be important in identifying locations that may pose a greater risk to birds.																			1559-4491	1938-5447				JUN	2016	128	2					355	367		10.1676/wils-128-02-355-367.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1676/wils-128-02-355-367.1													WOS:000379447200012

We are not aware of any systematic review of the literature of the epidemiology and transmission of schistosomiasis in Malawi since 1985. Therefore, we reviewed the current state of knowledge of schistosomiasis epidemiology and transmission in this country and identified knowledge gaps and relevant areas for future research and research governance. Methods: We conducted computer-aided literature searches of Medline, SCOPUS and Google Scholar using the keywords: "schistosomiasis", "Bilharzia", "Bulinus" and "Biomphalaria" in combination with "Malawi". These searches were supplemented by iterative reviews of reference lists for relevant publications in peer reviewed international scientific journals or other media. The recovered documents were reviewed for their year of publication, location of field or laboratory work, authorship characteristics, ethics review, funding sources as well as their findings regarding parasite and intermediate host species, environmental aspects, geographical distribution, seasonality of transmission, and infection prevalence and intensities. Review: A total of 89 documents satisfied the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Of these, 76 were published in international scientific journals, 68 were peer reviewed and 54 were original research studies. Most of the documents addressed urinary schistosomiasis and about two thirds of them dealt with the definitive host. Few documents addressed the parasites and the intermediate hosts. While urinary schistosomiasis occurs in most parts of Malawi, intestinal schistosomiasis mainly occurs in the central and southern highlands, Likoma Island and Lower Shire. Studies in selected communities estimated prevalence rates of up to 94.9% for Schistosoma haematobium and up to 67.0% for Schistosoma mansoni with considerable geographical variation. The main intermediate host species are Bulinus globosus and Bulinus nyassanus for urinary schistosomiasis and Biomphalaria pfeifferi for intestinal schistosomiasis. Seasonality of transmission tends to vary according to geographical, environmental, biological and behavioural factors. Conclusion: Transmission of schistosomiasis in Malawi appears to be highly focal, with considerable variation in space and time. Many locations have not been covered by epidemiological investigations and, thus, information on the transmission of schistosomiasis in Malawi remains fragmented. Functional infection risk assessment systems based on systematic investigations and surveillance are required for developing informed prevention and control strategies.

We evaluated long-term trends in the ionic composition of 30 lakes situated in the alpine zone of the Tatra Mountains, and compared the rates of their recovery with model (MAGIC) simulations done 20 years ago for the 2003-2020 period. The observed recovery was faster than the model forecast, due to greater reductions in acidic deposition than projected. Trends in water composition were further modified by climate change. Rising temperatures increased the length of the growing season and retention of inorganic N and SO42- more in soil-rich compared with soil-poor catchments. In contrast, elevated precipitation and an increase in rainfall intensity reduced water residence time in soils, and consequently reduced N retention, especially in soil-poor catchments. It is likely that increases in rainfall intensity and annual number of days without snow, along with air temperatures fluctuating around the freezing point elevated the physical erosion of rocks, especially in high-elevation, steep, and scree-rich areas where rocks are not thermally insulated and stabilized by soils. Weathering of exposed accessory calcite in the eroded granodiorite bedrock was a source of Ca2+ and HCO3 -, while S-bearing minerals likely contributed to lake water SO42- and partly mitigated its deposition-related decrease in scree-rich catchments. The extent of climate effects on changes in the water composition of alpine lakes recovering from acidic deposition thus depended on elevation and cover of soil and scree in catchments. Our results highlight the need for incorporating dominant climate-related process into existing process-based models to increase their reliability in predicting the future development of lake water composition.					; Stuchlik, Evzen/I-1915-2017; Kaňa, Jiří/C-4277-2014; Porcal, Petr/A-7350-2014; Kopacek, Jiri/A-7373-2014	Kopacek, Jiri/0000-0002-4409-4032; Stuchlik, Evzen/0000-0003-0200-5721; Porcal, Petr/0000-0002-7787-4924; Kana, Jiri/0000-0003-3596-4742; 													0269-7491	1873-6424				SEP 1	2021	284								117522	10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117522	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117522		JUN 2021						34261223					WOS:000672535900006

Observer bias and subsampling efficiencies for estimating the number of migrating fish in rivers using Dual-frequency IDentification SONar (DIDSON)	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Fixed-location, side-looking, multibeam, sonar techniques offer a practical approach to estimate the numbers of migrating fish in rivers that are too large or occluded for traditional sampling methods, such as weir trapping, visual observation techniques, and netting. While this technology has been used to enumerate salmonid escapement in coastal river systems of western North America, little use and evaluation has occurred in inland waters such as the Great Lakes, where rivers and runs of fish are considerably smaller than those along the Pacific coast. We use a "Dual-frequency IDentification SONar" ("DIDSON") imaging sonar system to investigate the error and variability among nine people performing fish counts. There was no significant difference found among observers' estimates of fish abundance per DIDSON file; however, the total count of all fish differed from the benchmark value by as much as 26%. Post-processing simple fish counts from DIDSON raw data is labour-intensive and costly. Three subsampling methods of fish passage estimations were developed and evaluated for their accuracy and precision for daily and seasonal time frames. The random and systematic subsampling methods had similar seasonal and daily accuracy and precision with few exceptions. Automation-assisted counting was much more accurate and efficient for seasonal estimates. A ratio of approximately 2:1 was found for the automated to manual fish counts and this varied little among years. The DIDSON multibeam sonar unit is useful in estimating potamodromous fish migrations for large tributaries of the Great Lakes. DIDSON image processing costs can be minimized through suitable subsampling approaches. The automation-assisted method is the most cost-effective means of estimating moderate levels of fish passage over longer study periods. Multiple individuals can be used interchangeably for the manual post-processing of DIDSON data. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Sinninghe			Anoxic in situ production of bacterial GMGTs in the water column and surficial bottom sediments of a meromictic tropical crater lake: Implications for lake paleothermometry	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Branched glycerol monoalkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGMGTs) are membrane-spanning lipids which were initially identified in marine settings and have more recently been found in peats and lake sediments. In the latter settings, their abundance relative to that of the branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) appears to increase under warmer climate conditions. Furthermore, their relative distribution in bottom sediments from an altitudinal transect of East African lakes has been linked to local mean annual air temperature (MAAT). To shed light on their sources and identify potential environmental factors driving their production in lakes, we investigated their occurrence and distribution in the water column, surficial lake-bottom sediments, and catchment soils of Lake Chala, a permanently stratified (meromictic) tropical crater lake in East Africa. Data from the water column comprise both suspended particulate matter (SPM) collected monthly at eight depth intervals between 0 and 80 m for 17 consecutive months, and settling particles collected monthly at a depth of 35 m over a period of 53 months. In catchment soils, brGMGTs are either relatively scarce or absent. In the water column, their occurrence is dominated by four of the seven known brGMGTs and mostly limited to the anoxic zone. Whereas the spatial distribution and concentration of brGMGTs in SPM were strongly influenced by the seasonal cycle of strong water-column stratification alternating with deep mixing, this trend is not consistent on the multi-year timescale of the settling-particles record. Moreover, their relative distribution in both SPM and settling particles did not respond to temperature variation during the studied interval. In contrast to the water column, surficial lake-bottom sediments contain the full suite of known brGMGTs in a distinct and spatially uniform fractional abundance, strongly suggesting that the majority of brGMGT production takes place there. BrGMGT-inferred MAAT for the Chala area reasonably estimates measured MAAT and conforms to the East African lake brGMGT calibration. Our results have important implications for the use of brGMGTs as proxy for MAAT, in that outside of the equatorial zone the presumably greater offset between bottom-water temperature and MAAT may create a bias towards cold-season air temperature. Regardless, the more singular source of brGMGTs in lake sediments is an advantage for paleotemperature reconstruction compared to brGDGTs, which several studies now indicate to have a mixed aquatic and terrestrial source of which the relative contribution cannot easily be disentangled or assumed to have been constant through time.

Potential shifts in zooplankton community structure in response to changing ice regimes and hydrologic connectivity	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Changing Arctic climate may alter freshwater ecosystems as a result of warmer surface waters, longer open-water periods, reduced wintertime lake ice growth, and altered hydrologic connectivity. This study aims to characterize zooplankton community composition and size structure in the context of hydrologic connectivity and ice regimes in Arctic lakes. Between 2011 and 2016, we sampled the phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish communities from a set of representative lakes on the Arctic Coastal Plain (ACP) of northern Alaska to determine potential food web responses to changing Arctic ecosystems. Multivariate analyses showed that time from ice-out had a strong influence on zooplankton community structure and that seasonal succession of zooplankton differed between lakes with varying hydrologic connectivity. Trends were observed suggesting that large-bodied zooplankton (Daphnia, calanoid copepods) may be more prevalent in poorly connected lakes with low fish diversity. Large-bodied zooplankton displayed higher biomass in lakes with high occurrences of bedfast ice, while small-bodied zooplankton (Bosmina, rotifers) displayed highest biomass in deeper lakes with low occurrences of bedfast ice. Our results contribute to limited knowledge of zooplankton in remote lakes of the ACP and suggest that the anticipated changes to aquatic ecosystems in the Arctic may include energetically less efficient plankton food webs.						scotese, KYLE/0000-0003-4270-7859; Jones, Benjamin/0000-0002-1517-4711; Tausz, Claudia/0000-0002-8784-768X													1523-0430	1938-4246					2019	51	1					327	345		10.1080/15230430.2019.1643210	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15230430.2019.1643210													WOS:000486105800024

Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, several SAV species serve as bioindicators for the trophic state of freshwater lakes. Variations in water temperature, light availability and nutrient concentration affect SAV growth and species composition. To monitor the trophic state as required by the European Water Framework Directive (WFD), SAV needs to be monitored regularly. This study analyses the development of macrophyte patches at Lake Starnberg, Germany, by exploring four Sentinel-2A acquired within the main growing season in August and September 2015. Two different methods of littoral bottom coverage assessment are compared, i.e. a semi-empirical method using depth-invariant indices and a physically based, bio-optical method using WASI-2D (Water Colour Simulator). For a precise Sentinel-2 imaging by date and hour, satellite measurements were supported by lake bottom spectra delivered by in situ data-based reflectance models. Both methods identified vegetated and non-vegetated patches in shallow water areas. Furthermore, tall- and meadow-growing SAV growth classes could be differentiated. Both methods revealed similar results when focusing on the identification of sediment and SAV patches (R-2 from 0.56 to 0.81), but not for a differentiation on SAV class growth level (R-2 <0.42).

A total of 302 fishes were analyzed for various types of OCPS. OCPs, namely hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane (DDT), heptachlor epoxide, endosulfan, and dieldrin were detected among various species of fishes. Among the various OCPs analyzed, HCH was the most frequently detected pesticides. Among the HCH isomers, HCH contributed more than 50% to the sigma HCH. p,p' DDT, the metabolites of DDT, had high percentage of occurrence. Among the cyclodiene insecticide residues, endosulfan was detected in more than 60% of the fishes. Varying levels of sigma OCPs (a sum of sigma HCH, sigma DDT, sigma endosulfan, heptachlor epoxide, and dieldrin) were detected in various fish species, although it was not significant (p>0.05). However, significant variations in OCPs were observed among location and between seasons (p<0.05). However, continuous monitoring is recommended to facilitate the early identification of risks not only to the fishes, but also to fish-eating birds breeding in these sanctuaries.

High-quality estimates of these changes are challenging because of the limits on the data quality and time span of satellite observations. Here, the term pan-Arctic river refers to the rivers flowing to the Arctic Ocean basin. In this study, we provide a new evaluation of groundwater storage (GWS) changes in the Lena, Ob, Yenisei, Mackenzie and Yukon River basins from the GRACE total water storage anomaly product, in situ runoff, soil moisture form models and a snow water equivalent product that has been significantly improved. Seasonal Trend decomposition using Loess was utilized to obtain trends in GWS. Changes in surface water (SW) between 1984 and 2019 in these basins were also examined based on the Joint Research Centre Global Surface Water Transition data. Results suggested that there were great GWS losses in the North American river basins, totaling approximately -219 km(3), and GWS gains in the Siberian river basins, totaling ~340 km(3), during 2002-2017. New seasonal and permanent SWs are the primary contributors to the SW transition, accounting for more than 50% of the area of the changed SW in each basin. Changes in the Arctic hydrological system will be more significant and various in the case of rapid and continuous changes in permafrost.

However, whether a seasonal change in bacterioplankton and eukaryoplankton communities is synchronous remains unclear. To test the synchronicity and analyze how physical and chemical environmental factors affect these communities, we compared bacterioplankton and eukaryoplankton communities in surface water samples between March (dry season) and June (rainfall season) considering water environmental factors. Our results showed that there was no significant difference in operational taxonomic unit number, Shannon index, and Chao1 index in bacterioplankton and eukaryoplankton communities between March and June. However, principal component analysis showed that the communities were significantly different between the sampling times and sampling sites. Water temperature (WT), oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), water transparency (SD), NO3-N, and NH3 significantly influenced bacterioplankton communities, and WT, SD, ORP, and NH4-N significantly influenced eukaryoplankton communities in the river. These results implied that compared with the sampling sites, sampling times more significantly affected the bacterioplankton and eukaryoplankton river communities by influencing WT, ORP, SD, and nitrogen forms.					; Ni, Jiajia/AAC-8769-2020; li, ziqi/JDC-9141-2023; Gao, yuan/HLH-1794-2023	Liu, Qianfu/0000-0002-3405-2998; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				FEB	2022	194	2							55	10.1007/s10661-021-09712-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-09712-9								34988711					WOS:000739405300004

This study is the first to explore the seasonal effects on the spatial patterns in functional diversity along an elevational gradient. The results showed that the pattern of functional diversity of riverine macroinvertebrates along the elevation gradient was either unimodal or monotonically decreasing. Seasonal changes did not affect the elevational patterns. The findings provide important research and management tools for the temporary effects of river ecosystems. Spatial biodiversity is a key issue in biogeography for the explorations of biological origin and diversification. However, seldom studies have addressed the temporal changes in spatial patterns of biodiversity. We explored the taxonomic and functional diversities of riverine macroinvertebrates in central China, with the elevational gradient, in different seasons in a normal climate year (i.e., no extreme anomalies in the annual precipitation or average annual temperature). The air temperature and streamflow discharge were decreased monotonically with the increase of elevation both in the dry and wet seasons. In addition, the total nitrogen had no significant change with the increase of elevational gradient in the dry season but showed a monotonically decreasing pattern in the wet season. The total phosphorus showed a monotonically decreasing pattern with the elevational gradient in the dry season but had no significant change in the wet season. The spatial pattern of taxonomic diversity of macroinvertebrates along the elevational gradient showed complex patterns, but the functional diversity had either the unimodal or monotonically decreasing pattern. In addition, the functional diversity with the elevational gradient had similar patterns between the dry and wet seasons. Further analysis of the elevational pattern in different seasons is an important basis for understanding the status quo of functional diversity and formulating countermeasures for biodiversity conservation.					; Cai, Qinghua/F-8176-2015	Luo, Qingyi/0000-0002-7434-9382; Cai, Qinghua/0000-0002-0224-7256; Chiu, Ming-Chih/0000-0003-2793-4981														2079-7737				FEB	2022	11	2							208	10.3390/biology11020208	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology11020208								35205075					WOS:000767599600001
J	Schwarzenberger, A				Schwarzenberger, Anke			Negative Effects of Cyanotoxins and Adaptative Responses of Daphnia	TOXINS												The plethora of cyanobacterial toxins are an enormous threat to whole ecosystems and humans. Due to eutrophication and increases in lake temperatures from global warming, changes in the distribution of cyanobacterial toxins and selection of few highly toxic species/strains are likely. Globally, one of the most important grazers that controls cyanobacterial blooms is Daphnia, a freshwater model organism in ecology and (eco)toxicology. Daphnia-cyanobacteria interactions have been studied extensively, often focusing on the interference of filamentous cyanobacteria with Daphnia's filtering apparatus, or on different nutritional constraints (the lack of essential amino acids or lipids) and grazer toxicity. For a long time, this toxicity only referred to microcystins. Currently, the focus shifts toward other deleterious cyanotoxins. Still, less than 10% of the total scientific output deals with cyanotoxins that are not microcystins; although these other cyanotoxins can occur just as frequently and at similar concentrations as microcystins in surface water. This review discusses the effects of different cyanobacterial toxins (hepatotoxins, digestive inhibitors, neurotoxins, and cytotoxins) on Daphnia and provides an elaborate and up-to-date overview of specific responses and adaptations of Daphnia. Furthermore, scenarios of what we can expect for the future of Daphnia-cyanobacteria interactions are described by comprising anthropogenic threats that might further increase toxin stress in Daphnia.

However, lake ecosystems are frequently overlooked as fungal habitats, despite the potentially important role of fungi in matter cycling and energy flow. Hulun Lake is a typical example of a seasonal glacial lake; however, previous studies have only focused on bacteria in this ecosystem. Therefore, in the current study, internal transcribed spacer ribosomal RNA (ITS rRNA) gene high-throughput sequencing was used to investigate the fungal communities in paired water and sediment samples from the Hulun Lake Basin in China. A significant difference was found between the fungal communities of the two sample types. Across all samples, we identified nine phyla, 30 classes, 78 orders, 177 families, and 307 genera. The dominant phyla in the lake were Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Chytridiomycota. Our results show that both water and sediments have very high connectivity, are dominated by positive interactions, and have similar interaction patterns. The fungal community structures were found to be significantly affected by environmental factors (temperature, chemical oxygen demand, electrical conductivity, total phosphorus, and pH). In addition, the dispersal limitations of the fungi affected the structure of the fungal communities, and it was revealed that stochasticity is more important than deterministic mechanisms in influencing the structure and function of fungal communities. This study provides unique theoretical support for the study of seasonally frozen lake fungal communities and a scientific basis for the future management and protection of Hulun Lake.

Inundation information was extracted from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing data and used to calibrate the wetting and drying parameter by assessing the accuracy of the simulated inundation area and its boundary. The bottom friction parameter was calibrated using current velocity measurements from Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP). The results show the model is capable of predicting the inundation area dynamic through cross-validation with remotely sensed inundation data, and can reproduce the seasonal dynamics of the water level, and water discharge through a comparison with hydrological data. Based on the model results, the characteristics of the current velocities of the lake in the wet season and the dry season of the lake were explored, and the potential effect of the current dynamic on water quality patterns was discussed. The model is a promising basic tool for prediction and management of the water resource and water quality of Poyang Lake.					; Feng, Lian/JQI-0512-2023; Xiao, Xiongwu/KIG-4042-2024; Zhang, Peng/NQE-7738-2025; Lu, Jianzhong/E-5698-2013	Zhang, Peng/0000-0002-7739-6109; Lu, Jianzhong/0000-0002-6432-8481; Feng, Lian/0000-0002-4590-3022; Xiao, Xiongwu/0000-0002-3035-7727; Liu, Honggao/0000-0003-2795-6347													2072-4292					APR	2015	7	4					4858	4879		10.3390/rs70404858	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs70404858													WOS:000354789300064
J	Wallenstein, MD; McMahon, S; Schimel, J				Wallenstein, Matthew David; McMahon, Shawna; Schimel, Joshua			Bacterial and fungal community structure in Arctic tundra tussock and shrub soils	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY					International Conference on Polar and Alpine Microbiology	MAR 27-31, 2006	Innsbruck, AUSTRIA	Inst Microbiol, Leopold Franzens Univ, Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Canadian Studies Ctr, LEU, FEMS				Fungal and bacterial community structure in tussock, intertussock and shrub organic and mineral soils at Toolik Lake, Alaska were evaluated. Community structure was examined by constructing clone libraries of partial 16S and 18S rRNA genes. The soil communities were sampled at the end of the growing season in August 2004 and just after the soils thawed in June 2005. The communities differed greatly between vegetation types, although tussock and intertussock soil communities were very similar at the phyla level. The communities were relatively stable between sample dates at the phyla and subphyla levels, but differed significantly at finer phylogenetic scales. Tussock and intertussock bacterial communities were dominated by Acidobacteria, while shrub soils were dominated by Proteobacteria. These results appear consistent with previous work demonstrating that shrub soils contain an active, bioavailable C fraction, while tussock soils are dominated by more recalcitrant substrates. Tussock fungi communities had higher proportions of Ascomycota than shrub soils, while Zygomycota were more abundant in shrub soils. Recent documentation of increasing shrub abundance in the Arctic suggests that soil microbial communities and their functioning are likely to be altered by climate change.

Spatial ecology of Bay of Quinte walleye (Sander vitreus): Annual timing, extent, and patterns of migrations in eastern Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Walleye (Sander vitreus) are the top nearshore predator in the Bay of Quinte and eastern Lake Ontario, where they have strong ecological and socio-economic impacts. The population is known to migrate seasonally; however, the precise timing and extent are not well defined. This study used acoustic telemetry to provide a fisheries-independent measure of timing, extent, and seasonal distribution of migration in Lake Ontario and to examine the influence of sex, spawning river, size, and year. Annual detection histories were used to determine the timing of migrations into and out of the spawning rivers, departure from the Bay of Quinte post-spawn, and the pre-spawn return to the Bay of Quinte. Sequence analysis was subsequently used to examine how fish occupy defined regions of eastern Lake Ontario annually and identify patterns in migration strategy. Spawning site fidelity was high for both rivers (91-97%) and annual residency within the Bay of Quinte was low (9.5%). Females spent less time in spawning rivers, migrated to the main lake earlier, and generally travelled further than males. Larger fish also migrated to the main lake first and travelled further, and differences in timing between spawning rivers were minor. Annual differences in timing were observed and were most likely related to environmental differences between years. Cluster analysis was used to identify groups of fish which utilized unique annual migration strategies and demonstrated sex and size had an important influence on the variability in annual spatial occupancy, but the importance of spawning river and year was minimal.

Prediction of Hypoxia in Eutrophic Polymictic Lakes	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Quantifying and predicting the drawdown of dissolved oxygen (DO) in lakes is important to ensuring healthy ecosystems and safe water sources. The characterization of DO depletion using available definitions and models requires extensive monitoring to obtain reliable results. These approaches have been mostly developed for seasonally stratified monomictic and dimictic lakes, limiting their applicability for polymictic systems which stratify and mix repeatedly. We compared the predicted duration of hypoxic events in the three basins of a large eutrophic polymictic lake (Clear Lake, CA, USA) by using three different one-dimensional (1-D) analytical approaches; two being original and requiring minimal input variables. Data on meteorology, lake temperature, and DO were all measured at multiple locations for one year and used to develop a novel method, named the Birge-Winkler method. The daily net surface heat fluxes provided an energy term from which estimates of the onset and length of hypoxic periods could be made with minimal calibration. We used the Lake Number method to evaluate the level of accuracy of the Birge-Winkler method. Finally, we estimated DO values next to the sediments using a Buoyancy Frequency method. Our results from the two original methods provided simple and effective tools for early warning of onset and duration of hypoxia, with a maximum of +/- 3-5 days uncertainty in the predictions. These indices can become powerful decision support tools for addressing aquatic ecological challenges triggered by hypoxia, including fish kills, internal nutrient loading, heavy metals release, and harmful algal blooms.

WATER												Temporary Mediterranean wetlands are characterized by both intra and interannual variations in their environmental conditions. These inherent fluctuations in limnological features affect the seasonal variation in the structure and dynamics of the aquatic communities. In this study, we hypothesized that zooplankton community is coupled to seasonal changes of the environmental variables along the hydroperiod. To get this purpose, the study was focused in monitoring, by collecting monthly samples during an annual period, seven temporary Mediterranean ponds located in the south-eastern region of the Iberian Peninsula (Alto Guadalquivir region, Andalusia). The relationships between zooplankton community and the different limnological variables were analyzed based on two approaches: a Spearman correlation analysis and a correspondence canonical analysis (CCA). The results have shown that chlorophyll-a concentration, Secchi depth, total nitrogen concentration, wetland area and depth were the variables with a greater influence on the zooplankton community, explaining the zooplankton species replacement. Moreover, optima and tolerance of the zooplankton species were obtained from the position of species within CCA diagram, allowing the separation of different groups of zooplankton along the hydroperiod. We finally highlight that the monitoring of zooplankton community and environmental conditions are necessary to evaluate how theses singular and endangered aquatic ecosystems will be affected by anthropogenic activities in the future.

J	Woldesenbet, TA; Elagib, NA				Woldesenbet, Tekalegn Ayele; Elagib, Nadir Ahmed			Spatial-temporal evaluation of different reference evapotranspiration methods based on the climate forecast system reanalysis data	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Evapotranspiration is a major component of the interaction between land-surface processes and the atmosphere. Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) data offer a promising database for overcoming the limitations in availability and reliability of climatological data and, hence, for understanding the evapotranspiration process. Using these data on grid-by-grid daily, seasonal and yearly scales, the present study attempts to advance the spatio-temporal evaluation of two radiation-based and three temperature-based methods for estimating potential evapotranspiration (PET) against estimates of grass reference evapotranspiration (ETo) by FAO Penman-Monteith method (FAO-PM). The analysis was performed for the period 1979-2013, considering the second largest (79 000 km(2)) river system in Ethiopia, that is, Omo-Gibe basin, which accommodates national parks and vast hydropower, cultivation and afforestation developments and discharges its flow to Lake Turkana in Kenya. Despite the large regional variations in climate and elevation, the results in overall emphasize the outperformance of the simple temperature method, viz. Hargreaves-Samani method, in capturing both the annual and seasonal FAO-PM estimates. Calibration of the Hargreaves-Samani equation is, however, a requisite for spectacular improvement of its performance. Accordingly, new coefficients of the equation are proposed. The annual trends in the basin's ETo increased with rising temperature and decreasing relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation, but with decreasing (increasing) rainfall in the upper region (the middle and lower regions). It is deduced that trends in simple methods do not necessarily reflect the true trends in ETo. Annual ETo decreases with increasing elevation and annual rainfall. The present findings are discussed in the context of a worldwide literature, thereby improving the understanding of the best performing PET methods in similar data-scarce national or transboundary rivers basin in Ethiopia, the region or worldwide. The wider implications regarding water loss from reservoirs and the rain-fed food and sugar production in the basin under study are also highlighted.

Monitoring and protecting its water quality are important for economic and social development. Water clarity (Secchi disk depth, SDD) is an important reference index for evaluating water quality. In this study, Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) remote sensing images were utilized together with the Forel-Ule index (FUI) and hue angle alpha to construct an SDD retrieval model, which was applied to the Yangtze River from 2017 to 2020, which was used to describe color in the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) color space to construct an SDD retrieval model that was applied to the Yangtze River for the period 2017-2020. Further, the spatial distribution, seasonal variation, inter-annual variation, and driving factors of the observed SDD variations were analyzed. The spatial distribution pattern of the Yangtze River was high in the west and low in the east. The main driving factors affecting the Yangtze River SDD was sediment runoff, water level, and precipitation. The upstream and downstream Yangtze River SDD were negatively correlated with the change in water level and sediment runoff, whereas the midstream Yangtze River SDD was positively correlated with the change in water level and sediment runoff. The upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and overall SDD showed a weak downward trend, and the middle reaches of the Yangtze River remained almost unchanged.						li, jun sheng/0000-0002-8590-9736; Zhang, Fangfang/0000-0002-9628-1817														2072-4292				JUN	2021	13	12							2260	10.3390/rs13122260	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13122260													WOS:000667882400001

Runoff simulation with eight different flow accumulation algorithms: Recommendations using a spatially distributed and open-source model	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												Flow accumulation algorithms (FAAs) predict the cumulative upstream drainage but each FAA generates a different map and this uncertainty still remains unsolved. This study makes advances in flow path research by testing 8 FAAs and analyzing the uncertainties of 15 simulations. The DR2-2013 (c) SAGAv1.0 hydrological software is presented in a study carried out for two catchment lakes (NE Spain) over a 69 month test period. The best simulations were obtained with two single flow (Rho8 and Deterministic Infinity) and two multiple flow (Multiple Flow with threshold value and Triangular Multiple Flow) algorithms. Correlations between runoff depths and lake levels improved when the test period was split into wet and dry seasons. Correlations also improved with a one-month delay in response time and no delay in the large and small lakes. The DR2-2013 (c) tool helped predict changes in lake volume and the highest model efficiencies were obtained with the multiple flow algorithms. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

At our study location in Darwin, northern Australia, water quality in the harbor is generally good, however dry-season beach closures due to elevated Escherichia coli and enterococci counts are a cause for concern. The sources of these high bacteria counts are currently unknown. To address this, we sampled sewage outfalls, other potential inputs, such as urban rivers and drains, and surrounding beaches, and used genetic fingerprints from E. coli and enterococci communities, fecal markers and 454 pyrosequencing to track contamination sources. A sewage effluent outfall (Larrakeyah discharge) was a source of bacteria, including fecal bacteria that impacted nearby beaches. Two other treated effluent discharges did not appear to influence sites other than those directly adjacent. Several beaches contained fecal indicator bacteria that likely originated from urban rivers and creeks within the catchment.

We compared the geographical discrepancies and potential conservation implications of using two different climate models (Saga and Worldclim) in combination with the species modelling approach Maxent in Bolivia. We estimated ranges of selected bird and fern species biogeographically restricted to either humid montane forest of the northern Bolivian Andes or seasonal dry tropical forests (in the Andes and southern lowlands). Saga and Worldclim predicted roughly similar climate patterns of temperature that were significantly correlated. Precipitation layers of both climate models were also roughly similar, but showed important differences. Species ranges estimated with Worldclim and Saga likewise produced different results. Ranges of species endemic to humid montane forests estimated with Saga had higher AUC (Area under the curve) values than those estimated with Worldclim, which for example predicted the occurrence of humid montane forest bird species near Lake Titicaca, an area that is clearly unsuitable for these species. Likewise, Worldclim overpredicted the occurrence of fern and bird species in the lowlands of the Chapare region and well south of the Andean Elbow, where more seasonal biomes occur. By contrast, Saga predictions were coherent with the known distribution of humid montane forests in the northern Bolivian Andes. Estimated ranges of species endemic to seasonal dry tropical forests predicted with Saga and Worldclim were not statistically different in most cases. However, detailed comparisons revealed that Saga was able to distinguish fragments of seasonal dry tropical forests in rain-shadow valleys of the northern Bolivian Andes, whereas Worldclim was not. These differences highlight the neglected influence of climate layers on modelling results and the importance of using the most accurate climate data available when modelling species distributions.

The green convergence: United States lakes are collectively moving toward a eutrophic state	HARMFUL ALGAE												Nutrient enrichment and climate change promote algal blooms, leading to many lakes being characterized as eutrophic (i.e., green) worldwide. We examined recent eutrophication trends of freshwater lakes at a national scale by collating 32 years (1990-2021) of growing season (July-September) in situ chlorophyll-a, nutrient, transparency, and climate data for 1,082 lakes across 32 freshwater ecoregions in the United States. Based on chlorophyll-a, 78.2 % (427/546) of lakes initially exhibited eutrophic conditions and have remained eutrophic. Moreover, non-eutrophic lakes converged toward a eutrophic state, with oligotrophic (i.e., clear) or mesotrophic (i.e., moderately clear) lakes becoming greener, and hypereutrophic (i.e., very green) becoming less green. Optimized Hot Spot Analysis suggests lakes in the Appalachian Piedmont and Apalachicola freshwater ecoregions eutrophied more rapidly than other locations. Results suggest nutrient management targeting eutrophic lakes has hindered further degradation, but poor preventative management of clear lakes has led to their eutrophication.

Emphasis is placed on results from the National Science Foundation Land-Air-Ice Interactions (LAII) program and on optical remote sensing techniques. Case studies demonstrate that ground-level sensors on stationary or moving track platforms and wide-swath imaging sensors on polar orbiting satellites are particularly useful for capturing optical remote sensing data at sufficient frequency to study tundra vegetation dynamics and changes for the cloud prone Arctic. Less frequent imaging with high spatial resolution instruments on aircraft and lower orbiting satellites enable more detailed analyses of land cover change and calibration/validation of coarser resolution observations. The strongest signals of ecosystem change detected thus far appear to correspond to expansion of tundra shrubs and changes in the amount and extent of thaw lakes and ponds. Changes in shrub cover and extent have been documented by modem repeat imaging that matches archived historical aerial photography. NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) time series provide a 20-year record for determining changes in greenness that relates to photosynthetic activity, net primary production, and growing season length. The strong contrast between land materials and surface waters enables changes in lake and pond extent to be readily measured and monitored. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Likewise, due to anthropogenic activities, the southern gulf of Lake Tana is an impacted region, and the production of Nile tilapia fish is reduced. For this reason, the aim of this study was to conduct a histopathological-based study of 48 Nile tilapia fishes' health status at the southern gulf of Lake Tana and aquaculture using a cross-sectional study from February 2023 to May 2023. The study evaluated the histopathology of the gill, liver, gonads, and spleen organs using descriptive statistics accompanied by a 2 x 2 contingency table and t-test analysis. During the study, different histological alterations were detected, and the numbers of fish affected by a specific histological alteration were presented as percentage prevalence; hence, from the total fish examined, hyperplasia (54.15%), followed by pigment deposits (52%), hemorrhage (50%), and immune cell infiltration (50%), respectively, were the most frequently detected alterations. However, Nile tilapias from the southern gulf of Lake Tana were 1.4 (odds ratio) times more likely to show histopathological alterations than those from aquaculture, although statistically, was not significant (p > 0.05). In addition, the study found the mean value of the fish index (95.3) and regressive indices of the gill (13.6), liver (14.8), and gonad (12.3); moreover, the inflammatory indices of the spleen organ (11.3) and mean severity grade value of the gill (2.35) and gonad (1.7) organs, respectively, were obtained from the southern gulf of Lake Tana, and all those values were significantly higher (p < 0.05) from this site as compared to the aquaculture. In general, it has been found that tilapias from the southern gulf of Lake Tana showed higher pathological severity as compared with aquaculture. Among the four target organs evaluated, liver organs were observed to be the most damaged, while gonads were the least impacted organs. Therefore, it has been concluded that tilapia fish are living in abnormal conditions, so to ensure a sustainable fishery, water pollutant sources from Bahirdar city must receive proper attention, and future studies should consider age differences, seasonal variation, and the detection of specific pollutants.					; Berihun, Asnakew/KGL-7369-2024	Malede, Birhan Anagaw/0009-0009-3596-8939; Berihun, Asnakew Mulaw/0000-0001-5804-125X														1746-6148				SEP 12	2024	20	1							409	10.1186/s12917-024-04230-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-024-04230-5								39267064					WOS:001312195100002

To investigate this inconsistency, we examined nanoflagellate diversity in Lake Biwa, Japan by 18S rRNA gene clone libraries using universal eukaryote and kinetoplastid-specific primers. We also examined the abundance of kinetoplastids by Catalyzed Reporter Deposition-Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization. No, kinetoplastid sequences were detected in the universal eukaryote primers library from epilimnion and hypolimnion in different seasons. However, kinetoplastid flagellates were detected with kinetoplastid-specific probe from all of the seasons and contributed up to 11.9 and 36.0% of total eukaryotes in the epilimnion and hypolimnion, respectively. Thus, kinetoplastids probably are a significant, sometimes dominant, group in the hypolimnion, contributing up to 43.7% of the total flagellates. Using group-specific primers, kinetoplastid sequences were also obtained from both epilimnion and hypolimnion library. Therefore, we attributed the inconsistency to the divergent nature of 18S rRNA gene of kinetoplastids, which lead to their undetection in the universal eukaryote primer libraries. This study revealed that kinetoplastids have significant ecological importance in the hypolimnion of Lake Biwa, suggesting that these flagellates have been overlooked in other studies using universal eukaryote primers.

Short-term and long-term carbon dynamics in a northern peatland-stream-lake continuum: A catchment approach	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Northern forests and peatlands are globally significant elements in carbon (C) cycling. Recent research has also highlighted the role of aquatic ecosystems in landscape C budgets. We measured contemporary carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) exchange, lateral C transfer (dissolved organic carbon (DOC), CO2, CH4), and long-term C accumulation in a peatland-stream-lake-continuum in north boreal Finland. On an annual scale the peatland, a rich fen, was a relatively strong C sink (27 g Cm-2 a(-1)). The stream that traversed through the fen had high CO2 and CH4 effluxes (on average 480 and 12 g C m(-2) a(-1), respectively) to the atmosphere, while the small oligotrophic lake was a small C gas source per unit area (15 g C m(-2) a(-1)). A catchment C budget was compiled by supplementing these measured values with literature values for the forests. The aquatic C fluxes equaled similar to 13% of the net C input by the forest and peatlands in the catchment, and the largest component was the downstream transfer of DOC. This study supports the proposition that ignoring the aquatic component would result in an overestimated regional C uptake. The contemporary net C input estimate for the fen, after accounting for the C transfer, was larger than the long-term C accumulation rate based on peat cores (22 versus 6.3-16.0 g C m(-2) a(-1)). This study provides reference values for both the contemporary C exchange and long-term C accumulation history, and the terrestrial-aquatic linkage from the boreal-subarctic ecotone, which is vulnerable to ongoing climatic change.

However, these types of methods were developed in small, low-order streams, and are therefore, infrequently applied to large rivers. To that end, phytoplankton communities and environmental variables were monitored in 30 sampling segments of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, China during the wet (July-August) and dry (November-December) seasons in 2017-2018. We developed a phytoplankton-based index of biotic integrity (P-IBI) and used the index to assess the ecological health of the Yangtze River. Relationships among P-IBI, its component metrics, and environmental factors were analyzed across different seasons.ResultsResults obtained from the P-IBI indicated that the phytoplankton-based ecological health of the Yangtze River was rated as "good" during both seasons, with an overall better condition in the dry season. During the wet season, there were scattered river segments with P-IBI ratings of "fair" or below. Water quality and land use appeared to shape the patterns of P-IBI. In the wet season, P-IBI negatively correlated with total phosphorus, nitrate, total suspended solids, turbidity, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen. In the dry season, P-IBI positively correlated with total nitrogen, ammonium, and nitrite, and negatively correlated with water temperature.ConclusionsThe ecological health of the Yangtze River as reflected by the P-IBI exhibited spatial and temporal variability, with the effect of water quality being greater than that of local land use. This study indicated the importance of considering seasonal effects in detecting large river ecological health. These findings enhanced our understanding of the ecological health and characterized potential benchmarks for management of the Yangtze River. These findings also may be applicable to other large rivers elsewhere.

The genus is slow evolving but is resilient, and widespread worldwide. Two recently described species occur in the Eastern Brazilian Amazon, Isoetes serracarajensis and Isoetes cangae. They are found in the ironstone grasslands known as Canga. While I. serracarajensis is present mostly in seasonal water bodies, I. cangae is known to occur in a single permanent lake at the South mountain range. In this work, we undertake an extensive morphological, physiological and genetic characterization of both species to establish species boundaries and better understand the morphological and genetic features of these two species. Our results indicate that the morphological differentiation of the species is subtle and requires a quantitative assessment of morphological elements of the megaspore for diagnosis. We did not detect differences in microspore output, but morphological peculiarities may establish a reproductive barrier. Additionally, genetic analysis using DNA barcodes and whole chloroplast genomes indicate that although the plants are genetically very similar both approaches provide diagnostic characters. There was no indication of population structuring I. serracarajensis. These results set the basis for a deeper understanding of the evolution of the Isoetes genus.

In the present study, 1 mu g/L microcystin-LR (MC-LR) was observed to induce apoptosis in the testes of male Rana nigromaculata via the mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pathways at exposure times ranging from 7 d to 14 d. The results showed that reactive oxygen species production and malondialdehyde content were positively correlated with exposure time. Antioxidant enzyme contents, such as reduced glutathione and glutathione peroxidase rapidly decreased, implying that the defense system of the testes induces oxidative damage. MC-LR significantly stimulated the release of cytochrome c in the testes, thereby improving the protein expressions of Bax and caspases-3, 8, and 9 (p < 0.01) and inhibiting the protein expression of Bcl-2 with prolonged exposure (p < 0.01). Ultrastructural observations showed distention of the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum and deformation of the nucleolus. Moreover, prolonged exposure times strengthened and weakened the relative expression levels of C/EBP homologous protein and GRP78, respectively. These results indicate that MC-LR-induced apoptosis of the testes in male frogs in vivo may occur through the mitochondrial and ER pathways. It also further proves our previous findings that MC-LR can induce toxicity in the male reproductive system of R. nigromaculata in vitro. The findings show that MC-LR is highly hazardous to frogs and that the accepted drinking water limit of 1 mu g/L MC-LR exerts significant toxicity to amphibians. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Nitrogen losses through surface runoff were measured for five treatments, including CK without N application, C200, C300 simulating the conventional practices, CO200, and CO300. Optimum N rate was applied for C200 and CO200, and 30% of chemical fertilizer was substituted with organic fertilizer for CO200 and CO300 with respect to C200 and C300, respectively. Rice season had higher runoff coefficients than wheat season. Approximately 52% of total N was lost as NH4+-N in rice season, ranging from 21 to 83%, and in wheat season, the proportion of NO3--N in total N averaged 53% with a variation from 38 to 67%. The N treatments lost less total N in rice season (1.67-10.7 kg N ha-1) than inwheat season (1.72-17.1 kg N ha(-1)). These suggested that a key to controlling N runoff losses from rice-wheat rotation was to limit NO3--N accumulation in wheat season. In both seasons, N runoff losses for C200 and CO300 were lower than those for C300. CO200 better cut N losses than C200 and CO300, with 64 and 57% less N in rice and wheat seasons than C300, respectively. Compared with the conventional practices, optimum N inputs integrated with co-application of organic and chemical fertilizers could reduce N runoff losses with a better N balance under rice-wheat rotation.					, 曹彦圣/AAR-3318-2020; Zhou, Sheng/B-7255-2008	Zhou, Sheng/0000-0002-6675-3991; Sun, Huifeng/0000-0002-7666-1097													0944-1344	1614-7499				FEB	2017	24	5					4841	4850		10.1007/s11356-016-8191-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-8191-y								27987124					WOS:000397007200052

We measured gully dimensions before and after the onset of the rainy season in 2016 to determine soil loss due to gully erosion. The temporal changes of gully expansion were determined by digitizing gully plain area from Google earth images taken in 2005 and 2013. The results support that gullies were expanding at higher rate in recent years. Area covered by gullies in the watershed increased from 1.84 to 3.43 ha between 2005 and 2013, indicating that the proportion of the watershed covered by gullies was nearly doubled in the investigated period. The estimated soil loss from the main watershed and gullies catchment was 6 and 2 t ha(-1) year(-1) in 2015, and was 7 and 9 t ha(-1) year(-1) in 2016, respectively. The results support that gullies were the main contributors of soil erosion in the watershed, and that integrated soil and water conservation measures are required to reduce soil erosion.					; Adem, Anwar/F-2612-2018; Tilahun, Seifu/ABE-2501-2020	Adem, Anwar Assefa/0000-0001-6374-745X; 													2190-5487	2190-5495				APR 13	2020	10	5							106	10.1007/s13201-020-01193-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13201-020-01193-4													WOS:000527987200003

The high rate of deposition or release of heavy metals in sediments is a problem to be solved. Southwest China is most famous in the world for the continuous distribution of karst area, for holding the largest area of bare carbonate rocks and for experiencing the strongest karst development in the world. The trace metals in 15 sites of Yelang Lake were determined by diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) method. The distribution and release mechanism of Cr, Ni, Cu, Cd, Zn and Pb under high geochemical backgrounds in the karst area of Guizhou Province in Southwest China were discussed. Based on the DGT concentration and pore water analysis, the distribution order of these heavy metal contents is usually upstream (SC), middle (DCB) and downstream (SW) areas of the lake, which increases during the dry season and decreases during the wet season. There was no significant difference in concentration between 0-4 and 4-8 cm depth (p < 0.05). The R values of heavy metals in the dry and wet seasons were highest with cadmium (Cd) and lowest with chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb). The results of the metal geo-accumulation index (I-geo) and the potential ecological risk index are highest on Cd and lowest on Cr. The mean concentrations of Cr, Cd, Zn, Ni (DCB, SW), Pb (SC, DCB) and Cu (SC) are between the corresponding threshold effect level and the probable effect level, and the average potential ecological risk is ranked in descending order of Cd > Pb > Zn > Cu > Ni > Cr. These three areas are at medium risk levels and the potential ecological risks increases from upstream to downstream. The deposition rate of heavy metals in Yelang Lake sediment was higher than the release rate and the ecological risk from heavy metals was relatively low. Since Cd is the main ecological risk factor in the lake, more attention needs to be given to Cd contamination in the Yelang Lake basin of the karst area.					; Liu, Hongyan/AAA-8294-2020; Luo, Kai/HHT-0937-2022; Xu, Mengqi/GWV-7943-2022; Yu, Enjiang/HMP-4394-2023	Luo, Kai/0000-0003-3787-9541; 													1436-3240	1436-3259				JUN	2020	34	6					793	805		10.1007/s00477-020-01799-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-020-01799-9		APR 2020											WOS:000526256700001

Our study sites were four lakes with different trophic states within the Osterseen Lake District in Southern Germany. Flow cytometry counts and next-generation sequencing were used from April to October 2015 to analyse the occurrence of Synechococcus and heterotrophic prokaryotes in relation to physical and chemical habitat properties. Synechococcus was identified as the main representative of the autotrophic picoplankton, but cell counts varied widely. The Synechococcus taxa identified by flow cytometry were confirmed by sequencing data, but the comparison of the flow cytometry counts and sequence data revealed discrepancies for cells in the exponential phase. The eutrophic Lake Schiffhuettensee was dominated by algae and had the highest abundance of heterotrophic prokaryotes. The presence of distinct operational taxonomic units of Synechococcus varied seasonally and was lake-specific, indicating local niche adaptation. Our study sheds light on the ecology of these important primary producers in freshwater systems. Furthermore, the discrepancy observed with the direct comparison of the widely used methods of next-generation sequencing and flow cytometry should serve as a caveat for future data analysis.

J	Xiao, JL; Xu, QH; Nakamura, T; Yang, XL; Liang, WD; Inouchi, Y				Xiao, JL; Xu, QH; Nakamura, T; Yang, XL; Liang, WD; Inouchi, Y			Holocene vegetation variation in the Daihai Lake region of north-central China: a direct indication of the Asian monsoon climatic history	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												DH99a sediment core recovered at the center of Daihai Lake in north-central China was analyzed at 4-cm intervals for pollen assemblage and concentration. The pollen record spanning the last ca 10,000 yr revealed a detailed history of vegetation and climate changes over the Daihai Lake region during the Holocene. From ca 10,250 to 7900 cal yr BP, and herbs and shrubs dominated the lake basin in company with patches of mixed pine and broadleaved forests, indicating a mild and dry climatic condition. Over this period, the woody plants displayed an increasing trend, which may suggest a gradual increase in warmth and humidity. The period between ca 7900 and 4450 cal yr BP exhibits large-scale covers of mixed coniferous and broadleaved forests, marking a warm and humid climate. Changes in the composition of the forests indicate that both temperature and precipitation displayed obvious fluctuations during this period, i.e., cool and humid ca 7900-7250 cal yr BP, warm and slightly humid ca 7250-6050 cal yr BP, warm and humid between ca 6050 and 5100 cal yr BP, mild and slightly humid ca 5100-4800 cal yr BP, and mild and humid ca 4800-4450 cal yr BP. The period can be viewed as the Holocene optimum (characterized by a warm and moist climate) of north-central China, with the maximum (dominated both by warmest temperatures and by richest precipitations) occurring from ca 6050 to 5100 cal yr BP. During the period of ca 4450-2900 cal yr BP, the woody plants declined, and the climate generally became cooler and drier than the preceding period. This period is characterized by a cold, dry episode from ca 4450 to 3950 cal yr BP, a warm, slightly humid interval between ca 3950 and 3500 cal yr BP and a mild, slightly dry episode from ca 3500 to 2900 cal yr BP, and appears to be a transition from warm and humid to cold and dry climatic conditions. Since ca 2900 cal yr ago, the forests disappeared and the vegetation density decreased, reflecting a cool and dry climate. However, a relative recovery of the woody plants occurring between ca 1700 and 1350 cal yr BP may denote an increase both in temperature and in precipitation. Fluctuations in the climatic condition of the Daihai Lake region were not only related to changes in the seasonal distribution of solar insolation and in the axis and intensity of the ocean current in the western North Pacific but were also closely linked to variations in the position and strength of polar high-pressure systems and in the pattern and intensity of the Westerly winds.

J	Adjovu, GE; Stephen, H; Ahmad, S				Adjovu, Godson Ebenezer; Stephen, Haroon; Ahmad, Sajjad			Spatial and Temporal Dynamics of Key Water Quality Parameters in a Thermal Stratified Lake Ecosystem: The Case Study of Lake Mead	EARTH												Lake Mead located in the Arizona-Nevada region of the Mohave Dessert is a unique and complex water system whose flow follows that of a warm monomictic lake. Although monomictic lakes experience thermal stratification for almost the entire year with a period of complete mixing, the lake on occasion deviates from this phenomenon, undergoing incomplete turnovers categorized with light stratifications every other year. The prolonged drought and growing anthropogenic activities have the potential to considerably impact the quality of the lake. Lake Mead and by extension the Boulder Basin receive cooler flow from the Colorado River and flow with varying temperatures from the Las Vegas Wash (LVW), which impacts its stratification and complete turnovers. This study analyzes four key water quality parameters (WQPs), namely, total dissolved solids (TDS), total suspended solids (TSS), temperature, and dissolved oxygen (DO), using statistical and spatial analyses to understand their variations in light of the lake stratifications and turnovers to further maintain its overall quality and sustainability. The study also evaluates the impacts of hydrological variables including in and out flows, storage, evaporation, and water surface elevation on the WQPs. The results produced from the analysis show significant levels of TDS, TSS, and temperature from the LVW and Las Vegas Bay regions compared with the Boulder Basin. LVW is the main channel for conveying effluents from several wastewater treatment facilities into the lake. We observed an increase in the levels of TDS, TSS, and temperature water quality in the epilimnion compared with the other layers of the lake. The metalimnion and the hypolimnion layer, however, showed reduced DO due to depletion by algal blooms. We observed statistically significant differences in the WQPs throughout various months, but not in the case for season and year, an indication of relatively consistent variability throughout each season and year. We also observed a no clear trend of influence of outflows and inflows on TDS, temperature, and DO. TSS concentrations in the lake, however, remained constant, irrespective of the inflows and outflows, possibly due to the settling of the sediments and the reservoir capacity.					; Ahmad, Sajjad/A-2867-2008	Stephen, Haroon/0000-0003-3116-1416; Adjovu, Godson Ebenezer/0000-0003-3169-6410; Ahmad, Sajjad/0000-0002-9903-9321														2673-4834				SEP	2023	4	3					461	502		10.3390/earth4030025	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/earth4030025													WOS:001114262700001

The use of eDNA as a tool for providing information on population relative abundance offers much potential although few examples in a fishery context have been documented. In this study, we collected 600 water samples from 30 lakes in Qu & eacute;bec (Canada) to document the relationship between brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis) angling data and their lake's eDNA concentration. Model selection with angling data and environmental parameters was used to find the best predictive model for eDNA concentration. We found a strong correlation between the average fish density from current and previous years (fish harvested/ha, adj. R-2 = 0.76) with the mean eDNA concentration among lakes, supporting the growing trends in the literature. We observed very similar levels of correlation either when eDNA and angling data were from the same year or different years. We also found a pronounced inter-year difference in lakes' eDNA quantity measured in 2019 and 2020. We hypothesize that the main drivers for this difference were inter-seasonal variation including water temperature and associated variation in fish behavior. These results support the usefulness of eDNA as a quantitative tool for exploited fish populations.

The invasive Pedicularis poses a severe threat to native biodiversity, ecological security, socioeconomic development, and human health in the Bayinbuluke Grassland, China. It is imperative and useful to obtain a precise distribution map of Pedicularis for controlling its spread. This study used the positive and unlabeled learning (PUL) method to extract Pedicularis from the Bayinbuluke Grassland based on multi-period Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope remote sensing images. A change rate model for a single land cover type and a dynamic transfer matrix were constructed under GIS to reflect the spatiotemporal distribution of Pedicularis. The results reveal that (1) the PUL method accurately identifies Pedicularis in satellite images, achieving F1-scores above 0.70 and up to 0.94 across all three datasets: PlanetScope data (seven features), Sentinel-2 data (seven features), and Sentinel-2 data (thirteen features). (2) When comparing the three datasets, the number of features is more important than the spatial resolution in terms of use in the PUL method of Pedicularis extraction. Nevertheless, when compared with PlanetScope data, Sentinel-2 data demonstrated a higher level of accuracy in predicting the distribution of Pedicularis. (3) During the 2019-2021 growing season, the distribution area of Pedicularis decreased, and the distribution was mainly concentrated in the northeast and southeast of Bayinbuluke Swan Lake. The acquired spatiotemporal pattern of invasive Pedicularis could potentially be used to aid in controlling Pedicularis spread or elimination, and the methods proposed in this study could be adopted by the government as a low-cost strategy to identify priority areas in which to concentrate efforts to control and continue monitoring Pedicularis invasion.					; Tang, JIAKUI/HHS-8723-2022; Zhang, An-An/GYV-0139-2022	Wang, Wuhua/0000-0003-3875-0459; Wang, Yanjiao/0000-0002-7850-1062; tang, jia kui/0000-0001-7069-1044; 														2072-4292				SEP	2023	15	18							4383	10.3390/rs15184383	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15184383													WOS:001077778300001

In a previous study, a synthetic sex pheromone component 7 alpha,12 alpha, 24-trihydroxy-5 alpha-cholan-3-one 24-sulfate (3kPZS) was applied to sea lamprey traps in eight streams at a final in-stream concentration of 10(-12) M. Application of 3kPZS increased sea lamprey catch, but where and when 3kPZS had the greatest impact was not determined. Here, by applying 3kPZS to additional streams, we determined that overall increases in yearly exploitation rate (proportion of sea lampreys that were marked, released, and subsequently recaptured) were highest (20-40 %) in wide streams (similar to 40 m) with low adult sea lamprey abundance (< 1000). Wide streams with low adult abundance may be representative of low-attraction systems for adult sea lamprey and, in the absence of other attractants (larval odor, sex pheromone), sea lamprey may have been more responsive to a partial sex pheromone blend emitted from traps. Furthermore, we found that the largest and most consistent responses to 3kPZS were during nights early in the trapping season, when water temperatures were increasing. This may have occurred because, during periods of increasing water temperatures, sea lamprey become more active and males at large may not have begun to release sex pheromone. In general, our results are consistent with those for pheromones of invertebrates, which are most effective when pest density is low and when pheromone competition is low.

J	Anand, M; Nimmala, P				Anand, Mridu; Nimmala, Pavani			Seasonal incidence of respiratory viral infections in Telangana, India: utility of a multiplex PCR assay to bridge the knowledge gap	TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH												Objective The diagnosis of acute viral respiratory tract infections (RTI) is a challenge due to overlapping clinical presentations and lack of availability of robust diagnostic methods. This in turn leads to lack of data regarding incidence and seasonality of viral RTIs which could potentially help to implement efficient strategies of antimicrobial stewardship as well as vaccine administration. Here we utilise a commercial Multiplex PCR assay for the early diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infections and discuss their epidemiology. Methods A prospective, observational study was conducted over a period of 3 years (2017-2019). Respiratory samples received from outpatients and inpatients with suspected acute RTIs from three multispeciality hospitals located in the twin cities of Hyderabad-Secunderabad were subjected to FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA). Results were tabulated and statistically analysed. Results Of 513 samples, 261 (50.9%) were positive for one or more pathogens. The viruses detected included influenza A H1 2009 (26.0%), human rhinovirus/enterovirus (21.5%), influenza A H3N2 (17.0%), human metapneumovirus (9.4%), influenza B (6.6%), coronavirus (4.9%), parainfluenza virus (4.5%), respiratory syncytial virus (3.1%) and adenovirus (2.1%). The largest number of samples was positive during the monsoon season (43.8%). Influenza A H1 2009 peaked in the monsoon season with another, smaller peak in February. Conclusions There is a bimodal peak of respiratory infections relative to the seasons, and vaccine administration should take place in April-May before the advent of the monsoons in this part of the country. Multiplexed PCR may be used as first line for diagnosis of viral infections so that infection control measures can be prioritised and antibiotic administration can be avoided in those who do not require it.																			1360-2276	1365-3156				DEC	2020	25	12					1503	1509		10.1111/tmi.13501	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tmi.13501		OCT 2020						32996228					WOS:000579116800001

In order to derive this inherent optical property of waters from remote sensing reflectance, a multiband quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) was calibrated and validated for the highly turbid water of Taihu Lake in China. A data set collected on November 8, 2007, from Meiliang Bay of Lake Taihu was first used to calibrate a regional QAA algorithm for this area, and other two independent data sets, which were collected on August 22, 2006, and November 10, 2008, from the same area, were used to further validate the local algorithm. By shifting the reflectance wavelength from the red region to near infrared, the local QAA algorithm works well for this highly turbid water, the percent difference between the derived and measured absorption coefficients is less than 20% for all 13 samples in the data set of 2007, and most of them are less than 10%. The regional calibrated algorithm also has great result in deriving the absorption for the data set of 2008. However, the performance of the local algorithm also has various seasonal properties. It failed in deriving absorption for the data set of August 2006, unless the reference wavelength is shifted to even more long ones. It has been suggested in this paper that the seasonal and regional information is necessary for using the QAA algorithm in different optical property waters.

Non-point-source (NPS) pollution affects river water quality. Exploring the impact of landscapes on river water quality is crucial for the control of water pollution in a basin. Current researchers focus on the impact of landscape pattern change on NPS pollution in the basin, but few consider climate, terrain, soil, and other geographical factors. In this study, we selected a subtropical agricultural basin in China named Chaohu Lake basin as the study area, added precipitation, soil erosion resistance, and slope to the original landscape pattern indicators. We quantified the spatial scale effect and seasonal dependence of integrated landscape indicators on water quality and comprehensively analyzed the optimal spatial scale and key landscape indicators. According to the nonlinear relationship between the key landscape indicators and river nutrients, we also determined the Type-1 threshold values of key landscape indicators for water quality protection in the basin. The results showed that the rivers in Chaohu Lake basin were mainly polluted by nitrogen and phosphorus. The strength of interpretation of the integrated landscape indicators of river water quality increased with riparian zone width. We determined the subbasin scale to be the optimal spatial scale. The key landscape indicators affecting water quality in the wet season at the optimal scale were precipitation and aggregation index of construction land (AI(bul)), whereas those in the dry season were AI(bul) and COHESION. The interpretation of the key landscape indicators in the wet season was slightly higher than that in the dry season. The above conclusions provide a scientific reference for NPS pollution control and water quality protection in subtropical agricultural basins.

Anne			Assisted dispersal and retention of lichen-dominated biocrust material for arctic restoration	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Arctic biocrust loss due to industrial activity can have long-lasting ecological impacts, highlighting the importance of restoring disturbed tundra environments. This research focused on biocrust establishment on substrates of by-product materials from diamond mining (crushed rock, lake sediment, processed kimberlite), inoculant dispersal (dry placement, slurry), habitat amelioration (erosion control blanket, tundra soil, woody debris), and containment (jute mat), over three field seasons at Diavik Diamond Mine, Inc., Northwest Territories. Three years after inoculation, lichens were detected on 100% of inoculated plots and 70% of uninoculated plots (likely blown in from inoculated plots). Uninoculated plots had significantly lower species richness and vegetation cover than inoculated plots. Biocrust retention was highest on plots with erosion control blanket, containment, woody debris, and crushed rock; larger scale application of these treatments should be assessed in future. Plots with processed kimberlite, no habitat amelioration or tundra soil, and no containment had the lowest cover, species richness, and individual species abundance in year 3. This research suggests that active restoration techniques using lichen biocrust inoculation and habitat amelioration is required for successful biocrust revegetation outcomes on substrates of mining by-products in the arctic.

This study investigated the spatiotemporal variability of basic physicochemical parameters of nearshore surface waters in Mwanza Gulf (Lake Victoria), Kigoma Bay (Lake Tanganyika), and Wissmann Bay (Lake Nyasa). Water quality was evaluated using the water quality index (WQI) method. Results showed that N and P nutrient pollution was relatively severe in central and southern parts of Mwanza Gulf owing to external agricultural emissions and internal release associated with physically disturbed sediment resuspension. External inputs from inflowing surface runoffs from the city of Mwanza typically enhanced N loading in northern parts of the gulf during the rainy season. Poor water quality was found in central and southern parts of Mwanza Gulf, especially in the rainy season. Algal blooms and NH4+-N (total P and total N) were the main factors driving water quality degradation in the rainy (dry) season. Kigoma Bay and Wissmann Bay both had good water quality, except in river mouth areas in Lake Nyasa during the rainy season. The degradation in water quality was caused primarily by increased land-based nutrient and turbidity inputs. To respond to challenges associated with climate change and local socioeconomic development, long-term monitoring of the lacustrine environment and systematic limnological studies will be required, not only in the three bays but also more widely throughout the three lakes and their basins.

HYDROBIOLOGIA												Amazonian floodplain lakes, which are of different types based on their proximity to the main river channels, are subjected to a strong seasonal hydrologic cycle and have different habitat types within them. We hypothesized that these two spatial scales (lake type, and habitat type within lakes), and the temporal scale associated with hydrological seasons help explain the high fish diversity of the Amazon basin. We sampled three lake types categorized by proximity and connectivity with the Solimoes River (island, coastal, and mainland) in 2011 during both high and low water seasons. Within these lakes, we sampled three habitat types (open water, flooded forest, and macrophyte banks). Although comparisons of diversity indices revealed few differences with respect to overall species numbers, actual species composition, which is not included in calculation of diversity indices, differed markedly at all three scales. Although many species (86) were common to all three types of lakes, each type also had many unique species (11-20), as did within-lake habitat type (10-15) and hydrologic season (26 each). Thus, these temporal and spatial scales are important to the detection and understanding of fish species diversity in this region, and will be important to keep in mind when designing preserves.					; Freitas, Carlos/I-5386-2012; Freitas, Carlos/F-1752-2014; DE SOUZA, FLAVIA/AAF-1526-2021	Petrere Jr, Miguel/0000-0003-2000-6699; Freitas, Carlos/0000-0001-5406-0998; Souza, Flavia/0000-0002-8723-8956													0018-8158	1573-5117				AUG	2016	776	1					99	110		10.1007/s10750-016-2738-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-016-2738-2													WOS:000378225900007

However, limited knowledge has been gained to date on the concentrations and distributions of HFRs in particular within certain regions. In the present study, legacy and emerging HFRs were systematically measured in suspended particle matter (SPM) and sediments collected in 2014 from the middle and lower reach of the Yellow River in Henan province. The total concentrations of HFRs in SPM among the three seasons were 42.2 +/- 91.2 ng g(-1), which was far higher than the corresponding values of HFRs in sediments (1.82 +/- 2.94 ng g(-1)). In this study, PBDEs, DP and EBFRs in sediment almost exhibited relatively lower levels as compared to those found in other studies, where the limited usage of HFRs in the middle and lower stream of the Yellow River was probably the major impact factor. EBFR was the predominate pollutant from SPM and sediments in most of the sampling sites, suggesting that EBFRs were widely used nowadays as substitute materials of 'old' FRs. The mean concentration values of DBDPE/BDE-209 in SPM and sediments were apparently higher than those of previous studies. Furthermore, it is interesting to reveal that herein almost all of the HFR concentrations were unrelated to the population and GDP, which might be attributed to the characteristics of 'elevated stream' of the Yellow River as well as the complex river systems in Henan province.

A.; Alotiby, Mohammed			Atmospheric dispersion modeling and radiological environmental impact assessment for normal operation of a proposed pressurized water reactor in the eastern coast of Saudi Arabia	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY												As a licensing requirement, constructing a new nuclear power plant (NPP) requires performing a radiological environmental impact assessment (REIA) which includes the study of the radioactive releases' effects on the surrounding environment and population. These discharges could be aerial: from chimneys (stacks), evaporation, erosion, re-suspension; or could be liquid discharges: into rivers, lakes, estuaries or coastal waters. This work presents an REIA study for a pressurized water reactor (PWR) assumed to be installed in Umm Huwayd in the Eastern Coast of Saudi Arabia. HYSPLIT tool is utilized to estimate the air concentration and ground deposition of certain released radionuclides such as: Cs-137 and I-131. It is also used to analyze the exposure dose's spatial distribution around the nominated site according to direction and distance. The radionuclide dispersion profiles for each of the four weather seasons were examined. The results revealed that the radionuclides dispersion profile is controlled by the weather parameters that varies from season to season. Around the nominated site, Umm Huwayd, the maximum estimated air concentration for I-131 radionuclide was 5.6 x 10(-6) Bq m(-3), and the annual air deposition for Cs-137 at the selected site had a peak value of 3.3 x 10(-9) Bq m(-2). GENII is also utilized to estimate the annual effective dose equivalent and cancer risks around the nominated site. The ingestion pathway contributed to the most of annual effective dose equivalent with 68.35% of the total, while external exposure and inhalation pathways contributed 30.50% and 1.15%, respectively. It is shown that in the nominated site the total annual rate of new cases of cancer (cancer incidence) is 1/10(9) persons. The cancer death annual rate (cancer fatality) is 5/10(10) person. Therefore, the highest risk level around the selected site is much lower than the tolerable levels as suggested by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP).

Suitability of Watershed Models to Predict Distributed Hydrologic Response in the Awramba Watershed in Lake Tana Basin	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Planning effective landscape interventions is an important tool to fight against land degradation and requires knowledge on spatial distribution of runoff. The objective of this paper was to test models that predict temporal and spatial distribution of runoff. The selected models were parameter-efficient semi-distributed watershed model (PED-WM), Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning integrated hydrological modeling system (HBV-IHMS), and Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). We choose 7-km(2) Awramba watershed in the Lake Tana basin with detailed hydrological information for testing these models. Discharge at the outlet, rainfall, and distributed information on infiltration rates, water table, and extent of the saturated area were collected from 2013 to 2015. The maximum saturated area was 65% of the watershed. Infiltration rates exceeded rainfall intensities 91% of the time. Hence, saturation excess runoff was the main runoff mechanism. Models were calibrated for the rainy seasons in 2013 and 2014 and validated for 2015. For daily flow validation, the PED-WM model (Nash-Sutcliff efficiency, NSE=061) outperformed HBV-IHMS (NSE=051) and SWAT (NSE=048). Performance on monthly time step was similar. Difference in model behavior depended on runoff mechanism. In PED-WM, saturation excess is the main direct runoff process and could predict the maximum extent of the saturated area closely at 69%. HBV-IHMS model runoff simulation depended on soil moisture status and evapotranspiration, and hence was able to simulate saturation excess flow but not the extent of the saturated area. SWAT, where infiltration excess is the main runoff mechanism, could only predict the monthly discharges well. This study shows that prevailing runoff mechanisms and distribution of runoff source areas should be used for proper model selection. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Differences in spatiotemporal variations of atmospheric PAH levels between North America and Europe: Data from two air monitoring projects	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL												Atmospheric concentrations of high molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were measured at five sites for almost two decades near the North American Great Lakes, as part of the Integrated Atmospheric Deposition Network (IADN), and at three remote sites around Europe, as part of the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP). The primary objectives were to reveal the spatial distributions, long-term temporal trends, and seasonal variations of atmospheric PAH concentrations and to investigate potential differences between these two regions. Atmospheric PAH concentrations at the urban sites in Chicago and Cleveland near Great Lakes were about 20 times (depending on PAH congener and sampling site) greater than those at the rural sites except for Kosetice in the Czech Republic. Atmospheric PAH concentrations at Kosetice, also a rural site, were about one-third of those at Chicago and Cleveland, but 10 times higher than those at other rural sites (Sturgeon Point, Sleeping Bear Dunes, Eagle Harbor, Aspvreten, and Spitsbergen). Significant long-term decreasing trends of all these PAH atmospheric concentrations were observed at Chicago and Cleveland. For the other sites, either less significant or no long-term decreasing trends were observed. Clear seasonality was observed at Sturgeon Point, Sleeping Bear Dunes, Kosetice, and Spitsbergen, with the highest PAH concentrations observed in mid-January. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Nelson, DM; Verschuren, D; Urban, MA; Hu, FS				Nelson, David M.; Verschuren, Dirk; Urban, Michael A.; Hu, Feng Sheng			Long-term variability and rainfall control of savanna fire regimes in equatorial East Africa	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Fires burning the vast grasslands and savannas of Africa significantly influence the global carbon cycle. Projecting the impacts of future climate change on fire-mediated biogeochemical processes in these dry tropical ecosystems requires understanding of how various climate factors influence regional fire regimes. To examine climatevegetationfire linkages in dry savanna, we conducted macroscopic and microscopic charcoal analysis on the sediments of the past 25000years from Lake Challa, a deep crater lake in equatorial East Africa. The charcoal-inferred shifts in local and regional fire regimes were compared with previously published reconstructions of temperature, rainfall, seasonal drought severity, and vegetation dynamics to evaluate millennial-scale drivers of fire occurrence. Our charcoal data indicate that fire in the dry lowland savanna of southeastern Kenya was not fuel-limited during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and Late Glacial, in contrast to many other regions throughout the world. Fire activity remained high at Lake Challa probably because the relatively high mean-annual temperature (approximate to 22 degrees C) allowed productive C4 grasses with high water-use efficiency to dominate the landscape. From the LGM through the middle Holocene, the relative importance of savanna burning in the region varied primarily in response to changes in rainfall and dry-season length, which were controlled by orbital insolation forcing of tropical monsoon dynamics. The fuel limitation that characterizes the region's fire regime today appears to have begun around 5000-6000years ago, when warmer interglacial conditions coincided with prolonged seasonal drought. Thus, insolation-driven variation in the amount and seasonality of rainfall during the past 25000 years altered the immediate controls on fire occurrence in the grass-dominated savannas of eastern equatorial Africa. These results show that climatic impacts on dry-savanna burning are heterogeneous through time, with important implications for efforts to anticipate future shifts in fire-mediated ecosystem processes.

J	Novakowski, GC; Hahn, NS; Fugi, R				Novakowski, Gisele Caroline; Hahn, Norma Segatti; Fugi, Rosemara			Diet seasonality and food overlap of the fish assemblage in a pantanal pond	NEOTROPICAL ICHTHYOLOGY												We assessed the trophic structure of the fish fauna in Sinha Mariana pond, Mato Grosso State, from March 2000 to February 2001. The aim was to determine the feeding patterns of the fish species during the rainy and dry seasons. The diets of 26 species (1,294 stomach contents) were determined by the volumetric method. Insects and fish were the most important food resources: insects were the dominant food of 23% and 27% of the species, respectively, in the rainy and dry season, and fish was the dominant item for 31% of the species in both seasons. Cluster analysis (Euclidean Distance) identified seven trophic guilds in the rainy season (detritivores, herbivores, insectivores, lepidophages, omnivores, piscivores and planktivores), and five trophic guilds in the dry season (detritivores, insectivores, lepidophages, omnivores and piscivores). The smallest mean values of diet breadth were observed for the specialist guilds (detritivores, lepidophages and piscivores), in both seasons. The widest means for diet breadth were observed for the omnivores, regardless of the season. In general, there was no seasonal variation in feeding overlap among the species studied. At the community level, diet overlap values between species were low (< 0.4) for 80% of the pairs in each season, suggesting wide partitioning of the food resource. The fish assemblage showed a tendency toward trophic specialization, regardless of the season, although several species changed their diets. We might consider two non-excludent hypothesis: that there is no pattern on the use of seasonal food resources and/or probably there are several patterns, because each one is based on characteristics of the studied site and the taxonomic composition of the resident species.

Macrobenthic community structure of the Mhlathuze Estuary, a permanently open estuarine embayment in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												The Mhlathuze Estuary, an estuarine embayment in northern Zululand, is considered an estuary of national conservation importance. No historical data on the benthic macrofauna are available for the past 20 years, creating a significant gap in our understanding of the ecology and benthic assemblage of this system. The primary aim of this study was to provide updated information on the ecology of the macrobenthic community. Benthic samples were collected quarterly using a Zabalocki grab during the period 2016-2017. The 87 taxa recorded were largely dominated by the tanaid Halmyrapseudes cooperi, followed by the brachyuran crab, Paratylodiplax blephariskios and the amphipod Grandierella bonnieroides. A multivariate data analysis was performed and PERMANOVA results indicated significant differences (p < 0.05) between sites in number of taxa, species diversity and density. A stable system with limited seasonal influences and the effect of May 2017 flood were highlighted in the study. The 100 benthic taxa recorded in previous studies, of which 46 species are still present, suggests a marked decline in macrobenthic diversity and a change in community, possibly linked to reduced freshwater inflow and agricultural effluent. The continuing ecological relevance of this protected area relies on reducing catchment activities that are detrimental in sustaining benthic populations.

One recently proposed way to model this is the riparian flow-concentration integration model (RIM) concept that accounts for the role of flow pathway control on [DOC] dynamics in streams. However, in boreal systems, there is also commonly a seasonal pattern, which cannot be explained by variability in discharge alone. The objectives with this study were to (1) demonstrate RIM as a tool for studying variability in stream water chemistry, (2) investigate factors related to stream water DOC variability, and (3) modify RIM to account for these factors. RIM was used with 14 years of daily discharge and almost 500 stream measurements of [DOC] from a forested boreal headwater stream. We used the calibrated RIM to account for discharge influences and then investigated variables that could be related to DOC variability (air and soil temperature, soil moisture, precipitation, antecedent flow and stream sulfate). Five alternative formulations of RIM, with temporally varying soil concentration profiles based on the variability in soil temperature and/or antecedent flow, were evaluated. The model where only the effects of riparian soil temperature on dynamics in DOC depth profiles were included performed best overall. This dynamic RIM improved the Nash-Sutcliffe to 0.58 compared to 0.42 for the flow-only formulation and reduced the median absolute error from 3.0 to 2.1 mg L (-1). This study demonstrates that RIM is a simple way of modeling stream DOC and exploring controls on stream water chemistry.

L.; Brown, Paul			Impacts of drought and predicted effects of climate change on fish growth in temperate Australian lakes	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Climate change is expected to negatively impact many freshwater environments due to reductions in stream-flow and increases in temperature. These conditions, however, can already be found today in areas experiencing significant drought; current observations of species' responses to droughts can be used to make predictions about their future responses to climate change. Using otolith analysis, we recreated golden perch (Macquaria ambigua) growth chronologies from two temperate lake populations in southeastern Australia over a 15-year period pre- and during a supraseasonal drought. We related interannual growth variation to landscape-scale changes in temperature and hydrological regimes: fish growth declined as water levels in the lakes dropped during the drought, but this effect was offset by increased growth in warmer years. We hypothesize that golden perch are responding to fluctuations in food availability and intraspecific competition related to water level and to an optimization of physiological growth conditions related to increases in growing season length. Based on our analyses, we made predictions of future growth under a number of climate change scenarios that incorporate forecast deviations in stream-flows and air temperature. Despite climatic models predicting significant declines in future water availability, fish growth may increase due to a disproportionate lengthening of the growing season. As the two lakes are at the limit of the southerly range of golden perch, our results are consistent with previous findings of climate-change driven latitudinal range shifts in a poleward direction. We discuss assumptions concerning the constancy of ecological interactions into the future that warrant further study. Our research provides a novel application of biochronological analysis that could be used elsewhere to further our knowledge of species responses to changing environments.

Changes in cladoceran subfossils in the surface sediments of 54 shallow lakes were studied along a European latitude gradient (36-68 degrees N). Multivariate methods, such as regression trees and ordination, were applied to explore the relationships between cladoceran taxa distribution and contemporary environmental variables, with special focus on the impact of climate. 2. Multivariate regression tree analysis showed distinct differences in cladoceran community structure and lake characteristics along the latitude gradient, identifying three groups: (i) northern lakes characterised by low annual mean temperature, conductivity, nutrient concentrations and fish abundance, (ii) southern, macrophyte rich, warm water lakes with high conductivity and high fish abundance and (iii) Mid-European lakes at intermediate latitudes with intermediate conductivities, trophic state and temperatures. 3. Large-sized, pelagic species dominated a group of seven northern lakes with low conductivity, where acid-tolerant species were also occasionally abundant. Small-sized, benthic-associated species dominated a group of five warm water lakes with high conductivity. Cladoceran communities generally showed low species-specific preferences for habitat and environmental conditions in the Mid-European group of lakes. Taxon richness was low in the southern-most, high-conductivity lakes as well as in the two northern-most sub-arctic lakes. 4. The proportion of cladoceran resting eggs relative to body shields was high in the northern lakes, and linearly (negatively) related to both temperature and Chl a, indicating that both cold climate (short growing season) and low food availability induce high ephippia production. 5. Latitude and, implicitly, temperature were strongly correlated with conductivity and nutrient concentrations, highlighting the difficulties of disentangling a direct climate signal from indirect effects of climate, such as changes in fish community structure and human-related impacts, when a latitude gradient is used as a climate proxy. Future studies should focus on the interrelationships between latitude and gradients in nutrient concentration and conductivity.

However, the mechanistic interactions through which phytoplankton community change and bacterial communities interact remain poorly understood. Here, the responses of bacterial communities to the community structure, resource-use efficiency (RUE), and community turnover of phytoplankton and microcystins (MCs) were investigated in Lake Dianchi, Lake Xingyun, and Lake Erhai of Southwestern China across two seasons (May and October 2020). Among phytoplankton, Cyanobacteria was the dominant species in all three lakes and attained greater dominance in October than in May due to variation in the RUE of nitrogen and phosphorus and environmental changes. The production of MCs, including MC_LR, MC_RR and MC_YR, was the result of the massive Cyanobacteria. Decreases in diversity and increases in heterogeneity were observed in the bacterial community structure. Nutrient levels, environmental factors and MCs (especially MC_YR) jointly affected the bacterial community in lakes, namely its diversity and community assembly. The cascading effects in lakes mediated by environmental conditions, phytoplankton community composition, RUE, community turnover, and MCs on bacterial communities were revealed in this study. These findings underscore the importance of relating phytoplankton community change and MCs to the bacterial community, which is fundamental for better understanding the lake ecosystem functioning and potential risks of MCs.

Optimal Linear Estimation (OLE) Modeling Supports Early Holocene (9000-8000 RCYBP) Copper Tool Production in North America	AMERICAN ANTIQUITY												The discovery and development of metal as a tool medium is a topic of global interest. A fundamental research goal involves establishing the timing of human experimentation with naturally occurring copper ore, which is commonly associated with sedentary, agrarian-based societies. However, in North America, there is well-documented millennia-scale exploitation of copper as tool media by small, seasonally mobile hunter-gatherer groups in the western Great Lakes. Archaeologists have suggested that Late Paleoindian groups may have begun using copper as a tool medium almost immediately after they entered the Lake Superior basin. However, only a few radiocarbon dates support such early use of copper. Here, we use optimal linear estimation modeling to infer the origin date for copper tool production in North America. Our results show that the invention of copper as a tool media likely occurred shortly after the first pioneering populations encountered copper ore during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. The origin dates modeled here (ca. 8100 RCYBP) reveal several important features about the behavior of pioneering hunter-gatherer populations. Moreover, our results suggest that this phenomenon represents the earliest known use of metal for utilitarian copper tool production.

A 1400-years flood frequency reconstruction for the Basque country (N Spain): Integrating geological, historical and instrumental datasets	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We present the first reconstruction of past flood events variability in the Basque Country and Western Ebro Basin (Northern Spain) integrating instrumental hydrological datasets (last 20 years), documentary archives (last 700 years) and Lake Arreo (655 m a.s.l.) sedimentary paleoflood record (last 1400 years). In this lake, allochthonous coarse and fine detrital layers (CDL and FDL respectively) intercalated within endogenic laminites were identified and interpreted as high-and moderate-energy flood events. The interplay between human activities and hydroclimate variability has controlled the deposition of these flood layers. Gauged data for the last 20 years suggest that floods are typically generated by heavy rainfall events on saturated soils after several days of continuous rainfall. These events occur mostly during the cold season (Oct-May). The reconstructed frequency of high-magnitude flood events from the lake record is coherent with the historical cold-season floods from Basque rivers. The lowest flood frequency took place during the 6-7th and 10-15th centuries, while higher flood frequency occurred during the 8-9th centuries and the last 500 years. Fluvial and lacustrine paleoflood records and documentary evidence show abrupt and large increases in extreme flood frequency during the termination of the Little Ice Age (1830-1870 CE) and mid to late 20th century, both periods of Rapid Climate Change (RCC). The significant increase in flood frequency observed during RCC suggests that a similar pattern could be expected in the near future with the ongoing global warming. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

Regulation of these overabundant populations is urgently needed. For an effective culling program addressing these overabundant populations, it is essential to have information on the activity pattern of animals. To determine the factors affecting seasonality of daily activity pattern in sika deer, we studied deer activity through camera traps on Nakanoshima Island, Lake Toya in Hokkaido, Japan, where human disturbance is low. We estimated activity pattern during four time periods (dawn, dusk, day, and night), and evaluated the effects of weather conditions on activity pattern (camera trap rate) for each period. Deer activity at dawn, dusk and night showed clear seasonal patterns, with peaks in September, while the activity pattern during the day was constant in all seasons. The activity at dawn and dusk tended to be higher than that at day during July-October and July-November, respectively. Although the activity of sika deer may be influenced by weather condition, there was no seasonal consistency. Our study reveals that human disturbance might decrease diurnal activity and increase nocturnal activity.					; Yoshida, Tsuyoshi/N-4049-2018; Takeshita, Kazutaka/HPE-1411-2023	Takeshita, Kazutaka/0000-0002-6866-6074; Ikeda, Takashi/0000-0003-3217-3275; Yoshida, Tsuyoshi/0000-0001-9297-8716; 													1343-4152	1348-6160				DEC	2015	40	4					199	205																WOS:000367744100001
J	Placzek, C; Quade, J; Patchett, PJ				Placzek, C; Quade, J; Patchett, PJ			Geochronology and stratigraphy of late Pleistocene lake cycles on the southern Bolivian Altiplano: Implications for causes of tropical climate change	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Large paleolakes (-33,000-60,000 km(2)) that once occupied the high-altitude Poopo, Coipasa, and Uyuni Basins in southern Bolivia (18-22 degrees S) provide evidence of major changes in low-latitude moisture. In these now-dry or oligosaline basins, extensive natural exposure reveals evidence for two deep-lake and several minor-lake cycles over the past 120 k.y. Fifty-three new U-Th and 87 new C-14 dates provide a chronologic framework for changes in lake level. Deposits from the "Ouki" deep-lake cycle are extensively exposed in the Poopo Basin, but no deep lakes are apparent in the record between 98 and 18.1 ka. The Ouki lake cycle was similar to 80 m deep, and nineteen U-Th dates place this deep-take cycle between 120 and 98 ka. Shallow lakes were present in the terminal Uyuni Basin between 95 and 80 ka (Salinas lake cycle), at ca. 46 (Inca Huasi lake cycle), and between 24 and 20.5 ka (Sajsi lake cycle). The Tauca deep-lake cycle occurred between 18.1 and 14.1 ka, resulting in the deepest (similar to 140 m) and largest lake in the basin over the past 120 ka. Multiple C-14 and U-Th dates constrain the highest stand of Lake Tauca along a topographically conspicuous shoreline between 16.4 and 14.1 ka. A probable post-Tauca lake cycle (the Coipasa) produced a <= 55-m-deep lake that is tentatively dated between 13 and 11 ka. We suggest that paleolakes on the Bolivian Altiplano expanded in response to increased moisture in the Amazon and enhanced transport of that moisture onto the Altiplano by strengthened trade winds or southward displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Pole-to-equator sea-surface temperature (SST) and atmospheric gradients may have influenced the position of the ITCZ, affecting moisture balance over the Altiplano and at other locations in the Amazon Basin. Links between the position of the ITCZ and the ca. 23 ka precessional solar cycle have been postulated. March insolation over the Altiplano is a relatively good fit to our lake record, but no single season or latitude of solar cycling has yet to emerge as the primary driver of climate over the entire Amazon Basin. Temperature may influence Altiplano lake levels indirectly, as potentially dry glacial periods in the Amazon Basin are linked to dry conditions on the Altiplano. Intensification of the trade winds associated with La Ni (n) over tildea-like conditions currently brings increased precipitation on the Altiplano, and deep-lake development during the Tauca lake cycle coincided with apparently intense and persistent La Ni (n) over tildea-like conditions in the central Pacific. This suggests that SST gradients in the Pacific are also a major influence on deep-lake development on the Altiplano.

Of the rivers, two were located within the designated evacuation zone. After standard length (SL) and body weight measurements, fish were dissected to two parts: body without head and internal organs, BD; head and internal organs, HI. Radiocesium concentrations in these parts were measured using germanium semiconductor detectors. Those in the whole body (WB) were reconstructed using their concentrations and weights. The Cs-137 concentrations in BD in oceanic samples (4.3-6.7cm SL) were below the detection limit, whereas those in riverine samples (6.4-18.8cm SL) were 0.719-902Bqkg(-1)-wet. Statistical analyses indicated a best-fit linear mixed-effects model including SL and sampling site as explanatory variables. Significant differences in Cs-137 concentrations in BD among rivers were detected. Our results indicate that Cs-137 concentrations in BD of riverine ayu, which showed lower but site-specifically constant values compared with those in HI or WB, are useful as a good indicator of radiocesium contamination of the respective rivers.

Delineation of the role of nutrient variability and dreissenids (Mollusca, Bivalvia) on phytoplankton dynamics in the Bay of Quinte, Ontario, Canada	HARMFUL ALGAE												The Bay of Quinte, a Z-shaped embayment at the northeastern end of Lake Ontario, has a long history of eutrophication problems primarily manifested as spatially extensive algal blooms and predominance of toxic cyanobacteria. The purpose of this study was to identify the structural changes of the phytoplankton community induced by two environmental alterations: point-source phosphorus (P) loading reduction in the late 1970s and establishment of dreissenid mussels in the mid-1990s. A combination of statistical techniques was used to draw inference about compositional shifts of the phytoplankton assemblage, the consistency of the seasonal succession patterns along with the mechanisms underlying the algal biovolume variability in the Bay of Quinte over the past three decades. Based on a number of diversity and similarity indices, the algal assemblages in the upper and middle segments of the Bay are distinctly different from those typically residing in the outer segments. Our analysis also identified significant differences among the phytoplankton communities, representing the pre- and post-P control as well as the pre- and post-dreissenid invasion periods. Recent shifts in phytoplankton community composition were mainly associated with increased frequency of occurrence of toxin-producing Microcystis outbreaks and reduced biovolume of N-2 fixers, such as Aphanizomenon and Anabaena. Bayesian hierarchical models were developed to, elucidate the importance of different abiotic factors (light attenuation, water temperature, phosphorus, and ammonium) on total cyanobacteria, Microcystis, Aphanizomenon, and Anabaena relative biovolume. Our modelling exercise suggests that there is significant spatial heterogeneity with respect to the role of the factors examined, and thus total phosphorus alone cannot always explain the year-to-year variability of cyanobacteria succession patterns in the system. The lessons learned from the present analysis will be helpful to the water quality criteria setting process and could influence the management decisions in order to delist the system as an Area of Concern.

J	Kebede, S; Travi, Y				Kebede, Seifu; Travi, Yves			Origin of the δ18O and δ2H composition of meteoric waters in Ethiopia	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Understanding the origin of the delta O-18 and delta H-2 content of meteoric waters is the initial step in using these isotopes in water resources, hydrological and hydro-climatic investigations. Specifically, isotopes of water are proven tools in a) constraining rate and mechanism of groundwater recharge, b) tracing movement of groundwaters, c) reconstructing past climate (rainfall amount, humidity and temperature) at various time scales, d) quantifying water flux across boundaries (e.g. evaporation rates, mixing), and e) complementing regional and global climate models. The delta O-18 and delta H-2 values in rainfall waters of Ethiopia have long been recognised as a 'regional anomaly'. Regardless of the station's high altitude (2360 m asl) and the region's low mean annual temperature (16 degrees C), two conditions that would otherwise lead to relative isotope depletion, the rains show the highest O-18 composition with no sign of effect of evaporative enrichment (as revealed by d-excess). This enrichment is also reflected in other local meteoric waters (shallow groundwaters, lakes, ambient vapour and rivers). Here, the delta O-18 and delta H-2 of 600 lake water samples, 3000 groundwater samples, and rainfall isotope data base from IAEA/WMO stations at Addis Ababa have been used to show the linkage between rainfall derivation processes and isotope signals. The major sources of moisture in Ethiopia are recycled moisture from continental sources for western and northern Ethiopia, and direct moisture from the Southern Indian Ocean for eastern lowlands of Ethiopia. Southern Ethiopia is influenced by South Indian Ocean moisture, which is characterised by relatively depleted O-18 and H-2. Spatial variation (altitude and latitude) in O-18 and H-2 is weak, with altitude effect accounting for 0.1 parts per thousand/100 m depletion in delta O-18. Detailed investigation of the relation between isotope pattern and isotope effects (amount, seasonality, temperature, etc.) shows that these effects are not pronounced. The -4.5 parts per thousand delta O-18 shift recorded in deeper groundwaters and other paleoclimate achieves (from the current wt. mean rainfall value of -0.5 parts per thousand) can only be explained by a shift in source of moisture, such as the northward penetration of the South Indian Ocean moisture into the Ethiopian highlands, or changes in evaporation conditions at the source.

This study addresses this gap by investigating seasonal variations in organic matter sources and ecological responses to human activities in Changjiang Delta sediments. Total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and carbon (S13C) 13 C) and nitrogen (S15N) 15 N) isotopic compositions of surface sediments collected from the Taipu River and Dalian Lake wetland were analyzed. Both water bodies exhibited similar seasonal trends for TOC and TN, with the Taipu River containing an average of 0.46% and 0.03% higher concentrations of TOC and TN, respectively, compared to Dalian Lake. Additionally, the organic index (OI) and organic nitrogen (ON) index were elevated in both water bodies during the wet season. Sediments from Dalian Lake remained uncontaminated to moderately contaminated, while those from the Taipu River were generally classified as moderately to heavily contaminated. Stable isotope analysis identified terrestrial C3 3 plants (averaging 25.5%), C4 4 plants (averaging 16.0%), and municipal wastewater (averaging 16.0%) as the main contributors to organic matter in the sediments. These findings suggest that terrestrial plant material and municipal wastewater are key targets for managing organic matter contamination in the Changjiang Delta. Implementing strategic land-use planning and targeted interventions to minimize these inputs can significantly improve water quality and ecosystem health.

Detection of the Sensitive Inflowing River Indicators Related to Non-Point Source Organic Pollution: A Case Study of Taihu Lake	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS												Organic matter transport from watershed soil into an aquatic ecosystem plays a key role in the fate of contaminants and lake eutrophication. Special emphasis is needed to understand whether sensitive river indicators can reflect watershed non-point source organic carbon (OC) pollution, in which the accurate assessment of non-point source (NPS) pollution is crucial. This study selected a sub-basin within the Taihu basin, China, as the study site, a typical rural-urban fringe region undergoing rapid urbanization where soil organic carbon (SOC) loss would likely take place due to the integration of agriculture NPS and impervious surface NPS. The seasonal tendency of NPS soil organic carbon (SOC) loads were evaluated by using the integration of SEDD and PLOAD models, which consider the sediment adsorption fraction loads (Sed-OC) and runoff dissolved fraction loads (Dis-OC) together. And then the sensitive water indicators for OC loads were determined by measurements of inflowing river properties and stepwise regression analysis. The results showed that active dissolved carbon fraction loads were the dominant contributors to the total organic carbon loads (Tot-OC) and that Sed-OC loads have more spatial variation. With respect to sensitive river properties, the lignin owned the greatest correlation degree with different OC fraction loads, in which the correlation coefficient between particulate lignin and Sed-OC loads reached 0.782, which is the greatest among the different indicators. In addition, the colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) was also correlated with Dis-OC loads. However, the particulate organic carbon (POC) was not well related to OC loads. The findings of this study are useful for better understanding the nutrient migration from watershed soil into aquatic ecosystem controlled by watershed NPS pollution.

"Fish Rescue us from Hunger": the Contribution of Aquatic Resources to Household Food Security on the Rufiji River Floodplain, Tanzania, East Africa	HUMAN ECOLOGY												Inland fisheries are essential to nutrition and food security in developing countries but remain undervalued. Worldwide, studies of aquatic resource consumption are rare. We use data from a monthly survey of 40 households in a Tanzanian village over 1 year combined with qualitative methods to analyse consumption of animal aquatic resources across wealth, seasons, fishing vs. non-fishing, and male- vs. female-headed households. We find that local freshwater fish are the most frequent source of animal protein, consumed on 57% of survey days. Wealth matters, with better-off households eating fish more often and in larger daily quantities on average. Middle-ranked households catch and sell fish more often, but all households double their consumption on average on days they catch rather than purchase fish. Female-headed households rely on gifts to increase consumption. Our results emphasise the need to preserve the livelihood functions of inland fisheries in the face of increasing threats.

Herein, we experimentally investigated how WER (three levels: exchange 0%, 20%, and 40% of total water per day) affects water and sediment properties, and the consequences that these variations have on the individual responses of two submerged macrophytes, Hydrilla verticillata and Myriophyllum aquaticum which were planted in two different sediment types (sand and clay). In the experiment without ramets, it was found that turbidity, pH value, and dissolved carbon dioxide concentration of the system water were statistically unaffected by WER, while water dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration and sediment oxidation-reduction potential (ORP, in both sediments) consistently increased with increasing WER, regardless of experimental time. In the experiment containing ramets, biomass accumulation and relative growth rate (RGR) of both species gradually increased with increasing WER regardless of sediment type. The mechanisms were related to (a) increased oxygen availability, as indicated by gradually increased water DO concentration and sediment ORP; and (b) enhanced phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) absorbing abilities associated with stimulated root growth, reflected in increased mean root length, specific root length, and the root/above-ground biomass ratio, with increasing WER. Additionally, in the experiments containing ramets, significant linear relationships were consistently detected between sediment ORP and root parameters, root parameters and plant nutrients (N and P), and plant nutrients and plant growth conditions (biomass accumulation and RGR). These results demonstrate that WER plays an important role in determining oxygen availability and thus impacts the growth of submerged macrophytes by altering the ability of roots to absorb nutrients, indicating that ecosystem functions are more sensitive to WER than previously recognized.

J	Ilteralp, M; Ariman, S; Aptoula, E				Ilteralp, Melike; Ariman, Sema; Aptoula, Erchan			A Deep Multitask Semisupervised Learning Approach for Chlorophyll-a Retrieval from Remote Sensing Images	REMOTE SENSING												This article addresses the scarcity of labeled data in multitemporal remote sensing image analysis, and especially in the context of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) estimation for inland water quality assessment. We propose a multitask CNN architecture that can exploit unlabeled satellite imagery and that can be generalized to other multitemporal remote sensing image analysis contexts where the target parameter exhibits seasonal fluctuations. Specifically, Chl-a estimation is set as the main task, and an unlabeled sample's month classification is set as an auxiliary network task. The proposed approach is validated with multitemporal/spectral Sentinel-2 images of Lake Balik in Turkey using in situ measurements acquired during 2017-2019. We show that harnessing unlabeled data through multitask learning improves water quality estimation performance.

J	Cooper, MG; Smith, LC				Cooper, Matthew G.; Smith, Laurence C.			Satellite Remote Sensing of the Greenland Ice Sheet Ablation Zone: A Review	REMOTE SENSING												The Greenland Ice Sheet is now the largest land ice contributor to global sea level rise, largely driven by increased surface meltwater runoff from the ablation zone, i.e., areas of the ice sheet where annual mass losses exceed gains. This small but critically important area of the ice sheet has expanded in size by similar to 50% since the early 1960s, and satellite remote sensing is a powerful tool for monitoring the physical processes that influence its surface mass balance. This review synthesizes key remote sensing methods and scientific findings from satellite remote sensing of the Greenland Ice Sheet ablation zone, covering progress in (1) radar altimetry, (2) laser (lidar) altimetry, (3) gravimetry, (4) multispectral optical imagery, and (5) microwave and thermal imagery. Physical characteristics and quantities examined include surface elevation change, gravimetric mass balance, reflectance, albedo, and mapping of surface melt extent and glaciological facies and zones. The review concludes that future progress will benefit most from methods that combine multi-sensor, multi-wavelength, and cross-platform datasets designed to discriminate the widely varying surface processes in the ablation zone. Specific examples include fusing laser altimetry, radar altimetry, and optical stereophotogrammetry to enhance spatial measurement density, cross-validate surface elevation change, and diagnose radar elevation bias; employing dual-frequency radar, microwave scatterometry, or combining radar and laser altimetry to map seasonal snow depth; fusing optical imagery, radar imagery, and microwave scatterometry to discriminate between snow, liquid water, refrozen meltwater, and bare ice near the equilibrium line altitude; combining optical reflectance with laser altimetry to map supraglacial lake, stream, and crevasse bathymetry; and monitoring the inland migration of snowlines, surface melt extent, and supraglacial hydrologic features.					; Cooper, Matthew/ADV-3111-2022	Cooper, Matthew/0000-0002-0165-209X; 														2072-4292				OCT	2019	11	20							2405	10.3390/rs11202405	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11202405													WOS:000498395800073
J	Du, J; Song, KS; Yan, BH				Du, Jia; Song, Kaishan; Yan, Baohua			Impact of the Zhalong Wetland on Neighboring Land Surface Temperature Based on Remote Sensing and GIS	CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE												Wetlands play a key role in regulating local climate as well as reducing impacts caused by climate change. Rapid observations of the land surface temperature (LST) are, therefore, valuable for studying the dynamics of wetland systems. With the development of thermal remote sensing technology, LST retrieval with satellite images is a practicable way to detect a wetland and its neighboring area's thermal environment from a non-point visual angle rather than the traditional detection from a point visual angle. The mono-windows (MW) method of retrieving LST was validated. On the basis of estimated LST, we used Geographical Information System (GIS) technology to study the impact of wetland reclamation on local temperatures at a regional scale. Following that, correlations between LST and the wetland were analyzed. The results show that: 1) It is feasible to retrieve the LST from Landsat 8 OLI satellite images with MW model. The model was validated with the land surface temperature observed in four meteorological stations when the satellite scanned the study region. The satellite retrieval error was approximately 1.01 degrees C. 2) The relationship between the spatial distribution of land surface temperatures and the Zhalong wetland was analyzed based on GIS technology. The results show that wetland has an obvious influence on LST, and that this influence decreases with increasing distance from the wetland. When the distance from the wetland was less than 500 m, its influence on LST was significant. Results also illustrated that the effect of the wetland's different land use/land cover's LST distribution varied with different seasons.

Although numerous dolomite formations in the geological record are composed of fine-grained crystals of micritic dolomite, an alternative process, that is, direct precipitation, is often excluded because of the absence of visible or geochemical indicators supporting primary precipitation. In this research, we present a study of a modern coastal hypersaline lagoon, Brejo do Espinho, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, which is located in a special climatic regime where a well-defined seasonal cycle of wet and dry conditions occur. The direct precipitation of modern high-Mg calcite and Ca-dolomite mud from the lagoonal waters under low-temperature hypersaline conditions is associated with the activity of microbial organisms living in this restricted environment. The mud undergoes an early diagenetic transformation into a 100% dolomite crust on the margins of the lagoon. The biomineralization process, characterized by the variations of the physico-chemical conditions in this environment during the annual hydrological cycle, is integrated with isotopic analysis to define the early diagenetic processes responsible for the formation of both dolomitic mud and crust. The carbon isotope values indicate a contribution of respired organic carbon, which is greater for the crust (delta C-13 = -9.5 parts per thousand Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB)) than mud (delta C-13 = -1.2 parts per thousand VPDB). The oxygen isotope values reflect a moderate degree of evaporation during mud formation (delta O-18 = 1.1 parts per thousand VPDB), whereas it is greatly enhanced during early diagenetic crust formation (delta O-18 = 4.2 parts per thousand VPDB). The clumped isotope formation temperature derived for the Brejo do Espinho mud is 34 degrees C, whereas it is 32 degrees C for the crust. These temperatures are consistent with the upper range of measured values during the dry season when the lagoon experiences the most hypersaline conditions.

A 29-year assessment of the water clarity and chlorophyll-a concentration of a large reservoir: Investigating spatial and temporal changes using Landsat imagery	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												A nearly three-decade (May-October) survey of the Secchi disk depth (SDD) and chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) was completed for Lake Diefenbaker from 1984 to 2012 with Landsat imagery. Novel predictive models were developed by comparing 2011 and 2012 field data to reflectance data from Landsat imagery. These models were applied to the archived imagery (1984-2012) to predict SDD and Chl-a. Predicted values were also tested independently with historical field data. Predicted and actual measurements for SDD and Chl-a were significantly related (R-2 = 0.84 and 0.57; RMSE 0.59 m and 1.43 mu g/L-1, respectively). These models are relevant because they can predict past and future water quality for Lake Diefenbaker without the need for reference field data. Water clarity and Chl-a concentration were positively correlated, suggesting that light limitation can occur in this reservoir. Predicted data showed that both SDD and mean Chl-a concentration have decreased in the reservoir from 1984 to 2012. Temporally, the decreases in SDD and Chl-a followed a decreasing sigmoid pattern. Mean seasonal and mean yearly flow caused significant reductions in water clarity and Chl-a concentration (R-2 = 0.28 and 0.25, p = 0.048 and 0.021, respectively). Algal blooms were observed in the reservoir during the study period, and were most frequently found in the Qu'Appelle arm of the reservoir. However, despite concerns from local residents, we did not find evidence that suggests an increase in frequency over the 29 year period. (C) 2014 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

J	Castedo, R; Fernandez, M; Trenhaile, AS; Paredes, C				Castedo, Ricardo; Fernandez, Marta; Trenhaile, Alan S.; Paredes, Carlos			Modeling cyclic recession of cohesive clay coasts: Effects of wave erosion and bluff stability	MARINE GEOLOGY												A mathematical model combining the effects of wave erosion, beach sediment, and bluff slope stability has been developed to study the episodic, cyclical recession of cohesive clay coasts. The model was applied to the southern Great Lakes in North America which, although non-tidal, experience seasonal fluctuations in lake level of about 0.5 m and long-term fluctuations of up to 2 m. Model runs were designed to explore the interaction between various components of the system, including profile shape, bluff recession rates, lake level variations, beach morphodynamics, the geomechanical characteristics of the material, and the type (slump, topple) and size of the slope failures. Model runs were made for the equivalent of 100 years. Quasi-equilibrium conditions developed in the runs, which had similar erosion rates to the field, with parallel slope retreat in the upper portion of the profiles and slope decline in the lower portion. Temporal variations in the rate of recession of the crest of the bluff closely matched changes in lake level. The model confirmed previous work that suggested that rates of bluff recession are strongly controlled by the rate of erosion below the water surface, but it also provided support for a more recent proposal that rates of bluff recession also influence rates of erosion in shallow water. It was found that positive and negative changes in the size of the beach can either promote or hinder bluff and profile erosion depending on local circumstances. The model demonstrated that bluff height, debris mobility, wave undercutting, and groundwater levels are key factors in determining the stability of coastal bluffs. The model represents a promising new tool to forecast and thereby mitigate the effects of climate change on marine and lacustrine coasts. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The biggest alpine lake of the Caucasus, Lake Sevan, has "blooming" recently almost every year. Thus, the study of phytoplankton community' development patterns in Lake Sevan is gaining urgency. The aim of the work has been the study of the seasonal dynamics of quantitative and qualitative characteristics of phytoplankton in Lake Sevan. Also, we have tried to determine the features of horizontal distribution of phytoplankton within different seasons with the focus on Cyanobacteria distribution to identify current spatial-temporal features of HABs in Lake Sevan. Seasonal ground data collected from the photic zone of 178 stations in 2016-2018 was analysed and spatially interpolated. The results of analysis of seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton groups abundance have revealed the increased role of Cyanobacteria in the algal "blooms". Particularly, HABs were led by the dominant species of the genus Dolichospermum/Anabaena that are potentially toxic. Univariate analysis of variance with the post hoc Tukey test has proved the significance of changes in the quantitative parameters of phytoplankton development within years with the peak in 2018. Some antagonistic relations between the groups of phytoplankton under the HAB events were also shown through factorial and correlation analysis. Spatial interpolations revealed very limited extents of HABs compared with "blooms" led by Bacillariophyta species. HABs were mainly occurring in the littoral zone in a close proximity to the estuaries of Lake Sevan major tributaries.					; Asatryan, Vardan/AAF-1261-2020; Khachikyan, Termine/GRJ-8562-2022; Mamyan, Armine/GRJ-5442-2022	Mamyan, Armine/0009-0008-4678-7589; Asatryan, Vardan/0000-0002-1477-5742; Khachikyan, Termine/0009-0001-1341-331X													0167-6369	1573-2959				OCT	2022	194	10							757	10.1007/s10661-022-10446-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-10446-5								36083377					WOS:000852423100003

Our research work is based on three kinds of migratory locusts in a niche overlap and the geographic distribution of preliminary forecast of the locust, the geographical distribution of typical quantitative habitat suitability change, understanding the China-Kazakhstan border areas, the concentrated distribution area of typical locusts and its future expansion area. The scope of the initial assessment of typical locusts confirms the emphases of the locust control between the two countries in the region, to provide a basis for future monitoring work. Large-scale locust monitoring measures are difficult to implement in practice; therefore, this study will provide a regional monitoring focus for locust control efforts. Our study complements this by assessing priority areas for prevention. Climate change, especially climate extremes, can increase the uncertainty of locust outbreaks. The Italian locust (Calliptamus italicus (Linnaeus, 1758)), Asian migratory locust (Locusta migratoria migratoria Linnaeus, 1758), and Siberian locust (Gomphocerus sibiricus (Linnaeus, 1767)) are common pests widely distributed in the semidesert grasslands of Central Asia and its surrounding regions. Predicting the geographic distribution changes and future habitats of locusts in the context of climate warming is essential to effectively prevent large and sudden locust outbreaks. In this study, the optimized maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model, employing a combination of climatic, soil, and topographic factors, was used to predict the potential fitness areas of typical locusts in the 2030s and 2050s, assuming four shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585) in the CMIP6 model. Modeling results showed that the mean area under the curve (AUC) and true statistical skill (TSS) of the MaxEnt model reached 0.933 and 0.7651, respectively, indicating that the model exhibited good prediction performance. Our results showed that soil surface sand content, slope, mean precipitation during the hottest season, and precipitation seasonality were the key environmental variables affecting locust distribution in the region. The three locust species were mainly distributed in the upstream region of the Irtysh River, the Alatao Mountain region, the northern slopes of the Tianshan Mountains, around Sayram Lake, the eastern part of the Alakol Lake region, the Tekes River region, the western part of Ulungur Lake, the Ili River, and the upstream region of the Tarim River. According to several climate projections, the area of potential habitat for the three most common locust species will decrease by 3.9 x 10(4)-4.6 x 10(4) km(2) by the 2030s and by 6.4 x 10(4)-10.6 x 10(4) km(2) by the 2050s. As the climate becomes more extreme, the suitable area will shrink, but the highly suitable area will expand; thus, the risk of infestation should be taken seriously. Our study present a timely investigation to add to extensive literature currently appearing regarding the myriad ways climate change may affect species. While this naturally details a limited range of taxa, methods and potential impacts may be more broadly applicable to other locust species.

The data observed were evaluated with national and international quality criteria. Based on the data observed, it was determined that the Porsuk Stream is affected by significant inorganic pollution from the Kutahya and Eskisxehir Provinces.

J	Jiang, BB; Mitsch, WJ				Jiang, BingBing; Mitsch, William J.			Influence of hydrologic conditions on nutrient retention, and soil and plant development in a former central Ohio swamp: A wetlaculture mesocosm experiment	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Agricultural runoff is a major contributor of nutrients to downstream freshwater and marine waters that, in turn, cause harmful algal blooms. "Wetlaculture," a new landscape management approach defined as "integrating wetland nutrient removal with recycling of these nutrients to agriculture," has the dual goals of reducing the need for fertilizer in agriculture while mitigating fluxes of nutrients to downstream aquatic ecosystems with created or restored wetlands. A mesocosm compound consisted of twenty-eight 380 L, 1-m(2) tubs filled with local hydric soil was initiated in mid-2016 near a highly eutrophic Buckeye Lake in central Ohio, USA, to investigate the wetlaculture approach in an experimental fashion. In October 2016, each mesocosm tub was inserted in the ground and planted with the sedge Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani. The mesocosms were assigned to four hydrologic treatments involving two water depths and two hydraulic loading rates (HLRs). Nearby river water containing significant agricultural runoff was added weekly into a water feed tank system to provide weekly hydraulic loadings to the mesocosms. Inflow and outflow water samples from each wetland mesocosm were collected and analyzed for five species of nitrogen and phosphorus. By August 2019, 17 plant species, including the planted S. tabernaemontani, were present in the wetland mesocosms. The wetland mesocosms soon became nutrient sinks with average removal efficiencies of total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) of 38 +/- 2.5% and 44 +/- 1%, respectively, through the three-year experiment. The combination of a high HLR (30 cm week(-1)) and 10 cm of standing water achieved the best nitrogen removal efficiencies while highest phosphorus removal occurred with the combination of a high HLR (30 cm week(-1)) and no standing water. This paper discusses the following integrative findings: Seasonal flooding had positive impacts on removal efficiency of NOx and a negative impact on the removal efficiency of TP and TKN. No standing water resulted in a higher removal efficiency of TP and TKN than standing water, results consistent with previous studies. Macrophyte plant community richness was influenced more by water depth than by hydraulic loading rate. Wetlands with 10 cm of standing water instead of saturated soils developed lower species richness but were more dominated by true wetland (OBL and FACW) species. Study scale does matter. Annual nutrient accumulation rates in the mesocosms (1 m(2)) soils were lower than in the full-scale (10,000-m(2)) multi-year wetlands at the nearby Olentangy River Wetland Research Park (ORWRP) in central Ohio. Annual accumulation rates of phosphorus and nitrogen in the full-scale wetlands ranged from 3.3 to 3.5 g-P m(-2) yr(-1) and 16.4 to 19.5 g-N m(-2) yr(-1), while in our mesocosms, the annual rates ranged from 0.66 to 1.40 g-P m(-2) yr(-1) and 7.85 to 15.08 g-N m(-2) yr(-1). Our experimental wetland mesocosms could only function in the non-freezing months and have been in operation for only three years.

Diet cycles of carbon, nutrient and metal in humic lakes of permafrost peatlands	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Despite the importance of surface waters of permafrost landscapes in carbon (C) emission and dissolved C and metal storage and export, the majority of available observations in high latitude aquatic systems deal with punctual or seasonal sampling without accounting for diurnal variations in temperature and primary productivity-respiration cycles. Towards providing comprehensive understanding of diet variations in CO2 emission, organic C and element concentrations in lakes of frozen peatlands, we monitored, each 2 h over 2 days, the water temperature, pH, CO2 fluxes, CO2, CH4, dissolved organic- and inorganic carbon (DOC and DIC, respectively), nutrients, carboxylic acids, bacterial number, and major and trace elements in two acidic (pH = 3.6 and 4.0) and humic (DOC = 15 and 35 mg L-1) thermokarst lakes of discontinuous permafrost zone in Western Siberia. We discovered a factor of 2 to 3 higher CO2 concentrations and fluxes during the night compared to daytime in the high-DOC lake. The emission fluxes in the low-DOC lake increased from zero to negative values during the day to highly positive values during the end of night and early morning.The methane concentration varied within a factor of 5 without any link to the diurnal cycle. The bulk of dissolved (< 0.45 mu m) hydrochemical parameters remained highly stable with +/- 10% variation in concentration over 2 days of observation (DOC, DIC, SUVA(254nm), carboxylates (formate, oxalate, puryvate and glutarate), Mn, Fe, Al, other trace elements). Concentrations of Si, P, K, Cu varied within +/- 20% whereas those of Zn and Ni ranged by a factor of 2 to 4 without any link to diurnal pattern. Overall, the impact of diel cycle on CH4, DOC, nutrient and metal concentration was below 10%. However, neglecting night-time period may underestimate net CO2 emission by ca. 30 to 50% in small organic-rich thaw ponds and switch the CO2 exchange from uptake/zero to net emission in larger thermokarst lakes. Given the dominance of large lakes in permafrost regions, the global underestimation of the emission flux may be quite high. As such, monitoring CO2 concentrations and fluxes in thermokarst lakes during months of extended night Lime (August to October) is mandatory for assessing the net emissions from lentic waters of frozen peatlands.

To achieve this, multi-temporal space-born data of both Landsat-8 OLI- (L1 and L2) and Sentinel-2 (2A and 2B) were used during 2014-2020. The methodologies of Case 2 regional coast colour algorithm and aquatic reflectance were applied for monitoring the physical properties of different water characteristics encompassing chlorophyll-a, total suspended matter (TSM), and aquatic reflectance. Satellite data from dry and wet seasons (2014-2020) were selected to examine seasonal and temporal variation. Comparing water quality through the dry and wet seasons (2014-2020) is to avoid the difference in atmospheric conditions and detect seasonal variations. The present study results have shown that the Western Lagoon and its streams are considered the primary source of pollution. Specifically, lower values are observed during August 2015 for TSM (4-17 g m(-3)) and chlorophyll-a (2-11 g m(-3)), while the highest values of TSM (23-50 g m(-3)) appear during August 2018 and for chlorophyll-a during August 2016-2018 (20-40 g m(-3)). For the wet season for TSM, the lowest values are observed during 2016 (3-10 g m(-3)), and the maximum is noticed during 2019 (13-29 g m(-3)); for the chlorophyll-a, maximum values are observed during 2017 (10-23 g m(-3)).																			0255-660X	0974-3006				DEC	2022	50	12					2411	2428		10.1007/s12524-022-01613-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-022-01613-9		SEP 2022											WOS:000863142200001

Both the upstream reservoir and downstream estuarine sides of the dam were examined. Water quality conditions for nutrients and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) have deteriorated considerably since the dam construction in 1994, with the reservoir water damaged more severely than the estuarine water. Improved water clarity and an enhanced level of nutrients resulted in an order of magnitude increase in Chl-a, indicating excessive phytoplankton growth in the reservoir after dam construction. The hydrology-related principal component (precipitation and discharge) was the most important and the autochthonous primary production-related principal component (nutrients and Chl-a) was the second most important factors affecting the postdam water quality conditions in both the reservoir and estuary. The cumulative load difference analysis revealed that the reservoir was a sink site for PO43- and NH4+ as well as a source site for Chl-a owing to excessive phytoplankton growth in the reservoir. The discharge from the reservoir dominated the estuarine water quality during wet seasons.

Phylogenetic ecology of the freshwater Actinobacteria acI lineage	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The acI lineage of freshwater Actinobacteria is a cosmopolitan and often numerically dominant member of lake bacterial communities. We conducted a survey of acI 16S rRNA genes and 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer regions from 18 Wisconsin lakes and used standard nonphylogenetic and phylogenetic statistical approaches to investigate the factors that determine acI community composition at the local scale (within lakes) and at the regional scale (across lakes). Phylogenetic reconstruction of 434 acI 16S rRNA genes revealed a well-defined and highly resolved phylogeny. Eleven previously unrecognized monophyletic clades, each with >= 97.9% within-clade 16S rRNA gene sequence identity, were identified. Clade community similarity positively correlated with lake environmental similarity but not with geographic distance, implying that the lakes represent a single biotic region containing environmental filters for communities that have similar compositions. Phylogenetically disparate clades within the acI lineage were most abundant at the regional scale, and local communities were comprised of more closely related clades. Lake pH was a strong predictor of the community composition, but only when lakes with a pH below 6 were included in the data set. In the remaining lakes (pH above 6) biogeographic patterns in the landscape were instead a predictor of the observed acI community structure. The nonrandom distribution of the newly defined acI clades suggests potential ecophysiological differences between the clades, with acI clades AII, BII, and BIII preferring acidic lakes and acI clades AII, AVI, and BI preferring more alkaline lakes.					; Jones, Stuart/ABD-5264-2021; McMahon, Katherine/I-3651-2012; Helmus, Matthew/C-4998-2015	Jones, Stuart/0000-0003-4740-6721; McMahon, Katherine D./0000-0002-7038-026X; Helmus, Matthew/0000-0003-3977-0507													0099-2240					NOV	2007	73	22					7169	7176		10.1128/AEM.00794-07	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00794-07								17827330					WOS:000251103300007

First, the hydraulic linkages between the lakes were generalized, then the water resources allocation mode and the scale of existing projects were clarified. After that, the actual available amount of flood resources in the lakes was evaluated. The average annual available floodwater resources in 2003-2017 was 1.49 billion m(3), and the maximum available capacity was 30.84 billion m(3). Then, using the floodwater resource utilization method of multi period flood limited water levels, the research period was divided into the main flood season (15 July to 15 August) and the later flood season (16 August to 10 September, 11 September to 30 September) by the Systematic Clustering Analysis method. After the flood control calculation, the limited water level of Hongze Lake in the later flood season can be raised from 12.5 m to 13.0 m, and the capacity of reservoir storage can increase to 696 million m(3). The limited water level of Luoma Lake can be raised from 22.5 m to 23.0 m (16 August to 10 September), 23.5 m (11 September to 30 September), and the capacity of reservoir storage can increase from 150 to 300 million m(3). Finally, establishing the floodwater resource optimization model of the lake group with the goals of maximizing the floodwater transfer amount and minimizing the flood control risk rate, the optimal water allocation scheme is obtained through the optimization algorithm.																				2071-1050				MAY	2021	13	9							4857	10.3390/su13094857	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13094857													WOS:000650899800001
J	Gallego, I; Narwani, A				Gallego, Irene; Narwani, Anita			Ecology and evolution of competitive trait variation in natural phytoplankton communities under selection	ECOLOGY LETTERS												Competition for limited resources is a major force in structuring ecological communities. Species minimum resource requirements (R*s) can predict competitive outcomes and evolve under selection in simple communities under controlled conditions. However, whether R*s predict competitive outcomes or demonstrate adaptive evolution in naturally complex communities is unknown. We subjected natural phytoplankton communities to three types of resource limitation (nitrogen, phosphorus, light) in outdoor mesocosms over 10 weeks. We examined the community composition weekly and isolated 21 phytoplankton strains from seven species to quantify responses to the selection of R* for these resources. We investigated the evolutionary change in R*s in the dominant species, Desmodesmus armatus. R*s were good predictors of species changes in relative abundance, though this was largely driven by the success of D. armatus across several treatments. This species also demonstrated an evolutionary change in R*s under resource limitation, supporting the potential for adaptive trait change to modify competitive outcomes in natural communities.

A total of 26 samples were collected from water bodies in three cities within the YRD during the dry season from October to November of 2009. The total PCBs (dissolved plus particulate) ranged from 1.23 to 16.6 ng L(-1) and were dominated by tri-, tetra-, and penta-chlorinated biphenyls. The mean PCBs in the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal and the Yangtze River were 8.84 and 3.36 ng L(-1). respectively. A t-test showed that there were no significant differences in the concentration of samples from the metropolitan area and the development zone. According to the Chinese national environmental quality standards for surface water (GB 3838-2002), the concentrations of PCBs observed in this study do not pose a hazard to aquatic or human health. Overall, this study described the PCB concentration and homolog distribution patterns in one of the most rapidly developing areas in China, and the results can be used as reference levels for future PCB monitoring programs.

J	Lin, H; Bartlett, SL; Guo, LD				Lin, Hui; Bartlett, Sarah L.; Guo, Laodong			Distinct variations in fluorescent DOM components along a trophic gradient in the lower Fox River-Green Bay as characterized using one-sample PARAFAC approach	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Variations in molecular weight distributions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and PARAFAC-derived fluorescent components were investigated along a transect in the seasonally hypereutrophic lower Fox River-Green Bay using the one-sample PARAFAC approach coupling flow field-flow fractionation for size-separation with fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) and PARAFAC analysis. Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen, chromophoric-DOM, specific UV absorbance at 254 nm, and humification index all decreased monotonically from river to open bay, showing a strong river-dominated DOM source and a dynamic change in DOM quality along the river-lake transect. The relative abundance of colloidal DOM (> 1 kDa) derived from ultrafiltration exhibited minimal variation, averaging 71 +/- 4 % of the bulk DOM, across the entire estuarine transect although the colloidal concentration decreased in general. Using the one-sample EEM-PARAFAC approach, the identified major fluorescent components were distinct between stations along the river-estuaryopen bay continuum, with four components in river/upper-estuary but three components in open bay waters. Among the four common fluorescent components (C475, C410, C320 and C290), the most abundant and refractory humic-like component, C475, behaved conservatively and its relative abundance (%SFmax) remained fairly constant (50 +/- 4 %) along the transect, while the semi-labile humic-like component, C410, consistently decreased from river to estuary and eventually vanished in open Green Bay. In contrast, the two autochthonous protein-like components (C320 and C290) increased from river to open bay along the trophic gradient. The new results presented here provide an improved understanding of the diverse and fluctuating characteristics in DOM composition, lability, and estuarine mixing behavior across the river-lake interface and demonstrate the efficacy of the one-sample PARAFAC approach.

J	Higginbotham, N; Connor, LH; Baker, F				Higginbotham, Nick; Connor, Linda H.; Baker, Fran			Subregional differences in Australian climate risk perceptions: coastal versus agricultural areas of the Hunter Valley, NSW	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												'Environmental cognitive stress' a hybrid model combining environmental stress and cognitive determinants of pro-environmental behavior is explored among Australians living in contrasting 'micro' climates in the same river catchment system. Peoples' climate risk perceptions are mediated by their connections to local environment, observations of environmental change and personal weather experiences. A longitudinal study randomly sampled 1,162 Hunter Valley coastal and rural residents in New South Wales. Telephone interviewers (2008) recruited lakeside homeowners 'at risk' of sea level rise, nearby 'control' residents and a comparable farming area group. Follow-up interviews (2011) located 81.5 % of the original sample. Fifty-six items based on the model asked about climate change observations, concerns, impacts and actions. Statistically significant rural-suburban and time differences were found. The rural sample was attuned to conditions affecting agricultural productivity: They worried about drought and heat, saw trees dying and changes to seasons and natural rhythms. They anticipate the impact of water scarcity, conserve water and value protecting plants and animals. Compared to higher elevation residents, lake dwellers observed marine life loss, worry about sea level rise and predict the decline of property values. Across time, all groups' perceptions of warming indicators declined. Concerns and impacts were high and generally stayed high, as did actions related to energy use. No differences emerged in beliefs about climate warming. Climate change observations, along with concerns and actions, have important implications for the environmental cognitive stress model. Overall, dynamic changes in residents' understandings are related to a changing policy environment, the vicissitudes of climate debates and weather experiences, including extreme swings from inundation to drought.

We applied correlation analysis and spline regression models to assess the effects of geomorphology, hydraulics, and seasonality on sediment characteristics, suspended solids, hydrochemistry and primary producers. The spatio-temporal connection to the river is the primary factor influencing the hydrochemical characteristics and sediments. Allochthonous processes such as nutrient and sediment input during high waters dominate in connected parts of the floodplain, whereas autochthonous processes, for example, the release of phosphorus from the sediments and internally driven eutrophication, dominate in isolated parts. These conditions also affect the dominating primary producers, biodiversity, the degree of floodplain aggradation and thus the potential life span of aquatic habitats. Measures to improve the functional basis for ecological services may use both allochthonous and autochthonous processes as a starting point, that is, minimizing sediment storage and nutrient input and improving the water balance to prolong the life span of isolated waters, and thus maximizing water body diversity and associated biodiversity. Based on the results of our analysis and literature, eight alternative management measures have been evaluated. As a result, we propose a stepwise adaptive approach beginning with a controlled water supply with low sediments and nutrient loads. If these measures prove insufficient to sustain ecological functions and conservation value, more radical steps must be considered. Synthesis and applications The increasing problems with catastrophic flooding have forced decision makers to seek basin-wide solutions with focus on more room for the river' and the reintegration of former floodplains as retention basins. Such reintegrations also represent opportunities to improve the ecological conditions for nature development in addition to their principal function, that is, the storage of water during floods. The results of our study can serve as an effective tool to predict the effects of alternative management options and to establish and define the design criteria of water retention areas with regard to their ecological functions, life spans and biodiversity.

J	Figueredo, CC; Giani, A				Figueredo, Cleber Cunha; Giani, Alessandra			Phytoplankton community in the tropical lake of Lagoa Santa (Brazil): Conditions favoring a persistent bloom of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii	LIMNOLOGICA												This study presents data on seasonal changes of the phytoplanktonic community of a small tropical lake, Lagoa Santa, in the Brazilian cerrado. Temporal variation in the community structure was small and we observed a permanent dominance of the cyanobacteria Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii. This dominance could be associated to the stability of several environmental conditions. Especially water temperature, always within the optimal growth range for C. raciborskii, and the constant mixed water column may have been important factors driving to the long term dominance of this species in the lake. Remarkable seasonal variation in rainfall, as well as the occasional and non-seasonal variation in nutrient concentrations, were important to explain changes in environmental and biological variables, but were not related to the dominance of C raciborskii. Pearson's correlation and PCA could just in part explain the stable dominance of this cyanobacterium. Meteorological and chemical factors seem to have no clear control on the variability of the phytoplankton dynamics in Lagoa Santa. The weak relationship between C. raciborskii abundance and environmental variables points to additional intrinsic factors associated to this species that may be important in structuring the phytoplankton assemblage.

Effects of hypolimnetic hypoxia on foraging and distributions of Lake Erie yellow perch	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Bottom hypoxia (<2 mg O-2 L-1) is a widespread phenomenon in marine and freshwater systems, yet the ecological consequences of hypoxia are generally unknown, especially for mobile organisms such as fish. Herein, we explore how a large area of hypolimnetic (i.e., sub-thermocline) hypoxia that develops seasonally in Lake Erie's central basin influences yellow perch (Perca flavescens), a demersal species of both ecological and economic importance. We hypothesized that hypolimnetic hypoxia would negatively affect yellow perch by limiting access to benthic prey and preferred (cool) temperatures. To explore how hypoxia influences yellow perch foraging and migration patterns in central Lake Erie, we collected a suite of biological (i.e., fish with bottom and mid-water trawls, benthic macroinvertebrates using Ponar grabs, and zooplankton via depth-specific pumping) and physical (i.e., temperature and dissolved oxygen) data monthly during June through October 2005. Our results indicate that yellow perch avoid hypoxic bottom waters by either moving horizontally away from the hypoxic zone or migrating above the oxycline. We also found evidence to suggest that individuals that moved above the hypoxic hypolimnetic layer continue to "dive" into the hypoxic layer to feed on benthic invertebrates. Even so, during the height of hypoxia, both the amount and proportion of benthic macroinvertebrates consumed decreased, whereas consumption of zooplankton increased. While hypoxia-induced changes in yellow perch distributions and foraging likely affect individual condition and growth in the short-term, the long-term effects on population production remain equivocal.

Harnessing the potential of the multi-indicator palaeoecological approach: an assessment of the nature and causes of ecological change in a eutrophic shallow lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Multi-indicator palaeoecological studies have become increasingly popular over the last decade as the need for a more complete understanding of lake ecological histories has increased. However, the true potential of the full biological record for assessing the potential drivers of observed ecological shifts in lake sediment records has rarely been demonstrated. Here, we examine the remains of a range of food-web components including algae (diatoms), macrophytes (plant macrofossils), zooplankton (chitinous and ephippial Cladocera remains), invertebrates (including chironomids, bryozoans, Mollusca) and fish (fish scales and fish leech egg cocoons) in multiple sediment cores from Groby Pool, an enriched English shallow lake, to assess whole-ecosystem response to eutrophication over the last two centuries. We focus on three striking changes in the palaeorecord, namely the post-1900 increase in Daphnia spp., the post-1840 decline in Cristatella mucedo and the post-1940 increase in Cocconeis placentula, and utilise the multi-indicator palaeoecological data to evaluate possible explanations for these patterns. Principal curves analysis revealed marked and broadly simultaneous changes in the plant macrofossils, cladocerans, diatoms and chironomids (as well as in other animal remains such as bryozoans and Mollusca), indicating an early period of enrichment most likely associated with land-use change in the late 18th century, followed by a more recent eutrophication phase coincident with the discharge of sewage effluent to the lake from 1935. Ecological change, resulting from eutrophication, was shown to have progressed slowly and steadily and to have occurred at all trophic levels with a shift from a relatively diverse mesotrophic' macrophyte assemblage, dominance by benthic diatoms and plant-associated Chydoridae and chironomids towards a relatively species-poor, eutrophic' macrophyte community with dominance by planktonic algae (e.g. Cyclostephanoid diatom taxa), planktonic Cladocera (Bosmina, Daphnia) and a chironomid fauna dominated by mud-associated taxa. The inferred shift in the macrophyte community from charophyte to fine-leaved pondweed and Callitriche truncata suggests a reduction in the seasonal duration of plant dominance. The multi-indicator analysis indicates that a combination of increased phytoplankton biomass and low zooplanktivorous fish predation is likely to explain the recent increases in Daphnia spp., while loss of plant habitat and increased competition for food appear to be the most likely causes of the observed decline in C.mucedo, and resistance to increased grazing pressure from invertebrates is the most probable driver of the C.placentula increase. Our study illustrates the potential of using the full array of fossil groups preserved in lake sediment cores to infer ecosystem dynamics over centennial timescales and to contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms that may link biological assemblages to a range of forcing factors. Further, this paper provides methodological guidance by demonstrating the ability of amalgamated records from three cores to reveal a strong sequence of events and coherent patterns.					; Davidson, Thomas/C-6542-2011; Simpson, Gavin/KFQ-1110-2024; Rose, Neil/C-5739-2008; Bennion, Helen/T-7848-2019	Davidson, Thomas/0000-0003-2326-1564; Sadler, Jonathan P./0000-0003-0443-4458; Bennion, Helen/0000-0003-0125-9308; Simpson, Gavin/0000-0002-9084-8413; Rose, Neil/0000-0002-5697-7334													0046-5070	1365-2427				JUL	2015	60	7					1423	1442		10.1111/fwb.12579	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12579													WOS:000356370800015

A more spatially focused view reveals that total phosphorus declines outside of the Saginaw River plume, accompanied by more subtle chlorophyll a decreases. In contrast, soluble reactive phosphorus and ammonia have recently declined throughout the bay, while nitrate has remained relatively stable. Concentration data from nearshore transects do not exhibit large differences from open-water sample sites. The 440 tonne P/year target phosphorus load established in the 1978 amendments to the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement has almost never been met, and total phosphorus concentrations regularly exceed the 15 mu g/L concentration objective proposed in documentation supporting the 1978 amendments. Seasonal patterns in both total phosphorus and chlorophyll a are more pronounced in the most recent data, with peaks occurring in September October. This apparently evolving seasonal pattern may result from seasonal changes in Saginaw River flow inputs, or seasonal variation in dreissenid mussel feeding and filtration rates. The adaptive management framework stipulated in the 2012 Great Lakes Water Quality Protocol should promote better monitoring of Saginaw Bay water quality into the future, with enhanced opportunities to better understand the factors that have maintained ongoing eutrophication symptoms.

Spatio-temporal macroinvertebrate multi-index of biotic integrity (MMiBI) for a coastal river basin: a case study of River Tana, Kenya	ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY												In the wake of climate change events, spatio-temporal integrated ecosystem models and indices are useful decision support tools for ecosystem management. We developed a preliminary spatio-temporal macroinvertebrate multi-index of biotic integrity (MMiBI) in a major tropical river basin in Kenya. Separation power of Mann-Whitney U test (p < 0.05) qualified 11 metrics from triplicate macroinvertebrate samples collected seasonally in 33 microhabitats into the scoring system of 1, 3 and 5. Validation and strengthening procedure compared the final MMiBI with selected (p < 0.05) physico-chemical parameters and post-MMiBI fieldwork. Seasonal alternating pattern of MMiBI scores suggested that it was highly likely that temporal scores performance might rank lower as compared to spatial significance on ecosystem health delineation. Although a case study in a single river basin is presented, the indexing holistic approach can be of general use for any other coastal river basin as a low-cost biomonitoring tool as a prerequisite towards ecosystem sustainability of water resources.

S	Catford, JA		Vila, M; Hulme, PE		Catford, Jane A.			Hydrological Impacts of Biological Invasions	IMPACT OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS ON ECOSYSTEM SERVICES	Invading Nature-Springer Series in Invasion Ecology											The quantity and distribution of freshwater are fundamental to many ecosystem services, including water supply, flood attenuation, habitat provision, electricity generation, navigation, and recreation. Non-native plants and animals can degrade hydrological functions through their physiology, morphology, behaviour, and interactions with other species, which can be compounded when non-native species are ecosystem engineers or transformers. Using the hydrological cycle and drawing on key global examples, this chapter outlines seven main ways in which non-native species can disrupt hydrological services and how these impacts can be managed. Non-native plants may alter local and regional climates by modifying land-atmosphere transfers of heat and moisture, surface roughness and albedo, and concentrations of aerosol particles. Differences in native and non-native water use can alter catchment runoff (usually reducing water yield), especially when non-native vegetation covers extensive areas (e.g., mesquite and eucalypts). Non-native plant invasion may alter the seasonal availability of water because of differences in the timing and duration of water use (e.g., deciduous natives vs. evergreen invaders). Non-native animals and plants can change ground surface and soil characteristics, altering surface and subsurface flows, infiltration rates, and water residence times (e.g., earthworms and beavers). Species that invade wetlands, lakes, and rivers can trap sediment, narrowing flow channels and reducing flood attenuation (e.g., tamarisk, Sagittaria, mimosa). Some plant growth forms and animal behaviours can cause channel collapse, increase sediment erosion, and alter flow paths (e.g., willows, coypu). Non-native species can modify water passage and flow velocities by altering geomorphology and hydraulics (e.g., Salvinia, zebra mussels). Invasive species management remains difficult because of feasibility and conflicting values of species (e.g., ecology versus economy, upstream versus downstream effects). An ecosystem services framework may help reconcile the differential impacts that non-native species have in time, space, and on the delivery of various services.

Historical phosphorus dynamics in Lake of the Woods (USA-Canada) - does legacy phosphorus still affect the southern basin?	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												A historical phosphorus (P) budget was constructed for southern Lake of the Woods. Sediment cores from 7 bays were radioisotopically dated and analyzed for loss-on-ignition, P, Si, diatoms, and pigments. Geochemical records for cores were combined using focusing factors for whole-basin estimates of sediment, total P, and P fraction accumulation. Although historical monitoring shows that external P loads decreased since the 1950s, sediment P has continued to increase since the mid-20th century. Much sediment P is labile and may be mobile within the sediments and/or available for internal loading and resuspension. Two mass-balance models were used to explore historical P loading scenarios and in-lake dynamics, a static one-box model and a dynamic multi-box model. The one-box model predicts presettlement external loads were slightly less than modern loads. The dynamic model shows that water-column P was higher in the 1950s-1970s than today, that the lake is sensitive to external loads because P losses from burial and outflow are high, and that the lake is moving to a new steady state with respect to water-column P and size of the active sediment P pool. The active sediment pool built up in the mid-20th century has been depleted through outflow and burial, such that its legacy effects are now minimal. Comparison of historical nutrient dynamics and sediment records of algal production showed a counterintuitive increase in production after external P loads decreased, suggesting other drivers may now regulate modern limnoecology, including seasonality of P loading, shifting nutrient limitation, and climate warming.					; Leavitt, Peter/A-1048-2013; Heathcote, Adam/I-9253-2019; Edlund, Mark/ADV-1967-2022	Reavie, Euan/0000-0001-8871-5809; Leavitt, Peter/0000-0001-9805-9307; Edlund, Mark/0000-0002-0227-1117; Heathcote, Adam/0000-0002-9633-9548													1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	4					386	402		10.1080/10402381.2017.1373172	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2017.1373172													WOS:000423047200006
J	Kaulfuss, U				Kaulfuss, Uwe			Crater stratigraphy and the post-eruptive evolution of Foulden Maar, southern New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS												Foulden Maar, Waipiata Volcanic Field, New Zealand is a partly eroded maar-diatreme formed by phreatomagmatic eruptions c. 23 Ma. Its post-eruptive evolution is reconstructed by combining outcrop, drillcore and physical core rock properties with pollen data. Facies associations in a 190 m thick composite section of the central crater sediments record four depositional stages: (1) immediate post-eruptive deposition of collapsed crater wall and tephra ring material by subaqueous gravity flows; (2) re-deposition of tephra by hyperconcentrated to turbulent gravity flows in a steep-sided lake; (3) seasonally mediated background sedimentation with recurring gravity flows in a meromictic lake; and (4) diminishing turbidity currents under decreasing relief and biogenic sedimentation over c. 130 ka. Clasts in the basal crater fill represent accidental lithic clasts of primary ejecta and indicate eruption into a mixed hard-soft rock substrate. Foulden Maar represents a 'classical' lacustrine maar crater sequence and confirms generally similar post-eruptive processes and sedimentation patterns in enclosed, lacustrine maar basins.																			0028-8306	1175-8791					2017	60	4					410	432		10.1080/00288306.2017.1365733	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288306.2017.1365733													WOS:000416802100010

A.			Early Mississippian sandy siltstones preserve rare vertebrate fossils in seasonal flooding episodes	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Flood-generated sandy siltstones are under-recognised deposits that preserve key vertebrate (actinopterygians, rhizodonts, and rarer lungfish, chondrichthyans and tetrapods), invertebrate and plant fossils. Recorded for the first time from the lower Mississippian Ballagan Formation of Scotland, more than 140 beds occur throughout a 490m thick core succession characterised by fluvial sandstones, palaeosols, siltstones, dolostone cementstones' and gypsum from a coastal-alluvial plain setting. Sandy siltstones are described as a unique taphofacies of the Ballagan Formation (Scotland, UK); they are matrix-supported siltstones with millimetre-sized siltstone and very fine sandstone lithic clasts. Common bioclasts include plants and megaspores, fish, ostracods, eurypterids and bivalves. Fossils have a high degree of articulation compared with those found in other fossil-bearing deposits, such as conglomerate lags at the base of fluvial channel sandstones. Bed thickness and distribution varies throughout the formation, with no stratigraphic trend. The matrix sediment and clasts are sourced from the reworking of floodplain sediments including desiccated surfaces and palaeosols. Secondary pedogenic modification affects 30% of the sandy siltstone beds and most (71%) overlie palaeosols or desiccation cracks. Sandy siltstones are interpreted as cohesive debris flow deposits that originated by the overbank flooding of rivers and due to localised floodplain sediment transport at times of high rainfall; their association with palaeosols and desiccation cracks indicates seasonally wet to dry cycles throughout the Tournaisian. Tetrapod and fish fossils derived from floodplain lakes and land surfaces are concentrated by local erosion and reworking, and are preserved by deposition into temporary lakes on the floodplain; their distribution indicates a local origin, with sediment transported across the floodplain in seasonal rainfall episodes. These deposits are significant new sites that can be explored for the preservation of rare non-marine fossil material and provide unique insights into the evolution of early terrestrial ecosystems.

A simple empirical tool combining Export Coefficient Model (ECM) and a Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based weighting scheme of watershed heterogeneity was proposed to estimate annual and monthly phosphorus loss, to identify critical source areas and periods, and to assess pollution control practices. The GIS-based weighting scheme was developed to represent the transport potential of runoff to move phosphorus from the land surfaces to waters, as a supplement to the source-based ECM. The empirical tool was applied to the Dianchi Lake watershed of China. The results showed that the total phosphorus loss from NPS in 2008 was 352.3 tons. The agricultural land was recognized as the largest and the most spatially various source type. The lakeside plain and the terraces of the watershed were identified as CSAs, which generated more than 90 % of non-point phosphorus. The early part of wet season (from May to August) was the CSPs, when about 70 % of non-point phosphorus was lost. The reduction of phosphorus fertilizers and the vegetated buffer strips (VBS) were effective in controlling phosphorus loss from NPS in the watershed. A reduction of 20 % in phosphorus fertilizer application combined with the set-up of VBS in both riparian area of the main watercourses and the lakeside areas would decrease 25 % of phosphorus loss.					张, 亮/AGR-2540-2022; Liu, Hongbin/U-1853-2019; Li, Sisi/IUO-7243-2023														1420-2026	1573-2967				OCT	2016	21	5					657	668		10.1007/s10666-016-9499-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10666-016-9499-1													WOS:000381993700008
J	Zhou, YB; Liang, S; Chen, Y; Jiang, QW				Zhou, Yi-Biao; Liang, Song; Chen, Yue; Jiang, Qing-Wu			The Three Gorges Dam: Does it accelerate or delay the progress towards eliminating transmission of schistosomiasis in China?	INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY												The Three Gorges Dam, located in the largest endemic area of schistosomiasis in China, is one of the world's largest hydroelectric projects to date. Some large-scale hydro projects have resulted in schistosomiasis emergence or re-emergence. Therefore, the dam's potential impact on the transmission of Schistosoma japonicum has raised concerns from medical researchers worldwide. A systematic literature review, coupled with an analysis of data on the water level and snail density in the Yangtze River was conducted to assess the impact of the dam on schistosomiasis transmission after more than 10 years of operation. The dam has significantly altered the water levels in the Yangtze River according to different seasons. These changes directly impact the ecology of the schistosome snail host. Due to the dam, there has been a reduction in the density of Oncomelania snails and/or changes in the distribution of snails. The prevalence of infection with S. japonicum has decreased in the downstream areas of the dam, including in the Dongting and Poyang Lakes. The prevalence of infection with S. japonicum in humans has decreased from 6.80 % in 2002 (before the dam began operating) to 0.50 % in 2012, and the number of people infected with S. japonicum have decreased from 94 208 in 2002 to 59 200 in 2011 in the Poyang Lake region. The presence of the dam does not seem to affect snail breeding or the prevalence of schistosomiasis in the Three Gorges Reservoir. Overall, the Three Gorges Dam has significantly contributed to changes in hydrology after more than 10 years of the dam operating. The changes caused by the dam, together with integrated control of schistosomiasis, might be accelerating the progress towards eliminating the transmission of S. japonicum in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Despite the positive effect the dam is having in controlling S. japonicum transmission, continued surveillance is required to monitor the future ecological impacts of the dam over the long term.

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate Lake Pomacochas, a high Andean lake in the north of Peru. A variety of parameters were studied, including physicochemical parameters such as temperature (T & DEG;C), dissolved oxygen (DO), potential hydrogen (pH), electrical conductivity (EC), turbidity, total dissolved solids (TDS), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), alkalinity, and chlorides hardness; the concentrations of nitrates, nitrites, sulfates, and ammonium; elements such as aluminum (Al), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), potassium (K), and boron (B); as well as metals and metalloids such as zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), and arsenic (As). In addition, pH, Zn, and Cu were evaluated at the sediment level. It is important to note that all parameters evaluated in the water matrix showed significant differences in the seasonal period and depth levels. In comparison, the parameters evaluated at the sediment level had no significant differences between the seasonal period and sampling points. As for the seasonal period, the variables that were higher for the dry season were electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, and lead while that for the wet season were biochemical oxygen demand, zinc, magnesium, turbidity, calcium, dissolved oxygen, temperature, and potential hydrogen. At the depth levels, parameters such as total dissolved solids, lead, and arsenic had similar behavior for the three depths evaluated. According to national standards, latent contamination by cadmium and lead was found in the lake water from the ecological risk assessment. However, by international standards, all sampling stations showed a high level of contamination by cadmium, lead, zinc, copper, and arsenic, which represents a potential risk for the development of socioeconomic activities in the lake. At the same time, the evaluation of sediments did not present any potential risk.

In this study, we assessed the changes of phytoplankton assemblages in response to water level increase in the Danjiangkou Reservoir, one of the largest drinking water reservoirs in Asia. The water level increased from a low of 137 m to 161 m in 2014 as a part of the South-NorthWater Diversion Project. Phytoplankton assemblages were sampled four times per year before, during and after the water level increase, at 10 sites. Environmental variables such as total nitrogen as well as phytoplankton biomass decreased after the water level increase. Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling analysis indicated that before the water level increase, phytoplankton assemblages showed distinct seasonal variation with diatom dominance in both early and late seasons while such seasonal variation was much less evident after the water level increase. Month and year (before and after) explained 13% and 6% of variance in phytoplankton assemblages (PERMANOVA, p < 0.001) respectively, and phytoplankton assemblages were significantly different before and after the water level increase. Both chlorophytes and cyanobacteria became more abundant in 2015. Phytoplankton compositional change may largely reflect the environmental changes, such as hydrodynamics mediated by the water level increase.

A palynological study of the lower and middle parts of the unit, at the Canadon Lahuinco and Canadon Caracoles sections, Cerro Condor Depocentre Chubut province, northwestern Patagonia, Argentina is presented. The quantitative composition of the palynofloras is characterised by the dominance of pollen produced by the conifer families Cheirolepidiaceae (Classopollis) and Araucariaceae (mainly Araucariacites and Callialasporites), suggesting that warm-temperate and relatively humid conditions under highly seasonal climate prevailed during the depositional times of the unit. The abundance of Botryococcus supports the presence of a shallow lake with probably saline conditions. Five palynomorph ecogroups (PEGs) were recognised: upland, lowland, riverside, coastal lake and aquatic. The ecological requirements of the different plant families forming the PEGs enable the inference of a sub-tropical palaeoclimate for the Canadon Asfalto region during late Early Jurassic to mid Middle Jurassic, which is consistent with the seasonally dry (winterwet)' biome.

Myxobacteria are the main soil microbes in this wetland. However, it is still unclear if the myxobacterial community structure and diversity can improve the ecological environment of Ebinur Lake Wetland by regulating soil nutrient cycling. Therefore, based on high-throughput sequencing of 16SrRNA gene technology, the composition, function, and diversity of the myxobacterial community in the rhizosphere of Tamarix chinensis Lour in Ebinur Lake Wetland were studied. Rhizosphere soil samples were collected from 10 sampling sites (S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, S9, and S10) for three months (April, July, and October) to explore the main biotic and abiotic factors affecting the diversity and functions of myxobacterial communities. The results revealed that diversity of myxobacterial communities was mainly influenced by the seasons. The diversity of myxobacterial communities was significantly higher in the month of July, as compared to April and October. FAPROTAX functional prediction revealed that, in addition to predation or parasitic functions, myxobacteria were mainly involved in ecological functions, such as nitrite respiration, nitrite ammonification, and nitrogen respiration. The Spearman correlation analysis of the diversity and function of myxobacteria and bacteria showed that there were significant positive correlations between myxobacteria diversity, function, and bacterial diversity. The co-occurrence analysis of myxobacteria and bacterial networks showed that over time, myxobacteria interacted differently with different bacterial networks and jointly regulated the microbial community in the rhizosphere of Tamarix chinensis Lour through predation or cooperation. The redundancy analysis of soil physicochemical factors as well as the myxobacterial community showed that electrical conductivity, exchangeable calcium, and exchangeable potassium were the most important abiotic factors affecting the diversity, structure, and function of the myxobacterial community.

Water Quality of Four Major Lakes in Mississippi, USA: Impacts on Human and Aquatic Ecosystem Health	WATER												Harmful algal blooms (HABs), harmful microorganisms (pathogens) and toxic metals represent three major agents of water quality deterioration. Water quality of three northern lakes (Sardis, Enid, and Grenada) and a central lake (Ross Barnett Reservoir) of Mississippi, USA were examined in this study. While all these lakes are heavily used for recreational purposes, the Ross Barnett Reservoir serves additionally as the primary water supply for the City of Jackson, the capital city of Mississippi. The main goal of this study was to comprehensively assess the water quality of these lakes employing field and satellite data, and evaluate the potential human and aquatic health impacts. A time-series of true color images derived from satellite data indicated that algal blooms have been a recurring phenomenon in these lakes. Cyanobacteria, the algal group that predominantly occur in freshwater and form toxic blooms, were always present in these lakes and were most abundant on many occasions. The most toxic cyanotoxin, microcystin-LR, was found in all lakes, and its concentrations exceeded federal drinking water guidelines for children under six years of age many times. Potential bioaccumulation and biomagnification of microcystin-LR may pose serious risk to the aquatic ecosystem and human health including adults. Nutrient measurements indicated that all four lakes were eutrophic. Among bacterial populations, total coliforms and enterococci exceeded guideline values on several occasions. Arsenic, cadmium, chromium, and lead were found in the water of all the lakes, with arsenic exceeding the guideline values at two sites in Ross Barnett Reservoir. While it is apparent from this study that these lakes face many water quality issues, data across all seasons will be required to document potential trends and to devise management strategies. Use of remote sensing technology is recommended to monitor some of the water quality parameters such as suspended particulate matter and algal blooms, especially cyanobacterial blooms.

Effect of organic and inorganic turbidity on the zooplankton community structure of a shallow waterbody in Central Mexico (Lake Xochimilco, Mexico)	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Aim: Lake Xochimilco is shallow (< 2m) water-body in Mexico City consisting of several interconnected canals. It is now eutrophic, with high levels of turbidity as a result of suspended sediment and phytoplankton blooms. We selected two sites, the Rowing channel with organic turbidity due to cyanobacterial blooms and the Main channel with inorganic turbidity from re-suspended clay. The aim of this work was to present data on zooplankton dynamics in two channels of the lake over one year (June, 2013 to May. 2014). Methodology: We collected zooplankton by filtering 80L of water from two sites in each of the canals, as well as measuring temperature, pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, nitrate-N and phosphate-Ps, Chlorophyll-a, and Secchi disk transparency at each of the sites. Results: The zooplankton community was dominated by rotifers; cladocerans and copepods were few. The common rotifer genera in thelake were Keratella. Brachionus, Polyarthra, Trichocerca, Filinia, Asplanchna chydorid cladocerans like Chydorus sphaericus, Pleuroxus varidentatus, Alona sp. and copepods Acantho cyclops americanus and Microcyclops rube//us. The canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) in the Rowing channel station, showed that the first two ordination axes explained 46% of the variance of the species data in CCA. The first and second axes were well correlated with the environmental data. The Monte Carlo permutation test was significant on the first axis. Interpretation: Our study showed that the presence of organic turbidity as observed in the rowing channel had a greater adverse effect than the inorganic turbidity on zooplankton density and diversity.					; Sarma, S.S.S./G-3634-2010; Morales, Manuel/F-5781-2019; Nandini, S./AFN-8031-2022	Gayosso Morales, Manuel Aaron/0000-0003-3258-9414; Sarma, S.S.S./0000-0003-2820-1579; Martinez-Jeronimo, Fernando/0000-0003-1484-9817; 													0254-8704					NOV	2017	38	6			SI		1183	1196		10.22438/jeb/38/6(SI)/03	http://dx.doi.org/10.22438/jeb/38/6(SI)/03													WOS:000417298100003

Here, we report the isolation and genomic characterization of P19250A, the first phage that infects the LD28 clade, an abundant freshwater methylotrophic bacterial group. P19250A was isolated from Lake Soyang, an oligotrophic reservoir, using an LD28 strain as a host. Morphological and genomic analyses revealed that P19250A is a lytic siphovirus with a approximate to 38.6-kb genome. To analyze the distribution of P19250A genome within its habitat, six seasonal viral metagenome (virome) samples were prepared from Lake Soyang. Through binning analysis of freshwater viromes, P19250A was shown to be the most highly assigned freshwater phage that infects heterotrophic bacteria (up to 8.21%) in five viromes. Furthermore, when freshwater virome data collected worldwide were analyzed, P19250A genome also showed high abundance, especially in Lough Neagh, UK, where P19250A genome was recorded as the most abundant bacteriophage. From metagenome analysis, the proportion of P19250A-assigned reads showed seasonal fluctuation following the abundance of the LD28 clade in Lake Soyang. These results showed that P19250A would be an essential resource for analyses of freshwater viromes, and also suggest that phages of other abundant freshwater bacteria need to be isolated for better understanding of freshwater viruses.

The origin and characteristics of natural organic matter (NOM) in the lake and its tributary rivers were studied using fluorescence excitation emission matrices (EEM) and parallel factor analysis. Two humic-like and one proteinous components were sufficient to describe EEM variability among 167 water samples collected between 2/2005 and 9/2006. The two humic-like components showed different relations in lake and riverine samples. Their vertical distribution in the lake was affected by seasonal stratification and distance from water surface, presumably reflecting the release of humic-like matter from sediments, its production via NOM transformation in the bottom layers, and its photodegradation in the upper layers. Vertical distribution of the proteinous component, indicating biological activity at upper water layers, did not correlate with that of the humic-like components. Dissolved organic carbon concentrations did not show any vertical stratification, emphasizing the power of EEM to explore NOM dynamics. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We found the highest Cd concentrations in the panicles and leaves; while the highest Cu and Mn were observed in the roots, the highest Pb in the panicles, and the highest Zn in the panicles and buds. In contrast, the lowest Cd concentrations were detected in the stem, roots, and buds; the lowest Cu concentrations in the leaves and stems; the lowest Mn concentrations in the panicles, rhizomes, and buds; the lowest Pb concentrations in the stems; and the lowest Zn concentrations in the leaves, stems, and rhizomes. Mean Cu concentration in the plant showed a positive regression coefficient with plot elevation, soil organic matter content, and soil Cu concentration, whereas it showed a negative regression coefficient with soil moisture and electrolyte leakage. Mean Mn concentration showed positive and negative regression coefficients with soil organic matter and soil moisture, respectively. Mean Pb concentration exhibited positive regression coefficient with plot elevation and soil total P concentration, and Zn concentration showed a positive regression coefficient with soil available P and total P concentrations. However, there was no significant regression coefficient between mean Cd concentration in the plant and the investigated environmental parameters. Stems and roots were the main organs involved in heavy metal accumulation from the environment. The mean quantities of heavy metals accumulated in the plant tissues were 2.2 mg Cd, 86.7 mg Cu, 290.3 mg Mn, 15.9 mg Pb, and 307 mg Zn per square meter. In the Dongting Lake wetlands, 0.7 x 10(3) kg Cd, 22.9 x 10(3) kg Cu, 77.5 x 10(3) kg Mn, 3.1 x 10(3) kg Pb, and 95.9 x 10(3) kg Zn per year were accumulated by aboveground organs and removed from the lake through harvesting for paper manufacture.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				JUL	2018	25	20					20003	20011		10.1007/s11356-018-2174-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-2174-0								29744779					WOS:000437395400069

Fish movement strategies in an ephemeral river in the Simpson Desert, Australia	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Arid zone catchments experience extreme hydrological variability and some rivers are entirely ephemeral, replenished only by intermittent flooding. The ecological roles of ephemeral systems are rarely studied. This paper describes movement patterns of fish in the Mulligan River, an ephemeral system in the Lake Eyre Basin, central Australia. Several sites were sampled along a temporal gradient encompassing floods and dry periods. After a single major flood in 2007 up to seven fish species were found at sites up to 300km from the closest permanent waterhole. Following a series of floods (when waterholes were replenished and remained wet between 2009 and 2011) a further five species were recorded including the first records for the Lake Eyre hardyhead, Craterocephalus eyresii, from the rivers of far western Queensland. The presence of all species known from the parent catchment (the Georgina, where permanent waterholes occur) in the ephemeral catchment (the Mulligan) suggests that many fish species present in the river systems of central Australia are capable of dispersing long distances following the opening of movement pathways during flooding. However, two distinct groups of species were identified: extreme dispersing species, that move as far as possible into intermittently wetted habitats, and conservative dispersing species, that do not move as far, tending to inhabit deeper waterholes within mid-reaches of the river that are more likely to hold water for longer. Preservation of the natural flow regime of Australia's arid-zone rivers is important for maintaining these fish communities and facilitating study of their adaptations to ephemerality.

J	Wang, XT; Ying, F; Chen, Y; Han, XD				Wang, Xueting; Ying, Feng; Chen, Yu; Han, Xiaodong			Microcystin (-LR) affects hormones level of male mice by damaging hypothalamic-pituitary system	TOXICON												Microcystin (-LR) (MC-LR) is a broad distributed hepatotoxic microcystin produced by common freshwater phytoplankton species. Recently, its toxic effects on male reproductive system drew great attention. To investigate its reproductive toxicity and the underlying mechanism, BALB/c mice were exposed to MC-LR by intraperitoneal injection with different injection duration (1, 4, 7 and 14 days) and injection concentration (3.75, 7.5, 15 and 30 mu g kg b.w.(-1) day(-1)) as an in vivo test. For in vitro test, isolated mice Leydig cells were exposed to MC-LR at doses of 1, 10, 100, 250, 500 750 and 1000 nmol/L for 24 h. MC-LR did not induce significant changes in Kiss-1, GPR54, Gnrhr, Fshr or Lhr expression. It decreased the Gnrh expression in a dose- and duration-dependent manner. It increased and subsequently decreased the expressions of FSH, LH and testosterone. In in vivo test, MC-LR was not able to enter Leydig cells and had no cytotoxicity on Leydig cells. The results showed that MC-LR affected male mice serum hormones and mRNA expressions by damaging the hypothalamic-pituitary systems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, there are currently limitedinformation about national-scale data of CH4 and N2O emissions from inland waters, such as lakes, rivers, andreservoirs, particularly in developing countries. This study employedmachine learning techniques, based on the literature data and nationalwater quality monitoring data, to reveal the CH4 and N2O emission patterns of China's inland waters at thethird-level basin and daily resolution. Our results show significantseasonal variations in CH4 emissions, which were influencedby total nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand concentrations. Northernwatersheds were identified as hotspots of CH4 emissions,with 57% higher CH4 flux than the other watersheds. Incontrast, N2O had a relatively lower contribution to totalcarbon emissions and showed smaller temporal and spatial variations.The estimated total emissions of CH4 and N(2)Oin China's inland waters in 2021 amounted to 80.22 Tg of carbondioxide equivalent, accounting for 9-11% of China'sterrestrial carbon sinks. This research provides valuable insightsto guide the counting and control of greenhouse gas emissions fromenvironmental water bodies. High-resolutionspatiotemporal footprint of methane andnitrous oxide emissions from China's inland waters was providedand the drivers for the spatial and seasonable variations were identified.

Amebic infections of the central nervous system	JOURNAL OF NEUROVIROLOGY												The report of death of a person from amebic meningoencephalitis, the proverbial "brain-eating ameba," Naegleria fowleri, acquired in a state park lake in Iowa in July 2022 has once again raised the seasonal alarms about this pathogen. While exceptionally rare, its nearly universal fatality rate has panicked the public and made for good copy for the news media. This review will address free-living ameba that have been identified as causing CNS invasion in man, namely, Naegleria fowleri, Acanthamoeba species, Balamuthia mandrillaris, and Sappinia diploidea (Table 1). Of note, several Acanthamoeba spp. and Balamuthia mandrillaris may also be associated with localized extra-CNS infections in individuals who are immunocompetent and disseminated disease in immunocompromised hosts. These ameba are unique from other protozoa in that they are free-living, have no known insect vector, do not result in a human carrier state, and are typically unassociated with poor sanitation.

Reduced nitrogen availability due to accelerated denitrification at higher temperatures or in response to reduced N loadings aimed to reduce the eutrophication may affect periphyton biomass and composition, to compensate for the low N availability (e.g. promoting N-2-fixing). We analysed periphyton responses to N decline in 12 eutrophic shallow lake mesocosms during one year of low N compared to high N, under three temperature scenarios: ambient, A2 IPCC scenario and A2 increased by 50%. We used two submerged macrophytes (Potamogeton crispus and Elodea canadensis) and artificial imitations of these as substrates for periphyton growth. Nitrogen decline increased periphyton biomass and induced compositional changes irrespective of season, plant type, and temperature. Periphyton biomass was negatively associated to phytoplankton and positively to plant complexity. Warmer scenarios negatively affected periphyton exclusively at high N loadings. Low N conditions were associated with lower periphyton taxonomic richness, lower N-2-fixing cyanobacteria biovolume and increased biovolume of large-sized chlorophytes and non-N-2-fixing cyanobacteria. Our results suggest that low N conditions promoted periphyton due to a more efficient use of nutrients and improved light conditions resulting from lower phytoplankton biomass and contrasting effects of temperature.

Pigment-based chemotaxonomy (CHEMTAX) is now widely applied to study of phytoplankton community structure on broader spatial and temporal scales of oceans, but the ability of this approach to provide estimates of phytoplankton assemblage in freshwater ecosystems is yet underdeveloped. To investigate the efficiency of the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-CHEMTAX in quantifying the different phytoplankton groups in inland freshwater, we present a comparison between phytoplankton pigment analyses by HPLC with CHEMTAX and microscopic counting of phytoplankton samples from four subtropical reservoirs in January and July 2014, respectively. The correlation between pigment and phytoplankton abundance detected by microscopy was stronger than that between pigment and phytoplankton biomass. The published marker pigments and their revised ratios can be used to describe phytoplankton abundances in a mixed community of freshwater phytoplankton, and pigment-based CHEMTAX can successfully describe the overall pattern of phytoplankton community dynamics during different seasons. The use of pigment-based CHEMTAX for quick surveys of phytoplankton communities can be recommended as a useful supplement or alternative tool to microscopy for freshwater ecosystem management.

Seasonal Influence on the Parasite Fauna of a Wild Population of Astronotus ocellatus (Perciformes: Cichlidae) from the Brazilian Amazon	JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY												Parasite infracommunities were studied in 202 specimens of Astronotus ocellatus collected from a freshwater lake in the State of Amapa, northern Brazil. Relationships between some host attributes (i.e., ontogeny, sex, and body size) and parasite infections were analyzed, but the primary focus was the seasonal variation in the parasite fauna. In total, 6,308,912 parasites belonging to 11 different taxa were found. Protozoa were the most abundant and dominant taxa, but monogeneans, trematode metacercariae, and nematode larvae were also prevalent and abundant. Fish ontogeny had a weak influence on parasite infection rates; juveniles were more parasitized by Dolops nana and Posthodiplostomum sp. The abundances of all parasite species were weakly correlated with host body size (low r(2) values), except D. nana, Contracaecum sp., and Posthodiplostomum sp., which exhibited no correlation between abundance and host body size. Prevalence and abundance were different between flood and drainage seasons for all parasite species, except for D. nana and the 2 metacercarial species. Astronotus ocellatus may represent a link in food-web transmissions for parasites because it is used both as definitive and intermediate host. The parasite fauna of A. ocellatus was composed primarily of ectoparasites, and this could be considered typical of fishes that inhabit lentic waters. Seasonality was a strong determinant in the parasite community structure.					; Bisaggio Pereira, Felipe/D-6289-2015; Tavares-Dias, Marcos/AAI-4783-2021; Pereira, Felipe/D-6289-2015; Luque, Jose/C-9767-2014	Luque, Jose/0000-0003-3515-1127; Bisaggio Pereira, Felipe/0000-0002-7921-5965; Tavares-Dias, Marcos/0000-0002-8376-1846; 													0022-3395	1937-2345				AUG	2013	99	4					718	721		10.1645/12-84.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1645/12-84.1								23421456					WOS:000322821900024

In order to investigate this type of activity, we have combined satellite images with fieldwork and extensive sampling of water and gas at seeping gryphons, pools and salsa lakes at the Dashgil mud volcano in Azerbaijan. We find that caldera collapse faults and E-W oriented faults determine the location of the seeps. The seeping gas is dominated by methane (94.9-99.6%), with a delta C-13 (parts per thousand V-PDB) in the -43.9 to -40.4 parts per thousand range, consistent throughout the 12 analysed seeps. Ethane and carbon dioxide occur in minor amounts. Seventeen samples of seeping water show a wide range in solute content and isotopic composition. Pools and salsa lakes have the highest salinities (up to 101,043 ppm Cl) and the lowest delta O-18 (parts per thousand V-SMOW) values (1-4 parts per thousand). The mud-rich gryphons have low salinities (<18,000 ppm Cl) and are enriched in O-18 (delta O-18 = 4-6 parts per thousand). The gas geochemistry suggests that the gases migrate to the surface from continuously leaking deep-seated reservoirs underneath the mud volcano, with minimal oxidation during migration. However, variations in gas wetness can be ascribed to molecular fractionation during the gas rise. In contrast, the water shows seasonal variations in isotopic composition and surface evaporation is proposed as a mechanism to explain high water salinities in salsa lakes. By contrast, gryphons have geochemical signals suggesting a deep-seated water source. These results demonstrate that the plumbing system of dormant mud volcanoes is continuously recharged from deeper sedimentary reservoirs and that a branched system of conduits exists in the shallow subsurface. While the gas composition is consistently similar throughout the crater, the large assortment of water present reflects the type of seep (i.e. gryphons versus pools and salsa lakes) and their location within the volcano. Our data highlight the importance of a carefully planned sampling strategy when the target is water geochemistry, whereas the methane content and isotopic composition is relatively independent of the particular seep morphology.

Variability of carbon dioxide flux from tropical (Cerrado) hydroelectric reservoirs	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Hydroelectric reservoirs generate energy without significant combustion of fossil fuels. However, these systems can, potentially, emit greenhouse gases (GHG's) at a rate which may be significant at the global scale, and, possible, co-equal, per kilowatt-hour, to that from conventional coal or oil-fired systems. Although much of the new construction of hydroelectric reservoirs is in the tropics, most of the data on GHG emissions comes from temperate regions. Further, much of the existing data on reservoir gas emissions comes from single sites, usually near the terminal dams. Large tropical reservoirs often involve the impoundments of river systems with complex morphology which in turn can cause spatial heterogeneity in gas flux. We evaluated spatial and seasonal variability in CO2 concentrations and gas flux for five large (50-1,400 km(2)) reservoirs in the Cerrado region of Brazil. Most of data set (87% of all measurements) showed CO2 supersaturation and net efflux to the atmosphere. There was as much or more variation in pCO(2) over space and among seasons. The large studied reservoirs showed different zones in terms of CO2 emission because those fluxes are dependent on flooded biomass, watershed input of organic matter and dam operation regime. Here we demonstrate that the reservoirs in the Brazilian Cerrado have low rates of CO2 emissions compared to existing global comparisons. Our results suggest that ignoring the spatial variability can lead to more than 25% error in total system gas flux.

The role of physical properties in controlling soil nitrogen cycling across a tundra-forest ecotone of the Colorado Rocky Mountains, USA	CATENA												There is growing recognition that physical characteristics of landscapes influence nitrogen (N) cycling. The relationships among climate forcing, soil properties, and the fate of N are particularly important in alpine ecosystems vulnerable to climate warming and characterized by shallow, rocky soils. This study evaluated differences in net N mineralization and nitrification rates determined using in-field incubation experiments across patches defined by six plant community types within an alpine catchment of the Colorado Rocky Mountains. We considered not only differences in net N transformation rates across space and time within a growing season, but also whether or not soil properties (i.e., physical and chemical) and conditions (i.e., temperature and moisture) could explain patch-scale variation in rates. Highest net N mineralization and nitrification rates occurred in the dry meadow (3.7 +/- 0.5 and 3.4 +/- 0.5 mu g N cm(-2) d(-1), respectively), while the lowest were in the subalpine forest (-0.3 +/- 0.4 and 0.0 +/- 0.1 mu g N cm(-2) d(-1)), which exhibited net N immobilization. The magnitude of differences in net N transformation rates through time differed among patches and was strongly controlled by soil C:N ratios. Dry and moist meadow communities showed the greatest range in net N transformation rates across the growing season and changes were positively correlated with soil moisture. In contrast, inhibition of nitrification at high soil moisture occurred in wet meadow areas. Our data suggest that as the alpine growing season lengthens in a drier, warmer future, changes in soil moisture will likely be a primary factor driving patterns of net N transformation rates.

Since 2003, the average lake water level has significantly declined by 1.35 m during the dry season. Quantifying the contribution of different factors to water level decline is necessary for lake management. The impact factors mainly include hydrological and topographic changes in terms of the decreased inflow from the five tributaries, lower water level in the Yangtze River, the decline of the lakebed, and the increased discharge ability of the lake. Back-propagation neural networks have been constructed to simulate the lake water level, considering preimpact and postimpact streamflow and topographic scenarios. The simulations verified the robustness and applicability of the networks and indicated that the streamflow and topographic changes contributed approximately 34% and 66% to the decline in the water level, respectively. The Three Gorges Reservoir exerts various impacts on the water level of Poyang Lake. The reservoir sedimentation causes riverbed erosion and lowers the downstream water level. The water release increases the downstream flow and is conducive to elevating the lake water level. But the impact is marginal because it is diluted by the topographic changes and the decreased runoff of the subbasins along the middle and lower Yangtze River. These results provide useful information to guide strategies for wetland and lacustrine ecological protection associated with water level fluctuations.

Chemical processes between sediment and water have been described based on the determination of ions, metals, non-metals, and TOC concentrations. Rock weathering is an important source of Fe, Ni, Co, Al in the seashore area. The PCA shows the impact of acidification in the release metals from sediment. Our results indicate that riverine mineral fluxes need to be accounted for as the volume of melt increases in response to climate change. Based on geoaccumulation indexes (anthropogenic fingerprint), we observed an increased concentration of Pb (I-geo = 1.643), in the lake near station facilities and Cd in the area of Ecology Glacier (I-geo > 1.389). Taking into account climate change and the intensification of anthropopressure, our study indicates that Antarctica requires a special focus on the seasonal dynamics of mineral content and pollution assessment.

Understanding the effect of hydrological disturbance on lake from the perspective of multiple aquatic organisms is important for lake management. Poyang Lake (PYL) experiences severe hydrological disturbance under the effects of flood pulse during the rainy season. In this study, we analyzed the responses of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and macroinvertebrates to hydrological disturbance during the rainy season in PYL. Flood pulse determined the spatial variation in turbidity (Turb), transparency (Trans), dissolved oxygen (DO), total phosphorus (TP), and soluble reactive phosphorus. Physical factors (Turb, Trans, conductivity) explained phytoplankton (9.6%) and zooplankton (15%) community variation, and the combination of physical and nutrient factors explained macroinvertebrate (3.8%) community variation. Cyclotella sp., Attheya zachariasi, and Melosira ambigua were the keystone taxa of phytoplankton, and these taxa were driven by Turb and Trans. Brachionus angularia, Polyarthra vulgaris, Filinia longiseta, and Diffugia globulosa were the keystone taxa of zooplankton and entire aquatic organisms, which contributed a lot to maintain the biological community stability possibly through the food web. These keystone taxa were stimulated by high Trans, DO, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrate (NO3-). We found habitat conditions (Turb, Trans and DO) were the prominent factors influencing the aquatic organism structure in strong hydrological disturbance environment. For the keystone taxa, both habitat conditions (i.e., DO) and exogenous nutrient inputs (i.e., DOC and NO3-) caused significant effect. This study provides new insights into the holistic response of multiple aquatic communities to flood pulse as well as the role of keystone species in maintaining community stability, which could guide the conservation and management of seasonal lake ecosystems.					; Tao, Cheng-an/H-4232-2014; yang, chenyu/IUP-9513-2023	Liu, Yang/0000-0001-8959-1529; 													1386-2588	1573-5125				JUN	2021	55	2					379	399		10.1007/s10452-020-09829-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-020-09829-y		APR 2021											WOS:000638835600001

Net Ecosystem Production and Carbon Greenhouse Gas Fluxes in Three Prairie Wetlands	ECOSYSTEMS												In central North America, prairie wetlands provide many important ecosystem services including attenuating floods, improving water quality, and supporting biodiversity. However, over half of these wetlands have been drained for agriculture. Relatively little is known about the functioning of these ecosystems either in their natural state or restored after drainage. We characterized net ecosystem production and carbon greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes (carbon dioxide [CO2] and methane) in the open-water zones of three prairie wetlands over two ice-free seasons. These wetlands included a natural site and sites restored 3 and 14 years prior to study (hereafter "recently restored" and "older restored"). We also assessed how two techniques for estimating metabolic status, the diel oxygen method (used to measure NEP) and net CO2 fluxes, compared. The diel oxygen method suggested that the restored wetlands were net heterotrophic across years, whereas the natural wetland was net heterotrophic in 1 year and net autotrophic in the other. Similar conclusions arose from quantifying net CO2 fluxes, although this technique proved to be relatively insensitive for understanding metabolic status at a daily temporal scale owing to the influence of geochemical processes on CO2 concentrations. GHG efflux was greatest from the recently restored wetland, followed by the older restored and natural wetlands. Overall, GHG flux rates were high and variable compared with other inland aquatic ecosystems. Although restoration may progressively return wetland functioning to near-natural states, our results highlight the necessity of preventing wetland drainage in the first place to preserve ecosystem functions and services.

Surface water samples were collected from 23 different locations of the Chandra Tal (Lake) situated in the Western Himalaya and analyzed for 12 different physicochemical parameters for understanding hydrogeochemistry of the study area. The average value of pH in the lake water was measured to be 8.1, showing alkaline nature. HCO3- was the most dominant anion and Ca2+ and Mg2+ were major cations in the Chandra Tal water. The high ratios of (Ca2+ + Mg2+)/TZ(+) (total cations), (Ca2+ + Mg2+)/(Na+ + K+), Ca2+/Na+, Mg2+/Na+, and HCO3-/Na+ show the dominancy of carbonate weathering as a major source of dissolved ions in the lake water of the study area. On the other hand, equivalent ratios of Na+/Cl- and K+/Cl- are significantly higher than the sea aerosol indicating relatively minor contribution of these ions from atmospheric fallout to the chemical composition of the Chandra Tal water. The carbon dioxide partial pressure (Pco(2)) of the lake water (10(-2.9) atm) was significantly higher than Pco(2) value of the atmosphere (10(-3.5) atm), showing disequilibrium with respect to the atmosphere and open system weathering in the catchment. The correlation and R-mode principal component analysis indicate that Chandra Tal water chemistry is mainly controlled by weathering processes such as carbonate and silicate weathering, oxidation of pyrite, dissolution of sulphate minerals along with small contribution from atmospheric precipitation, and anthropogenic activities.

This is important from a zoonotic perspective because it influences directly on the spread of many diseases. For the first time, an extensive survey on the prevalence of Leptospira infections in Polish wild boars was performed. During the hunting season 2012-2014, 3621 blood samples from wild boars were collected. The animals originated from different geographical areas across Poland. Serum samples were tested by a microscopic agglutination test (MAT) for the presence of specific antibodies to the following Leptospira serovars: Icterohaemorrhagiae, Grippotyphosa, Sejroe, Tarassovi, Pomona, Canicola, Bratislava, Autumnalis, Hardjo and Ballum. Results: Antibody titers to all Leptospira serovars except serovar Ballum were found in 377 serum samples (10.4 %). The highest number of seropositive wild boars was found in the south-eastern part of Poland and in highly urbanized areas such as Silesia and Lodz. Conclusions: The relatively high prevalence of Leptospira infections in wild boars may constitute a threat to hunters and people having contact with forest lakes or marshlands. The results also indicate that an increasing population of wild boar living close to borders of cities may create additional risk for inhabitants in large urban areas.

Hybrid watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum x Myriophyllum sibiricum) exhibits traits associated with greater invasiveness than its introduced and native parental taxa	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Hybridization has been associated with increased invasiveness in plants. In North America, the hybrid aquatic plant Myriophyllum spicatum x Myriophyllum sibiricum (hybrid watermilfoil, hereafter HWM) is a cross between non-native invasive Eurasian watermilfoil (M. spicatum, EWM) and native northern watermilfoil (M. sibiricum, NWM). Lab-based trials have demonstrated higher growth rates in HWM compared to EWM and NWM, but these patterns have not been systematically examined in the field. In this study, we compared the invasiveness of HWM to its parental taxa, EWM and NWM, by examining the amount and timing of: (1) flowering, (2) surface cover, and (3) biomass (using stem counts as a proxy). We conducted repeat surveys of Myriophyllum beds at eight lakes (2-3 lakes/taxon) in the Minneapolis-St. Paul Metropolitan area (Minnesota, USA) between June 2017 and November 2018. HWM produced more flower spikes earlier and overall, and maintained consistently more flower spikes throughout the growing season than EWM and NWM. In addition, surface cover reached greater annual peaks and was higher for longer throughout the growing season for HWM than for both parental taxa. We did not observe a significant difference in stem counts among the three taxa, but HWM did reach a higher maximum number of stems than either parental taxon. This study provides field-based evidence of increased invasiveness associated with hybridization between EWM and NWM; specifically, greater reproductive potential via flowering and greater surface cover may increase HWM spread, have greater impacts on native species, and pose more of a nuisance to lake users.					; Larkin, Daniel/IVV-7477-2023; Glisson, Wesley/AAB-7984-2019	Larkin, Daniel/0000-0001-6378-0495; Glisson, Wesley/0000-0002-2540-3696													1387-3547	1573-1464				AUG	2021	23	8					2417	2433		10.1007/s10530-021-02514-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-021-02514-7		APR 2021											WOS:000637672700002

Risks from mercury in anadromous fish collected from Penobscot River, Maine	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Levels of total mercury were measured in tissue of six species of migratory fish (alewife, American shad, blueback herring, rainbow smelt, striped bass, and sea lamprey), and in roe of American shad for two consecutive years collected from the Penobscot River or its estuary. The resultant mercury levels were compared to reference doses as established in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Integrated Risk Information System and wildlife values. Mercury concentrations ranged from 4 mu g/kg ww in roe to 1040 mu g/kg ww in sea lamprey. Sea lamprey contained the highest amounts of mercury for both seasons of sampling. Current health advisories are set at sufficient levels to protect fishers from harmful consumption of the fish for mercury alone, except for sea lamprey. Based upon published wildlife values for mink, otter, and eagle, consumption of rainbow smelt, striped bass, or sea lamprey poses a risk to mink; striped bass and sea lamprey to otter; and sea lamprey to eagle. For future consideration, the resultant data may serve as a reference point for both human health and wildlife risk assessments for the consumption of anad-romous fish.

Based on Himawari-8 satellite observation and Weather Research and Forecasting model results, this study examines the influences of lakes on daytime cloud cover during warm seasons over the Tibetan Plateau (TP), which is home to thousands of lakes. Observation shows the existence of cloud holes and narrow cloud rings around the lakes, that is, fewer clouds over the lakes and more clouds along the shoreline, which has rarely been reported and is considered typical to TP by comparison with lakes outside of TP. The threshold size of lakes that can produce the shoreline cloud ring is identified to be about 300 km(2), as a conservative estimate. We further highlight the importance of atmosphere advection/background wind in the formation of lake-associated clouds. Lake breeze forms under weak background winds and the downdraft branch inhibits cloud formation over the lakes; while the updraft branch causes convection to form clouds over lakeshores. However, strong background winds do not favor lake breeze formation, changing cloud distribution over the lakes. Fewer clouds are also found in the downwind regions, and this influence is at a distance comparable to the lake scale. Due to fewer clouds over lakes, shortwave radiation is significantly larger (similar to 100 W/m(2)) and longwave radiation is smaller (similar to a few W/m(2)) than that of the further land region. Therefore, the above observational facts provide a new perspective to advance the understanding of lake-air interactions. Plain Language Summary There are lots of lakes over the Tibetan Plateau (TP), but the influence of these lakes on cloud during warm seasons remain unclear. Satellite data shows the existence of cloud holes and narrow cloud rings around the lakes, that is, fewer clouds over the lakes and more clouds along the shoreline, which has rarely been reported before. Simulation results demonstrate that the lake breeze accounts for this phenomenon: air descends over the lake, which inhibits cloud formation, while ascending branch over the shoreline favors cloud formation. Lakes over 300 km(2) can yield these cloud influences, so this area is thought as the threshold area that lakes can have influence on atmosphere. Clouds in the downwind regions are also fewer under the influence of background wind, and this influencing distance is almost equal to the lake scale itself. Due to less block by clouds, solar radiation is much higher over the lake than surrounding land, but downward longwave radiation is a little lower because of less emission from the cloud bottom, resulting an increase of net radiation in total at the lake surface. The conclusions of this study can help understand energy and hydrology processes of lakes better over the TP.

The rate of thermokarst lake formation and drainage is anticipated to accelerate as the climate warms. However, it is uncertain how these dynamic features impact the terrestrial Arctic carbon cycle. Methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes were measured during peak growing season using eddy covariance and chambers at Illisarvik, a 0.16 km(2) thermokarst lake basin that was experimentally drained in 1978 on Richards Island, Northwest Territories, Canada. Vegetation in the basin differs markedly from the surrounding dwarf-shrub tundra and included patches of tall shrubs, grasses, and sedges with some bare ground and a small pond in the centre. During the peak growing season, temperature and wind conditions were highly variable, and soil water content decreased steadily. Basin-scaled net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) measured by eddy covariance was 1.5 [CI95% +/- 0 :2] gC-CO2 m(-2) d(-1); NEE followed a marked diurnal pattern with no day-to-day trend during the study period. Variations in half-hourly NEE were primarily controlled by photosynthetic photon flux density and influenced by vapour pressure deficit, volumetric water content, and the presence of shrubs within the flux tower footprint, which varied with wind direction. Net methane exchange (NME) was low (8.7 [CI95% +/- 0 :4] mgCH(4)m(-2) d(-1)) and had little impact on the growing season carbon balance of the basin. NME displayed high spatial variability, and sedge areas in the basin were the strongest source of CH4 while upland areas outside the basin were a net sink. Soil moisture and temperature were the main environmental factors influencing NME. Presently, Illisarvik is a carbon sink during the peak growing season. However, these results suggest that rates of growing season CO2 and CH4 exchange rates may change as the basin's vegetation community continues to evolve.					; Christen, Andreas/I-6037-2012	Humphreys, Elyn/0000-0002-5397-2802; 													1726-4170	1726-4189				SEP 4	2020	17	17					4421	4441		10.5194/bg-17-4421-2020	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-4421-2020													WOS:000569372000001

This study collected sediment cores from two sites with different pollution levels in Meiliang Bay, Taihu Lake (China). The samples were used in simulation experiments designed to elucidated the effects of dredging on internal loading in different seasons. The results showed that dredging the upper 30 cm of sediment could effectively reduce the contents of organic matter, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus in the sediments. Total biological activity in the dredged sediment was weaker (p < 0.05) than in the undredged sediment in all seasons for both the Inner Bay and Outer Bay, but the effect of 30-cm dredging on sediment oxygen demand was negligible. Dredging had a significant controlling effect on phosphorus release in both the Inner Bay and Outer Bay, and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) fluxes from the dredged cores were generally lower (p < 0.05) than from the undredged cores. In contrast, NH4+-N fluxes from the dredged cores were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than from the undredged cores in all seasons for both sites, this indicates short-term risk of NH4+-N release after dredging, and this risk is greatest in seasons with higher temperatures, especially for the Inner Bay. Dredging had a limited effect on NO2--N and NO3--N fluxes at both sites. These results suggest that dredging could be a useful approach for decreasing internal loading in Taihu Lake, and that the seasons with low temperature (non-growing season) are suitable for performing dredging projects.					; ZHANG, YI/AAU-5378-2020	Yu, Juhua/0000-0002-6398-6175; 														2073-4441				NOV	2018	10	11							1606	10.3390/w10111606	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10111606													WOS:000451736300113

Evaluating the potential for tactical hunting in the Middle Stone Age: Insights from a bonebed of the extinct bovid, Rusingoryx atopocranion	JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION												The foraging behaviors of Middle Stone Age (MSA) early modern humans have largely been based on evidence from well-stratified cave sites in South Africa. Whereas these sites have provided an abundance of data for behavioral reconstruction that are unmatched elsewhere in Africa, they are unlikely to preserve evidence of the diversity of foraging strategies employed by MSA hunters who lived in a variety of ecological and landscape settings across the African continent. Here we describe the results of recent excavations at the open-air site of Bovid Hill at Wakondo, Rusinga Island, Kenya, which yielded 24 in situ MSA artifacts within an assemblage of bones comprised exclusively of the extinct alcelaphin bovid Rusingoryx atopocranion. The excavated faunal assemblage is characterized by a prime-age-dominated mortality profile and includes cut-marked specimens and an associated MSA Levallois blade-based artifact industry recovered from a channel deposit dated to 68 +/- 5 ka by optically stimulated luminescence. Taphonomic, geologic, and faunal evidence points to mass exploitation of Rusingoryx by humans at Bovid Hill, which likely represents an initial processing site that was altered post-depositionally by fluvial processes. This site highlights the importance of rivers and streams for mass procurement in an open and seasonal landscape, and provides important new insights into MSA behavioral variability with respect to environmental conditions, site function, and tactical foraging strategies in eastern Africa. Bovid Hill thus joins a growing number of MSA and Middle Paleolithic localities that are suggestive of tactical hunting behaviors and mass capture of gregarious ungulate prey. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Are elusive anaerobic pathways key methane sinks in eutrophic lakes and reservoirs?	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Collectively, freshwaters constitute a significant source of methane to the atmosphere, and both methane production and methane oxidation can strongly influence net emissions. Anaerobic methane oxidation (AOM) is recognized as a strong regulator of marine methane emissions and appreciation of AOM's importance in freshwater is growing. In spite of this renewed interest, recent work and reactive-transport modeling results we present in this paper point to unresolved pathways for AOM. Comparison of recent observations from a eutrophic reservoir, Lacamas Lake, with predictions of a 1D steady-state model of water column methane dynamics indicates that high rates of methane oxidation measured via bottle assays cannot be explained with conventional electron acceptors (O-2, NO2 (-), NO3 (-), SO4 (2-), Mn4+, and Fe3+). Reactive-transport modeling suggests that solute oxidant concentrations at the thermocline would have to be around 10 times higher than observed to explain the measured methane consumption. Organic acids-a major constituent of organic matter-may account for part of this unexplained AOM given their abundance in eutrophic systems, although the details of these pathways remain elusive (e.g., which species are involved, seasonal renewal of reduced species, contribution of particulate versus dissolved phases). We point to several observations consistent with organic acid-mediated AOM, both in Lacamas Lake and in other systems. Nevertheless, direct evidence of this pathway is still lacking and testing for this remains an important direction for future work. To this end, we identify several new avenues of research that would help quantify the role of organic acid-mediated AOM relative to other electron acceptors.

Bycatch of non-target species in commercial fishing nets can have adverse impacts on their populations. Freshwater turtle populations are particularly susceptible to increases in adult mortality, and freshwater turtles are among the most threatened vertebrates. 2. As a case study, the population-level impacts of bycatch mortality on freshwater turtles were evaluated in Lake Opinicon, Ontario, Canada, a lake that supports a small-scale commercial fishery. Using population viability analyses, the impacts of bycatch on common snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina), eastern musk turtles (Sternotherus odoratus), northern map turtles (Graptemys geographica), and painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) were evaluated. 3. In all four species, even low levels of additional annual female mortality as a result of bycatch were sufficient either to reduce population size or to cause extirpation of the local population within 500years. Bycatch reduction programmes, such as seasonal closures and implementation of bycatch reduction devices, can help alleviate the risk of extirpation. Changes to fishing season length could help reduce the number of snapping turtles and musk turtles captured. Installation of simple bycatch reduction devices can exclude between 95% and 100% of snapping turtles and between 0% and 97% of the other three species, depending on the width of the exclusion device. If combined, these two bycatch reduction methods would help prevent adult female mortality and help maintain turtle populations in Lake Opinicon. 4. Although these findings are specific to the study area, the same principles apply to other areas where similar simple bycatch reduction strategies can be employed to prevent the extirpation of other freshwater turtle species. Considering the consequences of bycatch and of bycatch reduction programmes on populations provides managers with important information to support development of risk-averse conservation strategies.

Five stations within the reservoir were selected, and water quality parameters were determined at four different depths (surface, 5 m, 10 m, and 15 m). Water quality parameters were analyzed on-site using a HACH, HQ40d portable multi-meter, and turbidity was measured using Wag tech turbidity meter and in the laboratory using the standard method. Comparison of water quality parameters among depths were conducted using one-way ANOVA and Tukey's pairwise comparisons with 5% significance level. The probable contributing source of the investigated physicochemical water quality parameters at different depth was identified using Principal components analysis. The results show that depth wise except for total suspended solids (TSS), total dissolved solids (TDS), total phosphorus (TP) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) the rest showed statistically significant difference at p < 0.05 level. Negative correlations were found between depth and dissolved oxygen (DO), water temperature, pH, nitrate (N03- ) and chlorophyll a (Chl.a) while positive correlations were found between electrical conductivity (EC), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), turbidity and N03- . The study revealed that the release of nutrients associated with increased concentration of BOD5 at the bottom depth caused low concentration of dissolved oxygen due to oxygen consumption. This was further aggravated through the decomposition of organic matter, indicating organic pollution resulting from runoff from the catchment. The presence of dense masses of blue-green algae in the pelagic zone of Gilgel Gibe I reservoir suggested the presence of ample nutrients for its blooming and significant reduction of water quality, indicating possible eutrophic conditions. Therefore, catchment management is required to protect aquatic life and the reservoir function as a whole from reservoir water quality degradation.

In this study, Jingpo Lake, which is the most typical lake in the northern cold region of China, was selected as the research object. A numerical simulation model for transporting and diffusing the chemical oxygen demand (CODMn) and ammonia nitrogen (NH3N) with ice-covered and open-water periods was constructed and calibrated using the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC). Parameters such as the bottom roughness, ice roughness, diffusion coefficient, horizontal momentum diffusivity, molecular eddy viscosity, molecular diffusivity, buoyancy influence coefficient, CODMn decay rate and NH3N decay rate were validated. The research findings show that there were differences in the hydrodynamic water-quality changing process during the ice-covered and open-water periods, as well as for the seasonal ice-covered waterbody. The key parameter decay rates of the CODMn and NH3N in the ice-covered periods were lower than those in the open-water periods due to the water-temperature decline. The R-2 of the CODMn and NH3N reached 90.71% and 79.79%, respectively. Thus, it may be concluded that the EFDC model could well reflect changes in the water level of Jingpo Lake, as well as the transport and diffusion of the CODMn and NH3N in Jingpo Lake.

This study addresses the characteristics of primary phytoplankton productivity and its relationship with environmental factors in a large, shallow, and eutrophic lake (Lake Taihu, China). Surface water samples were collected in wet and dry seasons from eight lake areas to investigate physicochemical factors and primary productivity. The results show obvious seasonal differences in phytoplankton primary productivity and physicochemical factors in Lake Taihu. The primary productivity in the wet season is about five times larger than that in the dry season, and the spatial distribution of primary productivity is obviously inhomogeneous in the wet season, while in the dry season, there are no significant differences in different lake areas. Most of the lake areas are in the middle eutrophic state regardless of the season; the northwest region has the heaviest degree of eutrophication, while the southeast region has the lightest degree of eutrophication. Pearson correlation indicated that nutrients are the main factors affecting primary productivity in the wet season, while temperature is the most important factor affecting primary productivity in the dry season. Multiple stepwise regression suggested that chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), temperature (T), and water transparency (SD) can be used to estimate the phytoplankton primary productivity in Lake Taihu in different seasons, and the main influencing factors for primary productivity are Chl-a, nutrients, and SD/total suspended solids (TSS) in the wet season and T, Chl-a, and SD/TSS in the dry season.					; Ji, Xiaonan/W-2693-2019	Hu, Wei/0009-0001-3331-8926; Wei, Jin/0000-0002-3459-9141; 														2071-1050				SEP	2022	14	18							11216	10.3390/su141811216	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su141811216													WOS:000856756900001

The years of research, and more advanced instrumentation, have yielded a lot of evidence which may be considered by the scientific community as proof of past or present habitability of Mars. Recent discoveries including seasonal methane releases and a subglacial lake are exciting, yet challenging findings. Concurrently, laboratory and environmental studies on the limits of microbial life in extreme environments on Earth broaden our knowledge of the possibility of Mars habitability. In this review, we aim to: (1) Discuss the characteristics of the Martian surface and subsurface that may be conducive to habitability either in the past or at present; (2) discuss laboratory-based studies on Earth that provide us with discoveries on the limits of life; and (3) summarize the current state of knowledge in terms of direction for future research.

The present study aimed at assessing the temporal and spatial dynamic of trophic relevant water quality parameters in the small, deep and freshwater Peri coastal lagoon, South Brazil. During the 19 sampled months (March/2008-September/2009) spatial homogeneity (horizontal and vertical) was registered in all seasons for all variables, a condition related to the strong wind influence and low human occupation in the lagoon watershed. Seasonal variations of the water quality could be observed and they can be explained mainly by variation on temperature, wind forces and direction and rainfall, characteristic from the subtropical weather. Comparing this study with two others conducted in Peri lagoon in 1996 and 1998, no critical differences that evidence alteration in the water quality were found, but climate differences may have influenced in some small variations observed. The use of four trophic state indices indicated that indices designed for temperate lakes are inappropriate for the subtropical Peri lagoon. The lagoon was classified as oligotrophic for nutrients concentrations and meso-eutrophic for transparency and chlorophyll-a, which can be explained by the high densities and monodominance of the cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and the high recycling rates observed in warmer water bodies, when compared to the temperate ones.

The surface water bodies like rivers, lakes, ponds, and reservoirs hold a huge proportion of the rainfall. However, due to spatio-temporal variability of rainfall and limited availability of meteorological stations, accurate estimation of the hydrological components such as surface runoff, evaporation, and baseflow is a challenging task. In this study, we have used hydrological information, Soil Conservation Service Curve Number method to develop an empirical relationship between rainfall and runoff in the Telibandha Lake Catchment (TLC), situated in Raipur district of Chhattisgarh, central India. Further, we have used Landsat derived remote sensing product, Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) to understand its temporal variation of water spread in the TLC over the fifteen years (2001-2015). The water spread areas are assessed by using the mean monthly NDWI data set and analyzing its seasonal and annual patterns. It is found that Telibandha Lake has a maximum depth of 2.9 m and its surface area is 0.12 km(2). Apart from that, the annual runoff is around 232.28 mm, which accounts for almost 22% of the estimated rainfall. The monthly runoff coefficient varies from 0 to 0.25 in TLC. Both the temporal and spatial NDWI plots show that July-September months have high NDWI values in the TLC. The seasonal NDWI showed a good relationship with mean monthly rainfall data and depicts r(2) = 0.78. The findings from this study helps in determining the temporal changes of water spread within the TLC and supports in understanding the lake characteristics.

Streamlined and Abundant Bacterioplankton Thrive in Functional Cohorts	MSYSTEMS												While fastidious microbes can be abundant and ubiquitous in their natural communities, many fail to grow axenically in laboratories due to auxotrophies or other dependencies. To overcome auxotrophies, these microbes rely on their surrounding cohort. A cohort may consist of kin (ecotypes) or more distantly related organisms (community) with the cooperation being reciprocal or nonreciprocal and expensive (Black Queen hypothesis) or costless (by-product). These metabolic partnerships (whether at single species population or community level) enable dominance by and coexistence of these lineages in nature. Here we examine the relevance of these cooperation models to explain the abundance and ubiquity of the dominant fastidious bacterioplankton of a dimictic mesotrophic freshwater lake. Using both culture-dependent (dilution mixed cultures) and culture-independent (small subunit [SSU] rRNA gene time series and environmental metagenomics) methods, we independently identified the primary cohorts of actinobacterial genera "Candidatus Planktophila" (acI-A) and "Candidatus Nanopelagicus" (acI-B) and the proteobacterial genus "Candidatus Fonsibacter" (LD12). While "Ca. Planktophila" and "Ca. Fonsibacter" had no correlation in their natural habitat, they have the potential to be complementary in laboratory settings. We also investigated the bifunctional catalase-peroxidase enzyme KatG (a common good which "Ca. Planktophila" is dependent upon) and its most likely providers in the lake. Further, we found that while ecotype and community cooperation combined may explain "Ca. Planktophila" population abundance, the success of "Ca. Nanopelagicus" and "Ca. Fonsibacter" is better explained as a community by-product. Ecotype differentiation of "Ca. Fonsibacter" as a means of escaping predation was supported but not for overcoming auxotrophies. IMPORTANCE This study examines evolutionary and ecological relationships of three of the most ubiquitous and abundant freshwater bacterial genera: "Ca. Planktophila" (acI-A), "Ca. Nanopelagicus" (acI-B), and "Ca. Fonsibacter" (LD12). Due to high abundance, these genera might have a significant influence on nutrient cycling in freshwaters worldwide, and this study adds a layer of understanding to how seemingly competing clades of bacteria can coexist by having different cooperation strategies.

Biphasic growth in fish I: Theoretical foundations	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY												We develop the theory of biphasic somatic growth in fish using models based on the distinction between pre- and post-maturation growth and an explicit description of energy allocation within a growing season. We define a 'generic biphasic' (GB) model that assumes post-maturation growth has a von Bertalanffy (vB) form. For this model we derive an explicit expression for the gonad weight/somatic weight ratio (g) which may either remain fixed or vary with size. Optimal biphasic models are then developed with reproductive strategies that maximise lifetime reproductive output. We consider two optimal growth models. In the first (fixed g optimal), gonad weight is constrained to be proportional to somatic weight. In the second (variable g optimal) model, allocation to reproduction is unconstrained and g increases with size. For the first of these two models, adult growth in a scaled measure of length has the exact vB form. When there are no constraints on allocation, growth is vB to a very good approximation. In both models, pre-maturation growth is linear. In a companion paper we use growth data from lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) to test the bioenergetics assumptions used to develop these models, and demonstrate that they have advantages over the vB model, both in quality of fit, and in the information contained in the fitted parameters.

LAKES, LOESS, AND PALEOSOLS IN THE PERMIAN WELLINGTON FORMATION OF OKLAHOMA, USA: IMPLICATIONS FOR PALEOCLIMATE AND PALEOGEOGRAPHY OF THE MIDCONTINENT	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												Lower to mid-Permian deposits of the Midcontinent (U.S.A.) record a significant and long recognized aridification because they archive the shift from more humid fades (e.g., coal, organic shale) of the Pennsylvanian to widespread redbeds, semiarid to seasonal paleosols (Calcisols, Vertisols), and evaporites by the mid-Permian. The provenance, transport and depositional processes of the voluminous Permian redbeds of the Midcontinent, however, remain largely undefined. The Artinskian Wellington Formation in Oklahoma exhibits high-frequency cycles comprising organic-rich laminated mudstone with thinly laminated (inferred primary) dolomite, variegated laminated mudstone with gypsum, massive, red to gray-green mudstone with pedogenic overprinting, and pale red siltstone. The gypsum exhibits a distinct Sr-87/86 isotopic ratio (0.709199) that is inconsistent with Permian seawater. We suggest that these facies record deposition in ephemeral to perennial lakes during a time of increasing aridity and seasonality, the latter indicated by abundant mudcracks, vertic-type paleosols, conchostracans, and lungfish burrows. The fine and uniform grain size and the geochemistry of the siliciclastic component suggest far-travelled and likely eolian transport that ultimately accumulated in both subaqueous and subaerial environments. Provenance analysis indicates the siliciclastic component was sourced chiefly from the southeastern Ouachita-Appalachian orogen and the Ancestral Rocky Mountains (ARM) or its derivative sediment.

We present a wet nitrogen deposition budget including inorganic and organic dissolved nitrogen in relation with atmospheric sources of gases and particles, precipitation rate and air mass transport. A unique 2 yr monitoring data set (2017-2019), providing 183 rain samples was collected and analyzed according to international standards (WMO/GAW). Considering that precipitation represents the largest contributor of water to the Lake Victoria (80%), this study gives new insights in the seasonality of nutrients wet deposition (WD) inputs in the unique natural resource represented by Lake Victoria and its catchment. Four main contributions to the chemical composition of precipitation, were identified: (a) a 28% terrigenous contribution related to crustal and biomass sources, (b) a 14% marine contribution related to Indian ocean air masses intrusion, (c) a 15% organic contribution due to volatile organic carbon emissions from biomass burning and vegetation and (d) a predominant nitrogenous contribution of 39% due to livestock and fertilizers, biomass burning and neighboring agricultural fires. Ammonium and nitrate volume weighed mean concentrations are 36.75 and 8.88 mu eq l(-1), respectively. Rain in Mbita is alkaline (pH = 5.8) highlighting neutralization by heterogeneous chemistry. Total nitrogen WD is 8.54 kgN ha(-1) yr(-1), 58 760 tN yr(-1) for the entire lake, with 26% attributed to dissolved organic nitrogen. A total atmospheric deposition of 15 kgN ha(-1) yr(-1) is estimated taking into account dry deposition estimate from literature, showing that the Lake Victoria ecosystem is exposed to eutrophication. An extensive and regular monitoring of wet and dry nitrogen deposition is highly recommended both in-shore and off-shore to help improving the efficiency of nitrogen use in agricultural areas and reduce nitrogen losses around Lake Victoria.					; Hickman, Jonathan/AAJ-1517-2021	Hickman, Jonathan/0000-0002-7246-642X; 													1748-9326					APR	2021	16	4							045013	10.1088/1748-9326/abe25c	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/abe25c													WOS:000637346000001

However, the importance of each biotic and abiotic factor on structuring communities might depend on the local environmental conditions and the identity of such communities. We investigated through Permutational analyses of variance and functional beta-diversity components, the effects of neutral and extreme events of precipitation on environmental heterogeneity and distribution of zooplankton functional traits in floodplain lakes. We also examined through distance-based redundancy analysis and fourth-corner analysis, how different variables (physical-chemical, food availability, predation, and temporal dynamics) structure the distribution of zooplankton functional traits and which traits were related to these variables. We used data from six lakes of the Upper Parana River floodplain over 19 years. Environmental heterogeneity and beta-diversity were higher during El Nino and lower during La Nina (extreme rainy and extremely dry season, respectively). Physical-chemical were the variables that most explained zooplankton beta-diversity during all seasons and predation during both extreme seasons (La Nina and El Nino). We observed a set of multiple biotic and abiotic factors causing complex effects on zooplankton functional diversity. The homogenization of traits-observed during extreme dry seasons-can lead to losses in ecosystem functions and services if these events continue to be more frequent and intense. We reaffirm the importance of natural flood caused by the rainy seasons to maintain high biotic and abiotic heterogeneity and ecosystem processes.

In this study, the variations of the water body were comprehensively analyzed based on remote sensing images and in situ measurements from 2000 to 2019. Four breakpoint detection approaches were integrated to analyze the change trends and explore the related driving forces behind the changes. The results showed that significant intra- and inter-annual fluctuations of the water body were found from 2000 to 2019. The water area and volume decreased at rates of 1.26 km(2)/a and 16.65 x 10(6) m(3)/a, respectively. During the entire study period, the outflow at Chenglingji station (CLJ), the inflow from three outlets of the Yangtze River (Inflow2), and the inundation conditions during the last period (Area(lag)) made the largest relative contributions to the water area variation (around 25%, 27% and 24%, respectively). A breakpoint was detected around 2004, corresponding to the operation period of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD). The regulation of TGD profoundly affected the hydrological characteristics at the three outlets and CLJ, and may have indirectly caused the water area to expand by 2.41 km(2)/a during the dry seasons between 2004 and 2019. These results provide valuable insight into how natural and anthropogenic factors affect water body variation and may offer a practical reference for the local government to adjust management strategies.					; Zhang, Xuemei/IWM-5031-2023	Yang, Liu/0009-0005-0001-3279; Yao, Rui/0000-0002-1578-8641													1753-8947	1753-8955				AUG 3	2021	14	8					959	984		10.1080/17538947.2021.1907464	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2021.1907464		APR 2021											WOS:000635824500001

The Laacher See Tephra (LST), at the base of the studied interval, forms the tephrochronological anchor point. The fine laminations were examined using a combination of micro-facies and mu XRF analyses and are typical of calcite varves, which in this case provide mainly a warm season signal. Two varve types with different sub-layer structures have been distinguished: (I) complex varves consisting of up to four seasonal sub-layers formed during the Allered and early Holocene periods, and, (II) simple two sub-layer type varves only occurring during the Younger Dryas. The precision of the chronology has been improved by varve-to-varve comparison of two independently analyzed sediment profiles based on well-defined micro-marker layers. This has enabled both (1) the precise location of single missing varies in one of the sediment profiles, and, (2) the verification of varve interpolation in disturbed varve intervals in the parallel core. Inter-annual and decadal-scale variability in sediment deposition processes were traced by multi-proxy data series including seasonal layer thickness, high-resolution element scans and total organic and inorganic carbon data at a five-varve resolution. These data support the idea of a two-phase Younger Dryas, with the first interval (12,675-12,275 varve years BP) characterised by a still significant but gradually decreasing warm-season calcite precipitation and a second phase (12,275-11,690 varve years BP) with only weak calcite precipitation. Detailed correlation of these two phases with the Meerfelder Maar record based on the LST isochrone and independent varve counts provides clues about regional differences and seasonal aspects of YD climate change along a transect from a location proximal to the North Atlantic in the west to a more continental site in the east (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, spatial and seasonal variability in concentration and composition of CDOM and the origin of its variation was studied in Lake Balaton (Hungary), a large temperate shallow lake in central Europe. In addition, we investigated the effect of photobleaching on the optical properties of CDOM through in-lake incubation experiments. There was marked variability throughout the year in CDOM absorption in Lake Balaton (a(CDOM)(440) = 0.06-9.01m(-1)). The highest values were consistently observed at the mouth of the main inflow (Zala River), which drains humic-rich material from the adjoining Kis-Balaton wetland, but CDOM absorption decreased rapidly towards the east where it was consistently lower and less variable than in the westernmost lake basins. The spectral slope parameter for the interval of 350-500 nm (S-CDOM(350-500)) was more variable with increasing distance from the inflow (observed range 0.0161-0.0181 nm(-1) for the mouth of the main inflow and 0.0158-0.0300 nm(-1) for waters closer to the outflow). However, spatial variation in S-CDOM was more constant exhibiting a negative correlation with a(CDOM)(440). Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was strongly positively corre-lated with a(CDOM)(440) and followed a similar seasonal trend but it demonstrated more variability than either a(CDOM) or S-CDOM with distance through the system. Photobleaching resulting from a 7-day exposure to natural solar UV radiation resulted in a marked decrease in allochthonous CDOM absorption (7.04 to 3.36m(-1), 42% decrease). Photodegradation also resulted in an increase in the spectral slope coefficient of dissolved material.					; Hunter, Peter/B-8010-2008; Palenzuela, Jesus/AAB-1994-2019; Tyler, Andrew/F-2034-2010	Tyler, Andrew/0000-0003-0604-5827; Preston, Tom/0000-0002-9900-5682; Torres Palenzuela, Jesus M./0000-0002-0629-0710; Spyrakos, Evangelos/0000-0001-7970-5211; 													1726-4170	1726-4189				MAR 14	2017	14	5					1215	1233		10.5194/bg-14-1215-2017	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-1215-2017													WOS:000396170400001

Diversity of volatile patterns in sixteen Fragaria vesca L. accessions in comparison to cultivars of Fragaria xananassa	JOURNAL OF APPLIED BOTANY AND FOOD QUALITY												Fragaria vesca is the most distributed wild species in the genus Fragaria. Due to this biogeography, a high diversity is to expect. During two harvest seasons, sixteen accessions from different locations from the most eastern habitat at Lake Baikal in Siberia, from Middle and Southern Europe and Northern Europe with Scandinavia and Iceland were investigated as well as two of the three described North American subspecies and three F. vesca cultivars. Five very distinct European F. xananassa cultivars were chosen to serve as a comparison. Beside brix value and acid contents, the aroma patterns including 67 volatile compounds were quantified by stir bar sorptive extraction followed by gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection. The diversity of important volatiles of Fragaria vesca and F. xananassa is discussed regarding biogeography, domestication, breeding and the so-called funnel effect.																			1439-040X						2013	86						37	46		10.5073/JABFQ.2013.086.006	http://dx.doi.org/10.5073/JABFQ.2013.086.006													WOS:000323832100006

A fades and architectural analysis of the Csehbanya Formation at this location identified four main lithofacies associations with eight subtypes consisting of (1) lenticular sandstones representing river channels, (2) conglomerates with sandstone (coarse grained likewise representing channel deposits), (3) heterolithic-channel fill (high density flash flow deposits) (4) splay sandstones produced by crevasse splays, (5) dark sandy siltstone (small-scale stagnant pool deposits with high organic content), (6) greenish-grey claystone (deposits of shallow lakes and ponds), (7) reddish (moderately drained) paleosols, and (8) yellowish, mottled (hydromorphic) paleosols. The sedimentological investigations revealed that the terrestrial deposits exposed by the Iharkut open-pit were formed in an anastomosing fluvial system because: (i) the alluvial architecture is characterized by large proportion of overbank deposits encasing the channel sandstone bodies, (ii) the ribbon shaped sandstone bodies are dominant, (iii) cross-bedding and lateral accretion are almost completely absent in the channel fill deposits and (iv) the sandstone bodies are clearly isolated from each other, embedded in floodplain sediments, suggesting multiple co-existing channels. The most important vertebrate fossil site (SZ-6) was examined in special detail because it shows peculiar lithological features. The layers richest in fossils (Unit 1) of SZ-6 site are interpreted as a lag deposit formed during an episodic high density flash flood event representing a relatively short time interval, i.e., probably within a single rainy season.

Here we analyze glacier and glacial lake changes in this region using multi-year inventories based on Landsat images from 1981-2013. Results show that the total area of 141 glaciers in the region decreased by 30.44 +/- 0.89 km(2) from 198.35 +/- 9.54km(2) (1980s) to 167.93 +/- 4.52 km(2) (2010s). The annual area shrinkage rate (-0.48% a(-1)) is lower than that reported for southeastern Tibet but higher than that of inner Tibet. Both the number and total area of glacial lakes increased between 1981 and 2013. Among all lakes, proglacial lakes contribute most (similar to 81%) to the expansion. The total area of ten proglacial lakes increased by 150.3 +/- 13.17% and of these ten lakes the four that expanded most sharply showed increased calving at their upper margins, resulting in more rapid retreat of lake-terminating glaciers than land-terminating glaciers. Owing to rapid calving, several lakes may undergo further growth in the near future, increasing the potential risk of glacial lake outburst floods.

Here, the term "purification" is defined, in a wide sense, as the potential role of a water body to contribute to the reduction of pollutants and thus controlling eutrophication. Also regarded as a kind of ecological regulating services, biological purification involves various processes concerning seasonal nutrient fixation, such as uptake by aquatic macrophyte, biofouling onto foliage substrates, feeding by organisms in higher trophic level, and eternal loss or removal of substance from the water. In order to evaluate the water purification ability, a numerical lake ecosystem model (EcoTaihu) was developed and applied to Lakes Taihu. The model includes the biological interactions between pelagic compartments (phytoplankton and zooplankton, detritus, dissolved organic matter, fish, and nutrients). Under dynamic forcing of meteorological and hydrological parameters, the model was run over years to evaluate the annual nutrient cycles and purification functions. The reproducibility of the model was validated for water body by comparison with the field data from the water quality monitoring campaign. Numerical results revealed that self-purification capacity of nitrogen of Lake Taihu in years 2006, 2008, and 2010 is 4.00 x 10(4), 4.27 x 10(4), and 4.11 x 10(4) ton, respectively, whereas self-purification capacity of phosphorus of Lake Taihu in years 2006, 2008, and 2010 is 1.56 x 10(3), 1.80 x 10(3), and 1.71 x 10(3) ton, respectively.					hu, weiping/LIH-2020-2024														0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2015	22	11					8201	8215		10.1007/s11356-014-3920-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-3920-6								25516245					WOS:000354960300017
J	Zhou, YT; Scavia, D; Michalak, AM				Zhou, Yuntao; Scavia, Donald; Michalak, Anna M.			Nutrient loading and meteorological conditions explain interannual variability of hypoxia in Chesapeake Bay	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We use geostatistical universal kriging and conditional realizations to provide the first quantitative estimates, with robust estimates of uncertainties, of the seasonal and interannual variability in hypoxic volume in Chesapeake Bay, covering early April to late October for 1985 to 2010, and explore factors controlling that variability. Results show that the time when the hypoxic volume reaches its maximum has moved from late to early July over the examined period, but that there is no trend in the seasonal-maximum hypoxic volume itself. No significant trend was found in the timing of onset of hypoxia, but the end of the hypoxic period has moved from October to September. Including nutrient loading from the Rappahannock River in addition to the Susquehanna and Potomac Rivers is found to be beneficial for explaining the interannual variability of hypoxia. Overall, January to May total nitrogen loads from these three rivers, April to August southwesterly and northeasterly winds, and April and May precipitation explain >85% of the seasonally averaged interannual variability in hypoxic volumes. Southwesterly winds affect hypoxia by increasing vertical stratification, while precipitation likely acts as a surrogate for nonpoint sources of nitrogen downstream from monitoring stations. The relative contribution of nutrient loading to the overall interannual variability suggests that 28-35% reductions in monitored nutrient loads may not be sufficient to achieve a corresponding reduction in hypoxic conditions as had been suggested in previous studies, at least in the short term.

Methane-oxidizing bacteria effectively convert this potent greenhouse gas into biomass and carbon dioxide. These bacteria are present throughout the water column, where methane concentrations can range from nanomolar to millimolar. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that methanotroph assemblages in a seasonally stratified freshwater lake are adapted to the contrasting methane concentrations in the epi- and hypolimnion We further hypothesized that lake overturn would change the apparent methane oxidation kinetics as more methane becomes available in the epilimnion In addition to the change in the methane oxidation kinetics, we investigated changes in the transcription of genes encoding methane monooxygenase, the enzyme responsible for the first step of methane oxidation, with metatranscriptomics. Using laboratory incubations of the natural microbial communities, we show that the half-saturation constant (K-m) for methane - the methane concentration at which half the maximum methane oxidation rate is reached - was 20 times higher in the hypolimnion than in the epilimnion during stable stratification. During lake overturn, however, the kinetic constants in the epi- and hypolimnion converged along with a change in the transcriptionally active methanotroph assemblage. Conventional particulate methane monooxygenase appeared to be responsible for methane oxidation under different methane concentrations. Our results suggest that methane availability is one important factor for creating niches for methanotroph assemblages with well-adapted methane oxidation kinetics. This rapid selection and succession of adapted lacustrine methanotroph assemblages allowed the previously reported high removal efficiency of methane transported to the epilimnion to be maintained - even under rapidly changing conditions during lake overturn. Consequently, only a small fraction of methane stored in the anoxic hypolimnion is emitted to the atmosphere.

J	Leng, PF; Koschorreck, M				Leng, Peifang; Koschorreck, Matthias			Metabolism and carbonate buffering drive seasonal dynamics of CO2 emissions from two German reservoirs	WATER RESEARCH												Biological metabolism drives much of the variation in CO2 in terrestrial ecosystems but does not explain CO2 oversaturation and emission in net autotrophic lakes and reservoirs. The unexplained CO2 could be attributed to the equilibria between CO2 and the carbonate buffering system, which is seldom integrated into CO2 budgets, let alone its interplay with metabolism on CO2 emissions. Here, we perform a process-based mass balance modeling analysis based on an 8-year dataset from two adjacent reservoirs with similar catchment sizes but contrasting trophic states and alkalinity. We find that in addition to the well-acknowledged driver of net metabolic CO2 production, carbonate buffering also determines the total amount and seasonal dynamics of CO2 emissions from the reservoirs. Carbonate buffering can contribute up to nearly 50% of whole-reservoir CO2 emissions, by converting the ionic forms of carbonate to CO2. This results in similar seasonal CO2 emissions from reservoirs with differing trophic state, even in low alkalinity system. We therefore suggest that catchment alkalinity, instead of trophic state, may be more relevant in predicting CO2 emissions from reservoirs. Our model approach highlights the important role of carbonate buffering and metabolism that generate and remove CO2 throughout the reservoirs on a seasonal scale. The inclusion of carbonate buffering could diminish a major uncertainty in the estimation of reservoir CO2 emissions and increase the robustness of aquatic CO2 emission estimates.

This shallow lake is situated in the marshy Polesie region in eastern Poland. Sediments began to accumulate in the lake in the Older Dryas. On the basis of macrofossils, pollen, and Oribatida remains, and with the use of Kohonen's artificial neural network (self-organising map, SOM), six stages (corresponding to sub clusters X-1, X-2, X-3 in cluster X, and Y-1, Y-2, Y-3 in cluster Y) of the lake history were distinguished, and indicator taxa of each stage were identified from the indicator value (IndVal) index. During the transition period corresponding to the border between X and Y, the ecosystem transformed in the broad sense from the protocratic to mesocratic phase in a 5-point scale transformation of the landscape in the glacial interglacial cycle. All the steps involved in post-glacial history succession during interglacial cycles include changes in climate, soil, and biotic interactions. Indicator taxa for the subsequent SOM subclusters X-1, X-2, and X-3 are associated with the first phase of the protocratic glacial interglacial cycle. The transformation that occurs on the level of cluster Y (subcluster Y-1) is the mesocratic phase (ca. 9000-5000 C-14 age BP), which is characterised by high temperatures and development of closed forest (climax forest). Subcluster Y-2 corresponds to the transformation of forest cover during the oligocratic phase (ca. 5000-3000 C-14 age BP), which is associated with decreasing forest share and deteriorating soils. Finally, subcluster Y-3 can be associated with the telocratic phase, characterised by the influence of a more oceanic climate (from ca. 2500 C-14 age BP) with declining temperatures, higher humidity, and milder seasonal contrasts, which contributed to the development of more open vegetation and infertile soils. This stage also corresponds to an increased human activity and landscape transformation, such as from forests to cornfields and from wetlands to meadows. Interestingly, the currently strictly protected brittle naiad (Najas minor) was present in the lake during the Atlantic, Subboreal, and Subatlantic periods; however, this species is not listed as being part of the present vegetation and may have become extinct relatively recently.

In this study, the assessment of groundwater quality was performed in the municipality of Bumbu (Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo) according to the seasonal variation. Water physicochemical parameters [pH, electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen and soluble ions (Na+, K+, PO4 (3-), SO4 (2-), NO3 (-), NO2 (-))] and faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) including Escherichia coli (E. coli), Enterococcus (ENT) and Total coliforms (TC) were analysed. Except for EC and NO3 (-), the results revealed low concentration of other water physicochemical parameters, which are below the recommended limits, according to World Health Organization guideline for drinking water. Additionally, the result showed high concentration of FIB reaching the values of 1.6 x 10(4), 1.5 x 10(4) and 9.0 x 10(5) CFU 100 mL(-1) for E. coli, ENT and TC, respectively. The pollution was substantial in wet season compared to dry season. PCR amplification for human-Bacteroides indicated that more than 90 % of bacteria were from human origin. Our results highlight the potential human risk associated with the exposure to water contamination from wells due to the high level of NO3 (-), EC, E. coli and ENT in both dry and wet seasons. The approach developed in this study helps provide a better understanding of the physicochemical and microbiological pollution of wells in large cities characterized with lack of wastewater and sanitation facilities.

In this study, monthly sampling campaigns were conducted from a reservoir (Daecheong Reservoir, South Korea) and its forested tributaries for five consecutive months (June to October) to examine the variations of DOM composition. Excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) was applied to track the variations of different fluorescent components within bulk DOM. Selected samples were further separated into hydrophobic (Ho) and hydrophilic (Hi) fractions. Water quality and DOM composition varied greatly with the sampling locations including the upstream and the downstream tributary sites, and the reservoir. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) provided the information on the DOM sources and the potential processes leading to the observed DOM changes. Four of the five fluorescent components, identified by EEM-PARAFAC, were well correlated with the flow rates of the tributaries, suggesting hydrological control on DOM composition. The greatest effects were found on two terrestrial humic-like components (C1 and C2). The Ho fraction of DOM was more abundant for the post-storm samples versus the non-storm samples, supporting the important roles of hydrology on the changes in chemical composition of DOM. The amounts of the DOM resin fractions, either Ho or Hi, showed strong relationships with C1 and C2, suggesting that DOM fluorescence could be successfully applied to estimate different DOM chemical constituents in forested watersheds.					; Li, Penghui/C-5716-2008	Lee, Yun Kyung/0000-0002-1876-4987; Li, Penghui/0000-0001-7960-1025													0944-1344	1614-7499				DEC	2016	23	24					24834	24845		10.1007/s11356-016-7720-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-7720-z								27658410					WOS:000389301700031
J	Hoyer, AB; Schladow, SG; Rueda, FJ				Hoyer, Andrea B.; Schladow, S. Geoffrey; Rueda, Francisco J.			A hydrodynamics-based approach to evaluating the risk of waterborne pathogens entering drinking water intakes in a large, stratified lake	WATER RESEARCH												Pathogen contamination of drinking water lakes and reservoirs is a severe threat to human health worldwide. A major source of pathogens in surface sources of drinking waters is from body-contact recreation in the water body. However, dispersion pathways of human waterborne pathogens from recreational beaches, where body-contact recreation is known to occur to drinking water intakes, and the associated risk of pathogens entering the drinking water supply remain largely undocumented. A high spatial resolution, three-dimensional hydrodynamic and particle tracking modeling approach has been developed to analyze the risk and mechanisms presented by pathogen dispersion. The pathogen model represents the processes of particle release, transport and survival. Here survival is a function of both water temperature and cumulative exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Pathogen transport is simulated using a novel and computationally efficient technique of tracking particle trajectories backwards, from a drinking water intake toward their source areas. The model has been applied to a large, alpine lake - Lake Tahoe, CA-NV (USA), The dispersion model results reveal that for this particular lake (1) the risk of human waterborne pathogens to enter drinking water intakes is low, but significant; (2) this risk is strongly related to the depth of the thermocline in relation to the depth of the intake; (3) the risk increases with the seasonal deepening of the surface mixed layer; and (4) the risk increases at night when the surface mixed layer deepens through convective mixing and inactivation by UV radiation is eliminated. While these risk factors will quantitatively vary in different lakes, these same mechanisms will govern the process of transport of pathogens. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Forty-five taxa from 31 estuaries were identified from 2005 to 2009. Harmful species richness was latitudinally graded for rivers, with increasing number of taxa southward. There were significant differences (within an estuary) in harmful species abundance and richness for 11 of 21 estuaries tested. Where differences were observed, these were predominately due to species belonging to the Pseudo-nitzschia delicatissima group, Dinophysis acuminata, Dictyocha octonaria and Prorocentrum cordatum with a consistent upstream versus downstream pattern emerging. Temporal (seasonal or interannual) patterns in harmful phytoplankton within and among estuaries were highly variable. Examination of harmful phytoplankton in relation to recognised estuary disturbance measures revealed species abundance correlated to estuary modification levels and flushing time, with modified, slow flushing estuaries having higher abundance. Harmful species richness correlated with bioregion, estuary modification levels and estuary class, with southern, unmodified lakes demonstrating greater species density. Predicting how these risk taxa and risk zones may change with further estuary disturbance and projected climate warming will require more focused, smaller scale studies aimed at a deeper understanding of species-specific ecology and bloom mechanisms. Coupled with this consideration, there is an imperative for further taxonomic, ecological and toxicological investigations into poorly understood taxa (e.g. Pseudo-nitzschia).					; Armand, Leanne/C-9004-2009; Ajani, Penelope/K-9987-2019; Webster, Grant/IRZ-9604-2023	Scanes, Peter/0000-0002-6722-168X; Ajani, Penelope/0000-0001-5364-9936; Armand, Leanne/0000-0003-3995-308X													0167-6369	1573-2959				JUN	2013	185	6					5295	5316		10.1007/s10661-012-2946-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-012-2946-9								23111868					WOS:000318503100063

This study used different field measurements and laboratory tests of lake water to determine the impact of water hyacinth phytoremediation capacity. A total of eight sampling stations were used for the two lakes: Lake Koka and Lake Ziway, Ethiopia. Sampling stations were selected from sites infested with water hyacinth (low, medium, and high) and non-water hyacinth aquatic plants during wet or rainy and dry or non-rainy seasons to compare the effects of plants on water quality in the two lakes. All the sampled stations had various human interventions. The water samples were tested for the selected physico-chemical properties, namely, phosphate, nitrate, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), the five-day biological oxygen demand (BOD5), water temperature, and heavy metals (Chromium (Cr), Lead (Pb), Cadmium (Cd), Zinc (Zn), and Copper (Cu)). These water quality variables were compared by means of ANOVA. Despite the chemical oxygen demand (COD) of Lake Ziway, this study found no significant (p > 0.05) variation in the concentrations of Cu, EC, pH and water temperature between wet and dry seasons in either lake. Variations in Zn concentration and other physico-chemical parameters (EC, BOD5, COD, nitrate, phosphate) between low, medium, and high levels of water hyacinth were significant in both lakes (p < 0.05). Water hyacinth has shown significant phytoremediation nature during wet and dry seasons. The lowest average heavy metal, phosphate, and nitrate concentrations; and significant pH and temperature variations were observed in Lakes Koka and Lake Ziway, among water hyacinth and other grass-infested sites. These findings suggest water hyacinth plant as a promising nature-based solution for removing undesirable chemicals from contaminated water bodies.					; Chitakira, Munyaradzi/P-1708-2017; Nhamo, Luxon/H-4000-2019	Nhamo, Luxon/0000-0003-2944-1769; 														2073-4441				JUL	2023	15	14							2540	10.3390/w15142540	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15142540													WOS:001036560700001

Abundance and distribution of plant derived leaf waxes (long chain n-alkanes & fatty acids) from lake surface sediments along the west coast of southern South America: Implications for environmental and climate reconstructions	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Southern South America is the only large landmass that extends through the core of the Southern Westerly Winds (SWW), controlling hydrological and ecosystem variability in the region. In fact, the vegetation along the west coast changes from Temperate and Valdivian Rain Forest to the North Patagonian Evergreen Forest (ca. 42 & DEG;S) due to the latitudinal influence of the SWW. Climate is an important driver of organic matter accumulation in lakes, hence changes in vegetation would be recorded in lacustrine sedimentary archives. This study evaluated leaf waxes contained in lake surface sediments as indicators of climate change along the west coast of southern South America, providing a biogeochemical dataset for ongoing and future (paleo)climate and environmental research. The fatty acid and n-alkane sediment leaf wax datasets are compared with latitudinal, orographic, and climatic (Mean Annual air Temperature [MAT] & Precipitation [MAP]) trends extracted from a monthly gridded reanalysis product of the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis. Fatty acids are more abundant than n-alkanes, with high abundances characterizing the transition between seasonal and year-round precipitation along the coast (ca. 42 & DEG;S). The abundance of both leaf wax groups increases with MAP, suggesting precipitation as the main control on sedimentary leaf wax delivery to the lake sediments in the study area. The Carbon Preference Index (CPI) of the two groups show opposite trends, but both highlight the climate transition at ca. 42 & DEG;S, and have a linear relationship with MAP. The opposite significant trends between n-alkane CPI and fatty acid CPI with MAP are interpreted as higher n-alkane production at much higher precipitation because leaf wax fatty acids are the precursors of n-alkanes. Hence, past periods during which these leaf waxes show opposite trends in CPI might be interpreted as a precipitation change, especially if additional information such as pollen, dia-toms, chironomids and stable isotopes is available.

We investigate an innovative, cost-effective approach to groundwater monitoring in an island environment by computing auto- and cross-correlations of ambient seismic noise recorded on short-period and broadband seismic stations. While borehole readings give accurate site-specific water level data of the groundwater across the islands, this technique provides a more regional approach to quantitative groundwater monitoring. We perform the moving window cross-spectral method to determine temporal changes in seismic velocity (& delta;v/v). Comparison of the & delta;v/v with groundwater levels from boreholes and precipitation shows comparable patterns. We find that the variations of the & delta;v/v from auto-correlations are more pronounced than the cross-correlation, and that short-period seismic stations are also sensitive. The & delta;v/v signal deteriorates at longer interstation distances, presumably because paths traverse complex geology. We conclude that changes in the groundwater level found beneath very small islands, even as small as 3 km(2), can be detected seismically. Low-cost, easy-to-deploy seismic stations can thus act as an additional tool for groundwater monitoring, especially in places with limited natural water reservoirs, like rivers and lakes, and infrastructure.					; Schimmel, Martin/C-2261-2008	D'Amico, Sebastiano/0000-0001-7429-4767; Agius, Matthew/0000-0002-2620-295X; Schimmel, Martin/0000-0003-2601-4462														2073-4441				JUL	2023	15	14							2523	10.3390/w15142523	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15142523													WOS:001039884600001

Coupling these data with previous work, we demonstrate how the region's environment and climate developed during a time when agriculture became not only established but settlements started to transform into larger urban areas. Results demonstrate a wetter phase during the middle Holocene relative to the present period; a highly seasonal climate with one rainy season is also suggested between 8025 +/- 38 and 6977 +/- 219 BP. Phytoliths not only suggest a relatively wet environment but they also indicate a diversity of plants used for settlement activity. Sedimentary results complement the indication of a relatively wetter middle Holocene. Archaeologically, terraced construction found in Gurga Chiya and the presence of drought tolerant crops suggest adaptation to stronger, seasonal rains and seasonal droughts in the middle Holocene. Sedimentary, phytolith, and speleothem results suggest relatively drier late-Holocene conditions, although the region continued to be conducive for rainfed agriculture.					; Ali, Diary/AEF-7070-2022; Fleitmann, Domnik/HSF-0516-2023	Fleitmann, Dominik/0000-0001-5977-8835; Carter, Robert/0000-0001-9764-5814; Ali, Diary/0000-0001-6630-1226													0959-6836	1477-0911				JUN	2018	28	6					955	967		10.1177/0959683617752843	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683617752843													WOS:000436072100009

However, previous methods for the detection of SIEs are often flawed in one way or another, including not accounting for model complexity, not comparing all relevant models, and not including islands with no species. Therefore, the existence and the prevalence of the SIE may be dubious. In this study, after controlling for all these methodological shortcomings, we tested for the existence of the SIE in amphibian assemblages on subtropical landbridge islands created by the inundation of the Thousand Island Lake, China. We used the line transect method to determine the distribution of amphibian assemblages on 23 study islands during 3 breeding seasons from 2009 to 2011. To evaluate whether an SIE exists in amphibian assemblages, we compared the fit of a simple linearized power model with two most widely used breakpoint regression models. The information-theoretic multimodel inference approach based on Akaike's information criterion identified the left-horizontal SIE model as the best single model. Thus, we found strong evidence for the existence of an SIE in our system. The upper limit of the SIE for amphibian assemblages was 39.95ha. Below this threshold area, amphibian richness varied independently of island size. The SIE in amphibian assemblages may be due to episodic disturbances, stochastic events, and nutrient subsidies from the lake. Our results indicate that all the islands >39.95 ha should be protected for the effective conservation of amphibian assemblages in our system.					; Ding, Ping/H-1817-2015; Wang, Yanping/AAN-4402-2021; Wu, Qiang/IAP-9071-2023	WU, Qiang/0000-0002-3005-4072; 													1674-5507	2396-9814				JUN	2018	64	3					303	309		10.1093/cz/zox038	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cz/zox038								30402071					WOS:000436421000005

Yet, banana yields in this region are among the lowest in the world due to a wide range of abiotic, biotic and socioeconomic causes. Cropping systems which could contribute to soil fertility replenishment, pest and disease suppression and climate change mitigation might improve banana yields and contribute to uplifting the livelihoods of millions of people in the region. In this context, a survey was conducted over two seasons in banana-based subsistence farming systems in Rwanda, Burundi, north-western Tanzania (Kagera and Kigoma regions) and eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (South Kivu province), to investigate the distribution and incidence of banana Fusarium wilt as related to cropping systems, edapho-climatic and socio-economic factors. Banana Fusarium wilt incidence was found generally high in the region, 54.1% of all farms had disease incidence higher than 40%, with Tanzania having the highest number of farms with high disease incidence (63.6%). Statistical analysis (chi-squared test of association) and GIS mapping, by layering Fusarium wilt incidence over selected predictor maps, showed that disease incidence was lower in farms growing cultivar mixtures (p < 0.01) and at higher altitudes (>1600masl) (p < 0.05), and a significant association of Fusarium wilt and farm age was observed whereby disease incidence was highest in farms aged between 10 and 30 years (p < 0.05). Additionally, this study reports for the first time the occurrence of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense race 2 in Rwanda and Burundi, and suggests that strategies for banana Fusarium wilt management in east and central Africa should include raising farmers' awareness on pathogen spread mechanisms and enhancing their access to disease-free planting materials.

Phytoplankton dynamics in a subtropical lake dominated by cyanobacteria: cyanobacteria 'Like it Hot' and sometimes dry	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												An 18-year data set (1993-2010) of water column variables from Lake George, Florida (USA), was used to examine relationships between the phytoplankton community (composition and biomass) and physical variables (temperature and hydrologic discharge rates). Lake George is a large shallow eutrophic lake located in the subtropical environment of north Florida and is subject to frequent and intense blooms of cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria dominated the phytoplankton community during warmer months of the year (May-September). Other phytoplankton taxa increased their relative contributions to phytoplankton biomass during the colder months (November-March), when cyanobacterial biomass was low. Increased discharge rates during the peak flushing season (September-December) were correlated to diminished cyanobacterial biomass despite elevated nutrient levels. Analysis of time series data revealed higher warm season peaks in cyanobacteria biomass during years of relatively low discharge, whereas other phytoplankton groups showed the opposite trend with peaks during the colder months. These observations indicate a need for lake management strategies that consider both hydrologic and nutrient loadings within the context of possible future changes in temperature and rainfall regimes.																			1386-2588	1573-5125				JUN	2016	50	2					163	174		10.1007/s10452-016-9565-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-016-9565-4													WOS:000376610200002

This dMn(react) fraction is rapidly oxidised under oxygen atmosphere and is assumed to consist predominantly of Mn(III). There is a distinct increase of dMn(react) from the outer regions towards the central part of the Landsort Deep. Although the presence of MnO(x) particles in the Gotland Basin is evidence of ongoing oxidation of reduced Mn species, almost no dMn(react) was detected. Since completely different processes of Mn oxidation appear rather unlikely, we suggest oceanographic properties are responsible. Lateral currents and intrusions in the Gotland Basin seem to prevent the formation of a stable suboxic zone, a prerequisite necessary for accumulation of dMn(react). Such perturbations supply trace amounts of O(2) and H(2)S, causing either immediate oxidation/reduction of dMn(react) or deterioration of its stabilising ligands. dMn(react) has also been determined in Lake Dagow with values significantly exceeding the level of the Landsort Deep due to stable stratification of this lake. In contrast, H(2)S appearance throughout the entire water column and a pH <5 prevent accumulation of dMn(react) in Lake Fuchskuhle. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The reaction of the Arctic cryosphere to past periods of climate variation can afford insight into its present and future behavior. Here, we examine a-12,000 year record of glacier fluctuations and meltwater variation associated with the Renland Ice Cap, East Greenland, that extends from the early Holocene thermal optimum through the cooling of the Little Ice Age to present. Sediment records from glacially fed lakes indicate rapid early Holocene deglaciation, with ice extent likely slightly smaller than at present by-9500 yr BP. Glacial activity resulted in occasional deposition of rock flour in the studied lakes in the early Holocene until at least-7500 yr BP. Rock flour is absent for much of the period -7000-4000 yr BP, suggesting ice extent generally was smaller than at present. However, thin layers of blue-gray clay throughout this period may indicate millennial-scale ice expansions, with Renland Ice Cap briefly reaching extents during cold phases that may have been similar to today. Glacial sediment deposition occurred again in the late Holocene at-3200e340 0 yr BP and was followed by a brief glacial episode at-1340 yr BP and then a major event beginning shortly after-1050 yr BP. We infer that rock flour deposition in the lakes in the last millennium corresponds with advance of Renland glaciers to their Little Ice Age positions, marked by a fresh, gray drift limit. Radiocarbon dates of in situ plant remains adjacent to the present ice cap indicate a short relatively warm period-500 yr ago, when ice was within its AD 2011 limit, followed by glacier readvance. The general pattern of ice fluctuations in Renland is similar to that at other ice caps in the region, but also has important differences, including the preservation of a possible mid-Holocene record at times when lower-elevation ice caps in the Scoresby Sund region may have been absent. This finding reinforces the concept that examination of multiple geographic and geomorphologic settings is necessary for a full understanding of ice variations in a region. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Macrozoobenthos in saline rivers in the Lake Elton basin: Spatial and temporal dynamics	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												The data on seasonal and interannual changes in the taxonomic, structural, and quantitative characteristics of macrozoobenthos communities in rivers with a high salinity gradient are given. A total of 91 benthic invertebrate taxa have been revealed, which were dominated by Cricotopus salinophilus, Chironomus salinarius, C. aprilinus, Tanytarsus kharaensis, Microchironomus deribae, Glyptotendipes salinus (Diptera: Chironomidae), Culicoides (M.) riethi, Palpomyia schmidti (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae), Paranais simplex (Oligochaeta), and Ephydra sp. (Ephydridae) in different years. The fauna of benthic communities is mainly represented by eurybiontic halotolerant species with different ranges of resistance to salinity. The taxonomic composition and diversity of macrozoobenthos communities are closely correlated with water salinity in the range from 4 to 41 g/L; the complex of hydrological and hydrophysical factors (depth, overgrowing, water temperature, pH, etc.) control the distribution and abundance of species.																			1995-0829	1995-0837				OCT	2017	10	4					384	398		10.1134/S1995082917040125	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1995082917040125													WOS:000418100400007

They have been reported from various marine and limnic environments; however, their ecology remains largely unknown. Here infrared epifluorescence microscopy was used to monitor temporal changes in AAPs in the alpine lake Gossenkllesee, located in the Tyrolean Alps, Austria. AAP abundance was low (10(3) cells ml(-1)) until mid-July and reached a maximum of similar to 1.3 x 10(5) cells ml(-1) (29% of all prokaryotes) in mid-September. We compared the studied lake with other mountain lakes located across an altitudinal gradient (913 to 2,799mabove sea level). The concentration of dissolved organic carbon and water transparency seem to be the main factors influencing AAP abundance during the seasonal cycle as well as across the altitudinal gradient. While the AAP populations inhabiting the alpine lakes were composed of intensely pigmented large rods (5 to 12 mu m), the lakes below the tree line were inhabited by a variety of smaller morphotypes. Analysis of pufM diversity revealed that AAPs in Gossenkllesee were almost exclusively Sphingomonadales species, which indicates that AAP communities inhabiting alpine lakes are relatively homogeneous compared to those in low-altitude lakes.

J	Mayora, G; Devercelli, M; Giri, F				Mayora, Gisela; Devercelli, Melina; Giri, Federico			Spatial variability of chlorophyll-a and abiotic variables in a river-floodplain system during different hydrological phases	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and abiotic variables were measured in the main channel and floodplain waterbodies of the Middle Parana River to analyse the system dynamics and to assess their spatial variability during different hydrological phases, including an extreme flood. We wanted to test that the flood does not always have a homogenising effect in a river-floodplain system. An explanatory model for Chl-a was performed according to Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), and the relation of water level with the coefficient of variation (CV) among sites for each variable was explored. The model explained 64% of Chl-a variability. Water level, depth:euphotic zone ratio (Z (d):Z (eu)) (inverse correlation) and conductivity (direct correlation) were the significant explicative variables. The CV of Chl-a decreased with flood from the main channel to the floodplain, but for turbidity, Z (d):Z (eu), pH, dissolved oxygen, soluble reactive phosphorus and Chl-a:pheophytin-a ratio, it increased. However, within the floodplain, CV of turbidity, Z (d):Z (eu) and pH decreased during flood. These suggest that the homogenising effect frequently observed during inundation cannot be generalised and that the floodplain may maintain its identity even during flood. The extreme flood and its overlap with the warm season and sedimentological pulse probably contributed to the heterogeneity in the spatial gradient.

Here, we compiled biological data for 83 Yangtze River fish species, constructed their life tables and conducted elasticity analyses, which calculates the proportional contribution of each vital rate (age-specific survival and fecundity) to the annual population multiplication rate. Life tables showed that, for our analyzed species, the survival rate of age 0 fish was extremely low, ranging from 1.25 x 10(-6) to 1.74 x 10(-2) year(-1). All species showed a type III survivorship curve. Elasticity analysis revealed slow-fast continuum life histories ranging from species with a high contribution of fertility elasticity to the population growth rate, but lower juvenile and adult survival elasticity, as well as early maturation and short generation time to species that mature late, possess a long generation time, exhibit low fertility elasticity, and a high adult or juvenile survival elasticity. In addition, the analysis of all the species showed that fertility elasticity was significantly smaller than the sum of juvenile and adult survival elasticity, indicating the need to increase the juvenile and adult survival rates of Yangtze fish rather than focusing only on protecting reproduction and age 0 survival via a breeding season fishing ban which is the current conservation practice. Since overfishing has been proposed as the major factor responsible for the decline of Yangtze fish populations, we further suggest that controlling fishing pressure on juvenile and adult fish is another key conservation requirement.					; Wang, Teng/J-3882-2018; Jakovlić, Ivan/ADE-0623-2022	Liu, Huanzhang/0000-0002-4604-7686; Wang, Teng/0000-0002-6713-5589; Jakovlic, Ivan/0000-0002-2461-3712; 													0960-3166	1573-5184				MAR	2017	27	1					255	266		10.1007/s11160-016-9464-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11160-016-9464-8													WOS:000394375300013

Field supervision is difficult due to the size of the lake (>3000 km(2), wet season) and limited human resources. In this study, an approach is proposed to monitor sand-dredging activities using medium-resolution optical remote-sensing imagery, including 45 Landsat TM/ETM+ images from 2002 to 2012 and 140 HJ1A/B CCD images from 2009 to 2012. The procedure for detecting dredging vessels involves three steps. (1) The entire image is segmented into different homogeneous partitions to overcome water body heterogeneity, and ships in each partition with different levels of water clarity are detected using three types of contrast box architecture. (2) Dredging vessels are then identified based on a spatial overlay analysis of ships and dredging plumes, which are extracted from remotesensing imagery. (3) False alarms (FAs) of dredging vessels are screened according to the distribution of the sandy lake bed. The results showed significant spatiotemporal variation in dredging activities; sand-dredging activities were concentrated at the northern part of Poyang Lake prior to 2008 and have expanded southwards since 2009. The northern part of the lake experienced persistent dredging operations throughout the year, whereas dredging was observed only during the wet seasons in the southern portion of the lake. A high intensity of illegal dredging was discovered based on two lines of evidence: dredging vessels were detected during the sand-dredging ban, and the estimated quantities of sand dredging were much higher than those planned by the authority. The sediment balance in Poyang Lake has continued to be disrupted, and the lake has become a sediment-exporting system. This study provides an effective solution for monitoring sand-dredging dynamics as well as useful information for managing sand dredging in fresh water environments and assessing its potential impacts on aquatic ecosystems.

Here, we apply a novel inversion strategy to global positioning system (GPS) vertical movements to achieve high spatial resolution total water storage (TWS) variations in GLW through improved processing. The steps are composed of removing load changes driven by the lake water fluctuation by forward modeling, isolating the Great Lakes grids to solve the ill-conditioned problem in inversion, and inverting the GPS residual series to estimate TWS variations on land (TWSGPS). The results show that the regional dense continuous GPS observation network can successfully resolve TWS on land at monthly timescales with 30-45 km spatial resolution. We also could effectively capture fine-scale TWS features than GRACE/GFO mascon products. GRACE/GFO satellites largely underestimate seasonal and long-term TWS spatial fluctuations, but their temporal patterns coincide with those from GPS. The average annual amplitude of TWSGPS on land reaches 82.0 mm, greatly exceeding estimates from GRACE/GFO (similar to 48.0 mm) and composite hydrological model outputs (similar to 62.0 mm). The seasonal groundwater fluctuations inferred from GPS have peak-to-peak amplitudes of similar to 40 km3 with the maximum around September. This coincides with that from GRACE/GFO. However, the magnitudes and phases of groundwater storage from GPS vary markedly among the subbasins in GLW, and the different snow and soil moisture amounts measured in each subbasin cause discrepancies among these GPS estimates. This study shows the value of GPS data in spatially downscaling GRACE/GFO data and providing high-resolution output at spatiotemporal scales with low latency. A new inversion strategy for Total Water Storage (TWS) was applied to global positioning system (GPS) data by first removing lake water driven load through forward modeling GRACE/GFO TWS underestimates spatial patterns of seasonal and long-term TWS fluctuations but coincides with temporal TWS patterns from GPS data GPS provides high spatiotemporal resolution in TWS relative to GRACE/GFO and improved understanding water storage dynamics in Great Lakes Watershed					Rateb, Ashraf/ABB-8274-2022; Zhang, Zizhan/F-5705-2016; Rateb, Ashraf/F-2593-2012; ?, ??/F-5705-2016; Scanlon, Bridget/A-3105-2009	Li, Yan/0000-0001-5993-6135; Rateb, Ashraf/0000-0002-8875-1508; ?, ??/0000-0002-6815-2006; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				JUL	2024	60	7							e2023WR035213	10.1029/2023WR035213	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023WR035213													WOS:001256901100001

Contrasting trends in distribution of four major planktonic betaproteobacterial groups along a pH gradient of epilimnia of 72 freshwater habitats	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												The distribution and abundance of Betaproteobacteria and three of its genera Limnohabitans (R-BT065 lineage), Polynucleobacter (including subclusters Polynucleobacter necessarius and Polynucleobacter acidiphobus/Polynucleobacter difficilis), and Methylophilus across the epilimnia of 72 limnologically diverse freshwater habitats were investigated using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Moreover, seasonal development of Betaproteobacteria subgroups along the longitudinal axis of a reservoir was followed. Betaproteobacteria comprised on average 29.1%, Polynucleobacter 11.6%, P.similar to necessarius 10.1%, P.similar to acidiphobus/difficilis 0.5%, Limnohabitans 8.9%, and Methylophilus 0.9% of total bacterioplankton cells in the investigated habitats. Polynucleobacter necessarius and Limnohabitans coexisted in the majority of habitats but showed contrasting abundance patterns along the pH gradient of habitats (pH, 3.88.5). The observed distribution patterns could theoretically be explained by different preferences for substrate sources, that is, substances of humic origin in acidic waters and algal-derived substances in alkaline waters. However, substrate utilization patterns observed in laboratory experiments indicate no coherent group-specific differences in substrate preferences. Interestingly, similar distribution patterns were revealed for Limnohabitans and P.similar to acidiphobus/difficilis, suggesting similar ecological adaptations of these distantly related taxa.

Partial canonical correspondence analysis indicated that assemblage structure was predictably linked to environmental characteristics that varied along temporal and spatial scales. Species distributed differentially along an environmental gradient of temperature, hydrometric level, conductivity, macrophyte cover and transparency in relation to their sensory capabilities (following piscivory-transparency-morphometry model) and life history strategies. During high water season, assemblages were associated with temperature and hydrometric level, factors which varied mainly across temporal scales and exhibit a regional range of action. During low waters, assemblage structure correlated with macrophyte cover and transparency, factors that varied fundamentally on spatial scales and have local impact. These results indicate that the determinism of fish assemblages does not vary substantially between hydrometric periods, although the environmental variables affecting fish assemblages and their scale of action are clearly different.					; Pouilly, Marc/E-9119-2014	Lopez, Javier Alejandro/0000-0002-5156-6915; Pouilly, Marc/0000-0003-4209-3367													0906-6691	1600-0633				DEC	2011	20	4					605	618		10.1111/j.1600-0633.2011.00510.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2011.00510.x													WOS:000296448500013

The prevailing strong stratification is a major factor contributing to global algal blooms, underscoring the need to understand the thermal regime and driving mechanisms. The thermal conditions of riverine/canyon-type reservoirs and tributaries are distinct from those of other districts, and hydrological connectivity and meteorological forcing play an important role in stratification and mixing. To test this concept and analyse how hydrological and meteorological conditions affect the thermal regime of Xiangxi Bay (XXB), one of the largest tributaries at the head of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in China, we conducted approximately one year of field monitoring. The results indicate that XXB is a typical subtropical continuous warm polymictic water body. Affected by the regulation of the TGR, the water level of XXB fluctuated up to 30 m. The stratification started in March and reached its maximum during the flood season; with reservoir storage in September, the stratified structure gradually collapsed. The combination of lower water level, increased shortwave radiation (SW) and warmer air temperature (AT) enhanced the stratification intensity (N). Vertical mixing produced by meteorological forcing was limited, turbulent mixing in the near-surface was dominated by the convection velocity (w*) rather than the frictional velocity (uw*), and high wind speeds enhanced the convection effect. During the heating period, the peak uw * lagged behind w* by approximately 3 h, and near-surface stratification suppressed wind-induced turbulence. In addition, no temporal heterogeneity was observed during the cooling period. The heat budget was mainly controlled by the intrusive discharge of the mainstream of the TGR, and the annual water level fluctuation was the main factor affecting the heat imbalance (.QT-.QM). However, in the near-surface of the water column, heat distribution (indicator: mld) was mainly dominated by the water-air heat flux, Qnet (r = -0.833, p < 0.01, n = 323), and the difference in the cooling rate between the mainstream of the TGR and XXB induced a diurnal heat imbalance. The results of this study, the first long-term, muti-parameter field monitoring effort in XXB, provide new insights into the thermal regime of riverine reservoirs and their influencing factors while offering a thermodynamic perspective on eutrophication and algal blooms in reservoir tributaries.

J	Kennedy, DM; McSweeney, SL; Mariani, M; Zavadil, E				Kennedy, David M.; McSweeney, Sarah L.; Mariani, Michela; Zavadil, Elisa			The geomorphology and evolution of intermittently open and closed estuaries in large embayments in Victoria, Australia	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Intermittently open and closed estuaries (IOCE) are common landforms on open-ocean microtidal coasts. They are often viewed as evolutionary end members of open estuaries where all the accommodation space has been infilled by sediment. While IOCE are typically recognised to form in wave-dominated, microtidal environments, they can also form within embayments where the relative balance between waves and tides is highly spatially, and temporally, variable. This study examines the geomorphology and infill of two such embayed IOCE in Victoria, southern Australia, in order to assess how these systems compare to their open ocean counterparts in order to gain an understanding of the boundary conditions of such landforms. It is found that IOCE's can occur in embayments where there is sufficient energy to form a beach berm. The infill of these systems broadly follows the transgressive - stillstand pathways of open-coast systems, but the facies are modulated by the size of the catchment and open-ocean wave exposure. These boundary conditions also affect the evolution of the coastal plain in which the embayed IOCE may form and in turn the estuary planform. The entrance dynamics of these estuaries are highly variable, and it appears that they may switch between permanently open or closed states in relation to modification of boundary conditions such as roughness. It is inferred that the relative tidal range (RTR) of the marine environment at the estuary mouth is an important determination of entrance condition with the observed systems being close to the maximum RTR value on the open coast at which these landforms can exist.

A total of 46 phytoplankton taxa were recorded, where Bacillariophyta was the most abundant in species number representing 24 taxa. Diatoms were the most conspicuous phytoplankton in terms of abundance as well as occurrence frequency. Charophyta, Chlorophyta, Cyanobacteria, Ochrophyta, Miozoa, and Euglenozoa were the least abundant. However, some Diatoms (Gyrosigma attenuatum, Hippodonta hungarica, Meridion circulare, Nitzschia clausii, Nitzschia frustulum, Pantocsekiella ocellata, Rhoicosphenia abbreviata), Charophytes (Cosmarium granatum, Mougeotiopsis calospora), Cyanobacteria (Leiblenia epiphytica, Planktothrix agardhii); Dinoflagellates (Ceratium hirundinella, Parvodinium africanum, Parvodinium inconspicuum, Peridinium cinctum), and Ochrophyta (Dinobryon pediforme) were also noticeable, with their occurrence in all seasons. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) were employed to analyze the relationship between occurrence and abundance of phytoplankton species as well as the ecological factors. The results showed that pH and the concentrations of NH4, NO3, and PO4 influenced seasonal occurrence and abundance of phytoplankton species in the lake. Uzuncayir Dam Lake may be classified as an oligotrophic lake with the mean value of nitrate 2.62 mg L-1 and phosphate 0.23 mg L-1 as supported by the occurrence of various phytoplankton groups. Findings related to pollution indices yielded that Uzuncayir Dam Lake is on the edge of the moderate state of organic pollution.

Surface deformation observed by InSAR shows connections with water storage change in Southern Ontario	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: A 10,000 km(2) area of southwestern Ontario within the Lake Erie and Lake Ontario basins of the Laurentian Great Lakes basin, Ontario, Canada, a humid northern hydrogeological setting with abundant precipitation and recharge, and a stable Paleozoic sedimentary bedrock overlain by galacial sediment forming a relatively uncompressible sedimentary succession. Study focus: Examing land surface deformation in southern Ontario and its connection with water storage change. New hydrological insights: The surface deformation, observed from a set of 48 Radarsat-2 InSAR images over five years from Jan. 2013 to Sept. 2017 presents a subsidence trend of 1-10 mm/year and a seasonal variation of up to 20 mm over the region. The InSAR results are confirmed by the GPS measurements at six locations over the region. The surface deformations were compared to the water storage data derived from GRACE satellites, in-situ water levels of the Great Lakes, and precipitation data in the study area. The results indicate that the multi-year trend and seasonal variations in surface deformation are correlated to water storage changes, suggesting that the surface deformation in southern Ontario could be caused by water loading.

The sum of 13 PBDEs (Sigma 13PBDEs) in air and surface seawater varied in the range of 0.54-14.5. pg m(-3) and 0.60-13.5 pg L-1, respectively, with the highest concentrations observed in the ECS. The Clausius-Clapeyron approach and air mass origin analysis indicated that continued primary emissions of PBDEs, particularly BDE-209, from East Asian sources governed the spatial variability of air PBDEs over the NWP through long-range atmospheric transport (LRAT). Net air-to-seawater gas deposition of PBDEs was evidenced based on the fugacity calculation with sum fluxes of seven selected PBDEs ranging from -45 to -582 pg m(-2) d(-1). Following the substantial advection of aerosol phase BDE-209 over the ECS, dry particle deposition dominated the input pathway of PBDEs into the ECS, whereas in the open NWP, relatively free from the influence of the land emissions, fluxes in PBDE absorption and in dry particle deposition were comparable. This suggests an impact of continental outflow on the fate of atmospheric PBDEs over the NWP. Regarding gas-particle partitioning, PBDEs over the NWP were obviously absorbed into continental organic aerosols during atmospheric transport, except for BDE-209, which tended to remain within the steady state.

Diffusive methane emissions to the atmosphere from Lake Kivu (Eastern Africa)	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												We report a data set of methane (CH4) concentrations in the surface waters of Lake Kivu obtained during four cruises (March 2007, September 2007, June 2008, and April 2009) covering the two main seasons, rainy (October to May) and dry (June to September). Spatial gradients of CH4 concentrations were modest in the surface waters of the main basin. In Kabuno Bay (a small subbasin), CH4 concentrations in surface waters were significantly higher than in the main basin. Seasonal variations of CH4 in the main basin were strongly driven by deepening of the mixolimnion and mixing of surface waters with deeper waters rich in CH4. On an annual basis, both Kabuno Bay and the main basin of Lake Kivu were over-saturated in CH4 with respect to atmospheric equilibrium (7330% and 2510%, respectively), and emitted CH4 to the atmosphere (39 mmol m (2) yr (1) and 13 mmol m(-2) yr(-1), respectively). The source of CH4 to atmosphere was two orders of magnitude lower than the CH4 upward flux. The source of CH4 to the atmosphere from Lake Kivu corresponded to similar to 60% of the terrestrial sink of atmospheric CH4 over the lake's catchment. A global cross-system comparison of CH4 in surface waters of lakes shows that both Kabuno Bay and the main basin are at the lower end of values in lakes globally, despite the huge amounts of CH4 in the deeper layers of the lake. This is related to the strongly meromictic nature of the lake that promotes an intense removal of CH4 by bacterial oxidation.					; Borges, Alberto/C-4989-2008; Abril, Gwenaël/C-7835-2011; Delille, Bruno/C-3486-2008	Descy, Jean-Pierre/0000-0003-1649-7800; Abril, Gwenael/0000-0002-4914-086X; Delille, Bruno/0000-0003-0502-8101; Borges, Alberto V./0000-0002-5434-2247													2169-8953					SEP 9	2011	116								G03032	10.1029/2011JG001673	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2011JG001673													WOS:000294803900002

Potential effects of climate change and eutrophication on a large subtropical shallow lake	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												In many aquatic ecosystems, increased nutrient loading has caused eutrophication, which is reflected in the trophic structure of the ecosystem. In Lake Mangueira, a large shallow subtropical lake in Brazil, nutrient loading has also increased, but it is still unclear what the effects of this increase will be and how this relates to climate change. To evaluate the effects of increased nutrient loadings in such large lake one would need to integrate hydrological and ecological processes into one model, an approach that has rarely been used before. Here, we apply different versions of a complex 3D ecological model, called IPHTRIM3D-PCLake, which describes the integrated hydrodynamic, water-quality, and biological processes in the lake. First, the nutrient loadings from the watershed were estimated using a separate hydrological water quality model of the watershed based on field data. Second, we calibrated the 3D ecological model for a 6-year monitoring period in the lake using a simplified non-spatial version of the model. Finally, the calibrated ecological model was applied to evaluate the spatial explicit effects of different scenarios of land use, water pumping for irrigation, and climate change. On short term (1.5 year), the system seemed to be rather resilient, probably because of the lake size related to its high inertia. Our simulations indicated warming can increase water transparency in Lake Mangueira which may be related to two factors: (a) the current meso-oligotrophic state of the lake which may easily lead to nutrient limitation; and (b) submerged rnacrophytes grow during the whole season. The combined effect of climate change and increased nutrient loading, less strong than increased nutrient loading alone. The model can only be used for qualitative predictions of the effect of management scenarios, such as maintenance of water levels in the dry season, and water-pumping rules for irrigation in order to maintain the ecosystem structure and functions in the future under additional stress caused by increased use or climate change.

A total of 56 species belonging to 11 orders, were identified. Harbor of Gabes station was more diversified (45 species) than both Tabia (26 species) and Karboub (31 species) stations. The ciliate assemblage was numerically dominated by Spirotrichea in Tabia (82% of the total abundance), in the Harbor of Gabes (86% of the total abundance), whereas, in Karboub, Spirotrichea represented only 40% of the total abundance. The unexpected lower quantitative importance of Spirotrichea in Karboub station was apparently the result of the high salt concentration found in water samples throughout the study, probably originating from the saline area surrounding Karboub station, known as Sabkha. The distribution of species in the nearshore of the Gulf of Gabes seemed most likely influenced by the combined effects of temperature, salinity and hydrographic conditions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Isotopic and hydrogeochemical tracking of dissolved nutrient dynamics in the Brahmaputra River System: A source delineation perspective	CHEMOSPHERE												The Brahmaputra river system (BRS) produces the largest discharge in India, supplying water to more than 62 million inhabitants. The present study aims to quantify the environmental elements that affect the spatio-temporal variation of nutrients in the Brahmaputra river system (BRS). The association of physicochemical characteristics of floodplain sediments with the distribution pattern of P during wet and dry periods in different depths were also studied. The seasonal variation suggest that the average dissolved inorganic nitrogen and dissolve inorganic phosphorus are found higher in monsoon while the average dissolve silica were higher in post-monsoon. The spatial variation of dissolve inorganic phosphate and nitrate concentration suggests both the nutrient are higher in upstream sites. The DiS concentrations tended to be higher in downstream. In 70% of the sampled tributaries, the average molar ratio for dissolved inorganic nitrogen/dissolved inorganic phosphorous (DIN/DIP) was greater than 16:1, which indicates phosphate limited biological productivity. In contrast, an average molar ratio of dissolved inorganic silica/DIN (DSi/DIN) of 3.8 +/- 3.0 favoured diatom growth in those tributaries where DSi/DIN molar ratio was lower than 1, indicating eutrophication. The BRS transported 24.7, 5.93, and 312 x10(4 )tons/year(-1) of DIN, PO4-P and SiO2-Si, respectively. The depth-wise variation of P-fraction during monsoon suggests that the authigenic phosphorus was most abundant followed by Fe-bound, exchangeable, detrital and organic. In the post-monsoon, Fe-bound P was found at a higher concentration followed by authigenic phosphorus. High nutrient concentrations with more delta O-18 depleted water implied precipitation being the major source of nutrients in the BRS.					; Deshpande, Rajendrakumar/Q-5799-2019; Mahlknecht, Jürgen/ABA-5351-2020; Hdeib, Rouya/AAX-1024-2021; Kumari, Rina/GPF-7899-2022; Panday, Durga/X-9195-2019	jha, pawan kumar/0000-0002-4838-2875; Panday, Durga Prasad/0000-0003-3707-7936; Mahlknecht, Jurgen/0000-0002-5708-0043; Hdeib, Rouya/0000-0002-2985-6959; Kumari, Rina/0000-0003-1824-6351; 													0045-6535	1879-1298				NOV	2022	307		2						135757	10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.135757	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.135757		AUG 2022						35863407					WOS:000843013600001

However, the effects of host water isotope changes, temperature-dependent fractionations, and vital effects on the isotopic ratios of such biogenic proxies often cannot be disentangled. Here, delta O-18 values of ostracod valves, head capsules of chironomid larvae and aquatic macrophyte cellulose from various lake and stream sites in southern Patagonia (41-52 degrees S) are compared with delta O-18 values of their host waters. The best correlation between delta O-18 values of bioproxy and host water was obtained for aquatic cellulose exhibiting a slope of the regression of almost unity. Chironomid head capsules showed a strong correlation, but the data set was rather small (seven sites). The delta O-18 values of ostracod valves showed strong inter-specific vital effects. Strong offsets of ostracod values from isotopic equilibrium are possibly explained by re-working of subfossil valves, seasonality effects or different chemical composition of host waters. A weak, but significant temperature dependency of oxygen isotope fractionation was observed for cellulose of one aquatic taxon (Myriophyllum) and for ostracod calcite, but not for chironomids and aquatic moss cellulose. The present dataset suggests that delta O-18 values of aquatic cellulose are the most reliable proxy for host water isotope reconstructions, but clearly more investigations are needed to substantiate this finding.

Biological and geochemical changes in shallow lakes of the Hudson Bay Lowlands: a response to recent warming	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL) region of the far north of Ontario (Canada) is expected to undergo considerable physical, chemical and biological change as a result of ongoing climatic change. Previous research in the region has shown marked limnological changes during the past similar to 20years in relatively deep lakes that have been attributed to increased air temperatures and changes in sea ice phenology in Hudson Bay since the mid-1990s. Here, we present diatom assemblage, primary production and geochemical data from lake sediments documenting recent limnological change in two shallow sub-arctic lakes in the Sutton River region of the HBL. Both lakes recorded increased whole-lake production and diatom diversity changes that are consistent with a longer ice-free period and growing season. Changes in diatom composition at Wolfgang Lake were characterized by a response amongst benthic/periphytic taxa whereas a modest increase in planktonic diatoms was observed at Sam Lake. Geochemical changes (N-15, C/N and %N) were temporally coherent with diatom assemblage changes, but showed different responses in the two study lakes. Thus, although the biological and geochemical changes were consistent with recent warming, differences in the nature and timing of these shifts illustrate the heterogeneous nature of shallow lakes, and suggest that local (catchment-specific) factors are important determinants of the trajectory of limnological change in these sensitive systems.

Geochemical and hydrological controls of arsenic concentrations across the sediment-water interface at Maharlu Lake, Southern Iran	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												The sediment-water transition zone in an aquatic system is key role to the distribution of contaminants between the surface water and sediment pore water. Maharlu Lake is a seasonal hypersaline lake in the central part of the Maharlu Basin in Southern Iran. Wastewater of various types produced within the basin is released into the seasonal freshwater rivers that ultimately drain into the lake. Samples were collected through one complete period of the lake water-level fluctuation. Lake surface water and shallow sediment pore water samples were collected three times at three piezometric stations at different distances from the river inflow points. Lake sediment samples were collected twice, and water samples from the inflowing rivers were collected five times. Changes in surface runoff and agricultural wastewater inflows were responsible for seasonal hydrochemical changes and changes in the As concentrations in the inflowing rivers. Data from the stations close to the river inflows indicated that the dissolved As concentrations across the sediment-water interface in Maharlu Lake are mostly controlled by evaporation and interactions between the surface water and shallow pore water. However, data from the station far from the freshwater inflows indicated that the brine and precipitated evaporites were at equilibrium and redox processes (e.g., iron (hydr)oxide dissolution and secondary sulphide precipitation) control the dissolved As concentration in pore water. The results confirmed the role of lake water evaporation in As enrichment and As sequestration by secondary sulphide minerals in sediment below the sediment-water interface. Climate change may alter the lake chemistry and As behavior in near future.					; Savadjani, Roghayeh/AAD-9616-2020; Sracek, Ondra/AAK-4593-2020; Zarei, Mehdi/AAB-9406-2020; Bigalke, Moritz/M-6089-2013	Zarei, Mehdi/0000-0002-7909-3371; Sracek, Ondra/0000-0002-3085-6358; Bigalke, Moritz/0000-0002-6793-6159; Khosravi, Roghayeh/0000-0002-6823-4714													0883-2927					MAR	2019	102						88	101		10.1016/j.apgeochem.2019.01.008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2019.01.008													WOS:000459789000008

DETERMINATION OF HEAVY METALS IN FISH, WATER AND SEDIMENTS OF AVSAR DAM LAKE IN TURKEY	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCE & ENGINEERING												In the present study, some heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni and Pb) were seasonally determined in water, sediment and some tissues of Cyprinus carpio from Avsar Dam Lake, which is an important water source for irrigation and drinking in Turkey. Heavy metal levels in water, sediment and fish samples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP/AES). The obtained results showed that the average values of Fe in water samples were higher than the respective reference values for fresh water. Results for levels in water were compared with national and international water quality guidelines, as well as literature data reported for the lakes. The analysis of heavy metals in sediments indicated that among the six heavy metals tested, Fe was maximally accumulated, followed by Ni, Cu, Cr, Pb and Cd. Heavy metal concentrations were found to decrease in sequence of the Cyprinus carpio samples, in the muscle and stomach-intestine as Fe > Cu > Pb > Ni > Cr > Cd; in the gill, heart and liver as Fe > Cu > Ni > Pb > Cr > Cd and in the air sac as Fe > Cu > Ni > Pb > Cd > Cr. In the fish samples, cadmium, chromium, nickel and lead concentrations exceeded the tolerable values provided by international institutions.																			1735-1979						2009	6	2					73	80																WOS:000268072400003

The reservoir is of scientific interest in terms of monitoring and maintaining the quality and quantity of water and its impact on the regional climate. To support these tasks, we conducted numerical studies of the thermal and gas regimes in the lake over the period from May 2017 to March 2019, supplemented by the data observed at the weather stations and floating platforms during the field campaign of the ALentejo Observation and Prediction (ALOP) system project. The 1D model, LAKE 2.0, was used for the numerical studies. Since it is highly versatile and can be adjusted to the specific features of the reservoir, this model is capable of simulating its thermodynamic and biogeochemical characteristics. Profiles and time series of water temperature, sensible and latent heat fluxes, and concentrations of CO2 and O-2 reproduced by the LAKE 2.0 model were validated against the observed data and were compared to the thermodynamic simulation results obtained with the freshwater lake (FLake) model. The results demonstrated that both models captured the seasonal variations in water surface temperature and the internal thermal structure of the Alqueva reservoir well. The LAKE 2.0 model showed slightly better results and satisfactorily captured the seasonal gas regime.

By analysing faunal remains, the distribution of C-14 dates and the location of the settlement sites, we argue that earlier assumptions concerning the importance of marine mammals to the early human populations should be reconsidered. We suggest that the pioneering settlers of Gotland relied on fish to a significant extent. Radiocarbon dates taken from human bones are skewed by a freshwater reservoir effect, which can be used as an indirect indication of the significance of freshwater fish. The numerous, overgrowing lakes on the island, with their extensive biomass production and large amounts of freshwater fish, provided an important subsistence base. Even if the faunal assemblages that have survived are dominated by seal bones, the hunting season for seals was limited and the hunters mostly targeted young seals. Thus, the importance of seal have previously been overestimated and it appears that the human use of marine resources on Gotland was more limited and related to raw material needs rather than dietary necessity or specialization. Although presented as a case study; the results highlight the need to identify a freshwater fish diet among ancient foragers on a larger scale, as implications thereof can fundamentally change how foraging societies are perceived.					; Boethius, Adam/GSN-7857-2022	Vala, Cecilie/0000-0001-8932-9686; Boethius, Adam/0000-0002-8923-6233													2352-409X					JUN	2017	13						625	634		10.1016/j.jasrep.2017.05.014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jasrep.2017.05.014													WOS:000415616500058

In particular, significant hydropeaking operations by hydropower plants affect not only the downstream ecosystem but also the reservoir water temperature. This paper contributes to understanding that link. For this, we coupled a hydrodynamic model (Estuary, Lake and Coastal Ocean Model, ELCOM) to a grid-wide power system scheduling model. In a case study (Rapel, Chile), we observe the behavior of variables related to the flow regime and water quality (including sub-daily hydrologic alteration, seasonal and sub-daily thermal pollution of the downstream river, and vertical mixing in the reservoir). Additionally, we evaluate how environmental constraints (ECs) can improve the conditions for a wet, normal and dry water-type year. We found that the unconstrained operation produces a strong sub-daily hydrologic alteration as well as an intense thermal pollution of the outflow. We show that these effects can clearly be avoided when implementing ECs. The current (unconstrained) vertical mixing makes the reservoir susceptible to algae blooms. Implementing ECs may intensify the stratification in the reservoir near the dam in some scenarios. The grid-wide economic cost of Rapel's ECs is a modest 0.3%.					de la Fuente Stranger, Alberto/G-7018-2016; Olivares, Marcelo/D-7340-2016; Haas, Jannik/P-6845-2016	de la Fuente Stranger, Alberto/0000-0001-5415-9816; Haas, Jannik/0000-0003-2604-6456; Olivares, Marcelo/0000-0003-4443-9261													2073-4441					JUN	2017	9	6							367	10.3390/w9060367	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w9060367													WOS:000404559900005

To investigate glacier mass balance, runoff and water balance in the Qugaqie basin and Zhadang sub-basin in the southern Tibetan Plateau, two glacier models and three snow models were integrated into the spatially distributed hydrological model JAMS/J2K. The results showed that the temperature index method simulated glacier runoff better than the degree-day factor method. The simulated glacier melt volume in the Qugaqie basin in 2006, 2007 and 2008 contributed 58%, 50% and 41%, respectively, to its total runoff. In the Zhadang basin, the glacier melt volume contributed 78% and 66% to its runoff during 2007 and 2008, respectively. Compared with the observation results, the simulated glacier mass balance showed similar variations with slightly higher values, indicating an underestimation of glacier melt volume. The water balance simulation in the upstream areas (705-874 mm) was comparable to that in the downstream areas (1051-1502 mm) and generally lower than the observed results. In both basins, the glacier mass-balance simulation was relatively accurate in the melt season compared to the other seasons.

Mapping site-level microtopography with RealTime Kinematic Global Navigation Satellite Systems (RTK GNSS) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Photogrammetry (UAVP)	OPEN ARCHAEOLOGY												Microtopographic mapping has a long history in archaeology and has gained prominence recently owing to the proliferation of digital technologies. With such proliferation, it becomes necessary to compare and contrast different approaches based on a common set of criteria. This article compares the implementation and efficiency of two methods of mapping microtopography - ground- based Real- Time Kinematic Global Navigation Satellite System (RTK GNSS) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Photogrammetry (UAVP) survey - assessing the pros and cons of each, including those related to data quality. ` Off- the- shelf' solutions for methods were used to create the comparative dataset of microtopographic maps of six Middle and Late Bronze Age sites over the course of four seasons between 2007 and 2013 in the study area of the Central Lydia Archaeological Survey in western Turkey. Comparison of results demonstrate that the methods are similar with respect to ease of implementation, cost efficiency, and the (in) significance of data defects, while, unsurprisingly, UAVP survey can be greater than one order of magnitude more labor efficient than RTK GNSS survey and over two orders of magnitude more detailed as measured by data density. The accuracy of both methods is high, within typical error budgets for site- level mapping, and comparable to other recent digital mapping approaches. Accordingly, the results suggest that, given site suitability, UAVP is the more labor and cost- efficient method in the long run, with significant data quality benefits.

J	Fukushima, T; Kitamura, T; Matsushita, B				Fukushima, Takehiko; Kitamura, Tatsumi; Matsushita, Bunkei			Lake water quality observed after extreme rainfall events: implications for water quality affected by stormy runoff	SN APPLIED SCIENCES												To investigate the effects of extreme rainfall events (EREs) on lake water quality, we analyzed the lake monthly monitoring data at the stations close to inflow rivers. We tested the hypothesis that the effects depend on rainfall magnitude, season, distance from the rivers, etc. The highest correlations with many water-quality indicators were obtained for the rainfall amount for the preceding 10 days before the water sampling days; i.e., negatively with Na+, Cl-, chlorophyll a (Chla), and COD, and positively with ortho-phosphate. We used the threshold of rainfall amount >= 140 mm to choose EREs and evaluate the water quality on such occasions because quite low values of Na+, Cl-, and Chla thresholds (<= 25th percentile) were observed in some of the EREs. The event samples (group 1; G1) meeting the above thresholds probably represented the inflow waters during EREs (generally occurred in Oct-May), and the others (group 2; G2) indicated significant changes in the lakes (Jun to Sep), probably depending on the lake's state of primary production. In the events of lower rainfall events (50 mm to 140 mm for 10 days), fast recoveries of algal production usually occurred even in Oct to May. The values of COD, total phosphorus, and ortho-phosphate in G1 were higher than the values of river water quality in the baseflow conditions, whereas both the G1 and baseflow values of nitrogen were nearly the same. The effects of ERFs on lake water quality from the viewpoints of tempo-longitudinal distributions, future monitoring, and climate change were discussed.					; Matsushita, Bunkei/E-1036-2014; Fukushima, Takehiko/S-9801-2019	Fukushima, Takehiko/0000-0003-2494-309X; 													2523-3963	2523-3971				NOV	2021	3	11							841	10.1007/s42452-021-04823-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42452-021-04823-x													WOS:000706735000002

This study assessed the water quality of the North Canal River on the basis of its ecological status using the phytoplankton functional groups (PFGs) approach. The river runs through the megacities of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region in China, and is mainly replenished with reclaimed water. The results showed that the PFGs approach is much better for evaluating the water quality of urban rivers than the conventional physicochemical index method and phytoplankton diversity metrics, because the PFGs approach is more sensitive to the spatiotemporal variations in the water quality of urban rivers. The average Q ( r ) index, for ecological status estimation in rivers, based on the PFGs of the North Canal River was 3.30, indicating 'good' water quality. In the dry season, the dominant PFG upstream was group D (Cyclotella spp.), whereas the major downstream PFGs had changed to group Y (Glenodinium spp., Cryptomonas ovata, and Cryptomonas erosa) and W1 (Euglena spp. and Gonium pectoral). While the dominant PFG throughout the river changed to T-B: Melosira spp. in the wet season. The Q ( r ) at each site was one to two grades lower during the wet season than the dry season, indicating that water quality was worse in the wet than the dry season.					; WEI, Yuansong/H-6325-2012; Zhu, Liying/AAN-1917-2021; Wang, Yawei/AAM-1385-2020	Zhu, Liying/0000-0001-9194-6990; 													2515-7620					NOV 1	2021	3	11							115006	10.1088/2515-7620/ac3777	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2515-7620/ac3777													WOS:000719571700001

Biogeochemical and photobiological responses of subarctic lakes to UV radiation	JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY B-BIOLOGY												Solar ultraviolet radiation (UV) induces photodegradation of optically and functionally important organic compounds in lakes and may negatively impact aquatic biota. We disentangled UV impacts on dissolved organic matter (DOM) transformation, and algal and zoobenthic micro-organisms in two shallow subarctic lakes in NW Finnish Lapland; in a high-UV + low-DOM (tundra, Iso-Jehkas) and a low-UV + high-DOM (mountain birch woodland, Mukkavaara) system. In addition to site and seasonal comparisons, in situ experiments with three treatments (DARK, photosynthetically active radiation [PAR], UV + PAR) were set up floating on the lakes for four weeks during midsummer. Lake water and experimental lake water were analyzed for basic limnology, optical properties (dissolved organic carbon [DOC], specific UV absorbance [SUVA], colored DOM [CDOM], and DOM compounds) as well as for photosynthetic and photoprotective pigments in algae and microzoobenthos. DOC concentrations remained largely unchanged after the exposure period in seasonal and experimental samples in both lakes yet the biochemical composition of the carbon pools was distinctly altered. CDOM and SUVA decreased seasonally and under UV exposure in the experiments, and terrestrial DOM compounds decreased in the experiments, suggesting UV induced photodegradation of large molecular size DOM of terrestrial origin. Higher seasonal and experimental (UV + PAR vs. PAR) proportional CDOM degradation occurred in Iso-Jehkas (32%, 29%) than in Mukkavaara (19%, 9%). Accordingly, the high-UV + low-DOM lake was more sensitive to photodegradation despite originally low CDOM relative to the low-UV + high-DOM system where DOM biodegradation likely prevailed. Experimental results showed elevated algal carotenoid/chlorophyll ratios and microzoobenthic melanin under UV exposure indicating photoinhibition and photoprotective pigmentation. UV has a significant impact on aquatic food webs of subarctic lakes altering the biogeochemical composition of organic matter and organisms through mechanisms of photodegradation, photoinhibition and photoprotection.

QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Lacustrine laminated sediments are often varves representing annual rhythmic deposition. The Dead Sea high-stand laminated sections consist of mm-scale alternating detrital and authigenic aragonite laminae. Previous studies assumed these laminae were varves deposited seasonally. However, this assumption has never been robustly validated. Here we report an examination of the seasonal deposition of detrital aragonite couplets from two well-known Late Holocene laminated sections at the Ze'elim fan-delta using palynology and grain-size distribution analyses. These analyses are complemented by the study of contemporary flash-flood samples and multivariate statistical analysis. Because transport affects the pollen preservation state, well preserved (mostly) air-borne transported pollen was analysed separately from badly-preserved pollen and fungal spores, which are more indicative of water transport and reworking from soils. Our results indicate that (i) both detrital and aragonite laminae were deposited during the rainy season; (ii) aragonite laminae have significantly lower reworked and fungal spore concentrations than detrital and flash-flood samples; and (iii) detrital laminae are composed of recycling of local and distal sources, with coarser particles that were initially deposited in the Dead Sea watershed and later transported via run-off to the lake. This is in line with previous carbon balance studies that showed that aragonite precipitation occurs after the massive input of TCO2 associated with run-off episodes. Consequently, at least for the Holocene Ze'elim Formation, laminated sediments cannot be considered as varves. Older Quaternary laminated sequences should be re-evaluated. (C) 2016 The Authors.

In this study, we proposed a new system dynamics model with a coupled modeling structure to analyze a comprehensive influencing relationship between the NDVI and the concentrations of TN and TP from the socioeconomic water circulation during the growing season from 2000 to 2010 in Baiyangdian Lake, the largest shallow lake in northern China. The results show that, (1) there is a good comprehensive correlation between TN, TP and NDVI, with a correlation coefficient of 0.979; (2) compared to the industrial, domestic, and ecological water demand, the agricultural water demand exhibits the largest amount and the strongest ability in the creation of TN and TP, and the factor of agricultural wastewater affects the most. Therefore, the regulation of the agricultural wastewater would be the most efficient way to build a healthy environment for vegetative growth. This study contributes to the water resources planning and ecosystem management with the aim of improving both the water quality and the ecological functions in Baiyangdian Lake.

The Role of Methane Transport From the Active Layer in Sustaining Methane Emissions and Food Chains in Subarctic Ponds	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Groundwater discharge from the seasonally thawed active layer is increasingly recognized as an important pathway for delivering methane (CH4) into Arctic lakes and streams, but its contribution to CH4 emissions from thaw ponds and its influence on the trophic support and nutritional quality of pond food chains remains unexplored. We quantified the transport of CH4 from the active layer through groundwater discharge into thaw ponds in a subarctic catchment in northern Sweden, using radon (Rn-222) as groundwater tracer. We analyzed stable isotopes and fatty acids of pond macroinvertebrates to evaluate the potential effects of groundwater-mediated CH4 inputs on the aquatic food chains. Our results indicate that active layer groundwater discharge flows are nontrivial (range 6%-46% of pond volume per day) and the associated CH4 fluxes (median 339 mg C m(-2)day(-1), interquartile range [IQR]: 179-419 mg C m(-2) day(-1)) can sustain the diffusive CH4 emissions from most of the ponds (155 mg C m(-2) day(-1), IQR: 55-234 mg C m(-2) day(-1)). Consumers in ponds receiving greater CH4 inputs from the active layer had lower stable carbon (C) isotope signatures that indicates a greater trophic reliance on methane oxidizing bacteria (MOB), and they had lower nutritional quality as indicated by their lower tissue concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Overall, this work links physical (CH4 transport from the active layer), biogeochemical (CH4 emission), and ecological (MOB-consumer interaction) processes to provide direct evidence for the role of active layer groundwater discharge in CH4 cycling of subarctic thaw ponds.

In contrast to diet information from stomach contents, diet estimates obtained using stable isotopes in blood and muscle can reveal temporal variation in diets. Here, we used an extensive stable isotope dataset and Bayesian stable isotope mixing model to evaluate the trophic role of the Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis), a critically endangered species distributed in the middle and lower catchments of the Yangtze River. We analysed blood samples from 24 individuals captured during March 2017 in Poyang Lake (which adjoins the Yangtze River), and muscle samples from 8 individuals stranded in the lake over a 1-year period (2012-2013). We additionally genotyped prey from faecal samples taken from 13 individuals captured in March 2017. We found that as a generalist apex predator, this finless porpoise consumes semi-migratory and non-migratory fish prey. However, relative proportions of these two prey resources were different between dietary analyses based on blood samples compared to muscle samples, reflecting recent and longer-term consumption patterns, respectively. Non-migratory fish contributed mainly to the diet of predators in the early and middle of March. In contrast, semi-migratory fish comprised the majority of the prey composition over a more extended period (e.g. 2-3 months), and the difference may be linked to changes in the fish abundance influenced by seasonal factors. Our findings provide insights into the trophic role of this critically imperilled but little studied species, demonstrate how stable isotope analyses can elucidate finless porpoise feeding ecology, and emphasise the importance of semi-migratory fish to conserving this porpoise population.					; Mei, Zhigang/AAQ-1545-2020; Xu, Jun/E-9681-2013; Zheng, Jinsong/JVY-6910-2024; Wan, Xiaoling/T-1813-2019	Yang, Jiwei/0000-0001-8527-9482; Mei, Zhigang/0000-0002-1826-9177; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				MAY	2021	66	5					992	1001		10.1111/fwb.13692	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13692		MAR 2021											WOS:000623775800001

The Randeck Maar: Palaeoenvironment and habitat differentiation of a Miocene lacustrine system	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The Randeck Maar in S. Germany is a well-known fossil lagerstatte with exceptionally preserved fossils, particularly insects and plants, which thrived in and around the maar lake during the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum (late Early/early Middle Miocene, mammal zone MN5). We provide the first critical and detailed overview of the fauna and flora with lists of 363 previously published, partially revised, and newly identified taxa. Plant remains are the most diverse group (168 taxa), followed by insects (79). The flora points towards subhumid sclerophyllous forests and mixed mesophytic forests, the former being an indication for the occurrence of seasonal drought Three main sections can be differentiated for the habitats of the Randeck Maar lake system: (1) Deep- and open-water lake habitats with local and short-termed mass occurrences of insect larvae, amphibians, and/or gastropods, while fish is particularly scarce. The interpretation of the water chemistry is problematic because contradictive palaeoenvironmental indicators for both brackish and freshwater conditions exist. (2) Shallow parts of the lake comprise a narrow reed-belt with insects and gastropods living on the exposed plant stems as well as turtles. (3) Crater slopes and surrounding plateaus were mainly covered by subhumid sclerophyllous to mixed mesophytic forests depending on sun exposition and soil conditions. Horses and other forest-dwellers preferably lived in forested habitats while proboscideans and rhinoceratids occupied more open habitats. Our study also brings up contradictive results that cannot be untangled with the current state of knowledge and thus directions for future studies are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Sinninghe			Disentangling influences of climate variability and lake-system evolution on climate proxies derived from isoprenoid and branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs): the 250 kyr Lake Chala record	BIOGEOSCIENCES												High-resolution paleoclimate records from tropical continental settings are greatly needed to advance understanding of global climate dynamics. The International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP) project DeepCHALLA recovered a 214.8 m long sediment sequence from Lake Chala, a deep and permanently stratified (meromictic) crater lake in eastern equatorial Africa, covering the past ca. 250 000 years (250 kyr) of continuous lacustrine deposition since the earliest phase of lake-basin development. Lipid biomarker analyses on the sediments of Lake Chala can provide quantitative records of past variation in temperature and moisture balance from this poorly documented region. However, the degree to which climate proxies derived from aquatically produced biomarkers are affected by aspects of lake developmental history is rarely considered, even though it may critically influence their ability to consistently register a particular climate variable through time. Modern-system studies of Lake Chala revealed crucial information about the mechanisms underpinning relationships between proxies based on isoprenoid (iso-) and branched (br-) glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) and the targeted climate variables, but the persistence of these relationships in the past remains unclear. Here we assess the reliability of long-term climate signals registered in the sediments of Lake Chala by comparing downcore variations in GDGT distributions with major phases in lake-system evolution as reflected by independent proxies of lake depth, mixing regime and nutrient dynamics: seismic reflection data, lithology and fossil diatom assemblages. Together, these records suggest that during early lake history (before ca. 180-200 ka) the distinct mixing-related depth zones with which specific GDGT producers are associated in the modern-day lake were not yet formed, likely due to more open lake hydrology and absence of chemical water-column stratification. Consequently absolute GDGT concentrations dating to this period are relatively low, proxies sensitive to water-column stratification (e.g., branched versus isoprenoid tetraether (BIT) index) display highly irregular temporal variability, and correlations between proxies are dissimilar to expectations based on modern-system understanding. A sequence of lake-system changes between ca. 180-200 and ca. 80 ka first established and then strengthened the chemical density gradient, promoting meromictic conditions despite the overall decrease in lake depth due to the basin gradually being filled up with sediments. From ca. 180 ka onward some GDGTs and derived proxies (e.g., crenarchaeol concentration, BIT index and IR 6Me ) display strong similar to 23 kyr periodicity, likely reflecting the predominantly precession-driven insolation forcing of Quaternary climate variability in low-latitude regions. Our results suggest that GDGT-based temperature and moisture-balance proxies in Lake Chala sediments reflect the climate history of eastern equatorial Africa from at least ca. 160 ka onwards, i.e., covering the complete last glacial-interglacial cycle and the penultimate glacial maximum. This work confirms the potential of lacustrine GDGTs for elucidating the climate history of tropical regions at Quaternary timescales, provided they are applied to suitably high-quality sediment archives. Additionally, their interpretation should incorporate a broader understanding of the extent to which lake-system evolution limits the extrapolation back in time of proxy-climate relationships established in the modern system.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence of potentially toxic cyanobacteria and the environmental conditions associated with the presence of cyanotoxins in a Brazilian subtropical reservoir. Five collections were carried out at seven sampling locations in the reservoir, during the rainy and dry seasons, between the years 2016 and 2017. There was permanent occurrence of Raphidiopsis raciborskii (Woloszynska) Aguilera, Berrendero Gomez, Kastovsky, Echenique & Salerno (Phycologia 57(2):130-146, 2018), ranging between dominant and abundant, with an average biomass of 38.8 +/- 29.9 mg L-1. Also abundant were Dolichospermum solitarium, D. planctonicum, Planktothrix isothrix, and Aphanizomenon gracile. Saxitoxin (STX) was detected in all the collected samples (0.11 +/- 0.05 mu g L-1). Microcystin (MC) was also detected, but at lower concentrations (0.01 +/- 0.0 mu g L-1). Low availability of NO3- and phosphorus limitation had significant effects on the R. raciborskii biomass and the levels of STX and MC. It was observed that R. raciborskii was sensitive to thermal stratification, at the same time that STX levels were higher. This suggested that STX was produced under conditions that restricted the growth of R. raciborskii. These are important findings, because they add information about the permanent occurrence of STX and R. raciborskii in an aquatic ecosystem limited by phosphorus, vulnerable to climatic variations, and polluted by domestic effluents.

How does the cladoceran Daphnia pulex affect the fate of Escherichia coli in water?	PLOS ONE												The faecal indicator Escherichia coli plays a central role in water quality assessment and monitoring. It is therefore essential to understand its fate under various environmental constraints such as predation by bacterivorous zooplankton. Whereas most studies have examined how protozooplankton communities (heterotrophic nanoflagellates and ciliates) affect the fate of E. coli in water, the capacity of metazooplankton to control the faecal indicator remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated how the common filter-feeding cladoceran, Daphnia pulex, affects the fate of E. coli under different experimental conditions. Daphnia ingested E. coli and increased its loss rates in water, but the latter rates decreased from 1.65 d(-1) to 0.62 d(-1) after a 1,000-fold reduction in E. coli initial concentrations, due to lower probability of encounter between Daphnia and E. coli. The combined use of culture and PMA qPCR (viability-qPCR) demonstrated that exposure to Daphnia did not result into the formation of viable but non-culturable E. coli cells. In lake water, a significant part of E. coli population loss was associated with matrix-related factors, most likely due to predation by other bacterivorous biota and/or bacterial competition. However, when exposing E. coli to a D. pulex gradient (from 0 to 65 ind. L-1), we observed an increasing impact of Daphnia on E. coli loss rates, which reached 0.47 d(-1) in presence of 65 ind. L-1. Our results suggest that the filter-feeder can exert a non-negligible predation pressure on E. coli, especially during seasonal Daphnia population peaks. Similar trials using other Daphnia species as well as stressed E. coli cells will increase our knowledge on the capacity of this widespread zooplankter to control E. coli in freshwater resources. Based on our results, we strongly advocate the use of natural matrices to study these biotic interactions in order to avoid overestimation of Daphnia impact.					prevost, michele/HOC-8215-2023; Burnet, Jean-Baptiste/HKN-6662-2023; Cauchie, Henry-Michel/K-8123-2014	Cauchie, Henry-Michel/0000-0003-4780-6100; Burnet, Jean-Baptiste/0000-0002-6126-0338													1932-6203					FEB 8	2017	12	2							e0171705	10.1371/journal.pone.0171705	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0171705								28178322					WOS:000393712500061

Testate amoebae as proxies for mean annual waiter-table depth in Sphagnum-dominated peatlands of North America	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Peatland-inhabiting testate amoebae are sensitive indicators of substrate-moisture conditions and have increasingly been used in palaeohydrological studies. However, to improve accuracy of testate-amoeba-based hydrological inferences, baseline ecological data on rare taxa, a larger geographic network of calibration sites, and incorporation of long-term estimates of water-table depth are needed. Species-environment relationships at 369 sites from 31 peatlands in eastern North America were investigated. Long-term estimates of water-table depth were obtained using the method of polyvinyl (PVC) tape-discolouration. Transfer functions were developed using a variety of models, and validated through jackknifing techniques and with an independent dataset where water-table depths were directly measured throughout the growing season. Results indicate that mean annual water-table depth can be inferred from testate amoeba assemblages with a mean error of 6 to 8 cm, although there is a slight systematic bias. All transfer function models performed similarly and produced similar reconstructions on a fossil sequence. In a preliminary effort towards development of a comprehensive North American calibration dataset, data from this study were combined with previous studies in Michigan and the Rocky Mountains (n = 650). This combined dataset had slightly larger mean errors of prediction (8-9 cm) but includes data for several rare taxa. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Contrasting patterns of 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) vs. geosmin across depth in a drinking water reservoir are mediated by cyanobacteria and actinobacteria	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Taste and odor episodes caused by off-flavor secondary metabolites, such as 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) and geosmin, pose one of the greatest challenges for drinking water utilities around the world. The prevalence of these compounds is predicted to increase in the future as a function of nutrient enrichment and elevated temperatures of surface drinking water sources. We conducted a manipulative field experiment in a drinking water reservoir to elucidate patterns for two taste and odor compounds, MIB and geosmin, as well as two taxa known to produce these compounds, phytoplankton (more specifically, cyanobacteria) and actinobacteria, across different depths in response to nutrient enrichment with two common dissolved nitrogen forms, organic urea or inorganic nitrate. In general, we found that MIB levels increased by greater than 250% with nutrient enrichment mediated by increased phytoplankton biomass. However, the effect of the fertilization treatments on MIB decreased with depth with a 35% reduction at 7 m versus 1.5 m. In contrast, geosmin levels reached a maximum at the lowest measured depth (7 m), were unaffected by the fertilization treatments, and followed a similar pattern to the abundance of actinobacteria. Thus, our data suggest that the positive response of phytoplankton (e.g., cyanobacteria, such as Oscillatoria species) to the fertilization treatments is likely responsible for increased MIB, while geosmin concentrations may be a function of actinobacteria-mediated decomposition in the hypolimnion in our study system.					; Choi, Jess/KEJ-3753-2024; Abebe, Ash/C-3681-2014	Choi, Jessie/0000-0002-2939-3528; Abebe, Ash/0000-0001-5759-2383; Wilson, Alan/0000-0003-1080-0354													0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2021	28	24					32005	32014		10.1007/s11356-021-12973-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-12973-z		FEB 2021						33620686					WOS:000621017700008

However, our understanding of the astronomical forcing pattern on halite formation at the sedimentary basin scale is still limited. Here, we present a halite-rich lacustrine record from the middle-late Eocene through the early Oligocene of the Dawenkou Formation in the Huanggang Basin, Eastern China. A similar to 6.5-Myr-long floating astronomical time scale was constructed based on a 405-kyr orbital eccentricity cycle tuning of gamma-ray (GR) series measured from the Upper and Middle members of the Dawenkou Formation. Our results indicate that halite intervals in the Middle Member of the Dawenkou Formation correspond well with the minima of the 100 kyr orbital eccentricity, suggesting the short eccentricity-induced climatic cycles forcing of halite formation by impact on seasonal contrasts. Our work provides essential context for understanding the pattern of halite deposits from the aspect of climate cycles at the sedimentary basin scale.

Sources of solutes and carbon cycling in perennially ice-covered Lake Untersee, Antarctica	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Perennially ice-covered lakes that host benthic microbial ecosystems are present in many regions of Antarctica. Lake Untersee is an ultra-oligotrophic lake that is substantially different from any other lakes on the continent as it does not develop a seasonal moat and therefore shares similarities to sub-glacial lakes where they are sealed to the atmosphere. Here, we determine the source of major solutes and carbon to Lake Untersee, evaluate the carbon cycling and assess the metabolic functioning of microbial mats using an isotope geochemistry approach. The findings suggest that the glacial meltwater recharging the closed-basin and well-sealed Lake Untersee largely determines the major solute chemistry of the oxic water column with plagioclase and alumino-silicate weathering contributing < 5% of the Ca2+-Na+ solutes to the lake. The TIC concentration in the lake is very low and is sourced from melting of glacial ice and direct release of occluded CO2 gases into the water column. The comparison of delta C-13(TIC) of the oxic lake waters with the delta C-13 in the top microbial mat layer show no fractionation due to non-discriminating photosynthetic fixation of HCO3- in the high pH and carbon-starved water. The C-14 results indicate that phototrophs are also fixing respired CO2 from heterotrophic metabolism of the underlying microbial mats layers. The findings provide insights into the development of collaboration in carbon partitioning within the microbial mats to support their growth in a carbon-starved ecosystem.					; Andersen, Dale/B-4816-2013	Faucher, Benoit/0000-0002-3954-8386; Lacelle, Denis/0000-0002-6691-8717; 													2045-2322					JUL 23	2020	10	1							12290	10.1038/s41598-020-69116-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-69116-6								32704043					WOS:000556697300009

Vegetation responses to late Holocene climate changes in an Andean forest	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												A paleoecological record from Lake Palotoa (1370 m elevation) in the Andean foothills of Peru spans the last 3800 years. Lake Palotoa lies near the modern cloud base in a location sensitive to changes in atmospheric moisture. In many areas, these forests have been destroyed, but Lake Palotoa shows no sign of human occupation today or in the past. The modern forest surrounding the lake is dominated by the Andean palm, Dictyocaryum lamarckianum, which is also the most abundant taxon in the fossil pollen record. Fossil pollen data show the vegetation assemblages have not experienced strong compositional changes in the late Holocene. Global-scale climatic events such as the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and the Little Ice Age (LIA) are identified within the record, though the vegetation responses are subtle. Hedyosmum and Sloanea pollen percentages increase near the onset of the MCA and may reflect decreased seasonality. The LIA coincides with increased Hedyosmum pollen percentages, and increases in Clethra and Begonia, two elements that tend to occupy forests now found at higher elevations. Our findings demonstrate the stability of montane forest systems to natural Holocene climate change.

This reserve comprises a set of temporary lakes, often saline, where water level fluctuates seasonally. Water inflows come mainly from direct precipitation and runoff of small lake watersheds. Most of these lakes lack surface outlets and behave as endorheic systems, where water withdrawal is mainly due to evaporation, causing salt accumulation in the lake beds. Remote sensing was used to estimate the temporal variation of the flooded area in these lakes and their associated hydrological patterns related to the seasonality of precipitation and evapotranspiration. Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite images for the reference period 2013-2015 were jointly used with ground-truth datasets. Several inverse modeling methods, such as two-band and multispectral indices, single-band threshold, classification methods, artificial neural network, support vector machine and genetic programming, were applied to retrieve information on the variation of the flooded areas. Results were compared to ground-truth data, and the classification errors were evaluated by means of the kappa coefficient. Comparative analyses demonstrated that the genetic programming approach yielded the best results, with a kappa value of 0.98 and a total error of omission-commission of 2%. The dependence of the variations in the water-covered area on precipitation and evaporation was also investigated. The results show the potential of the tested techniques to monitor the hydrological patterns of temporary lakes in semiarid areas, which might be useful for management strategy-linked lake conservation and specifically to accomplish the goals of both the European Water Framework Directive and the Habitats Directive.

DGGE and real-time PCR techniques were conducted to describe the distributions of the cyanobacterial community in the water and their relationship with the development of blooms over one year. In addition, the vertical distributions of cyanobacterial communities in the sediment were determined. The results suggested that the diversity of the cyanobacterial population in the pelagic water was quite low from July to September, and that Microcystis and Synechococcus were the two most dominant cyanobacteria. The copy number of Synechococcus was approximately one order of magnitude higher than that of Microcystis during the blooming seasons (June-September), whereas, with the exception of December, the copy number of Microcystis was slightly higher than that of Synechococcus during the non-bloom seasons. The highest cyanobacterial diversity was observed in the sediment at 20-25 cm. Furthermore, the amount of Synechococcus was higher than that of Micro cystis in the upper layers of the sediment (0-20 cm), whereas the amount of Microcystis was higher than that of Synechococcus in samples collected from the deeper layers (20-30 cm).

The seasonality of flooding or beaching of the littoral area affects nutrient cycling, redox gradients in sediments, and life cycles of aquatic organisms. Despite the ecological importance of water level fluctuations, we still lack a method that assesses water levels in the context of hydropower operations. Water levels in reservoirs are influenced by the operator of a hydropower plant, who discharges water through the turbines or stores water in the reservoir, in a fashion that maximizes profit. This rationale governs the seasonal operation scheme and hence determines the water levels within the boundaries of the reservoir's water balance. For progress towards a sustainable development of hydropower, the benefits of this form of electricity generation have to be weighed against the possible detrimental effects of the anthropogenic water level fluctuations. We developed a hydro-economic model that combines an economic optimization function with hydrological estimators of the water balance of a reservoir. Applying this model allowed us to accurately predict water level fluctuations in a reservoir. The hydro-economic model also allowed for scenario calculation of how water levels change with climate change scenarios and with a change in operating scheme of the reservoir (increase in turbine capacity). Further model development will enable the consideration of a variety of additional parameters, such as water withdrawal for irrigation, drinking water supply, or altered energy policies. This advances our ability to sustainably manage water resources that must meet both economic and environmental demands.

J	Gross, A; Nishri, A; Angert, A				Gross, Avner; Nishri, Ami; Angert, Alon			Use of Phosphate Oxygen Isotopes for Identifying Atmospheric-P Sources: A Case Study at Lake Kinneret	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The input of phosphorus (P) through atmospheric deposition can be a major source of P to fresh water bodies and may strongly affect their biogeochemistry. In Lake Kinneret (LK), northern Israel, dust deposition provides a significant fraction of the bioavailable P input. Here, we demonstrate that the oxygen isotopic composition of resin-extractable inorganic phosphate (delta O-18(p)) in dust particles can be used to identify the phosphate source. Samples of soils with both natural vegetation and agricultural cover were collected upwind of LK and found to have distinct delta O-18(p) value ranges (17.4-18.2 parts per thousand and 19.3-22.1 parts per thousand, respectively). The delta O-18(p) values for dust, collected continuously over LK during June 2011 to March 2012, were in the same range as agricultural soils. The dust concentration in the air decreased from the dry to the wet season and was correlated with a decrease in P concentration in air, yet no correlation was found between these parameters and dust delta O-18(p). Dust deposited during short-term desert dust events was characterized by a combination of high delta O-18(p) values ranging from 22.2 parts per thousand to 22.7 parts per thousand and high concentrations of dust in the air. The data we present demonstrates a new application of delta O-18(p) measurements for direct estimation of dust-P sources to lakes, as well as the potential for tracing dust-P on larger scales.

Exploring the dynamics in the associated factors is essential for water pollution management and control. GIS interpolation, principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate statistical techniques were used to identify the main pollution sources in different areas of Honghu Lake. The results indicate that the spatial distribution of the concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphate (TP), ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), and permanganate index (CODMn) have similar characteristics and that their values gradually increased from south to north during the three seasons in Honghu Lake. The major influencing factors of water quality varied across the different areas and seasons. The relatively high concentrations of TN and TP, which might limit the growth of submerged aquatic plants, were mainly caused by anthropogenic factors. Our work suggests that spatial analyses combined with PCA are useful for investigating the factors that influence water quality and submerged aquatic plant biomass in different areas of a lake. These findings provide sound information for the future water quality management of the lake or even the entire lake basin.					fang, qingqing/GZK-4330-2022	LI, KUN/0000-0003-2855-2280														2073-4441				SEP	2017	9	9							707	10.3390/w9090707	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w9090707													WOS:000411567200080

Variations in 11 water quality parameters from 15 sampling sites in Poyang Lake were investigated from 2009 to 2012. An integrative fuzzy variable evaluation (IFVE) model based on fuzzy theory and variable weights was developed to measure variations in water quality. Results showed that: 1) only chlorophyll-a concentration and Secchi depth differed significantly among the 15 sampling sites (P < 0.01), whereas the 11 water quality parameters under investigation differed significantly throughout the seasons (P < 0.01). The annual variations of all water quality variables except for temperature, electrical conductivity, suspended solids and total phosphorus were considerable (P < 0.05). 2) The IFVE model was reasonable and flexible in evaluating water quality status and any possible 'bucket effect'. The model fully considered the influences of extremely poor indices on overall water quality. 3) A spatial analysis indicated that anthropogenic activities (particularly industrial sewage and dredging) and lake bed topography might directly affect water quality in Poyang Lake. Meanwhile, hydrological status and sewage discharged into the lake might be responsible for seasonal water quality variations.

Glacial lake mapping with very high resolution satellite SAR data	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Floods resulting from the outbursts of glacial lakes are among the most far-reaching disasters in high mountain regions. Glacial lakes are typically located in remote areas and space-borne remote sensing data are an important source of information about the occurrence and development of such lakes. Here we show that very high resolution satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data can be employed for reliably mapping glacial lakes. Results in the Alps, Pamir and Himalaya using Ten-aSAR-X and Radarsat-2 data are discussed in comparison to in-situ information, and high-resolution satellite optical and radar imagery. The performance of the satellite SAR data is best during the snow- and ice-free season. In the broader perspective of hazard management, the detection of glacial lakes and the monitoring of their changes from very high-resolution satellite SAR intensity images contributes to the initial assessment of hazards related to glacial lakes, but a more integrated, multi-level approach needs also to include other relevant information such as glacier outlines and outline changes or the identification of unstable slopes above the lake and the surrounding area, information types to which SAR analysis techniques can also contribute.					; Kääb, Andreas/AAG-8769-2020	Joshi, Sharad Prasad/0000-0001-9811-8370; Kaab, Andreas/0000-0002-6017-6564													1561-8633						2012	12	8					2487	2498		10.5194/nhess-12-2487-2012	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/nhess-12-2487-2012													WOS:000309616500005

In this paper, hydrogen (D) and oxygen (O-18) isotope techniques were used in the mainstream and Zhuyi Bay (ZYB) of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) during the wet and dry seasons in 2015. It revealed that (1) Precipitation was the main source of stream flow compared to the TGR water line with meteoric water line of the Yangtse River basin; (2) The D and O-18 values exhibited a toward lighter-heavier' trend along mainstream due to the continuous evaporation effect in the runoff direction, and the fluctuations reflected incoming water from the nearest tributaries. The general trend of d-excess increased with increasing distance from the Three Gorges Dam, which indicated that kinetic fractionation was an important process affecting the isotopic composition. The enrichment effect of isotopes was found in the downstream of TGR; (3) Water mass from the TGR mainstream flowed backward to the confluence zone of ZYB via the middle and bottom layers in the dry season, whereas in the wet season, water reversed through the upper-middle layers due to thermal density flows. This study described and demonstrated that the water cycle of TGR was driven by natural environmental variability and operational system, which will provide valuable information for the water resource management and for controlling the algal blooms in the future.					; Hu, Ming-Ming/AAX-4704-2020; 包, 宇飞/IUO-0856-2023	Cheng, Yao/0000-0001-5739-7924; Wang, Yuchun/0000-0002-7243-353X; 													2073-4441					MAY	2018	10	5							563	10.3390/w10050563	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10050563													WOS:000435196700029

We carried out samplings of three habitats at eight sites located in the Lake Baiyangdian that is strongly influenced by wastewater discharge (Sites 1 and 2), aquaculture and densely populated villages (Sites 3, 6, and 8), and the least disturbed (Sites 4, 5, and 7). Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, Hg, Cd, and Cr were determined in these samples, and the periphyton community was simultaneously studied. The contamination factor (C (f) (i) ) was estimated for every metal as the ratio between pre-industrial records from sediments (C (n) (i) ) and present concentration values (C (i) ), and the individual potential risk (E (r) (i) ) was calculated by multiply the toxic response factor (Tr (i) ) and C (f) (i) for a given substance were based on Hakanson's methodology. The RI was obtained for each sampling site by summing the values of E (r) (i) first and the average was calculated across the sampling sites. The results showed that the RI for all three habitats was lower than 94, and they are in decreasing order: wastewater discharge, aquaculture and densely populated villages, and the least anthropogenic impacted. When the three sampling seasons were compared, August appeared to show the highest risk, followed by April and November. The RI values showed negative correlations (r = -0.444 to -0.851, p < 0.05) with the structural and functional metrics. The best correlation was detected between chlorophyll c/chlorophyll a (Chl c/a) ratio and E (r) (i) Hg (r = -0.851, p < 0.01).

Drainage modification and agricultural development in southern Florida transport sediments and nutrients from watershed agricultural areas to Lake Okeechobee. As a result of development around Lake Okeechobee and the estuaries that are connected to Lake Okeechobee, estuarine conditions have also been adversely impacted, resulting in salinity and nutrient fluctuations. The measurement of water turbidity in lacustrine and estuarine ecosystems allows researchers to understand important factors such as light limitation and the potential release of nutrients from re-suspended sediments. Based on a strong correlation between water turbidity and normalized water-leaving radiance at the near-infrared (NIR) band (nL(omega)(869)), a new satellite water turbidity algorithm has been developed for Lake Okeechobee. This study has shown important applications with satellite-measured nL(omega)(869) data for water quality monitoring and measurements for turbid inland lakes. MODIS-Aqua-measured water property data are derived using the shortwave infrared (SWIR)-based atmospheric correction algorithm in order to remotely obtain synoptic turbidity data in Lake Okeechobee and normalized water-leaving radiance using the red band (nL(omega)(645)) in the Caloosahatchee and St. Lucie estuaries. We found varied, but distinct seasonal, spatial, and event driven turbidity trends in Lake Okeechobee and the Caloosahatchee and St. Lucie estuary regions. Wind waves and hurricanes have the largest influence on turbidity trends in Lake Okeechobee, while tides, currents, wind waves, and hurricanes influence the Caloosahatchee and St. Lucie estuarine areas.

Distant Effects of a Recurving Tropical Cyclone on Rainfall in a Midlatitude Convective System: A High-Impact Predecessor Rain Event	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Recent research has identified predecessor rain events (PREs), which are mesoscale regions of heavy rainfall that occur similar to 1000 km poleward and downshear of recurving tropical cyclones (TCs). PREs typically occur 24-36 h prior to the arrival of the main rain shield associated with the TC, and frequently result in damaging flooding. A distinguishing feature of a PRE is that it is enhanced by a broad region of deep tropical moisture directly associated with the TC that is transported well poleward ahead of the TC. This study will quantify the effects of the tropical moisture from one TC on a record-breaking rain and flood event over the northern Great Plains and southern Great Lakes region on 18-19 August 2007. In this event, which occurred ahead of TC Erin, a southerly stream of deep tropical moisture (precipitable water values > 50 mm) moved poleward and intersected a northwest-southeast-oriented quasi-stationary baroclinic zone beneath the equatorward entrance region of an upper-level jet streak. A slow-moving mesoscale convective system (MCS) developed and produced widespread heavy rainfall, with local amounts exceeding 380 mm that resulted in historic flooding in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Observations and numerical simulations using the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting model (ARW-WRF) indicate that low-level frontogenesis was maximized during the overnight hours of 19 August 2007 and provided the forcing for vigorous ascent during the mature stage of the PRE. A control simulation, which included the poleward transport of TC Erin-related moisture, reproduced the extreme rainfall amounts, although the simulated rainfall was displaced from where it was observed. A sensitivity simulation in which the moisture associated with TC Erin was removed (referred to as "NOPLUME") shows reduced convective available potential energy (CAPE) in the inflow region of the PRE and a less vigorous MCS. In all, there was an approximately 50% reduction in the maximum precipitation amount and a 25% reduction in the total precipitation from the control simulation to the NOPLUME run. Or, considered in the context of rainfall enhancement by the Erin-related moisture, there was a near doubling of the maximum amount and a 33% increase in the total rainfall. The extent of these differences underscores the importance of moisture originating from TC Erin in transforming a heavy rain event into a high-impact, record-breaking rain event.

This study integrated water-stable isotopes and hydrogeochemical species to examine hydrogeochemical processes during groundwater recharge and evolution in the Lake Malawi basin aquifer systems. The findings provide insights into groundwater source provenance, with non-evaporated modern precipitation dominating recharge inputs. Grouped hydrochemical facies exhibit five groundwater water types, prominently featuring Ca-Mg-HCO3. Modelled hydrogeochemical data underscore dominant silicate dissolution reactions with the likely precipitation of calcite and/or high-Mg dolomitic carbonate constrained by ion exchange. Isotope hydrology reinforces water resource system conceptualisation. Coupled isotopic-hydrogeochemical lines of evidence reveal a discernible spatial-seasonal inhomogeneity in groundwater chemical character, revealing a complex interplay of meteoric water input, evaporative effects, recharge processes, and mixing dynamics. Findings show that measurable nitrate across Malawi highlights a widespread human impact on groundwater quality and an urgent need for detailed modelling to predict future trends of nitrate in groundwater with respect to extensive fertiliser use and an ever-increasing number of pit latrines and septic systems arising from rapid population growth. This study not only refined the Lake Malawi basin aquifer systems conceptualisation but also provided isotopic evidence of groundwater and lake water mixing. This study sets a base for groundwater management and policy decisions in support of the Integrated Water Resources Management principles and Sustainable Development Goal 6 objectives for groundwater sustainability in the transboundary Lake Malawi basin.					; Kalin, Robert/E-8620-2011; Kalin, Robert M/E-8620-2011	Chitsundi Banda, Limbikani/0000-0002-0449-5974; Kalin, Robert M/0000-0003-3768-3848														2073-4441				JUN	2024	16	11							1587	10.3390/w16111587	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16111587													WOS:001246879900001

The resulting smoke plumes can travel hundreds to thousands of kilometers, reflecting or scattering sunlight and depositing particles within ecosystems. Several key physical, chemical, and biological processes in lakes are controlled by factors affected by smoke. The spatial and temporal scales of lake exposure to smoke are extensive and under-recognized. We introduce the concept of the lake smoke-day, or the number of days any given lake is exposed to smoke in any given fire season, and quantify the total lake smoke-day exposure in North America from 2019 to 2021. Because smoke can be transported at continental to intercontinental scales, even regions that may not typically experience direct burning of landscapes by wildfire are at risk of smoke exposure. We found that 99.3% of North America was covered by smoke, affecting a total of 1,333,687 lakes >= 10 ha. An incredible 98.9% of lakes experienced at least 10 smoke-days a year, with 89.6% of lakes receiving over 30 lake smoke-days, and lakes in some regions experiencing up to 4 months of cumulative smoke-days. Herein we review the mechanisms through which smoke and ash can affect lakes by altering the amount and spectral composition of incoming solar radiation and depositing carbon, nutrients, or toxic compounds that could alter chemical conditions and impact biota. We develop a conceptual framework that synthesizes known and theoretical impacts of smoke on lakes to guide future research. Finally, we identify emerging research priorities that can help us better understand how lakes will be affected by smoke as wildfire activity increases due to climate change and other anthropogenic activities.

Satellite rainfall bias assessment for crop growth simulation-A case study of maize growth in Kenya	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												In this research, the performance of satellite rainfall estimates (SREs) for crop growth simulation was investigated. Rainfall products selected were CHIRPS 2.0, CMORPH 1.0, MSWEP 2.2, and RFE 2.0. In-situ rainfall from 20 stations within the Lake Victoria basin in Kenya served as reference. Rainfall products were evaluated for onset days, rainfall depths, dry spells, and rainfall occurrence for four crop growth stages. Assessment was on a daily time step for the period 2012-2018 and on a point-to-pixel basis. Results showed that SREs exhibit large variation in timing of rainfall arrival. SREs exhibited largest interannual and spatial spreads in representing dry spell length during the flowering stage with CMORPH and CHIRPS showing best and weakest results, respectively. Bias of SREs in representing dry spells was smaller during early growth stages. Detecting rainfall occurrence by the SREs weakened as the growing season progressed. MSWEP, followed by RFE2, produced the best results in detecting rainfall events, while falsely detected rainfall was frequent in CHIRPS, particularly in later growth stages. SREs generally performed better during a wet than a dry growing season. SREs indicated less bias in rainfall depths during the early stages of crop growth but deteriorated at later stages. MSWEP and CMORPH exhibited the least and highest interannual spread in relative bias, respectively. In associating biases to severe and extreme water stress, based on crop water requirement satisfaction index, effects were more prevailing in the ripening than flowering stages. Findings of this study suggest that SREs can serve as input to crop growth modelling, but validation of SREs with rain gauge observed counterparts is essential.

Evaluating the impacts of foreshore sand and birds on microbiological contamination at a freshwater beach	WATER RESEARCH												Beaches along the Great Lakes shorelines are important recreational and economic resources. However, contamination at the beaches can threaten their usage during the swimming season, potentially resulting in beach closures and/or advisories. Thus, understanding the dynamics that control nearshore water quality is integral to effective beach management. There have been significant improvements in this effort, including incorporating modeling (empirical, mechanistic) in recent years. Mechanistic modeling frameworks can contribute to this understanding of dynamics by determining sources and interactions that substantially impact fecal indicator bacteria concentrations, an index routinely used in water quality monitoring programs. To simulate E. coli concentrations at Jeorse Park beaches in southwest Lake Michigan, a coupled hydrodynamic and wave-current interaction model was developed that progressively added contaminant sources from river inputs, avian presence, bacteria-sediment interactions, and bacteria-sand-sediment interactions. Results indicated that riverine inputs affected E. coli concentrations at Jeorse Park beaches only marginally, while avian, shoreline sand, and sediment sources were much more substantial drivers of E. coli contamination at the beach. By including avian and riverine inputs, as well as bacteria-sand-sediment interactions at the beach, models can reasonably capture the variability in observed E. coli concentrations in nearshore water and bed sediments at Jeorse Park beaches. Consequently, it will be crucial to consider avian contamination sources and water-sand-sediment interactions in effective management of the beach for public health and as a recreational resource and to extend these findings to similar beaches affected by shoreline embayment.

Previous flood event-related risk assessments either hardly consider the context in which water diversion encounters flood events or hardly consider the physical process, stochastic analysis and multivariate interactions of flood event characteristics simultaneously, thereby resulting in a less reliable assessment of flood event-related risk. To resolve this limitation, a copula-coupled hydrodynamic risk assessment model (CHRAM) is proposed to characterize the physical, multivariate, and stochastic nature of risk, improving the accuracy of risk assessment. In this study, CHRAM is capable of accurately quantifying flood event-related risks (i.e., flood risk and ecological risk) of the Nansi Lake Basin in the flood season under the operation of the eastern route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project in China. Our findings revealed that the total flood volume (R-sum) and duration (T-d) of flood events were significantly sensitive characteristic indexes for flood risk and ecological risk. In addition, the security domains of flood risk (R-sum < 35 mm and T-d < 23 d) and ecological risk (R-sum < 50 mm and T-d < 27 d) were determined based on the analysis of the relationship between sensitive characteristic indexes and risk indicators. The results also showed that the impact of T-d on flood risk, ecological risk and flood-ecological combined risk was 3-14 times greater than the impact of R-sum. The occurrence probability of flood-ecological combined risk was smaller than that of flood risk but greater than that of ecological risk, with the corresponding maximum risk probabilities of 11.2%, 36.5%, and 4.7%, respectively. This study extends the current knowledge about risk assessment in IRLS and is beneficial to instruct the management of projects for similar systems.					yang, ray/JOJ-7331-2023; ZHANG, YU/IRZ-5949-2023; Zhang, Chen/G-9555-2016	Zhang, Chen/0000-0003-3212-4270													0022-1694	1879-2707				DEC	2021	603		C						127042	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.127042	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.127042		OCT 2021											WOS:000711024300016

Multi-scale study of the role of the biofilm in the formation of minerals and fabrics in calcareous tufa	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Three sites of actively-forming tufa, two barrage systems and one terraced slope system, located in northern Calabria (Italy) and in north-east England, have been investigated with the purpose of studying the neoformed carbonate minerals at the interface with the organic components that compose the associated biofilms. Several depositional facies are distinguished, notably peloidal to aphanitic, laminar and dendrolitic fabrics composed of micrite and microsparite, and isolated botryoids and continuous crusts composed of sparite. All fabrics occurring in all depositional facies are organized into layers with a more or less well-developed seasonal cyclicity. Low-Mg calcite precipitates more or less constantly during all seasons within the active depositional zone. This extends for a few hundred microns upon the external surface of the deposits, where the biofilm occurs. The latter is composed of a heterogeneous community of green algae, filamentous cyanobacteria and other types of prokaryotes, Actinobacteria and fungi, with a variable amount of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Porous micro-columns (50 to 150 mu m in size), separated by interstitial spaces, characterize the active depositional zone. Here precipitation always begins with organomineral nanospheres (10 to 20 nm diameter), both along the external surfaces and within internal cavities of the micro-columns, by replacing degraded organic matter, and at point-sites suspended within living cyanobacterial tufts along the external surface of their sheaths, indicating that the biological activities of the biofilm are crucial, with its living organisms and non-living organic matter. Organomineral nanospheres successively agglutinate to form irregular to rod-shaped crystal aggregates, 100-200 nm in size, that with their further agglutination create two basic types of larger, more ordered, crystal structure: polyhedrons in the range of 1-2 mu m, and minute triads of calcite fibres varying in length from similar to 0.4 (short triads) to similar to 1 mu m (long triads). Basic crystal structures coalesce to form larger crystals (mainly tetrahedrons ;tens of microns in size) that constitute the micro-columns. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Cable Bacteria Activity Modulates Arsenic Release From Sediments in a Seasonally Hypoxic Marine Basin	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Eutrophication and global change are increasing the occurrence of seasonal hypoxia (bottom-water oxygen concentration <63 mu M) in coastal systems worldwide. In extreme cases, the bottom water can become completely anoxic, allowing sulfide to escape from the sediments and leading to the development of bottom-water euxinia. In seasonally hypoxic coastal basins, electrogenic sulfur oxidation by long, filamentous cable bacteria has been shown to stimulate the formation of an iron oxide layer near the sediment-water interface, while the bottom waters are oxygenated. Upon the development of bottom-water anoxia, this iron oxide "firewall" prevents the sedimentary release of sulfide. Iron oxides also act as an adsorption trap for elements such as arsenic. Arsenic is a toxic trace metal, and its release from sediments can have a negative impact on marine ecosystems. Yet, it is currently unknown how electrogenic sulfur oxidation impacts arsenic cycling in seasonally hypoxic basins. In this study, we presented results from a seasonal field study of an uncontaminated marine lake, complemented with a long-term sediment core incubation experiment, which reveals that cable bacteria have a strong impact on the arsenic cycle in a seasonally hypoxic system. Electrogenic sulfur oxidation significantly modulates the arsenic fluxes over a seasonal time scale by enriching arsenic in the iron oxide layer near the sediment-water interface in the oxic period and pulse-releasing arsenic during the anoxic period. Fluxes as large as 20 mu mol m(-2) day(-1) were measured, which are comparable to As fluxes reported from highly contaminated sediments. Since cable bacteria are recognized as active components of the microbial community in seasonally hypoxic systems worldwide, this seasonal amplification of arsenic fluxes is likely a widespread phenomenon.

In this study, otolith microstructure analysis was performed on 318 young Gymnocypris selincuoensis (99 larvae and 219 juveniles) collected from Lake Siling Co from May 2010 to June 2011. The time of the first annulus formation of otoliths in juveniles was confirmed. The results showed that lapilli were the most suitable otoliths for age determination of G. selincuoensis among the three pairs of otoliths. By comparing the microstructure features of the otolith edge of the wild juveniles before and after overwintering, the first annulus formation time of the lapilli of the 2010 generation of juveniles was confirmed to be from April 17 to May 3, 2011 using the daily increment analysis. On the lapillus, an opaque band was formed from mid-April through early November (the growing season of G. selincuoensis), and a translucent band (i.e., the annulus) was formed from early November to mid-April of the following year (the slow growth stage). The first daily increment outside of the first annulus was formed at an average water temperature of 1.69 degrees C, which is the lowest reported water temperature at which fish were able to form daily increments. Our proposed method to determine the time of the first annulus formation through otolith daily increment analysis provides a referential way for confirming annulus formation in fish. The high temporal resolution (at day level) of this method in estimating annulus formation time highlights its application potentials in studies of growing season length estimation and fish response to water temperature change, which can assist with fish population management and conservation challenges arising from climate and environmental changes.

In this study, we investigated CH 4 concentration in two connected Tibetan Plateau lakes, Lake Keluke (an open freshwater lake) and Lake Tuosu (a closed saline lake), through in -situ continuous measurements taken in different months from 2021 to 2023. The results show substantial spatial and seasonal variations in CH 4 concentrations in the two lakes, while the CH 4 concentrations in Lake Keluke are consistently higher than those in Lake Tuosu for each month. Despite sharing similar environmental conditions due to connected (e.g. pH, water temperature, dissolved oxygen content, and total organic carbon content), the critical difference between the two lakes is their salinity. This implies that salinity is the critical factor contributing to the decrease in CH 4 concentrations in Lake Tuosu, possibly due to the changes in microbial species between freshwater and brackish/saline lakes. Additionally, to further validate the effect of salinity on CH 4 concentrations in lake water, we compared the CH 4 concentrations of 33 lakes (including 5 saline lakes and 28 freshwater lakes) from the Tibetan Plateau, Chinese Loess Plateau, and Yangtze Plain, and found that saline lakes consistently exhibit lower CH 4 concentrations (avg. 0.08 mu mol/L), while freshwater lakes generally display higher CH 4 concentrations (avg. 1.25 mu mol/L) with considerable fluctuations. Consequently, freshwater and saline lakes exhibit distinct CH 4 emissions, which could be used for more accurate estimation of global CH 4 emission from lakes.

In this way, it is possible to assess the stress tolerance of the system and thereby improve the possibilities for proper management. In this study, water quality parameters and the biomass of submerged macrophytes were examined monthly in two bays receiving contrast amounts of nutrient input of a large mesotrophic lake from August, 2011 to July, 2012. We found that effects of external nutrient input could not be explained by differences between the two bays in water quality parameters, such as total nitrogen, total phosphorus, chlorophyll a, light attenuation coefficient and water transparency (Secchi depth), but by the species composition and temporal variation of submerged vegetation. In the progress of eutrophication, the submerged macrophyte community changed from Potamogeton maackianus dominance to co-dominance of Ceratophyllum demersum and P. maackianus, and became more seasonally variable in biomass and coverage due to the shorter survivorship of C. demersum. We suggest that in the early stage of eutrophication, when submerged macrophytes are still abundant, water quality parameters should be coupled with monitoring of submerged vegetation to examine the effects of external nutrient loading on shallow lake ecosystems.					li, wei/LBI-1869-2024; Zhang, Xiaoling/OMM-2733-2025; l, hb/AAC-4898-2019; Xie, Ping/AAL-7532-2020														1866-6280	1866-6299				SEP	2015	74	5					3701	3708		10.1007/s12665-015-4202-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4202-4													WOS:000360401400003

In this study, we addressed the potential influence of fisheries co-management to increase fish abundance and fishing yields in the lower Tocantins River Basin (Brazilian Amazon), downstream from a large dam. We analyzed 590 fish landings (6.7 t of fish) from five fishing villages and 48 fish samples obtained using gillnets (10,378 fish from 101 species) in 12 floodplain lakes in four regions: two with incipient co-management and two unmanaged. The fish species richness did not differ among the regions, but the lakes in the regions that were co-managed had higher fish abundance (biomass and number of individuals) and a higher mean proportion of fish reproducing during the high water season. Fishers had higher catches per unit of effort in the co-managed regions than fishers in the non-managed regions. These results were also influenced by geographic factors (distance and accessibility of lakes), as fish biomass was higher in lakes that were distant from the main river and from the main city in the region. Managers should thus consider strategic selection of the geographic locations of managed sites, even in remote areas. However, the fish biomass sampled in lakes was more related to region than to the lakes' geographical location. Therefore, co-management has at least partially contributed to increased fish abundance and fishing yields in the studied region, through the protection of an important fish habitat (lakes).

Yet, the mechanisms regulating phytoplankton diversity in freshwater ecosystems are not fully understood, especially in peri-urban environments where anthropogenic pressures strongly impact the quality of aquatic ecosystems. To address this issue, we sampled the phytoplankton communities of 50 lakes in the Paris area (France) characterized by a large gradient of physico-chemical and catchment-scale characteristics. We used large phytoplankton datasets to describe phytoplankton diversity patterns and applied a machine-learning algorithm to test the degree to which species richness patterns are potentially controlled by environmental factors. Selected environmental factors were studied at two scales: the lake-scale (e.g. nutrients concentrations, water temperature, lake depth) and the catchment-scale (e.g. catchment, landscape and climate variables). Then, we used a variance partitioning approach to evaluate the interaction between lake-scale and catchment-scale variables in explaining local species richness. Finally, we analysed the residuals of predictive models to identify potential vectors of improvement of phytoplankton species richness predictive models. Lake-scale and catchment-scale drivers provided similar predictive accuracy of local species richness (R-2=0.458 and 0.424, respectively). Both models suggested that seasonal temperature variations and nutrient supply strongly modulate local species richness. Integrating lake-and catchment-scale predictors in a single predictive model did not provide increased predictive accuracy; therefore suggesting that the catchment-scale model probably explains observed species richness variations through the impact of catchment-scale variables on in-lake water quality characteristics. Models based on catchment characteristics, which include simple and easy to obtain variables, provide a meaningful way of predicting phytoplankton species richness in temperate lakes. This approach may prove useful and cost-effective for the management and conservation of aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

R.; Bezerra-Neto, Jose Fernandes			Importance of nutrients, organic matter and light availability on epilimnetic metabolic rates in a mesotrophic tropical lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Global changes, such as climate and land use alterations, are expected to affect freshwater ecosystems, modifying environmental conditions with ultimate effects on carbon and nutrient cycling. While effects of these changes have been the focus of several studies in temperate lakes, remarkably little effort has been dedicated to understanding the behaviour and responses of tropical lakes despite their importance in tropical environments. In a factorial mesocosm study conducted in a tropical lake, we investigated how changes in environmental conditions, such as additions of inorganic nutrients and allochthonous organic matter, and shading, affect gross primary production (GPP), community respiration (R) and net community production (NCP) rates, and the occurrence of GPP light saturation and photoinhibition. GPP rates in the mesocosms were enhanced by additions of inorganic nutrients (+NP) and organic matter (+C) and decreased with increasing mean light available (I). Apparent photoinhibition was pronounced in full light treatments (+L) without additions of nutrients (-NP) and organic matter (-C), occurring in 91% of the experimental days. This supports previous evidence of the importance of photoinhibition in the upper mixed layer of the lake, especially during nutrient depletion and high light availability in the warmer rainy season. The main factor affecting metabolic rates was nutrients (NP), followed by organic matter (C). Effect of light (L) and the interaction between C and L were also significant for GPP and R rates. Addition of allochthonous organic matter (+C) with a high content of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) stimulated GPP rates and reduced the occurrence of apparent photoinhibition and light saturation. This also increased R rates in the mesocosms. However, R was strongly coupled to GPP, indicating that changes in respiration were more related to autotrophic activity than to a direct and independent stimulation of heterotrophic communities. Our results strongly support recent evidence of the interactions between nutrients, organic matter and light conditions, which under a scenario of changes in the frequency and intensity of precipitation events and human-mediated changes in land use, may affect the magnitude, variability and balance of metabolic processes in the productive upper mixed layers of tropical lakes.

Biogeochemistry of natural ponds in agricultural landscape: Lessons learned from modeling a kettle hole in Northeast Germany	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Kettle holes, small shallow ponds of glacial origin, represent hotspots for biodiversity and biogeochemical cycling. They abound in the young moraine landscape of Northeast Germany, potentially modulating element fluxes in a region where intensive agriculture prevails. The Rittgarten kettle hole, with semi-permanent hydroperiod and a surrounding reed belt, can be considered as a representative case study for such systems. Aiming to provide insights into the biogeochemical processes driving nutrient and primary producer dynamics in the Rittgarten kettle hole, we developed a mechanistic model that simulates the carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and oxygen, phytoplankton, and free-floating macrophyte biomass dynamics. After model calibration and sensitivity analysis, our modeling exercise quantified the simulated nutrient fluxes associated with all the major biogeochemical processes considered by the model. Seasonality of nutrient concentrations, magnitude of primary productivity rates, and biogeochemical process characterization in the pond were reasonably reproduced by the model from July 2013 to July 2014. Our results suggest that the establishment of a phytoplankton community well-adapted to low light availability, together with the differential use of N and P from free-floating macrophytes and phytoplankton can explain their coexistence in kettle holes. Sediment nutrient release along with decomposition of decaying submerged macrophyte are essential drivers of internal nutrient cycling in kettle holes. Our results also suggest that the Rittgarten kettle hole act as a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere on an annual scale, which offers a testable hypothesis for kettle holes with structural and functional similarities. We conclude by discussing the need to shed light on the effects of water level fluctuations on nutrient dynamics and biological succession patterns, as well as the relative importance of external sources and internal nutrient recycling mechanisms.

Spatially Explicit, Regional-Scale Simulation of Lake Carbon Fluxes	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Lakes are areas of intense biogeochemical processing in the landscape, contributing significantly to the global carbon cycle despite their small areal coverage. However, current large-scale estimates of lake biogeochemical fluxes are all generated by multiplying a mean observed areal rate by regional or global lake surface area, which ignores important heterogeneous spatial and temporal processes that regulate lake carbon cycling. We have developed a process-based model that integrates core scientific knowledge in hydrology, biogeochemistry, and ecology that is specifically designed to be applied over large geographic regions to hindcast or forecast regional lake carbon fluxes. We used our model to simulate daily carbon fluxes and pools for 3,675 lakes in the Northern Highlands Lake District from 1980-2010 and produced spatial and seasonal patterns consistent with observations. Variabilities in lake carbon fluxes were well predicted by relatively simple hydrologic metrics, such as the fraction of hydrologic export as evaporation (FHEE). Overall, lakes with a high FHEE processed a greater percentage of carbon inputs in the simulations than lakes with a low FHEE, but low-FHEE lakes ultimately processed more total carbon because of greater carbon inputs. Large lakes with low FHEE and high external loading of dissolved inorganic carbon contributed most to total CO2 emissions for the Northern Highlands Lake District, and our model estimated that 78% of total CO2 emissions from lakes to the atmosphere originated from external loads of dissolved inorganic carbon. By better characterizing the unique biogeochemical processes for each individual lake, regional estimates of carbon fluxes are more accurately determined.					; Jones, Stuart/ABD-5264-2021; Bolster, Diogo/D-9667-2011	Zwart, Jacob/0000-0002-3870-405X; Jones, Stuart/0000-0003-4740-6721; Bolster, Diogo/0000-0003-3960-4090													0886-6236	1944-9224				SEP	2018	32	9					1276	1293		10.1002/2017GB005843	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017GB005843													WOS:000447281100002

The lake models used in the study range from a one-layer bulk model to finite-difference models with k-epsilon turbulence closures. All models tested proved to satisfactorily simulate the seasonal cycle of surface temperature in small Sparkling Lake (Wisconsin, USA). However, problems are encountered in representing vertical mixing through the lake thermocline and the evolution of the near-bottom temperature.

J	Opere, WM; John, M; Ombori, O				Opere, Wasonga Michael; John, Maingi; Ombori, Omwoyo			Occurrence of Enteric Viruses in Surface Water and the Relationship with Changes in Season and Physical Water Quality Dynamics	ADVANCES IN VIROLOGY												Environmental water quality issues have dominated global discourse and studies over the past five decades. Significant parameters of environmental water quality include changes in biological and physical parameters. Some of the biological parameters of significance include occurrence of enteric viruses. Enteric viruses can affect both human and animal's health by causing diseases such as gastrointestinal and respiratory infections. In this study, the relationship between the occurrence of enteric viruses with reference to adenoviruses and enteroviruses and the physical water quality characteristics was assessed from water samples collected from Lake Victoria (LV) in Kenya. In order to understand the dynamics of season driven enteric viruses' contamination of the lake waters, we additionally analysed seasonal behavior of the lake's catchment area in terms of rainfall effects. Physical quality parameters were measured on-site while viral analysis was carried out by molecular methods using the nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR). From 216 samples that were analysed for viral contamination, enteric viral genomes were discovered in 18 (8.3%) of the samples. Out of half of the samples (108) collected during the rainy season, enteric viral genomes were detected in 9.26% (10) while 8 (7.41%) samples tested positive from the other half of the samples (108) collected during the dry season. There was, however, no significant correlation noted between the physical water quality characteristics and the enteric viruses' occurrence. Neither wet season nor dry season was significantly associated with the prevalence of the viruses. In Lake Victoria waters, most of the samples had an average of physical water quality parameters that were within the range accepted by the World Health Organization (WHO) for surface waters with exemption of turbidity which was above the recommended 5 NTU as recorded from some sampling sites. Continuous and long-term surveillance of the lake water to accurately monitor the contaminants and possible correlation between chemical, physical, and biological characteristics is recommended. This would be important in continuous understanding of the hydrological characteristics changes of the lake for proper management of its quality with reference to the WHO standards. A multiple varied-sampling approach in different geographical regions during different seasons is recommended to establish the geographical distribution and relatedness to seasonal distribution patterns of the viruses. The data generated from this study will be useful in providing a basis for assessment of seasonally driven fecal pollution load of the lake and enteric virus contamination for proper management of the sanitary situation around the lake.					; Opere, Michael/AAZ-4304-2020	ombori, omwoyo/0000-0001-5353-467X; Opere, Michael/0000-0002-2351-2282													1687-8639	1687-8647				JUL 3	2020	2020								9062041	10.1155/2020/9062041	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/9062041								32695168					WOS:000552761500001

Caffeine concentrations in influents and effluents of Swiss wastewater treatment plants (WWTP's, 7-73 and 0.03-9.5 mug/L, respectively) indicated an efficient elimination of 81-99.9%. Corresponding loads in untreated wastewater showed small variations when normalized for the population discharging to the WWTPs (15.8 +/- 3.8 mg person(-1) d(-1)), reflecting a rather constant consumption. WWTP effluent loads were considerably lower (0.06 +/- 0.03 mg person(-1) d(-1)), apart from installations with low sludge age (less than or equal to5 d, loads up to 4.4 mg person(-1) d(-1)). Despite the efficient removal in most WWTPs, caffeine was ubiquitously found in Swiss lakes and rivers(6-250 ng/L, except for remote mountain lakes (<2 ng/L; analytical procedure for wastewater and natural waters: SPE, GCMS-SIM or GC-MS-MS-MRM, internal standard C-13(3)-labeled caffeine). Caffeine concentrations in lakes correlated with the anthropogenic burden by domestic wastewaters, demonstrating the suitability of caffeine as a marker. A mass balance for Greifensee revealed that;: approximate to1-4% of the wastewaters had been discharged without treatment, presumably on rainy days when the capacity of WWTPs had been exceeded. For Zurichsee, it could be shown that the monthly inputs of caffeine correlated with precipitation data. The depth- and seasonal-dependent concentrations in this lake were adequately rationalized by a numerical model considering flushing, biodegradation, and indirect photodegradation via HO. radicals as elimination processes and caffeine inputs as fitting variables.

N.; Rao, Lakshminarayana			Unravelling the reason for seasonality of foaming in sewage-fed urban lakes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Foaming surface waters are a global phenomenon but are understudied. Bellandur lake in India has gained international attention due to its foaming events, which occur seasonally after rainfall. This study investigates the seasonality of foaming and the sorption/desorption of surfactants onto sediment and suspended solids (SS). Results show that foaming lake sediment can contain as much as 3.4 g of anionic surfactant/kg of dry sediment, and its concentration was proportional to the organic matter (OM) content and surface area of the sediment sample. This is the first study to demonstrate the sorption capacity of SS in wastewater, which was found to be 53.5 +/- 4 mg surfactant/g SS. In contrast, only a maximum of 5.3 mgsurfactant was sorbed/g of sediment. The lake model analysis revealed that sorption is a first-order process and that surfactant sorption on SS and sediment is reversible. SS was found to desorb similar to 73 % of sorbed surfactant back to the bulk water, while sediment desorbed 33-61 % of sorbed surfactants proportional to their OM. Contrary to the common assumption, rain does not dilute the surfactant concentration but instead increases the foaming potential of lake water through desorption from SS.					; V, Ramachandra/Q-5982-2016; Das, Reshmi/KIE-7583-2024; Rao, Lakshminarayana/AAJ-9254-2020	Das, Reshmi/0000-0002-1051-4801; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				AUG 15	2023	886								164019	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164019		MAY 2023						37172839					WOS:001001319500001

Creating a Detailed Wetland Inventory with Sentinel-2 Time-Series Data and Google Earth Engine in the Prairie Pothole Region of Canada	REMOTE SENSING												Wetlands in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of Canada and the United States represent a unique mapping challenge. They are dynamic both seasonally and year-to-year, are very small, and frequently altered by human activity. Many efforts have been made to estimate the loss of these important habitats but a high-quality inventory of pothole wetlands is needed for data-driven conservation and management of these resources. Typical landcover classifications using one or two image dates from optical or Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Earth Observation (EO) systems often produce reasonable wetland inventories for less dynamic, forested landscapes, but will miss many of the temporary and seasonal wetlands in the PPR. Past studies have attempted to capture PPR wetland dynamics by using dense image stacks of optical or SAR data. We build upon previous work, using 2017-2020 Sentinel-2 imagery processed through the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform to capture seasonal flooding dynamics of wetlands in a prairie pothole wetland landscape in Alberta, Canada. Using 36 different image dates, wetland flood frequency (hydroperiod) was calculated by classifying water/flooding in each image date. This product along with the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) Canopy Height Model (CHM) was then used to generate a seven-class wetland inventory with wetlands classified as areas with seasonal but not permanent water/flooding. Overall accuracies of the resulting inventory were between 95% and 96% based on comparisons with local photo-interpreted inventories at the Canadian Wetland Classification System class level, while wetlands themselves were classified with approximately 70% accuracy. The high overall accuracy is due, in part, to a dominance of uplands in the PPR. This relatively simple method of classifying water through time generates reliable wetland maps but is only applicable to ecosystems with open/non-complex wetland types and may be highly sensitive to the timing of cloud-free optical imagery that captures peak wetland flooding (usually post snow melt). Based on this work, we suggest that expensive field or photo-interpretation training data may not be needed to map wetlands in the PPR as self-labeling of flooded and non-flooded areas in a few Sentinel-2 images is sufficient to classify water through time. Our approach demonstrates a framework for the operational mapping of small, dynamic PPR wetlands that relies on open-access EO data and does not require costly, independent training data. It is an important step towards the effective conservation and management of PPR wetlands, providing an efficient method for baseline and ongoing mapping in these dynamic environments.

Aiming at the difficulties of glacier identification, such as mountain and cloud shadow, cloud cover and seasonal snow cover in high altitude areas, this paper proposes a reflectivity difference index for identifying glaciers in shadow and glacial lakes and a multi-temporal minimum band ratio index for reducing the influence of snow cover. It establishes a new large-scale glacier extraction method (so-called Double RF) based on the random forest algorithm of Google Earth Engine (GEE) and applies it to the Tibetan Plateau. The verification results based on 30% sample points show that overall accuracies of the first and second classification of 96.04% and 90.75%, respectively, and Kappa coefficients of 0.92 and 0.83, respectively. Compared with the real glacier dataset, the percentage of correctly extracted glacier area of the total area of glacier dataset (PGD) was 84.07%, and the percentage of correctly extracted glacier area of the total area of extracted glacier (PGE) was 89.06%; the harmonic mean (HM) of the two was 86.49%. The extraction results were superior to the commonly used glacier extraction methods: the band ratio method based on median composite image (Median_Band) (HM = 79.47%), the band ratio method based on minimum composite image (Min_Band) (HM = 81.19%), the normalized difference snow cover index method based on median composite image (Median_NDSI) (HM = 83.48%), the normalized difference snow cover index method based on minimum composite image (Min_NDSI) (HM = 84.08%), the random forest method based on median composite image (Median_RF) (HM = 83.87%) and the random forest method based on minimum composite image (Min_RF) (HM = 85.36%). The new glacier extraction method constructed in this study could significantly improve the identification accuracy of glaciers under the influences of shadow, snow cover, cloud cover and debris. This study provides technical support for obtaining long-term glacier distribution data on the Tibetan Plateau and revealing the impact of climate warming on glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau.						zhou, guang sheng/0000-0001-6303-1275														2072-4292				JUL	2022	14	13							3084	10.3390/rs14133084	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14133084													WOS:000825665200001

However, while many water quality constituents in lakes and rivers are of overall interest, water temperature is a 'key' variable as temperature influences mixing within a waterbody, influences the acceptability of the habitat for flora and fauna, and serves as a guide to the general health of a stream. To enable the assessment, a physics-based, deterministic hydraulic and heat-balance modeling procedure using the combination of MIKE SHE, MIKE HYDRO and ECO Lab is described to assess heat transfer magnitudes in portions of the Credit River, Ontario. Changes in instream temperature regimes are examined, including both frequency and spatial extent, providing insights into the impacts of urbanization in terms of seasonal temperature shifts arising from land use changes. For flow and temperature regimes, Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE) values of 0.49 and 0.955 were achieved, respectively, for current threshold conditions. Durations of temperature increases from threshold levels indicate that land use changes from current agriculture conditions to urbanization may change stream water temperatures for 9% of the time by 1 degrees C, and 2% of the time by 2 degrees C for distances of 1000 m downstream, because of land use change from agriculture to low-density urbanization, and for 20% of the time by 1 degrees C, and 4% of the time by 2 degrees C at distances of 1000 m downstream with land use change to high-density urbanization. With climate change RCP 4.5 Scenario in 2050 (Base, for a Wet Year-2017), the continuous amount of time the stream water temperature remains at elevated temperatures of more than 3 degrees C (from 5000 m to 25,607 m from the most upstream point of Fletchers Creek) for a distance of 20,000 m is more than 13 h. These elevations in temperature may have serious implications for flora and fauna in the creek, particularly impacting the cold-water and mixed-water fish species.					; McBean, Edward/ABB-9732-2021	Murison, Lorna/0000-0002-4647-9841; 														2073-4441				JUL	2022	14	13							1994	10.3390/w14131994	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14131994													WOS:000825682900001

The present study (1) utilizes total gaseous mercury (TGM) measurements made around a former Hg-cell chlor-alkali plant (CAP) located in Pavlodar, Kazakhstan, and predicts the spatial distribution of Hg over its premises and the nearby city. It then (2) estimates the environmental repartition of Hg deposited by the CAP using three fugacity models of varying complexity: Level I, QWASI, and HERMES. Finally, it (3) predicts long-range Hg transport via forward trajectory-based cluster analysis. The atmospheric Hg levels measured in Pavlodar and around Lake Balkyldak were elevated: in the range of 1-37 ng/m(3) with an urban background level at 4.9 ng/m(3). Specifically, concentrations up to 37 ng/m(3) close to Lake Balkyldak and up to 22 ng/m(3) nearby the city's industrial zone (where the CAP was located) had been observed. Interpolation maps created using kriging also suggest these locations as the primary sources of atmospheric Hg in the city. The Level I fugacity model indicated that almost all of Hg is expected to end up in the atmosphere. The modeling results obtained using more complex QWASI and HERMES models showed that some significant quantity of Hg would still be associated with the sediments of Lake Balkyldak (a large wastewater discharge pond nearby the CAP). The forward trajectory-based cluster analysis method revealed the long-range atmospheric transportation routes and local, regional, and global impact zones. Furthermore, a source-receptor relationship using air transportation pathways to identify "areas of impact" was addressed. During both heating and non-heating seasons, the frequency-based analysis identified the distribution of Hg reaching the territories of Mongolia, northwest China, southwest Kazakhstan. The Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT-4) model forward trajectory analysis has confirmed similar patterns during heating and non-heating seasons, except with shorter impact distances during the non-heating period. Even though the CAP was closed more than 30 years ago and those past remediation efforts cleaned up the site, the residual Hg pollution seems significant and should be further investigated in different environmental media.					; Kismelyeva, Symbat/HPE-1304-2023; Inglezakis, Vassilis/F-8554-2013; Kumisbek, Aiganym/NOF-3826-2025	Inglezakis, Vassilis/0000-0002-0195-0417; Guney, Mert/0000-0003-4583-2671; Akimzhanova, Zhanel/0000-0003-3867-4839; Karaca, Ferhat/0000-0002-9604-9348; Kumisbek, Aiganym/0000-0003-4986-0522														2073-4433				FEB	2021	12	2							275	10.3390/atmos12020275	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos12020275													WOS:000622118500001

The monitoring data necessary to build the model were obtained from two multiparameter probes that were submerged in two locations in the Sulejow Reservoir. An ADCP current profiler was used to collect data for hydrodynamic model calibration and verification. Total error between computed and measured velocity was estimated at 10-15%. A high concentration of chlorophyll-a during the vegetation season of 2015 (0.02 mg/L) was coupled with high water temperature (above 25 degrees C) and low concentrations of biogenic compounds (phosphorus and nitrogen at 0.02 and 0.001 mg/L, respectively). In 2015, NO3-N was the limiting nutrient in the Sulejow Reservoir. Maximum growth of algae was observed in June and July 2015 (0.02 mg/L chla) along the entire length of the reservoir; algae bloom volume reduction was observed in September (0.004 mg/L chla). Proposed scenarios for nutrient reduction-50% reduction of phosphate-phosphorus (PO4-P) and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) from agriculture areas as well as 50% reduction of discharges from septic tanks-led to a considerable reduction of nutrient concentrations in the reservoir waters; it additionally favors reducing the concentration of chlorophyll-a. The obtained results indicate that these sources of pollutants are mainly responsible for the poor water quality status of the reservoir and more intensive eutrophication phenomena.

Cliff-nesting seabirds influence production and sediment chemistry of lakes situated above their colony	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Seabirds that congregate in large numbers during the breeding season concentrate marine-derived nutrients to their terrestrial nesting sites, and these nutrients disperse and enhance production in nearby terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. In the Canadian Arctic, large seabird colonies (>100,000 breeding pairs) nest on cliff faces that drain directly in the ocean, ultimately returning the nutrients back to the marine environment from which they were derived. However, strong winds blowing up cliff faces could transport nutrients up in elevation and onto surrounding terrestrial and aquatic environments. Here, we assess the degree to which seabird nutrients and metals have been delivered to coastal lakes near Hudson Strait (Nunavut, Canada) over the past century. Three lakes located at a higher elevation and increasing distance from a thick-billed murre (Uria lomvia) colony (similar to 400,000 breeding pairs) were sampled for surface water chemistry. In addition, algal assemblages, nitrogen isotopes, and metal/metalloids were analyzed in four dated sediment cores. Elevated nutrients and major ions, as well as an enriched delta N-15 signature in the sediment cores, were measured in the lake <100 m from the cliff, whilst no comparable changes were recorded in lakes >1 km from the seabird colony. In contrast, similar oligo-trophic and benthic diatom assemblages were identified in all three lakes, suggesting that diatoms were not influenced by enhanced nutrient inputs in this Arctic environment. Chemical tracers (e.g., total mercury) and algal assemblages in the lake near the colony suggest climate Warming since similar to 1950 was the most likely driver of limnological changes, but this effect was muted in the more distant lakes. These pronounced changes in the sea-bird-impacted lake suggest that, with warming air temperatures and diminished lake ice cover, longer growing seasons may allow for aquatic organisms to more fully exploit the seabird nutrient subsidies.

Deposition History of Brominated Flame Retardant Compounds in an Ice Core from Holtedahlfonna, Svalbard, Norway	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Brominated flame retardants (BFRs) have been found in Arctic wildlife, lake sediment, and air. To identify the atmospheric BFR deposition history on Svalbard, Norway, we analyzed 19 BFRs, including hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)ethane (BTBPE), decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE), pentabromoethylbenzene (PBEB), and 15 polybrominated diphenyl ether congeners (PBDE) in the upper 34 m of an ice core (representing 1953-2005) from Holtedahlfonna, the western-most ice sheet on Svalbard. All of the non-PBDE compounds were detected in nearly continuous profiles in the core. Seven PBDEs were not observed above background (28, 47, 66, 100, 99, 154, 153), while 4 were found in 1 or 2 of 6 segments (17, 85, 138, 183). BDEs-49, 71, 190, 209 had nearly continuous profiles but only BDE-209 in large amounts. The greatest inputs were HBCD and BDE-209, 910, and 320 pg cm(-2) yr(-1) from 1995-2005. DBDPE, BTBPE, and PBEB show nearly continuous input growth in recent core segments, but all were <6 pg cm(-2) yr(-1). Long-range atmospheric processes may have moved these particle-bound BFRs to the site, probably during the Arctic haze season. Average air mass trajectories over 10 years show >75% of atmospheric flow to Holtedahlfonna coming from Eurasia during haze periods (March and April).					; van de wal, roderik/D-1705-2011; Muir, Derek/F-6183-2011; Hermanson, Mark/ACK-5258-2022	pohjola, veijo/0000-0001-6851-1673; Hermanson, Mark/0000-0002-3557-523X; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				OCT 1	2010	44	19			SI		7405	7410		10.1021/es1016608	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es1016608								20839863					WOS:000282209700038

X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and diatom analyses of laminated sediment were conducted to determine the impact of short-term climate oscillations and anthropogenic eutrophication on the lagoon ecosystem. In this lagoon, eutrophication has progressed since the early 20th century due to deforestation and human activity in the catchment area, such as development of the cattle industry and field agriculture. In particular, the sedimentation rate of Lake Mokoto and potassium and phosphorus contents of lake sediment have increased rapidly since 1970, in association with an increase in the number of cattle. In addition, the Lake Mokoto ecosystem shows inter annual and decadal cyclic fluctuations that are separate from the anthropogenic effects. Prior to anthropogenic eutrophication, the nutrient condition of Lake Mokoto showed a close relationship with the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO). The growth of seagrass, inferred from epiphytic diatom abundance, showed a clear decadal cycle following variation in solar irradiance.																			0272-7714	1096-0015				JUN 30	2019	222						205	213		10.1016/j.ecss.2019.04.016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2019.04.016													WOS:000468256400020

However, additional hydroclimate records are needed from the northern Caribbean to understand the long-term behavior of the NASH, and better forecast its future behavior. Here we present a multi-proxy sinkhole lake reconstruction from a carbonate island that is proximal to the NASH (Abaco Island, The Bahamas). The reconstruction indicates the northern Bahamas experienced a drought from similar to 3300 to similar to 2500 Cal yrs BP, which coincides with evidence from other hydroclimate and oceanographic records (e.g., Africa, Caribbean, and South America) for a synchronous southern displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and North Atlantic Hadley Cell. The specific cause of the hydroclimate change in the northeastern Caribbean region from similar to 3300 to 2500 Cal yrs BP was probably coeval southern or western displacement of the NASH, which would have increased northeastern Caribbean exposure to subsiding air from higher altitudes.

Such additional measurements assist both research and operational programs. However, for a particular lake or reservoir, altimetric products offered to end-users may differ due to choice of employed instrument, processing technique, and applied geophysical corrections. To explore these differences, particularly with their potential impact on climate-based research, an intercomparison of three web-based water-level products (produced by Laboratoire d'Etudes en Geophysique et Oceanographie Spatiale, National Aeronautics and Space Administration/United States Department of Agriculture, and European Space Agency/De Montfort University) has been undertaken based on 18 lakes and reservoirs. The products are well correlated with each other (r = 0.87 to 0.99) and where in situ data are available are quite well correlated with the gauge measurements (r = 0.73 to 0.99). Despite variations in data processing, the poorest root-mean-square differences between any altimeter product and gauge data (similar to 0.20 to 1.41 m) occur for the narrow reservoirs and smaller lakes. The largest discrepancies between the altimeter products occur for the lakes that freeze (Lake Athabasca and Woods). The current altimeter products provide acceptable accuracy, long-term trends and seasonality for climate applications. We discuss the merits of each product system, but recommend further validations and the provision of ice-detection flags. (C) 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

In order to ascertain suitable methods for direct measurement of evaporation from small water bodies, this study presents a comparison of eddy covariance and scintillometry measurements from a reservoir in southeast Queensland, Australia. The work presented expands on a short study presented by McJannet et al. (2011) to include comparisons of eddy covariance measurements and scintillometer-derived predictions of surface energy fluxes under a wide range of seasonal weather conditions. In this study, analysis was undertaken to ascertain whether important theoretical assumptions required for both techniques are valid in the complex environment of a small reservoir. Statistical comparison, energy balance closure, and the relationship between evaporation measurements and key environmental controls were used to compare the results of the two techniques. Reasonable agreement was shown between the sensible heat flux measurements from eddy covariance and scintillometry, while scintillometer-derived estimates of latent heat flux were approximately 21% greater than eddy covariance measurements. We suggest possible reasons for this difference and provide recommendations for further research for improving measurements of surface energy fluxes over small water bodies using eddy covariance and scintillometry.

J	Yang, SQ; Liu, PW				Yang, Shu-Qing; Liu, Pan-Wei			Strategy of water pollution prevention in Taihu Lake and its effects analysis	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Taihu Lake, the third largest freshwater lake in China, is located in the Chanjiang Delta of the Yangtze River. Its waters are used by agriculture, industry and as major drinking water for several cities including Shanghai and Wuxi. The lake also is important for tourism, aquaculture and flood control. Taihu Lake and its surrounding areas are facing three major water-related threats: deteriorating water quality with inflow and runoff from its watershed; flooding during the rainy seasons; and water shortages during drier months. Noxious algae blooms are occurring with increasing frequency and water quality continues to decline. Remedial actions implemented to date have been ineffective. This paper proposes that the problems could be remedied by constructing a by-pass channel (BPC), which would divert low-quality water from the lake during low precipitation periods and allow better quality water to flow into the lake during high flow periods. This remedial action would simultaneously deal with the deteriorating water quality of Lake Taihu and maintain its water level at a desired level. A preliminary assessment of this strategy shows that, if the BPC were implemented, the water quality of Taihu Lake would be improved significantly in few years, the flood disaster would be greatly mitigated, and the water shortage problem in the basin would be alleviated.

To this end, field studies including environmental surveying and water column sampling at six stations along two routes in Lake Zarivar, Iran, together with laboratory analysis were conducted. Then, a stepwise multivariate regression analysis was employed to identify existing patterns and effects among variables. To secure the evolved model generalizability, the range of data was adjusted using available measurements from several similar lakes/wetlands with respect to their climate and sampling season. Finally, the evolved models ' reliability was examined using validation samples as well as a comparative performance appraisal with a benchmark model attained by the least squares regression technique. The results indicated that NH 4 and pH have the most significant effect on DO. The greater amount of DO on the lake surface, i.e., wind effect, and its effect on both nitrification and ammonification processes ensure the absence of hypoxia in surface layers. Therefore, in water column monitoring programs, measuring NH 4 and pH would be sufficient. Our results also demonstrated that the potential of hypoxia increases if the amount of NH 4 increases in the lower layers of the water column despite releasing DO with nitrate. Strong relations between DO, as the main factor of hypoxia, with NH 4 and pH, gives us the opportunity to predict the hypoxia potential and its level. Using time delay between nitrification and ammonification processes, one may predict the changes in the amount of oxygen from the changes in nitrogen.

We investigated the temporal MRE variability at the Early-to Mid-Holocene site of El Mazo (Asturias, northern Spain) by using a combination of new and previously published radiocarbon measurements on marine and terrestrial samples. The El Mazo site is characterized by overall well-defined archaeological layers of unknown occupation length with the predominant presence of two mollusc species (Patella vulgata Linnaeus, 1758 and topshell Phorcus lineatus [da Costa, 1778]) which were analysed for radiocarbon measurements. We employed the recently released IntCal20 calibration curve for the northern hemisphere and Bayesian modelling to reconstruct the site's chronology and temporal variability in MREs according to mollusc species. Obtained radiocarbon modelling results, although the estimate precision is not high, reveal a temporal variability in MREs that can be interpreted in view of known past climatic and environmental events such as the 8.2 ka event. The results also revealed differences in MREs according to mollusc species, which need to be taken into account in future chronological modelling. Overall, our results provide reference MRE values for the study of chronologies in northern Iberia during the Early-to Mid-Holocene. In this respect, a non-conservative Delta R reference for local marine samples dating earlier than c. 8.1 ka cal BP is -238 +/- 28 14C years.

J	Allen, JRM; Huntley, B				Allen, Judy R. M.; Huntley, Brian			Last Interglacial palaeovegetation, palaeoenvironments and chronology: a new record from Lago Grande di Monticchio, southern Italy	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The sediments of Lago Grande di Monticchio, southern Italy, extend continuously from the present back to the penultimate glacial stage and have an independent lamination-based chronology of high precision and accuracy. Results are presented here from a detailed palynological investigation of that part of the sediment sequence that extends from the last millennia of the penultimate glacial stage to the first stadial following the Last Interglacial (LI). Quantitative palaeovegetation and palaeoclimate reconstructions made from the palynological data are also presented. The onset of the LI is dated to 127.20 ka BP, a date that is consistent with other recent estimates; the duration of the LI is estimated to have been 17.70 ka. The palaeovegetation record indicates a transition period of 3.35 ka at the end of the penultimate glacial stage prior to the onset of the LI; no Younger Dryas-like oscillation is recorded, although the transition was interrupted by a brief event, lasting ca 250 years, during which pollen of woody taxa was reduced in abundance. Steppe vegetation dominated during the latter part of the penultimate full-glacial stage, but was replaced progressively by wooded steppe during the transition. Although the development of forest cover marked the onset of the LI, the forests were relatively open or discontinuous during the first 2.65 ka, closing progressively thereafter and generally dominating between 123.00 and 109.50 ka BR The end of the LI is dated to 109.50 ka BP, after which date forest cover became discontinuous and wooded steppe or steppe dominated during the 1.90 ka of the subsequent stadial. As might be expected, given the location of the lake, the composition of the LI forests differs markedly from those recorded from northern Europe, as well as from those recorded at other localities in southern Europe. The palaeoclimate reconstructions reveal complex changes in seasonality, the maximum coldest month mean temperatures being between 125.70 ka BP and 123.00 ka 131, whereas maxima for both annual temperature sum and the ratio of actual to potential evapotranspiration were between 120.60 ka BP and 115.80 ka BR Reconstructed zonal mean values for all three climatic variables in the zones in which they peak exceed values at the locality today. Comparison with other palaeovegetation records of the LI from Europe reveals that forest cover generally opened up north of the Alpine region probably ca 115 ka 1313, coinciding with a marked decrease in sea surface temperatures in the Nordic Seas; this probably corresponds to a marked shift in forest composition at Lago Grande di Monticchio at 115.80 ka BP with an associated reconstructed decrease of ca 5 degrees C in coldest month mean temperature. Nonetheless, forest continued to dominate at Lago Grande di Monticchio until 109.50 ka BR Such comparisons also reveal considerable complexity in the geographical and altitudinal patterns of change in palaeovegetation during the LI; such complexity is to be expected given the parallel complexity of Holocene changes. Systematic comparisons between reconstructions of palaeoclimate are hampered by a lack of consistency in approach and in the variables reconstructed. Further insight into this complexity of palaeoclimate development during the LI requires a synthesis of the available data and application of a consistent reconstruction approach that also provides robust estimates of the uncertainty in the reconstructed values.

So far, there have been few studies on evaluating lake model performance at the diurnal time scale and against flux observations. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Land Model version 4-Lake, Ice, Snow and Sediment Simulator using the eddy covariance and water temperature data obtained at a subtropical freshwater lake, Lake Taihu, in China. Both observations and model simulations reveal that convective overturning was commonplace at night and timed when water switched from being statically stable to being unstable. By reducing the water thermal diffusivity to 2% of the value calculated with the Henderson-Sellers parameterization, the model was able to reproduce the observed diurnal variations in water surface temperature and in sensible and latent heat fluxes. The small diffusivity suggests that the drag force of the sediment layer in this large (2500 km(2)) and shallow (2-m depth) lake may be strong, preventing unresolved vertical motions and suppressing wind-induced turbulence. Model results show that a large fraction of the incoming solar radiation energy was stored in the water during the daytime, and the stored energy was diffused upward at night to sustain sensible and latent heat fluxes to the atmosphere. Such a lake-atmosphere energy exchange modulated the local climate at the daily scale in this shallow lake, which is not seen in deep lakes where dominant lake-atmosphere interactions often occur at the seasonal scale.

J	Coelho, S; Ramos, P; Ribeiro, C; Marques, J; Santos, A				Coelho, Sara; Ramos, Patricia; Ribeiro, Claudia; Marques, Joana; Santos, Agostinho			Contribution to the determination of the place of death by drowning - A study of diatoms' biodiversity in Douro river estuary	JOURNAL OF FORENSIC AND LEGAL MEDICINE												The role of the investigation of diatoms' presence in organs and body fluids of an individual found dead in a liquid medium and the relevant contribution to the forensic diagnosis of drowning remain controversial. Furthermore, the absence of an exact and well-defined method for diatoms' analysis makes its study a challenging task. Considering this medico-legal problem and the absence of forensic studies on this subject in Portugal, this work aimed to determine the drowning place of dead individuals based on the analysis of diatom species found in different tissues (lung, liver, kidney, bone marrow) and stomach content. Diatom species found in biological samples were compared with those present in the liquid medium where the corpses were found. A total of 37 cases of death by drowning in Oporto metropolitan area were studied. A seasonal database of the diatom species found in Douro river estuary was built based on water samples collected at nine selected places. Diatoms' extractions were performed by a chemical method using 37% (w/w) hydrochloridric acid for the biological samples and 96% (w/w) sulfuric acid for water samples. Diatoms were found in 63% of total cases but only in lung and gastric content samples. The absence of diatoms in other organs is probably related with a quick death, which may have stopped blood circulation almost immediately, preventing diatom contamination of the other organs. A strong relationship between the diatom species found in the biological samples and those found in water samples of the respective drowning place was observed. Due to the high anthropogenic influence on the Douro estuary no significant differences were observed between the five sampling places, making it extremely difficult to determine the exact estuary location of the drowning. The importance of the creation of a diatom database of the potential drowning places (e.g., rivers, seas, lakes) becomes clear in this study. It also shows that, in cases of drowning, the collection of a water sample from the drowning place is crucial. This is the only way to allow a rigorous comparison of the diatom species in water and biological samples. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine. All rights reserved.

Competition for light between toxic and nontoxic strains of the harmful cyanobacterium Microcystis	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The cyanobacterium Microcystis can produce microcystins, a family of toxins that are of major concern in water management. In several lakes, the average microcystin content per cell gradually declines from high levels at the onset of Microcystis blooms to low levels at the height of the bloom. Such seasonal dynamics might result from a succession of toxic to nontoxic strains. To investigate this hypothesis, we ran competition experiments with two toxic and two nontoxic Microcystis strains using light-limited chemostats. The population dynamics of these closely related strains were monitored by means of characteristic changes in light absorbance spectra and by PCR amplification of the rRNA internal transcribed spacer region in combination with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, which allowed identification and semiquantification of the competing strains. In all experiments, the toxic strains lost competition for light from nontoxic strains. As a consequence, the total microcystin concentrations in the competition experiments gradually declined. We did not find evidence for allelopathic interactions, as nontoxic strains became dominant even when toxic strains were given a major initial advantage. These findings show that, in our experiments, nontoxic strains of Microcystis were better competitors for light than toxic strains. The generality of this finding deserves further investigation with other Microcystis strains. The competitive replacement of toxic by nontoxic strains offers a plausible explanation for the gradual decrease in average toxicity per cell during the development of dense Microcystis blooms.					; Huisman, Jef/A-1089-2013; Visser, Petra/NJT-4667-2025	Tonk, Linda/0000-0002-6248-3605; Huisman, Jef/0000-0001-9598-3211; Visser, Petra/0000-0003-3294-1908; 													0099-2240	1098-5336				MAY	2007	73	9					2939	2946		10.1128/AEM.02892-06	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02892-06								17337540					WOS:000246238500022

Phytoplankton Functional Groups in a Tropical Estuary: Hydrological Control and Nutrient Limitation	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Hydrology and nutrients have been indicated as the main driving factors acting on phytoplankton biomass and composition in estuarine systems, although grazing may occasionally have some influence. In order to identify these factors over temporal and spatial scales, we analyzed physical, chemical, and biological properties of a tropical river-dominated estuary during the dry and rainy seasons. As far as we know, this is the first time that the functional groups approach has been used to analyze the changes in phytoplankton composition in an estuary. This recent framework is based on the tolerances and sensitivities in relation to environmental conditions of groups of species, which are labeled by alpha-numeric codes (Reynolds et al., J. Pl. Res. 24:417-428, 2002). In the estuary of Paraiba do Sul River, all phytoplankton groups were represented by freshwater organisms, indicating the strong influence of the river. However, remarkable shifts in composition and biomass occurred from the low to high flushing seasons, due much more to the river discharge than to nutrient availability. The overall results showed no nitrogen, phosphorus, or silica limitation to phytoplankton growth (mean values: dissolved inorganic nitrogen = 30.5 A mu M, soluble reactive phosphorus = 1.45 A mu M, and silica = 208.05 A mu M). The higher river flow supports a lower phytoplankton biomass composed mainly of nanoplankton (< 20 A mu m) fast-growing functional groups, which are able to maintain biomass even in high flushing conditions (X-1), or large heavy organisms, such as some heavy diatoms of group P, which are able to be in suspension in shallow and turbulent systems. The lower river flow led to the coexistence of large organisms (> 20 A mu m) of the groups P and F, which include slow-growing populations typically found in mesotrophic lakes. Although the functional group approach was originally developed for temperate lakes, our data support this approach for a tropical estuarine environment.					; Ovalle, Alvaro/I-1303-2015; Huszar, Vera/J-7126-2012	Huszar, Vera/0000-0002-8096-1404; 													1559-2723	1559-2731				MAY	2009	32	3					508	521		10.1007/s12237-009-9142-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-009-9142-3													WOS:000265038500010

The dominant fish species in these ecosystems are cold-water salmonids, which play a central ecological role in lake ecosystems, where they are often exposed to size-selective fisheries that truncate their size and age distributions, making them potentially vulnerable to exploitation and environmental perturbations. Here, we address the combined effects of climate-induced water temperature increase (using regionally downscaled climate models based on the RCP-4.5 and RCP-8.5 climate scenarios together with an air-to-water temperature model) and gillnet harvesting, over the period from 1950 to 2100, on the somatic growth, demography and vulnerability of Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (L.), using an eco-genetic individual-based model. The model captures successive annual life-history events, including the key processes of size-dependent mortality, age- and size-dependent maturation described by a probabilistic reaction norm, temperature-dependent growth, size-dependent reproduction and density-dependent recruitment. Our model predicts that higher water temperatures will increase the somatic growth of Arctic charr, leading to larger body size at age and increased stock biomass: for RCP-8.5, we predict an 80% increase in stock biomass in the year 2100 relative to the year 2000 in the absence of fishing. Interestingly, this potential increase in biomass in future climate scenarios will be partially masked by harvesting: for a fishing mortality of 0.3 year(-1), we predict a mere 40% increase in stock biomass in 2100 relative to 2000. Despite the predicted increase in stock biomass, yield will increase substantially only when fishing mortality is low. In addition, climate warming will accentuate the age-truncation effect of harvesting, which will target younger individuals, including immatures, thus elevating the vulnerability of the population to environmental perturbations. Synthesis and applications. Our model-based analyses highlight the combined effects of climate change and size-selective fishing, emphasizing the emerging vulnerability of fish populations to multiple stressors. We recommend carefully climate-adapted management strategies permitting only a narrow range of gillnet mesh sizes for inland fisheries at high latitudes.

To assess specific environmental effects, young-of-the-year major carps were collected below TGD in the Yangtze River at Jianli (larvae) and E'zhou (juveniles) and in the Dongting Lake (juveniles) during June-August 2007. Lapillar otoliths were analyzed to determine early growth. There were no discernible growth increments in otoliths for a majority of the larvae (38 of 63 grass carp and 40 of 47 silver carp), while increments were evident in otoliths formed in the larval stage for all the juveniles, indicating that larvae without discernible increments failed to recruit to the juvenile stage. Back-calculated hatch dates of major carps were between 31 May and 24 July. The initiation of the spawning season was delayed about 1 month compared to pre-TGD records. Larval growth rates, as reflected by otolith-increment width, were lower at Dongting Lake (closer to TGD) than at E'zhou (farther from TGD), indicating that TGD-moderated effects on early growth and development of carps are more apparent for fishes hatched nearer to the dam. The delay in spawning and decreased early growth may partly explain the recent decline of the major carp resources in the middle and lower Yangtze River.

Spatial and temporal trends in the fate of silver nanoparticles in a whole-lake addition study	PLOS ONE												Studies of the fate and toxicity of nanoparticles, including nanosilver (AgNPs), have been primarily conducted using bench scale studies over relatively short periods of time. To better understand the fate of AgNPs in natural aquatic ecosystems over longer time scales and ecological settings, we released suspensions of AgNPs (30-50 nm, capped with polyvinylpyrrolidone) into a boreal lake at the Experimental Lakes Area in Canada. Approximately 9 kg of silver was added from a shoreline point source from June to October 2014, which resulted in total Ag (TAg) concentrations of about 10 mu g L-1 or less. In addition, dissolved Ag concentrations (DAg) were typically very low. Using single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (sp-ICP-MS) analysis of grab samples, we found that the nanoparticles typically ranged in the 40-60 nm size class and were widely distributed throughout the lake, while larger aggregates (i.e. >100 nm) were infrequently detected. The highest occurrence of aggregates was found near the addition site; however, size distributions did not vary significantly among spatial locations or time suggesting rapid dispersal upon entry into the lake. Lake stratification at the thermocline was not a barrier to mobility of the AgNPs, as the particles were also detected in the hypolimnion. Environmental factors influenced Ag size distributions over sampling locations and time. Total dissolved phosphorus, bacterio-plankton chlorophyll-a, and sampling time strongly correlated with aggregation and dissolution dynamics. AgNPs thus appear to be relatively mobile and persistent over the growing season in lake ecosystems.

The dissolution of carbonate particles in dust has a strong impact on the chemical composition of rainfall as inferred from the Gibbs model and the ternary plots of the major ions. The chemical composition of the ground water can be divided into two groups, one influenced by river water and the other dominated by deeper aquifers. The chemical composition of lake water can be mainly ascribed to evaporation and crystallization. Total dissolved solid (TDS) of river waters during the wet periods is higher than during the dry periods. Calcium and bicarbonate are the dominant cations and anions of the river waters, and they have higher fractions during the wet periods than during the dry periods. Comparisons between (Mg2+ + Ca2+)/TZ(+), (Mg2+ + Ca2+)/(Na+ + K+), HCO3-/Na+, and Cl-/Na+ suggest that the chemical composition of the river waters is mainly controlled by carbonate weathering and that the carbonate weathering is much stronger during the wet periods than during the dry periods. Seasonal melting may be one of the important factors that influence the seasonal variations of water chemistry of the rivers. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT												To understand the consequences of unsustainable management practices and global change, analyzing the patterns of ecosystem functioning and land degradation is as important as quantifying the spatio-temporal patterns of land cover loss. This is particularly important for wetlands where loss and degradation are globally intensifying. In the Lower Delta of the Parana River, Argentina, land use change has occurred in the context of cattle raising intensification, which involves water management infrastructure. However, when those changes specifically occurred and whether they permanently influenced the functional component of wetland ecosystems remain unanswered. We used a long-term (2001-2015) fused satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index dataset to identify major shifts in vegetation activity trends using the Breaks for Additive Seasons and Trend algorithm. We assembled a set of hydro-climatic, environmental, and anthropogenic variables to study their association with the spatio-temporal patterns of vegetation activity trends. Our results show that browning-to-greening trends dominated throughout the study area. Concomitantly, the magnitude of breakpoints was mainly negative, which points towards rapid land degradation and biomass submersion or removal events. Breakpoints primarily occurred between 2007 and 2009 and were partially coincident with an extraordinary flood event and intentional fire outbreaks. Paranacito river flooding, precipitation, the synchronicity with temperature patterns, water management infrastructure and the occurrence of local land cover conversions were determining factors in the differentiation and characteristics of vegetation activity trends, shifts and breakpoints. Our results provide evidence that even though regional hydro-climatic patterns remain as main drivers of wetland vegetation dynamics, human influence and its negative effects increase in the context of adverse hydroclimatic scenarios. In this matter, we observed that the decouplement from the flood pulse promoted a postdisturbance recolonization of herbaceous vegetation. Consistently, the widespread browning-to-greening trend reversal does not necessarily relate to wetland vegetation recovery but instead, might have masked its extensive conversion to grasslands.					; Sica, Yanina/HTQ-8713-2023	Aquino, Diego Sebastian/0000-0001-7160-2656; 													2352-9385					NOV	2021	24								100626	10.1016/j.rsase.2021.100626	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2021.100626		SEP 2021											WOS:000719729600002

Recent Results on Soil Moisture Remote Sensing Using P-band Signals of Opportunity	2017 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTROMAGNETICS IN ADVANCED APPLICATIONS (ICEAA)					19th International Conference on Electromagnetics in Advanced Applications (ICEAA)	SEP 11-15, 2017	Verona, ITALY	Politecnico Torino, Univ Studi Verona, IEIIT CNR, IEEE Antennas & Propagat Soc, URSI, Torino Wireless Fdn, Ist Super Mario Boella Tecnologie Informazione Telecomunicazioni, IEEE Italy Sect				Root zone soil moisture (RZSM) is an essential variable in meteorology, hydrology, and agriculture. Current methods in passive and active microwave remote sensing at L-band (e.g. SMOS or SMAP) are limited to a sensing depth of less than 10 cm. Observing RZSM (water in the top meter of soil) will require lower frequencies (P-band), presenting significant difficulties for a spaceborne instrument, due to the required antenna size, the presence of radio-frequency interference (RFI), and competition for spectrum allocations (in the case of active radar). Bistatic radar using Signal of Opportunity (SoOp) (e.g. digital satellite transmitters) offers the possibility of remote sensing using powerful signals already occupying bands allocated for communications. This paper will present early results from the first airborne campaign to study Pband reflectometry for soil moisture, conducted in Oklahoma between October 17-26, 2016. A geosynchronous communication satellite, transmitting a 25 KHz data signal on a 260.375 MHz carrier was uses at the signal source. Preliminary assessment of the data showed high reflectivity over a lake and consistent results between subsequent overflights of the watershed. Recently, a tower experiment has started using a 20 MHz wide signal centered at 370 MHz. Linearly polarized measurements were made over bare soil between 25-May-2017 and 8-June-2017 observing a strong reflected signal. Corn is being planted on the field and measurements will be made throughout the growing season.					; Pignotti, Garett/HNQ-1135-2023	Garrison, James/0000-0002-0269-9834; Pignotti, Garett/0000-0002-7787-3366; 															978-1-5090-4451-1				2017							1604	1607																WOS:000426455500326

Contact Selectivity for Four Fish Species Sampled with North American Standard Gill Nets	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												The American Fisheries Society (AFS) has recommended standard gears and methods for collecting North American freshwater fish data, but selectivity of these gears, including gill nets, is poorly described for most species. We calculated contact selectivity for species commonly collected with AFS standard gill nets in lakes and reservoirs of North America, including Black Bullhead Ameiurus melas, Channel Catfish Ictalurus punctatus, Walleye Sander vitreus, and Yellow Perch Perca flavescens. The normal selectivity curve provided the best fit to empirical catch data for all species. Inclusion of a tangle factor improved model fit for Black Bullhead, Channel Catfish, and Walleye, indicating that tangling is an important means of capture for these species. Channel Catfish were more susceptible to tangling than the closely related Black Bullhead, likely because larger Channel Catfish are more vulnerable to tangling by spines in the smallest meshes, whereas Black Bullhead in the same meshes were wedged. Failure to include a tangle factor for Channel Catfish and Walleye would have underestimated peak length of captured fish by 80 and 40 mm, respectively. Tangling was not an important factor in Yellow Perch capture. Total selectivity curves for each species captured with the AFS standard gill net were calculated, and relative selectivity values are provided as correction factors for size-selectivity bias. Our correction factors and modeled selectivity curves for Channel Catfish, Walleye, and Yellow Perch corroborate previous studies that modeled selectivity of the AFS standard gill net for Channel Catfish, Walleye, and Yellow Perch, but our study provided novel information on Black Bullhead. Improved selectivity information for the AFS standard gill net may help to promote further voluntary adoption of AFS standard gears and methods.

J	Schilling, KE; Anderson, E; Streeter, MT; Theiling, C				Schilling, Keith E.; Anderson, Elliot; Streeter, Matthew T.; Theiling, Chuck			Long-term nitrate-nitrogen reductions in a large flood control reservoir	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Flood-control reservoirs are common in the U.S. and several are located in highly agricultural regions of the Midwest. In this study, a mass balance of annual and seasonal NO3-N concentration and load reductions was calculated for Lake Red Rock, a large flood-control reservoir located on the Des Moines River downstream of the City of Des Moines, Iowa. Utilizing rare long-term upstream and downstream NO3-N monitoring records extending back in time 42 years and combining this with estimates from tributary inputs, Lake Red Rock reservoir was found to remove an average of 7,379 Mg NO3-N per year, representing 12.4 % of the NO3-N inputs to the reservoir. Annual variations in NO3-N loss rate varied considerably (-2.9 % to 41.3 %) and were signifi- cantly related to annual reservoir water retention time. Combining study results with literature data, annual NO3-N reduction in Midwestern flood-control reservoirs was logarithmically related to average annual water retention time. Although flood-control reservoirs are designed primarily for flood protection, manipulating the reservoirs to achieve longer water retention times, particularly during periods of high NO3-N concentrations and loads, could be a strategy to alleviate impairments at downstream water suppliers and help state and federal agencies meet NO3-N reduction goals.

J	Obertegger, U; Manca, M				Obertegger, Ulrike; Manca, Marina			Response of rotifer functional groups to changing trophic state and crustacean community	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Information based on taxon-based indices is species-specific while information gained from function-based research can give a comprehensive view of ecosystem processes. We applied the guild-ratio, an index based on the proportion of functional groups of roofers (i.e. microphagous and raptorial species), on a long-term data set of Logo Maggiore. By applying seasonal trend decomposition based on smoothing techniques and non-metrical multidimensional scaling, we assessed the response of rotifer functional groups to changes in trophic state and climate. While the taxon-based indices showed smooth changes, the function-based index showed a dramatic shift from a raptorial to a microphagous dominance, with a back-shift to raptorial dominance starting in 2000. The seasonal peak of microphagous and raptorial dry weight was clearly separated in the pre-eutrophication period. When mesotrophic conditions prevailed both peaks overlapped Only to he separated again with re-oligotrophication. We attributed these alterations of rotifer functional groups to changes in competition with crustacean zooplankton and to decreased phytoplankton algal abundance and size while altered seasonality in functional groups could be related to inter-group competition fin. food. We hypothesise that the effects of trophic state (i.e. altered phytoplankton) and climate (i.e. altered cladoceran community) were transferred across trophic levels to rotifer functional groups. Our study highlights that functional groups are valid instruments for illustrating unifying principles in ecology through a better understanding of ecosystem processes and the interrelationship between trophic levels.

While sediments are considered major repositories for MPs, information on their spatial distribution within these matrices is insufficient. This research examined both the horizontal and vertical presence of MPs in the sediments surrounding Lake Paldang in South Korea, alongside a comprehensive evaluation of the physicochemical characteristics of the samples obtained. The total content of MPs varied from 2.15 to 122.2 particles g -1 . The average contents of MPs on surface sediments were 40.47, 34.14, 5.01, and 8.19 particles g -1 in north mainstream (NM), south mainstream (SM), tributary (TB), and Tributary catchment (TC) based on Sonae Island, Gyeongan stream, respectively. The most abundant MP types were polyethylene (PE), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and polypropylene (PP), accounting for more than 70% of the total MPs. The most abundant sizes of MPs were within 45 -100 mu m. At all sediment depths, polymers were distributed in the order PE, PP, and polyester in NM, SM, and TC, respectively, whereas PTFE mainly occurred in the surface layer. MPs distribution also exhibited seasonal variation as larger inflows and flow rates varied with season.

Large-scale assessment of wildlife exposure to both emerging and legacy PFAS plays a key role in effective biomonitoring to better discriminate regional contamination patterns and provide early warnings. Using eggs of two closely-related shorebird species collected across China during the breeding season in 2021, we constructed contrasting PFAS levels and profiles in coastal versus inland populations. The highest n-ary sumation PFAS concentrations were found in two Kentish plover (Charadrius alexandrinus) populations from the Bohai Sea, a semi-enclosed shallow bay located in northeast China. These two populations showed exceptionally high PFOA concentrations (mean: 94 and 121 ng/g wet weight; West and North Bohai Sea, respectively) dominating the overall PFAS profile (66% for both). This pattern is characteristic, compared to that of other seabird eggs worldwide. By comparison, PFAS profile in the white-faced plover (Charadrius dealbatus) population at the South China Sea coast was dominated by PFOS (46%), which showed similar levels to those at the North Bohai Sea coast (mean: 29 and 20 ng/g, respectively). PFAS concentrations of Kentish plovers from the remote Qinghai Lake were lower compared to the three coastal populations, and were dominated by PFNA (mean: 2.6 ng/g, 29%) and PFOS (mean: 2.5 ng/g, 27%). None of the eggs analyzed in the present study exceeded estimated toxicity reference values for PFOS or PFOA. Additionally, the emerging 6:2 Cl-PFESA was detected in eggs from all regions, while its concentrations were highest in the Bohai Sea populations, and short-chain PFBS was only detected in the North Bohai Sea population. Our results indicate intensive local emissions of PFOA and emerging PFAS at the Bohai Sea region, and warrant further investigation and monitoring.					; Cheng, Yachang/AAK-3207-2020; song, zitan/HLX-0376-2023; Sun, Jiachen/C-7559-2017; Liu, Yang/ABE-5175-2021; Wang, Kai/AAT-3039-2020; Sun, Jiachen/ADT-5510-2022	Liu, Yang/0000-0003-4580-5518; Sun, Jiachen/0000-0002-0191-3085; Cheng, Yachang/0000-0002-2108-7227; 													0013-9351	1096-0953				JUL 15	2023	229								115946	10.1016/j.envres.2023.115946	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2023.115946		APR 2023						37080273					WOS:000989591700001

The complex dynamics of this climatic system are therefore of broad scientific and societal interest. In this virtual special issue (VSI), we present 19 papers dealing with the Asian monsoon since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, -21 kyr BP), with a focus on understanding variability and forcing mechanisms. Findings use recently developed quantitative reconstructions combined with numerical simulations, and present novel insights as follows: (1) analyses of comprehensive datasets of pollen, diatom, brGDGTs, oxygen and hydrogen isotopes and frequency magnetic susceptibility, as well as an innovative algorithm model for the lake energy-water balance, improve the reliability of quantitative reconstructions of Asian monsoon climate variations; (2) studies of quantitative climate parameters in central East Asia show that mean annual temperature (MAT) was -5 degrees C (or - 7.9 degrees C using brGDGTs) lower during the LGM, -1.5 degrees C (+/- 41% using brGDGTs) higher around the Holocene thermal optimum (HO) and mean annual precipitation (MAP) varied between 30 and 150% with marked seasonality during 8 -5 ka; (3) dynamical downscaling palaeoclimatic simulations improve the accuracy of past monsoon variations, revealing strong variability in monsoon precipitation across the LGM and HO. The holistic study of Asian monsoon variations at orbital to centennial timescales in these VSI papers presents reliable observations of monsoon variability and its driving mechanisms, providing high-resolution quantitative paleoclimate reconstructions that fill existing gaps in spatial coverage, as well as offering an improved understanding, thorough numerical simulation, of coupled sealevel change and vegetation feedbacks.

J	Humphries, P; Richardson, A; Wilson, G; Ellison, T				Humphries, Paul; Richardson, Adam; Wilson, Glenn; Ellison, Tanya			River regulation and recruitment in a protracted-spawning riverine fish	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												We present and test an extension of the "match/mismatch" hypothesis that attempts to explain the persistence, under conditions of flow alteration, of small, short-lived, native, riverine, fish species. The premise is that flow alteration typically changes environmental conditions, such as temperature and prey abundance, which may affect survival during the larval period of fishes. This "window-of-opportunity hypothesis" states that, if optimal conditions for recruitment vary temporally within a year, the probability that a proportion of the larvae of protracted-spawning species will encounter a period of optimal conditions is greater than for larvae with only a brief spawning period, and so the former will have a recruitment advantage. We determined whether all hatching events contributed equally to juvenile recruitment of the protracted-spawning Australian smelt (Retropinna semoni) during one breeding season in three pairs of heavily regulated and largely free-flowing unregulated rivers in the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, and related patterns in the hatch dates of recruits to temperature or prey biomass for one pair. For all rivers, heavily regulated or not, recruits present at the end of the breeding season most commonly hatched in the latter part of the breeding season. Mortality of those fish hatched in the first part of the season likely explains this trend. Furthermore, while hatching times were similar for all rivers, each river showed a distinct pattern of hatching and recruitment, which may relate to the temperature range within which epigenetic processes are aligned. Patterns of zooplankton biomass differed between the largely free-flowing Ovens and regulated Goulburn rivers and likely had different sources: within the channel and within the storage lake, respectively. For the Ovens River, recruits hatched subsequent to the period when the first significant increase in zooplankton biomass occurred. We hypothesize that temperature may largely influence the "window" during which recruitment can take place but that prey density, responding to river-specific interactions between temperature and discharge, plays a role in the timing and magnitude of recruitment of Australian smelt. We conclude that the match/mismatch hypothesis may be applicable to rivers, that the window-of-opportunity hypothesis has some currency and deserves further investigation, and that river regulation may have significant impacts on fish recruitment.

Understanding Greenland ice sheet hydrology using an integrated multi-scale approach	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Improved understanding of Greenland ice sheet hydrology is critically important for assessing its impact on current and future ice sheet dynamics and global sea level rise. This has motivated the collection and integration of in situ observations, model development, and remote sensing efforts to quantify meltwater production, as well as its phase changes, transport, and export. Particularly urgent is a better understanding of albedo feedbacks leading to enhanced surface melt, potential positive feedbacks between ice sheet hydrology and dynamics, and meltwater retention in firn. These processes are not isolated, but must be understood as part of a continuum of processes within an integrated system. This letter describes a systems approach to the study of Greenland ice sheet hydrology, emphasizing component interconnections and feedbacks, and highlighting research and observational needs.

W.; O'Reilly, Bryan; Hietpas, Kaitlynn R.; Block, Paul			Development of a sub-seasonal cyanobacteria prediction model by leveraging local and global scale predictors	HARMFUL ALGAE												In recent decades, cultural eutrophication of coastal waters and inland lakes around the world has contributed to a rapid expansion of potentially toxic cyanobacteria, threatening aquatic and human systems. For many locations, a complex array of physical, chemical, and biological variables leads to significant inter-annual variability of cyanobacteria biomass, modulated by local and large-scale climate phenomena. Currently, however, minimal information regarding expected summertime cyanobacteria biomass conditions is available prior to the season, limiting proactive management and preparedness strategies for lake and beach safety. To address this, subseasonal (two-month) cyanobacteria biomass prediction models are developed, drawing on pre-season predictors including stream discharge, phosphorus loads, a floating algae index, and large-scale sea-surface temperature regions, with an application to Lake Mendota in Wisconsin. A two-phase statistical modeling approach is adopted to reflect identified asymmetric relationships between predictors (drivers of inter-annual variability) and cyanobacteria biomass levels. The model illustrates promising performance overall, with particular skill in predicting above normal cyanobacteria biomass conditions which are of primary importance to lake and beach managers.

Modeling Hydrological Responses to Land Use Dynamics, Choke, Ethiopia	WATER CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING												The main objective of this study was to assess the hydrological response of the Choke mountain range to land use dynamics. Two watersheds, Muga and Suha watersheds, were selected for detailed evaluation and analysis. The study was conducted using integrated applications of remote sensing and the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The SWAT model was calibrated using Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-2) algorithm in SWAT-CUP. Decadal land use maps (1985, 1995, and 2005) were used to simulate the hydrological responses. Simulated model results showed that over the past two decades (1985-2004), the total annual surface and lateral streamflows in the watershed increased at a rate of 1.2 mm/year and 0.57 mm/year, whereas the annual total groundwater flow and percolation in the basin decreased at a rate of 1.6 mm/year and 1.77 mm/year respectively. The decrease in the streamflow was more pronounced during the dry season (October to May), for which statistically significant declines of the base flow or the low flow at a rate of 0.37 m(3)/year and 0.73 m(3)/year in the Muga and Suha watersheds, respectively, were found. In the wet season (June to September), the peak flow has increased by 50% in Muga and 94% in Suha watersheds. Results of this study showed that the SWAT model can be an effective and useful tool for the assessment of response of watersheds to land use alterations.					; Melesse, Assefa/F-9931-2013; Abera, Fikru/NTQ-9535-2025	Abera, Fikru/0000-0003-3017-2391; 													2366-3340	2364-5687				DEC	2019	4	4					201	212		10.1007/s41101-019-00076-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s41101-019-00076-3													WOS:000705499100005

High-frequency in situ automated sensor data and long-term manual observational data from Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, USA, were used to parameterize, calibrate, and evaluate model predictions. We focused specifically on short-term predictions of temperature, dissolved oxygen, and phytoplankton biomass over one season. Traditional goodness-of-fit metrics indicated more accurate prediction of physics than chemical or biological variables in the time domain. This was confirmed by wavelet analysis in both the time and frequency domains. For temperature, predicted and observed global wavelet spectra were closely related, while observed dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll fluorescence spectral characteristics were not reproduced by the model for key time scales, indicating that processes not modeled may be important drivers of the observed signal. Although the magnitude and timing of physical and biological changes were simulated adequately at the seasonal time scale through calibration, time scale-specific dynamics, for example short-term cycles, were difficult to reproduce, and were relatively insensitive to the effects of varying parameters. The use of wavelet analysis is novel to aquatic ecosystem modeling, is complementary to traditional goodness-of-fit metrics, and allows for assessment of variability at specific temporal scales. In this way, the effect of processes operating at distinct temporal scales can be isolated and better understood, both in situ and in silico. Wavelet transforms are particularly well suited for assessment of temporal and spatial heterogeneity when coupled to high-frequency data from automated in situ or remote sensing platforms.

Monitoring of the Sulejow Reservoir in 2009 and 2010 in two sites Tresta (TR) and Bronislawow BR), which have different morphometry, showed that physicochemical conditions were always favorable for cyanobacterial bloom formation. In 2009, the average biomass of cyanobacteria reached 13 mg L-1 (TR) and 8 mg L-1 (BR), and in the second year, it decreased to approximately 1 mg L-1 (TR and BR). In turns, the mean number of toxic Microcystis genotypes in the total Microcystis reached 1% in 2009, both in TR and BR, and in 2010, the number increased to 70 % in TR and 14 % in BR. Despite significant differences in the biomass of cyanobacteria in 2009 and 2010, the mean microcystins (MCs) concentration and toxicity stayed at a similar level of approximately 1 mu g L-1. Statistical analysis indicated that water retention time was a factor that provided a significant difference between the two monitoring seasons and was considered a driver of the changes occurring in the Sulejow Reservoir. Hydrologic differences, which occurred between two studied years due to heavy flooding in Poland in 2010, influenced the decrease in number of Microcystis biomass by causing water disturbances and by lowering water temperature. Statistical analysis showed that Microcystis aeruginosa biomass and 16S rRNA gene copy number representing Microcystis genotypes in both years of monitoring could be predicted on the basis of total and dissolved phosphorus concentrations and water temperature. In present study, the number of mcyA gene copies representing toxic Microcystis genotypes could be predicted based on the biomass of M. aeruginosa. Moreover, MCs toxicity and concentration could be predicted on the basic of mcyA gene copy number and M. aeruginosa (biomass, 16S rRNA), respectively. Present findings may indicate that Microcystis can regulate the number of toxic genotypes, and in this way adjust the whole bloom to be able to produce MCs at the level which is necessary for its maintenance in the Sulejow Reservoir under stressful hydrological conditions.					; Mankiewicz-Boczek, Joanna/J-2427-2018; Izydorczyk, Katarzyna/KHD-2599-2024	Dziadek, Jaroslaw/0000-0003-1427-884X; Jozwik, Adam/0000-0002-3287-7064; Mankiewicz-Boczek, Joanna/0000-0001-7358-0673; Jurczak, Tomasz/0000-0002-1576-6741; Izydorczyk, Katarzyna/0000-0003-2056-2513; Wojtal-Frankiewicz, Adrianna/0000-0003-3509-6076; Gagala-Borowska, Ilona/0000-0003-0123-7440													0095-3628	1432-184X				FEB	2014	67	2					465	479		10.1007/s00248-013-0303-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-013-0303-3								24241584					WOS:000331707500023

The relations between MC-producing Microcystis, MC production, and environmental variables especially nutrient conditions in eutrophic lakes, Lake Taihu and Lake Yanghe, were investigated during the bloom season of 2015. Results showed that toxigenic cells contributed to 8.94-75.68% and 7.87-58.69% of the total Microcystis in Lake Taihu and Lake Yanghe, respectively. The dynamics of toxigenic cells and MC production were positively associated with NH3-N concentration in Lake Taihu, while positively associated with the concentrations of TP, TDP and PO4-P in Lake Yanghe, indicating that the dominant nutrient factor affecting the toxic blooms was nitrogen in Lake Taihu, whereas it was phosphorus in Lake Yanghe. The significant relationship between TLR eq (total MC after transformation of MC-RR and MC-YR into MC-LR) and Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration implied that Chl-a could be an alternative measure to predict MC risk in the two lakes, and the safe threshold value of Chl-a was proposed as 25.38 and 31.06 mu g/L in Lake Taihu and Lake Yanghe, respectively.					wenqing, shi/JCO-4345-2023; zhang, jianyun/X-7292-2018														0147-6513	1090-2414				DEC 30	2018	166						192	199		10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.09.095	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.09.095								30269014					WOS:000448760800025

Managing lake trout lakes in a warming world: a paleolimnological assessment of nutrients and lake production at three Ontario sites	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Nelligan C, Jeziorski A, Ruhland KM, Paterson AM, Smol JP. 2016. Managing lake trout lakes in a warming world: A paleolimnological assessment of nutrients and lake production at three Ontario sites. Lake Reserve Manage. 32: 315-328. Recent declines in hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in many lakes throughout Ontario have prompted concern regarding the health of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) populations. We used diatom assemblages and spectrally inferred chlorophyll a from the dated sediments of 3 lake trout lakes to track trends in total phosphorus (TP) and whole-lake production over the past similar to 150 years. Eagle Lake is considered a sensitive lake trout lake because DO concentrations have been lower than the provincial standard (>7 mg/L) since the early-2000s; however, a lack of monitoring data impedes the evaluation of current conditions within a historical context. For a regional perspective, we compared trends in Eagle Lake with those of 2 additional lake trout lakes similar to 200 km away. The diatom assemblages of Eagle Lake underwent a shift in the early-1980s, marked by a decline in the relative abundance of Stephanodiscus minutulus and an increase in small Cyclotella (sensu lato) taxa. This change is indicative of nutrient reductions and is consistent with a decline in both monitored and diatom-inferred TP. Sedimentary chlorophyll a peaked after the 1980s, suggesting whole-lake production has increased independent of nutrient loading, likely due to regional warming and a longer growing season. Diatom compositional changes at the 2 other sites are indicative of climate warming, with increases in the relative abundance of Discostella stelligera and spectrally inferred chlorophyll a. Our data suggest climate is likely the dominant driver of the observed algal changes, highlighting that the effects of warming on habitat quality should be considered in lake management strategies.					; Jeziorski, Adam/AAJ-6982-2020; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696; Jeziorski, Adam/0000-0001-7701-7247; 													1040-2381	2151-5530					2016	32	4					315	328		10.1080/10402381.2016.1203844	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2016.1203844													WOS:000388610500001

The characteristics were analyzed based on remote sensing reflectance, and an automatic cluster two-step method was applied for water classification. The inland waters could be clustered into three types, which we labeled water types I, II and III. From water types I to III, the effect of the phytoplankton on the optical characteristics gradually decreased. Four chlorophyll-a retrieval algorithms for Case II water, a two-band, three-band, four-band and SCI (Synthetic Chlorophyll Index) algorithm were evaluated for three water types based on the MERIS bands. Different MERIS bands were used for the three water types in each of the four algorithms. The four algorithms had different levels of retrieval accuracy for each water type, and no single algorithm could be successfully applied to all water types. For water types I and III, the three-band algorithm performed the best, while the four-band algorithm had the highest retrieval accuracy for water type II. However, the three-band algorithm is preferable to the two-band algorithm for turbid eutrophic inland waters. The SCI algorithm is recommended for highly turbid water with a higher concentration of total suspended solids. Our research indicates that the chlorophyll-a concentration retrieval by remote sensing for optically contrasted inland water requires a specific algorithm that is based on the optical characteristics of inland water bodies to obtain higher estimation accuracy.

Compared with dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), the reactivity of DON has received limited attention. Photo-ammonification contributes significantly to the transformation of DON to DIN. However, information on the mechanism of this process is limited. This study investigated the photo-ammonification process of different natural surface water samples. The effects of seasons and rainfall on this processwere explored, and the contributing factorswere identified. Results showed that the seasonal effect on photo-ammonification differed for different water samples, whereas rainfall increased the rates of photo-ammonification formost of the lakes. The concentrations of reactive species, including triplet states of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (3CDOM*) and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)), were found to be significantly correlated with water optical-parameters. Multivariable linear regression analysis (R-2 = 0.617) revealed that the photo-ammonification of DON was mainly facilitated by (CDOM)-C-3* whereas O-1(2) competed with (CDOM)-C-3* and showed an inhibiting effect. The components of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were identified by fluorescence excitation emission matrices coupled with parallel factor analysis and were found to be greatly influenced by the location. Allochthonous humic-like components were found to promote the production of reactive species while tryptophan-like component was found to be a reactive species consumer. This study revealed that the composition of DOM and the reactive species governed the rates of photoammonification. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The data included fertilised eggs and reared larvae from 21 individuals caught during the spawning season from eutrophic Lake Pyhajarvi in Finland. The length of the hatching larvae was dependent on female size but also on water temperature and on the potential energy the female had invested on reproduction. Maternal effects seemed to also influence the timing of larvae growth, and larvae that were large at hatching grew less on mere yolk sac reserves, and vice versa. Female length had a positive effect on the larval starvation resistance but only under cold conditions. The results suggest that higher temperature might reduce the advantage the larvae from large females get for starvation resistance.

When applied to high resolution sedimentary sequences, measurement of brGDGT distributions is employed to reconstruct MAT at subdecadal time scales. In addition, brGDGT proxy estimates are also sometimes purported to be seasonally biased in environments where annual brGDGT production may not be constant during a seasonal cycle. The main aim of this study was to assess the occurrence of seasonality in the production and distribution of brGDGTs and the seasonality bias of the derived temperature proxy. For this purpose, we examined brGDGT distributions and brGDGT-derived MAT estimates in surface soils and settling/suspended particulate matter over one year, from two sites located in the same latitude but at different altitudes, in the Catalan Pyrenees, as well as at one site in southern Norway. These locations have marked seasonal temperature cycles, which were expected to maximize the possibility of detecting any seasonal bias in the production and compositions of brGDGTs. The results show that brGDGT abundance is heterogeneous and increases with soil humidity. The brGDGT distributions and some of the brGDGT-derived proxy measurements in soils are relatively stable throughout the year and do not change significantly in the suspended particulate matter in the river or settling particulate matter in traps. Our study shows that the impact of the seasonality of temperature on brGDGT distribution was absent in the soils studied, regardless of altitude or latitude on a catchment/regional scale. As soils are likely to contain a brGDGT signature which is representative of average environmental conditions in the catchment at least over decades, brGDGT proxy reconstructions derived from soil sources are more suitable to infer variability in environmental parameters over the same timescales (i.e. decades or longer). On shorter timescales (i.e. annual), sediment downcore variability in brGDGTs is likely to be related to changes derived from in situ production and sediment sources.

On the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, thermokarst lakes are experiencing extensive changes due to faster warming. For a deep understanding of internal lake biogeochemical processes, we applied metagenomic analyses to investigate the microbial diversity and their biogeochemical roles in sediment and water of thermokarst lakes in the Yellow River Source Area (YRSA). Sediment microbial communities (SMCs) had lower species and gene richness than water microbial communities (WMCs). Bacteria were the most abundant component in both SMCs and WMCs with significantly different abundant genera. The functional analyses showed that both SMCs and WMCs had low potential in methanogenesis but strong in aerobic respiration, nitrogen assimilation, exopolyphosphatase, glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterases, and polyphosphate kinase. Moreover, SMCs were enriched in genes involved in anaerobic carbon fixation, aerobic carbon fixation, fermentation, most nitrogen metabolism pathways, dissimilatory sulfate reduction, sulfide oxidation, polysulfide reduction, 2-phosphonopropionate transporter, and phosphate regulation. WMCs were enriched in genes involved in assimilatory sulfate reduction, sulfur mineralization, phosphonoacetate hydrolase, and phosphonate transport. Functional potentials suggest the differences of greenhouse gas emission, nutrient cycling, and living strategies between SMCs and WMCs. This study provides insight into the main biogeochemical processes and their properties in thermokarst lakes in YRSA, improving our understanding of the roles and fates of these lakes in a warming world.					; Ren, Ze/AAB-2920-2019; Wang, Qing/HKN-3460-2023	Ren, Ze/0000-0002-1473-2697; Wang, Qing/0000-0002-8806-6228; Li, Xia/0000-0003-4595-9170; 													0095-3628	1432-184X				APR	2023	85	3			SI		904	915		10.1007/s00248-022-02053-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-022-02053-1		JUN 2022						35650293					WOS:000804597800001

In view of a recently articulated elimination agenda, a deeper understanding of the spatio-temporal distribution of schistosomiasis intermediate host snails is pivotal. We conducted cross-sectional malacological surveys during the dry season (April/May 2013) and after the short rainy season (October 2013) in N'Djamena, the capital of Chad. Snails were identified at the genus and species level using morphological keys and molecular DNA barcoding approaches. Those belonging to Bulinus and Biomphalaria were examined for cercarial shedding. Snail habitats were characterised and their predictive potential for the presence of schistosomiasis intermediate host snails explored. Seasonal patterns were studied using geographical information system and kriging in order to interpolate snail abundance data to make predictions at non-sampled locations across N'Djamena. Overall, 413 Bulinus truncatus, 369 Bulinus forskalii and 108 Biomphalaria pfeifferi snails were collected and subjected to cercarial shedding. During the dry season, one Bu. truncatus of 119 snails collected shed Schistosoma spp. cercariae (0.84%), while S. mansoni was shed by one of 108 Bi. pfeifferi snails (0.93%). None of the snails collected after the rainy season shed Schistosoma spp. cercariae. The abundance of Bu. truncatus and Bu. forskalii showed an inverse U-shape relationship with the square term of conductivity, i.e. low abundance at the lowest and highest levels of conductivity and high abundance at intermediate levels. Bi. pfeifferi showed a negative, linear association with pH in the dry seasons. It is planned to link these intermediate host snail data to infection data in human populations with the goal to draw a predictive risk map that can be utilised for control and elimination of schistosomiasis in N'Djamena.

J	Winder, M; Hunter, DA				Winder, Monika; Hunter, Deborah A.			Temporal organization of phytoplankton communities linked to physical forcing	OECOLOGIA												The performance of individual phytoplankton species is strongly governed by the thermal stratification's impact on vertical mixing within the water column, which alters the position of phytoplankton relative to nutrients and light. The present study documents shifts in phytoplankton structure and vertical positioning that have accompanied intensified long-term stratification in a natural ecosystem. Ordination analysis is used to extract gradients in phytoplankton composition in Lake Tahoe, an extremely nutrient-poor lake, over a 23-year period of records. Community structure in the 1980s was associated most strongly with resource availability (low nitrogen to phosphorus ratios, deeper euphotic zone depth), while intensified stratification dominated the phytoplankton structure since the late 1990s. Within diatoms, small-sized cells increased with reduced mixing, suggesting that suppressed turbulence provides them with a competitive advantage over large-sized cells. Among the morphologically diverse chlorophytes, filamentous and coenobial forms were favored under intensified stratification. The selection for small-sized diatoms is accompanied by a shoaling trend in their vertical position in the water column. In contrast, the motile flagellates displayed a deeper vertical positioning in recent years, indicating that optimal growth conditions shifted likely due to reduced upwelling of nutrients. As the thermal stratification of lakes and oceans is strongly linked to climate variables, the present study confirms that climate warming will alter phytoplankton structure and dynamics largely through effects on nutrient availability and sinking velocities. Intensified stratification should favor the expansion of small-sized species and species with the capability of buoyancy regulation, which may alter primary productivity, nutrient recycling, and higher trophic productivity.

However, little is known regarding the functionality of ecosystem degradation on the source of POM in the water of a karst lake. To fill this knowledge gap, herein we compared the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of POM prior to and after ecosystem degradation in the karst lake Caohai Lake, located in the southwest of China, and analyzed the source of POM using a combination of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes (delta C-13-delta N-15). Our results showed that the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration and pH values decreased, and the concentrations of POM in water increased by 11% and 31% in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The decrease in the delta C-13 value of POM was accompanied by the increase in the delta N-15 value of POM in the water of Caohai lake. Prior to the ecosystem's degradation, sediment resuspension (28%) and submerged macrophytes (33%) were the dominant sources of POM in lake water. In contrast, sediment resuspension (51%) was the major source of POM after the ecosystem's degradation. Environmental factors, including DO, turbidity, water depth, and water temperature, that are related to photosynthesis and sediment resuspension are the main factors controlling the spatiotemporal distribution of POM. The resuspension of sediment reduced the transparency of the water, limiting effective photosynthesis, impeding the survival of submerged macrophytes, and, consequently, deteriorating the ecosystem. We propose that the control of sediment resuspension is important for improving the water transparency that creates an appropriate habitat for the restoration of the submerged macrophyte community.

Seasonal analysis of bacteriological quality of drinking water sources in communities surrounding Lake Bosomtwe in the Ashanti Region of Ghana	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The 26 communities surrounding the rim of the largest Crater Lake in Africa, the Lake Bosomtwe, depend on the lake for livelihood support. Water sources such as lake, streams and boreholes used as drinking water sources were collected quarterly for a period of 2years. These were analysed bacteriologically for the determination of total and faecal coliform, Escherichia coli, Aeromonas sp., Enterococcus sp., Salmonella sp., Pseudomonas sp. and total heterotrophic bacteria (THB) using membrane filtration and pour platetechniques. The seasonal variations of these bacteria in the water sources were determined. The results showed variation of bacteria counts in all the water sources. The highest E. coli counts of 2.9x10(3)cfu/100ml were recorded in the lake and the least in the borehole 2.1x10(1)cfu/100ml. The difference between the total coliform, faecal coliform and E. coli counts and the water sources was significant (p<0.05). All the bacteria count with the exception of THB, in the different water sources, had higher bacteria counts during the dry season than the wet season which are statistically significant (p<0.05). The bacteria contamination of these water sources renders them bacteriologically not suitable for drinking purposes; therefore, drinking these waters without any form of treatments could pose health risk to consumers. These water sources can, however, be used for domestic purposes.																			2190-5487	2190-5495				JUN	2019	9	4							82	10.1007/s13201-019-0959-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13201-019-0959-z													WOS:000466853300006

The Potential Influence of Short-term Environmental Variability on the Composition of Testate Amoeba Communities in Sphagnum Peatlands	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Testate amoebae are a group of moisture-sensitive, shell-producing protozoa that have been widely used as indicators of changes in mean water-table depth within oligotrophic peatlands. However, short-term environmental variability (i.e., sub-annual) also probably influences community composition. The objective of this study was to assess the potential influence of short-term environmental variability on the composition of testate amoeba communities in Sphagnum-dominated peatlands. Testate amoebae and environmental conditions, including hourly measurements of relative humidity within the upper centimeter of the peatland surface, were examined throughout the 2008 growing season at 72 microsites within 11 peatlands of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, USA. Relationships among testate amoeba communities, vegetation, depth to water table, pH, and an index of short-term environmental variability (EVI), were examined using nonmetric multidimensional scaling and correlation analysis. Results suggest that EVI influences testate amoeba communities, with some taxa more abundant under highly variable conditions (e.g., Arcella discoides, Difflugia pulex, and Hyalosphenia subflava) and others more abundant when environmental conditions at the peatland surface were relatively stable (e.g., Archerella flavum and Bullinularia indica). The magnitude of environmental variability experienced at the peatland surface appears to be primarily controlled by vegetation composition and density. In particular, sites with dense Sphagnum cover had lower EVI values than sites with loose-growing Sphagnum or vegetation dominated by vascular plants and/or non-Sphagnum bryophytes. Our results suggest that more environmental information may be inferred from testate amoebae than previously recognized. Knowledge of relationships between testate amoebae and short-term environmental variability should lead to more detailed and refined environmental inferences.

J	Blanco-González, A; López-Sáez, JA; Alba, F; Abel, D; Pérez, S				Blanco-Gonzalez, Antonio; Antonio Lopez-Saez, Jose; Alba, Francisca; Abel, Daniel; Perez, Sebastian			Medieval landscapes in the Spanish Central System (450-1350): a palaeoenvironmental and historical perspective	JOURNAL OF MEDIEVAL IBERIAN STUDIES												This paper presents a long-term synthetic overview of the socio-ecological dynamics responsible for the shaping of present-day rural landscapes in the Spanish Central System. Available historical and palaeoenvironmental records have been compiled and cross-referenced to characterise key transformations unfolding in this mountainous macro-region during the medieval time span. A sharp deforestation of upland pines and midland oaks was due to extensive Late Antique strategies. Pre-tenth-century trajectories are diverse and exhibit the recovery of high-mountain pine forests and highly localised agro-pastoral impact on selective mid-altitude niches. The eleventh-century early repopulation policy implied migrations, increased momentum of rural village foundation and extension of colonised agrarian landscapes in the tablelands of the Extremadurii. The pace and intensity of these phenomena depended on ecological and historical circumstances, leading to subsequently different realities. By the mid-thirteenth century the definitive pacification and the rising demographic trend facilitated the later permanent occupation and the ensuing integral and sustainable exploitation of the highlands - and especially the Transierra - within the feudal system. High-altitude landscapes exhibit intensive forest clearances due to transterminant livestock movements and the benefit of seasonal resources, whereas low-altitude settings specialised in arboriculture and diversified crops to supply urban markets.

A spatial and seasonal assessment of river water chemistry across North West England	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This paper presents information on the spatial and seasonal patterns of river water chemistry at approximately 800 sites in North West England based on data from the Environment Agency regional monitoring programme. Within a GIS framework, the linkages between average water chemistry (pH. sulphate, base cations, nutrients and metals) catchment characteristics (topography, land cover, soil hydrology, base flow index and geology), rainfall, deposition chemistry and geo-spatial information on discharge consents (point sources) are examined. Water quality maps reveal that there is a clear distinction between the uplands and lowlands. Upland waters are acidic and have low concentrations of base cations, explained by background geological sources and land cover. Localised high concentrations of metals occur in areas of the Cumbrian Fells which are subjected to mining effluent inputs. Nutrient concentrations are low in the uplands with the exception sites receiving effluent inputs from rural point sources. In the lowlands, both past and present human activities have a major impact on river water chemistry. especially in the urban and industrial heartlands of Greater Manchester, south Lancashire and Merseyside. Over 40% of the sites have average orthophosphate concentrations > 0.1 mg-P l(-1). Results suggest that the dominant control on orthophosphate concentrations is point source contributions from sewage effluent inputs. Diffuse agricultural sources are also important, although this influence is masked by the impact of point sources. Average nitrate concentrations are linked to the coverage of arable land, although sewage effluent inputs have a significant effect on nitrate concentrations. Metal concentrations in the lowlands are linked to diffuse and point sources. The study demonstrates that point sources, as well as diffuse sources, need to be considered when targeting measures for the effective reduction in river nutrient concentrations. This issue is clearly important with regards to the European Union Water Framework Directive, eutrophication and river water quality. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This study provides dynamic water mapping with daily frequency and a moderate (500 m) resolution over a heterogeneous thermokarst landscape in eastern Siberia. A combination of random forest and conditional generative adversarial networks (pix2pix) machine learning (ML) methods were applied to data fusion between the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2, with the addition of ancillary hydrometeorological information. The results show that our algorithm successfully filled in observational gaps in the MODIS data caused by cloud interference, thereby improving MODIS data availability from 30.3% to almost 100%. The water fraction estimated by our algorithm was consistent with that derived from the reference MODIS data (relative mean bias: -2.43%; relative root mean squared error: 14.7%), and effectively rendered the seasonality and heterogeneous distribution of the Lena River and the thermokarst lakes. Practical knowledge of the application of ML to surface water monitoring also resulted from the preliminary experiments involving the random forest method, including timing of the water-index thresholding and selection of the input features for ML training.

Based on extensive field data and Landsat data (2011-2018), this article developed a retrieval model suitable for turbidity. The determination coefficient (R-2) of the model was 0.946 and the root-mean-square error was 23.82 NTU. The model was implemented to obtain the turbidity information of hundreds of lakes in Northeast China (1984-2018). The results revealed the distinctive spatial pattern of water turbidity values of the lakes (i.e., high turbidity in the south; low turbidity in the northwest; and moderate turbidity in the east). In terms of temporal pattern, the water turbidity values of most lakes trended downward at an average rate of 1.39 NTU/a (P < 0.05) with obvious seasonal differences (i.e., decreased from May to the lowest in July, and then increased from September onward). Finally, we quantitatively examined how several typical factors affect turbidity variation at different scales. We found that water turbidity was highly correlated with NDVI (R = 0.56, P < 0.001), followed by water temperature and wind speed (0.02 < R < 0.5, P < 0.05). Water turbidity varies because of the interaction of multiple factors (e.g., area, temperature, water depth, precipitation, and land use) instead of one factor. This article highlights the potential of remote sensing in large-scale and long-term monitoring of lake water quality, and provides important information and support for water quality management in China.

J	Gebre, S; Boissy, T; Alfredsen, K				Gebre, Solomon; Boissy, Thibault; Alfredsen, Knut			Sensitivity to climate change of the thermal structure and ice cover regime of three hydropower reservoirs	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												This study examines the effect of climate-induced changes on the thermal state and ice cover regime of three reservoirs in Norway: Tesse, Follsjoe and Alta. The model used for the task is MyLake which is a one-dimensional deterministic model for lake ice and thermal stratification, which we modified to handle the effects of reservoir outflows. The model was first validated using observational datasets and it reproduced the vertical temperature profiles of the reservoirs, the withdrawal temperatures, and the ice cover dynamics reasonably well. The mean absolute error for vertical temperature predictions ranged from 0.7 degrees C to 1.13 degrees C. The validated model was then applied to investigate the impacts of climate change on the ice cover regime, the seasonal temperature profiles in general and the withdrawal water temperatures in particular. The climate change model forcings come from the medium level emission scenario A1B and two global circulation models (GCMs), which are dynamically downscaled using a regional climate model (RCM). Some of the predicted effects of climate change include: a reduction in ice cover duration ranging between 15 to 44 days in 2050s and 27 to 81 days in 2080s, depending on the scenarios and hydro-climatic conditions of the reservoirs. As a consequence of this, the period of stratification is lengthened by 20-31 days in 2050s, and 22-36 days in 2080s. The results also revealed that the southern near coastal reservoir (Follsjoe) is much more sensitive to the climate change signals compared to the inland (Tesse) and arctic (Alta) reservoirs.

However, there is no systematic study being conducted on the EDLNNR's historical trend of land use/land cover (LULC). Therefore, it is crucial to understand the relationship between changes in functional zones' boundary and spatio-temporal changes in the LULC from pre-establishment to the present time for adequate protection. The objective of this study is to understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of LULC changes from 1979 to 2019 in the three functional zones of EDLNNR during the dry season. LULC transition matrix and landscape metrics at the landscape level were also used to investigate the land type dynamics and landscape fragmentation, respectively. An increase in the marsh area was observed in all three functional zones of EDLNNR. The built-up area was increased due to the conversion of agricultural land. The landscape metrics-based analysis showed that the EDLNNR was less fragmented in 2019 than the previous record in 2016, due to the adjustment action of the three functional zones' boundary of the EDLNNR in 2018. The excluded area of the EDLNNR was from its experimental zone, which includes densely populated areas and surrounding agricultural land and woodland. The spatio-temporal LULC change information can offer effective management and conservation of different functional zones of the EDLNNR. This study can also act as a case model for effective management of other protected areas worldwide.

The urban lakes in Wuhan, China, which is known as 'city of hundreds of lakes', are facing substantial threats mainly due to rapid urbanization. This paper focused on detecting the spatial and temporal change of urban lakes in Wuhan, using a long time series of Landsat and HJ-1A remotely sensed data from 1987 to 2016. The permanent disappearance and seasonal fluctuation of 28 main urban lakes were analysed, and their relationships with climatic change and human activities were discussed. The results show that most lakes in Wuhan had shrunk over the past 30 years resulting in a permanent change from water to land. The shrinkage was also most apparent in the central region of the city. Seasonal fluctuations of lake area were evident for most lakes but the relative important driving variable of lake area change varied between sub-periods of time for different lakes. The explanatory power of impervious surface to five-year permanent water change is 91.75%, suggesting that urbanization - as increasing impervious surface - had led to the shrinkage of urban lakes in Wuhan. In all, 128.28 km(2) five-year permanent water disappeared from 1987 to 2016.

In this paper, we derived a time series of major lake surface areas across Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (XUAR), China, based on an eight-day MODIS time series in 500 m resolution from 2000 to 2014. A classification approach based on water index and dynamic threshold selection was first developed to accommodate varied spectral features of water pixels at different temporal steps. The overall classification accuracy for a MODIS-derived water body is 97% compared to a water body derived using Landsat imagery. Then, monthly composites of water bodies were derived for the months of April, July, and September to identify seasonal patterns and inter-annual dynamics of 10 major lakes (>100 km(2)) in XUAR. Our results indicate that the changing trends of surface area of major lakes varied across the region. The surface areas of the Ebinur and Bosten Lakes showed a significant shrinking trend. The Ulungur-Jili Lake remained relatively stable during the entire period. For mountain lakes, the Barkol Lake showed a decreasing trend in April and July, but the Sayram Lake showed a significant expanding trend in September. The four plateau lakes exhibited significant expanding trends in all three seasons except for Arkatag Lake in July. The shrinking of major lakes reflects severe anthropogenic impacts due to agricultural and industrial needs, in addition to the impact of climate change. The pattern of lake changes across the XUAR can provide insight into the impact of climate change and human activities on regional water resources in this arid and semi-arid region.

Methane sources in arctic thermokarst lake sediments on the North Slope of Alaska	GEOBIOLOGY												The permafrost on the North Slope of Alaska is densely populated by shallow lakes that result from thermokarst erosion. These lakes release methane (CH4) derived from a combination of ancient thermogenic pools and contemporary biogenic production. Despite the potential importance of CH4 as a greenhouse gas, the contribution of biogenic CH4 production in arctic thermokarst lakes in Alaska is not currently well understood. To further advance our knowledge of CH4 dynamics in these lakes, we focused our study on (i) the potential for microbial CH4 production in lake sediments, (ii) the role of sediment geochemistry in controlling biogenic CH4 production, and (iii) the temperature dependence of this process. Sediment cores were collected from one site in Siqlukaq Lake and two sites in Sukok Lake in late October to early November. Analyses of pore water geochemistry, sedimentary organic matter and lipid biomarkers, stable carbon isotopes, results from CH4 production experiments, and copy number of a methanogenic pathway-specific gene (mcrA) indicated the existence of different sources of CH4 in each of the lakes chosen for the study. Analysis of this integrated data set revealed that there is biological CH4 production in Siqlukaq at moderate levels, while the very low levels of CH4 detected in Sukok had a mixed origin, with little to no biological CH4 production. Furthermore, methanogenic archaea exhibited temperature-dependent use of in situ substrates for methanogenesis, and the amount of CH4 produced was directly related to the amount of labile organic matter in the sediments. This study constitutes an important first step in better understanding the actual contribution of biogenic CH4 from thermokarst lakes on the coastal plain of Alaska to the current CH4 budgets.

Impact of Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) on Water Quality, Stream Sediments and Periphytic Diatom Communities in the Surrounding Streams of Aljustrel Mining Area (Portugal)	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Aljustrel mining area is located in the Iberian Pyrite Belt, one of the greatest concentrations of massive sulphide deposits that extends from Lousal (Portugal) to AznalcA(3)llar (Spain). The surrounding streams, Roxo, Agua Azeda and Agua Forte, are influenced by the erosion of the tailing deposits and the input of acid mine drainage (AMD) from the abandoned Aljustrel pyrite mines, recently reopened in 2007. The purpose of this study was to understand how these adverse conditions influenced the stream sediments, water quality and periphytic diatom communities and establish the pre-restoration local conditions to judge the success of rehabilitation program now under way. For stream sediments, the highest metal concentration samples were found at sites F, G and H. Arsenic, Cu, Fe, Pb and Sb detected concentrations, generally exceeded the probable effect concentration values reaching level 4: the highest toxicity level. In surficial water samples of AMD affected sites (F, G and H), low pH values (1.5 to 3.5) and high metal concentrations of As (6,837 mu g L-1), Cd (455 mu g L-1), Cu (68,795 mu g L-1), Fe (1,262,000 mu g L-1), Mn (19,451 mu g L-1), Pb (136 mu g L-1), and Zn (264,377 mu g L-1) were found. In these sites, the diversity index (H') for diatoms was low (0.6 to 2.8) and the dominant taxa were Eunotia exigua (site F, 33.5%) and Pinnularia acoricola (abundances in sites: F, 86.8%; G, 88.5%; and H, 91.1%). In opposition, in less AMD impacted, H' was high (1.5 to 4.6) and low metal concentrations and high pH were found. Achnanthidium minutissimum was the dominant taxon in (abundances in sites: A, 76.1% and B, 24.39%). Canonical correspondence analysis showed that spatial variation due to mine influence was more important than seasonal variation, which did not show any pattern.

Ruby			Future hurricane storm surge risk for the US gulf and Florida coasts based on projections of thermodynamic potential intensity	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Coastal populations in the global tropics and sub-tropics are vulnerable to the devastating impacts of hurricane storm surge and this risk is only expected to rise under climate change. In this study, we address this issue for the U.S. Gulf and Florida coasts. Using the framework of Potential Intensity, observations and output from coupled climate models, we show that the future large-scale thermodynamic environment may become more favorable for hurricane intensification. Under the RCP 4.5 emissions scenario and for the peak hurricane season months of August-October, we show that the mean intensities of Atlantic hurricanes may increase by 1.8-4.2 % and their lifetime maximum intensities may increase by 2.7-5.3 % when comparing the last two decades of the 20th and 21st centuries. We then combine our estimates of hurricane intensity changes with projections of sea-level rise to understand their relative impacts on future storm surge using simulations with the National Weather Service's SLOSH (Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes) model for five historical hurricanes that made landfall in the Gulf of Mexico and Florida. Considering uncertainty in hurricane intensity changes and sea-level rise, our results indicate a median increase in storm surge ranging between 25 and 47 %, with changes in hurricane intensity increasing future storm surge by about 10 % relative to the increase that may result from sea level rise alone, with highly non-linear response of population at risk.

J	Wicaksono, SA; Russell, JM; Bijaksana, S				Wicaksono, Satrio A.; Russell, James M.; Bijaksana, Satria			Compound-specific carbon isotope records of vegetation and hydrologic change in central Sulawesi, Indonesia, since 53,000 yr BP	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Lake Matano (2 degrees 29.1'S 121 degrees 20'E) in central Sulawesi, the deepest and one of the largest lakes in Indonesia, provides an excellent opportunity to reconstruct long-term hydrological and vegetation changes at the heart of the Maritime Continent within the tropical Western Pacific Warm Pool. We measured the carbon isotopic composition of terrestrial leaf waxes (delta C-13(wax)) in new sediment cores from Lake Matano to understand regional variations in vegetation and their interactions with local and high latitude climate forcings during the past 53 kyr. Variations in delta C-13(wax) record the expansion and contraction of C-3 versus C-4 vegetation as well as changes in plants' carbon and water use efficiency and, by inference, regional hydroclimate. During Marine Isotope Stages 1 and 3, more negative delta C-13(wax). values indicate that closed-canopy C-3 rainforests predominated in Sulawesi, reflecting a wetter, less seasonal climate. In contrast, more positive delta C-13(wax) values record a terrestrial ecosystem with more abundant open canopy vegetation and possible expansion of C-4 grasses between 29 and 14 ka BP, indicating that during Marine Isotope Stage 2, including the Last Glacial Maximum, the climate was more arid, likely with increased precipitation seasonality, in central Sulawesi. Comparison of our record with other paleovegetation and paleohydrological records from Sulawesi and nearby islands suggests coherent long-term hydrological changes in central Indonesia that appear to be sensitive to high latitude climate across glacial-interglacial boundaries. However, variations in the amplitude of the response of vegetation to these glacial-interglacial forcings highlight the importance of regional topographic control on climate and vegetation and suggest an important role for higher elevations in maintaining rainforest refugia during regionally arid time intervals when C4 savannas and grasslands expanded at lower elevations.

Environmental Impacts on Skin Microbiomes of Sympatric High Arctic Salmonids	FISHES												In the region of King William Island, Nunavut, in the Canadian high Arctic, populations of salmonids including Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), cisco (Coregonus autumnalis and C. sardinella) as well as lake whitefish (C. clupeaformis) are diadromous, overwintering in freshwater and transitioning to saline waters following ice melt. Since these fish were sampled at the same time and from the same traditional fishing sites, comparison of their skin structures, as revealed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, has allowed an assessment of influences on wild fish bacterial communities. Arctic char skin microbiota underwent turnover in different seasonal habitats, but these striking differences in dispersion and diversity metrics, as well as prominent taxa involving primarily Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, were less apparent in the sympatric salmonids. Not only do these results refute the hypothesis that skin communities, for the most part, reflect water microbiota, but they also indicate that differential recruitment of bacteria is influenced by the host genome and physiology. In comparison to the well-adapted Arctic char, lake whitefish at the northern edge of their range may be particularly vulnerable, and we suggest the use of skin microbiomes as a supplemental tool to monitor a sustainable Indigenous salmonid harvest during this period of change in the high Arctic.

Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is a common method to obtain large-scale surface deformation, especially in mountainous terrain where it is difficult to install a large number of monitoring sites. Here, we used Sentinel-1A SAR data acquired from March 2017 to March 2021 to monitor surface deformation and estimate active layer thickness (ALT) using two methods-temperature-based and soil moisture-based-in the permafrost regions of the Heihe River Basin on the northeast Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. We find that the seasonal deformation amplitude ranges 10-60 mm, and the annual mean vertical deformation trend ranges from -40 to 30 mm/a. We verify the ALT estimates with observations and find that the method based on soil moisture has higher accuracy and is therefore more applicable in this particular study area. The ALT gradually decreases from the southeast to the northwest, ranging from 0.3 to 6.5 m, with an average value of 2.47 m. These results contribute to better quantifying the response of permafrost change and to understanding the spatial distribution of ALT on a large scale, serving as guidance for engineering and other applications.					peng, xiaoqing/ABE-1509-2021; tian, jie/ABD-4663-2021; tian, weiwei/GSN-8325-2022; Peng, Sijia/NZN-5298-2025	tian, jie/0000-0002-4845-5085; 													2169-9003	2169-9011				APR	2023	128	4							e2022JF006782	10.1029/2022JF006782	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022JF006782													WOS:000968839400001

Lake restoration led to a re-oligotrophication in the 1990s with a decrease in seasonal phytoplankton biovolume until the late 1990s, but a reversed trend from the early 2000s onwards. We hypothesize that recent changes in phytoplankton biomass and functional structure are triggered by changes in lake nitrogen and silica concentrations, and we expect climate-related factors to modulate the trophic status of Piburger See. Phytoplankton data were analyzed by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) applied on biovolume of morpho-functional groups, combined with correlation analyses of environmental variables. Since the 2000s, short-term changes in phytoplankton of Piburger See were explained by varying concentrations and ratios of nitrogen and silica, while the inter-annual variability in phytoplankton species composition was rather attributed to superimposed rising water temperature and lake thermal stability. Our results underline the co-dominant role of phosphorus and nitrogen as phytoplankton drivers in lakes that experience periods of nitrogen limitation. The combined impact of nutrients and climate on phytoplankton development can thus mimic short-term increases in the trophic level of less productive lakes.					; Nickus, Ulrike/C-2063-2019; Tolotti, Monica/D-4441-2018	Nickus, Ulrike/0000-0001-6041-5329; Thies, Hansjoerg/0000-0001-8153-2428; Tolotti, Monica/0000-0003-2674-8597													0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2012	698	1					61	75		10.1007/s10750-012-1146-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1146-5													WOS:000309345700006

Recent changes in drainage route and outburst magnitude of the Russell Glacier ice-dammed lake, West Greenland	CRYOSPHERE												Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) or jokulhlaups from ice-dammed lakes are frequent in Greenland and can influence local ice dynamics and bedrock motion, cause geomorphological changes, and pose flooding hazards. Multidecadal time series of lake drainage dates, volumes, and flood outlets are extremely rare. However, they are essential for determining the scale and frequency of future GLOFs, for identifying drainage mechanisms, and for mitigating downstream flood effects. In this study, we use high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) and orthophotos (0.1 x 0.1 m) generated from uncrewed-aerial-vehicle (UAV) field surveys, in combination with optical satellite imagery. This allows us to reconstruct robust lake volume changes associated with 14 GLOFs between 2007 and 2021 at Russell Glacier, West Greenland. As a result, this is one of the most comprehensive and longest records of ice-dammed lake drainages in Greenland to date. Importantly, we find a mean difference of similar to 10 % between our lake drainage volumes when compared with estimates derived from a gauged hydrograph 27 km downstream. Due to thinning of the local ice dam, the potential maximum drainage volume in 2021 is similar to 60 % smaller than that estimated to have drained in 2007. Our time series also reveals variations in the drainage dates ranging from late May to mid-September and drainage volumes ranging between 0.9 and 37.7 Mm(3). We attribute these fluctuations between short periods of relatively high and low drainage volumes to a weakening of the ice dam and an incomplete sealing of the englacial tunnel following the large GLOFs. This syphoning drainage mechanism is triggered by a reduction in englacial meltwater, likely driven by late-season drainage and sudden air temperature reductions, as well as annual variations in the glacial drainage system. Furthermore, we provide geomorphological evidence of an additional drainage route first observed following the 2021 GLOF, with a subglacial or englacial flow pathway, as well as supraglacial water flow across the ice margin. It seems probable that the new drainage route will become dominant in the future. This will drive changes in the downstream geomorphology and raise the risk of flooding-related hazards as the existing buffering outlet lakes will be bypassed.					; Kjeldsen, Kristian Kjellerup/A-9592-2013; Khan, Shfaqat Abbas/B-2664-2012; Kjeldsen, Kristian/A-9592-2013; Bjørk, Anders/B-1625-2013; Khan, Shfaqat/B-2664-2012; Bjork, Anders Anker/B-1625-2013	Domgaard, Mads/0000-0001-5066-7514; Kjeldsen, Kristian Kjellerup/0000-0002-8557-5131; Khan, Shfaqat Abbas/0000-0002-2689-8563; Huiban, Flora/0000-0002-3582-1840; Carrivick, Jonathan/0000-0002-9286-5348; Bjork, Anders Anker/0000-0002-4919-792X													1994-0416	1994-0424				MAR 31	2023	17	3					1373	1387		10.5194/tc-17-1373-2023	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1373-2023													WOS:000961074100001

The parameters were the initial ozone demand (IOD), ozone decay rate constant after the IOD (k(sec)), ratio of OH radical exposure to the ozone exposure (R-Ct), and ratio of ozone consumption to the OH radial exposure multiplied by the second-order rate constant for the reaction of the OH radical with an OH radical probe compound (). The seasonal variations in water quality had the most significant influence on R-Ct (39-64%), followed by k(sec) (35-38%), (27-34%), and IOD (11-25%) for the raw lake water and sand-filtered water in which the numbers inside parentheses indicate the percent standard deviation of the measured values for 1year. For the oligotrophic-type lake water, the seasonal variation in water temperature (6-26 degrees C) had the most significant influence on the k(sec), R-Ct, and . The was newly found to be inversely related with water temperature, possibly due to the temperature-dependent OH radical yield from ozone decomposition. This implies that the OH radical oxidation capacity during ozonation can be significantly influenced by the temperature due to the varying ozone decomposition rate and the intrinsic OH radical yield. This study also demonstrated the is a useful, alternative parameter to the R-Ct for describing or predicting OH radical exposure from ozone consumption especially when the ozone decay is rapid or varies over time such as the initial ozonation phase of natural water or wastewater where a considerable OH radical exposure takes place.					; Shin, Jaedon/AAC-6988-2022	Lee, Yunho/0000-0001-5923-4897; Shin, Jaedon/0000-0002-3262-186X; 													0191-9512	1547-6545				MAR 3	2016	38	2					100	114		10.1080/01919512.2015.1079120	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01919512.2015.1079120													WOS:000372016700004

Phylogenetic Inference of Colony Isolates Comprising Seasonal Microcystis Blooms in Lake Taihu, China	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Blooms of the toxin-producing cyanobacterium, Microcystis spp., are an increasingly prevalent water quality problem and health hazard worldwide. China's third largest lake, Lake Taihu, has been experiencing progressively more severe Microcystis blooms over the past three decades. In 2009 and 2010, individual Microcystis colonies, consisting of four different morphospecies, were isolated and genotyped using a whole-cell multiplex PCR assay. The 16S-23S rDNA-ITS sequences were aligned based on Bayesian inference and indicated that one morphospecies was genetically unique (Microcystis wesenbergii) and three were indistinguishable (Microcystis aeruginosa, Microcystis flos-aquae, and Microcystis ichthyoblabe). Microcystin (mcyB) genes were detected intermittently in two of the morphospecies while the other two morphospecies lacked the mcyB gene in all samples. Water temperature was found to influence bloom formation and morphotype prevalence, and chlorophyll a and temperature were positively and significantly correlated with microcystin concentration. Cooler water temperatures promoted toxigenic strains of Microcystis. Wind appeared to influence the distribution of morphotypes across the lake, with M. aeruginosa and M. ichthyoblabe being more susceptible to wind stress than M. wesenbergii and M. flos-aquae. The results of this study indicated that the blooms were composed of a variety of Microcystis morphospecies, with more genotypes observed than can be attributed to individual morphotypes. We conclude that morphology is not a reliable indicator of toxigenicity in Lake Taihu, and caution should be exercised when the M. aeruginosa morphotype is present because it is capable of producing MC-LR, the most toxic microcystin isoform.

J	Peng, YJ; Xiao, J; Nakamura, T; Liu, BL; Inouchi, Y				Peng, YJ; Xiao, J; Nakamura, T; Liu, BL; Inouchi, Y			Holocene East Asian monsoonal precipitation pattern revealed by grain-size distribution of core sediments of Daihai Lake in Inner Mongolia of north-central China	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Two sediment cores recovered in the central part of Daihai Lake in north-central China were analysed at 2- to 4-cm intervals for grain-size distribution. Grain-size distributions of the lake sediments are inferred to be a proxy for past changes in East Asian monsoon precipitation, such that greater silt-size percentage and higher median grain size reflect increased monsoonal precipitation rates. The grain-size record of Daihai Lake sediments spanning the last ca 10,000 yr indicates that the monsoonal precipitation in the lake region can be divided into three stages: the Early, Middle and Late Holocene. During the Early Holocene before ca 7900 cal yr BP, the median grain size (Md) and the silt-fraction content were relatively low and constant, suggesting relatively low precipitation over the lake region. The Middle Holocene between ca 7900 and 3100 cal yr BP was marked by intensified and highly variable monsoonal precipitation, as indicated by high and variable Md values and silt contents of the lake sediments. During this period, average precipitation rate gradually increased from ca 7900 to 6900 cal yr BP, displayed intense oscillations between ca 6900 and 4400 cal yr BP, and exhibited a decreasing trend while fluctuating from ca 4400 to 3100 cal yr BP. Although generally high during the Middle Holocene, both the Md and the silt content assumed distinctly low values at the short intervals of ca 6500-6400, 6000-5900, 5700-5600, 4400-4200 cal yr BP, implying that monsoonal precipitation might have been significantly reduced during these intervals. During the Late Holocene since ca 3100 cal yr BP, grain-size values suggest that precipitation decreased. However, during the Late Holocene, relatively higher Md values and silt contents occurring between ca 1700 to 1000 cal yr BP may denote an intensification of hydrological cycles in the lake area. Changes in the East Asian monsoonal precipitation were not only directly linked with the changing seasonality of solar insolation resulting from progressive changes in the Earth's orbital parameters, but also may have been closely related to variations in the temperature and size of the Western Pacific Warm Pool, in the intensity of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, and in the path and strength of the North Equatorial Current in the western Pacific.

Inference of the spatio-temporal variability and storage potential of groundwater in data-deficient regions through groundwater models and inversion of impact factors on groundwater, as exemplified by the Lake Victoria Basin	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Groundwater is an important resource for supporting domestic water use for people's livelihoods and for maintaining ecosystems. Borehole observations provide the first-hand data that characterise the fluctuation, depth, and aquifer conditions of the groundwater. Unfortunately, such observations are not available or are insufficient for scientific use in many regions. Taking the Lake Victoria Basin (LVB) as an example of data-deficient regions, this study proposes a simple knowledge-based approach that uses the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM) for the main data, with rainfall, hydrological, topographical and geological datasets as supports, by which to infer the spatio-temporal variability and storage potential of groundwater. The method is based on analysis and inversion of impact factors on groundwater, and the feasibility of such a method is proven by showing that the groundwater results from GLDAS CLSM can correctly indicate the seasonality, as well as the link to topographical and geological features. For example, both results from the water balance equation (WBE) and GLDAS CLSM indicate that there are two groundwater recharge seasons in the basin, e.g., March to May and September to November. Compared to the eastern side of the LVB, the western side has mountains blocking surface runoff, and thus, reasonably, has larger storage potential estimates in GLDAS CLSM. Due to the low degree of weathering of the basement rocks, it is expected that there is only small storage potential and variation of groundwater in the southeastern parts of the LVB. GLDAS CLSM also correctly reflects this behaviour. Additionally, the largest groundwater storage potential over the LVB is found in regions near the Kagera River and the western shoreline, since it associates with unconsolidated rocks and behaviours of large groundwater recharge from GLDAS CSLM during the wet year of 2006. The major limitation of this knowledge-based method is that the uncertainty in terms of magnitude on GLDAS CLSM groundwater changes cannot be assessed, in addition to the fact that the reliability of the results cannot be quantified in terms of specific numbers. Therefore, the results and interpretation of groundwater behaviours using such methods can only be a guide for 'where' and 'when' to find groundwater. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Shifts in phytoplankton community structure in response to hydrological changes in the shallow St Lucia Estuary	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Hydrological regimes are key in shaping the structure of phytoplankton communities in estuaries. Because anthropogenic disturbances often alter the quantity and quality of riverine inputs, this research focused on investigating phytoplankton dynamics in the St. Lucia Estuary, since being reconnected to the Mfolozi River. Due to the closed mouth state of the estuary, the input from the river resulted in oligohaline (>= 5) conditions and the characteristic reverse salinity gradient to persist throughout the study (i.e. one year). Model results indicated that phytoplankton communities were structured by rainfall, light transmittance and depth, while shifts between dominant groups were driven by salinity and flow season. The persistence of chlorophytes and euglenophytes as the co-dominant functional group indicates the freshening and nutrient-enriched nature of the river. This study provides the first detailed account documenting the response of the phytoplankton community to recent restoration efforts in the St Lucia Estuary, a Ramsar Site.					; Adams, Janine/AAA-9865-2021	Adams, Janine/0000-0001-7204-123X; Nunes, Monique/0000-0002-6538-1815; 													0025-326X	1879-3363				MAR	2018	128						275	286		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.01.035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.01.035								29571374					WOS:000430645600032

A significant change is demonstrated in the descriptive statistical characteristics, such as the mean and the variance after a change point in 1999 by nonparametric techniques. Therefore, two models namely, mono- and multiple-time trend (Mono-and Multiple-TT), are applied to remove trends observed in the UL water level. In case of Mono-TT model, the trend assessment of water level exhibit downward trend significantly. In case of Multiple-trend model, the time series is divided into before and after change point subseries and a linear time trend model is fitted to each subseries. The results showed a significant increasing and decreasing trend, respectively. Furthermore, this paper have developed hybrid time series models including Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) and Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) fitted to detrended values by Mono-and Multiple-TT models. The criteria evaluation demonstrates the adequacy of SARIMA, Mono-and Multiple-TT-SARIMA models and their combination with GARCH approach for modeling monthly water level which have significant trends. The GARCH models indicate the existence of short-run persistency in the water level. The proposed SARIMA and Mono-TT-SARIMA and their combination with the GARCH models are found useful for modeling the water level with significant trends.

Transcriptome discovery in non-model wild fish species for the development of quantitative transcript abundance assays	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY D-GENOMICS & PROTEOMICS												Environmental studies increasingly identify the presence of both contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) and legacy contaminants in aquatic environments; however, the biological effects of these compounds on resident fishes remain largely unknown. High throughput methodologies were employed to establish partial transcriptomes for three wild-caught, non-model fish species; smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), white sucker (Catostomus commersonii) and brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus). Sequences from these transcriptome databases were utilized in the development of a custom nCounter CodeSet that allowed for direct multiplexed measurement of 50 transcript abundance endpoints in liver tissue. Sequence information was also utilized in the development of quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) primers. Cross-species hybridization allowed the smallmouth bass nCounter CodeSet to be used for quantitative transcript abundance analysis of an additional non-model species, largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). We validated the nCounter analysis data system with qPCR for a subset of genes and confirmed concordant results. Changes in transcript abundance biomarkers between sexes and seasons were evaluated to provide baseline data on transcript modulation for each species of interest. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We defined lakes in pristine condition as reference lakes and adapted a fish multimetric index of biotic integrity. The floodplain lakes analyzed were Baixio, Preto, Anana, Araca, Maraca and Poraque, located 30-400 km from Manaus, the state capital. To select the reference lakes we adapted a rapid bioassessment protocol that analyzes satellite imagines from Google Earth. Landscape characteristics were investigated in two different screening phases: preliminary (presence/absence) and final (semi-quantitative). Each screening phase used two landscape scales: buffer-zone (a 6 km-diameter circle around each lake) and local (an area extending 500 m from the lake's shoreline). The landscape attributes selected in these screening phases allowed us to define an Environmental Gradient Index (EGI) that represented the effect of the human presence on the lakes. Lakes Araca and Anana, which had no or very few signs of anthropogenic disturbance, were classified in the high EGI category and selected as reference lakes. A floodplain-lake index of biotic integrity (FL-IBI) was developed from twenty candidate fish assemblage metrics, of which four were selected after range, sensitivity, responsiveness and redundancy tests for inclusion in the final index (total number of species, total number of individuals, total number of individuals with moderate-high vulnerability and percentage of carnivores). Metrics were scored continuously from 0 to 10. Final FL-IBI scores were calculated by adding the scores for each selected metric and dividing the result by the number of metrics. To facilitate comparison with other indices, this was weighted to range from 0 to 100. The FL-IBI proved to be able to distinguish well between reference and non-reference lakes. Index scores had wide seasonal and temporal variability, largely because of the major changes in habitat caused by the intensity, duration, frequency and occurrence of the Solimoes flooding cycle. For the reference lakes, the lowest seasonal index variability (CV < 5%) was observed in the receding-water period, allowing us to consider this as the best index period for biomonitoring purposes. The greatest annual variability for the study period (2004-2007) was observed in 2005 ( CV > 20%) and was associated with the severe drought occurred in that year. These results show that the fish assemblages in the lakes studied are highly resilient and perfectly adapted to the hydrological cycle of the Solimoes River. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A mid-Holocene paleoprecipitation record from Belize	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Understanding past climate may contribute to a better understanding of future climate change, allowing for adaptations to changing water resources. High latitude paleoclimate reconstructions reveal a warmer northern hemisphere during the mid-Holocene, yet paleoclimate records from tropical Central America are lacking, especially seasonally resolved reconstructions needed to resolve seasonal shifts. Here we reconstruct mid-Holocene precipitation using high-resolution (sub-annual to biannual) stable isotope ratios (oxygen and carbon) extracted from a speleothem recovered from Belize to investigate the frequency and magnitude of precipitation variability. We found a slight increase in precipitation during the mid-Holocene in Belize with less variability compared to the late-Holocene. This increase in precipitation may be a result of the expansion of the North Atlantic Subtropical High (NASH), which strengthens the Caribbean Lower Level Jet, enhancing westward advection of atmospheric moisture to Belize. The decrease in precipitation variability could be derived from a northward movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) placing Belize within the bounds of the ITCZ for a longer period each year. Time series analysis reveals periodicities of 200-250 years which correspond to the Suess solar cycle. The additional periods of similar to 100 and similar to 50 years also have origins in solar irradiance. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV; also known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO)), long recognized as important drivers of precipitation variability in the region, are present but only at the 90% significance level. We posit that the reduced influence of the NAO and AMV could be caused by the northerly migration of the ITCZ during the mid-Holocene. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Two different samples S1-10 and S2-10 were taken from under the salt crust of Chott El Jerid in the dry season. DGGE analysis revealed that bacterial sequences were related to Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, unclassified bacteria, and Deinococcus-Thermus phyla. Anaerobic fermentative and sulfate-reducing bacteria were also detected in this ecosystem. Within the domain archaea, all sequences were affiliated to Euryarchaeota phylum. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that 16S rRNA gene copy numbers of bacteria was 5 x 10(6) DNA copies g(-1) whereas archaea varied between 5 x 10(5) and 10(6) DNA copies g(-1) in these samples. Eight anaerobic halophilic fermentative bacterial strains were isolated and affiliated with the species Halanaerobium alcaliphilum, Halanaerobium saccharolyticum, and Sporohalobacter salinus. These data showed an abundant and diverse microbial community detected in the hypersaline thalassohaline environment of Chott El Jerid.

This condition is caused by excessive nutrient inputs to aquatic systems, and one of the main consequences is accelerated phytoplankton growth. Eutrophication can lead to damage to human health, the environment, society, and the economy. One of the most serious consequences of eutrophication is the proliferation of cyanobacteria that can release toxins into the water. The aim of this research was to evaluate the trophic condition of a tropical reservoir over the course of time, using a database extending over 15 years to investigate relationships with environmental conditions, considering spatial heterogeneity and seasonality, as well as inter-relations between trophic state indicators. Data for chlorophyll-a, total phosphorus, and total nitrogen were collected from 2000 to 2014, and cyanobacteria abundance was determined from 2004 to 2014. The trophic state index was also calculated. The results demonstrated the existence of two distinct compartments in the reservoir: one lotic and the other lentic. No relationship was observed between chlorophyll-a and phosphorus. The results suggested that phytoplankton growth was mainly controlled by nitrogen concentrations. These conditions favored cyanobacteria predominance, resulting in increasing abundance of these potentially toxic bacteria over time. The model obtained indicated hypereutrophic conditions, with high phytoplankton biomass and cyanobacteria abundance during the next years likely to affect the uses of the water of the reservoir.

Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology was used in this study.Results The bacterial community structure in the water was different from that in the sediment of Poyang Lake during extreme flood seasons. The bacterial diversity in water was much lower than that in sediment. In the water column, the dominant phyla were Actinobacteriota, while the composition of bacteria in sediment was more complex than that in water, and the dominant phyla in sediment were Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteriota, and Actinobacteriota. The bacterial diversity in the water of Poyang Lake showed seasonal dynamics, while no seasonal variation of bacterial communities in sediment was observed. The bacterial community structure in the sediment from the two bays and channel areas of Poyang Lake can be distinguished from each other. The microbial diversity in sediment gradually increased from the Sancha Bay to the Zhouxi Bay and then to the channel, but the total nitrogen (TN) concentration in sediment (STN) and the total phosphorus (TP) concentration in sediment (STP) showed opposite trends. This might be due to the anthropogenic disturbances from the extreme flood. The bacterial community structure in, water column was significantly correlated with WT, NH4-N, STP, SOM, Chl a, DO, TP, and Eh, while the bacterial community structure in sediment was significantly correlated with SOM and STP.Conclusion The bacterial community structure in water was greatly different from that in sediment in Poyang Lake during extreme flood seasons. The bacterial community structure in the water column was not only sensitive to the geochemical characteristics of the water but also affected by some nutrient concentrations in the sediment. During the wet seasons, bacterial diversity was only affected by SOM and STP.																				1664-302X				APR 3	2024	15								1362968	10.3389/fmicb.2024.1362968	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2024.1362968								38633691					WOS:001203774400001

Rs was measured for 24 h during each of three different stages of the growing season on four different degraded levels. The results showed: (1) peak Rs occurred at around 5:00 p.m., regardless of the degree of degradation and growing season stage, with the maximum Rs reaching 10.05 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) in non-degraded meadows rather than other meadows; (2) the daily mean Rs value was 7.14-7.86 mu mol.m(-2.)s(-1) during the mid growing season in non-degraded meadows, and declined by 48.4-62.6% when degradation increased to the severely degraded level; (3) Q(10) ranged from 7.1-11.3 in non-degraded meadows during the mid growing season, 5.5-8.0 and 6.2-8.2 during the early and late growing seasons, respectively, and show a decline of about 50% from the non-degraded meadows to severely degraded meadows; (4) Rs was correlated significantly with soil temperature at a depth of 0-5 cm (p < 0.05) on the diurnal scale, but not at the seasonal scale; (5) significant correlations were found between Rs and soil organic carbon (SOC), between biomass and SOC, and between Q(10) and Rs (p < 0.05), which indicates that biomass and SOC potentially impact Q(10). The results suggest that vegetation degradation impact both Rs and Q(10) significantly. Also, we speculated that Q(10) of alpine wetland meadow is probable greater at the boundary region than inner region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and shoule be a more sensitive indicator in the studying of climate change in this zone.

Variations in water level height, nutrient condition, light availability and water temperature affect the growth and species composition of SAV. Detailed information about seasonal variations in littoral bottom coverage are still unknown, although these effects are expected to mask climate change-related long-term changes, as derived by snapshots of standard monitoring methods included in the European Water Framework Directive. Remote sensing offers concepts to map SAV quickly, within large areas, and at short intervals. This study analyses the potential of a semi-empirical method to map littoral bottom coverage by a multi-seasonal approach. Depth-invariant indices were calculated for four Atmospheric & Topographic Correction (ATCOR2) atmospheric corrected RapidEye data sets acquired at Lake Kummerow, Germany, between June and August 2015. RapidEye data evaluation was supported by in situ measurements of the diffuse attenuation coefficient of the water column and bottom reflectance. The processing chain was able to differentiate between SAV and sandy sediment. The successive increase of SAV coverage from June to August was correctly monitored. Comparisons with in situ and Google Earth imagery revealed medium accuracies (kappa coefficient = 0.61, overall accuracy = 72.2%). The analysed time series further revealed how water constituents and temporary surface phenomena such as sun glint or algal blooms influence the identification success of lake bottom substrates. An abundant algal bloom biased the interpretability of shallow water substrate such that a differentiation of sediments and SAV patches failed completely. Despite the documented limitations, mapping of SAV using RapidEye seems possible, even in eutrophic lakes.

Experimental determination of acetylene and ethylene solubility in liquid methane and ethane: Implications to Titan's surface	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												In this study, the solubility of acetylene (or ethyne, C2H2) and ethylene (or ethene, C2H4) in liquid methane (CH4) and ethane (C2H6) has been experimentally determined at Titan surface temperature (90 K) and pressure (1.5 bars). As predicted by theoretical models, the solubilities of acetylene and ethylene are very large at Titan temperature and these species are most likely to be abundantly present in the lakes and as evaporites on the shores or dry lake beds. Our results indicate the solubility of 4.9 x 10(-2) mole fraction for acetylene in methane and 48 x 10(-2) mole fraction in ethane; for ethylene, 5.6 x 10(-1) mole fraction in methane and 4.8 x 10(-1) mole fraction in ethane. Assuming the mole fractions from atmospheric models in the lower stratosphere and equilibrium with the surface, we determined that the lakes on Titan that cover similar to 400,000 km(2) are not saturated. The liquid lakes on Titan act as an important reservoir for both acetylene and ethylene. Assuming difference of methane and ethane content in the lakes at different latitudes, the difference in solubility in liquid methane and ethane, solutes in lakes may change with the temporal evolution (such as; evaporation and condensation) over seasons and geological time scales.

J	Hamilton, SK				Hamilton, Stephen K.			Biogeochemical implications of climate change for tropical rivers and floodplains	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Large rivers of the tropics, many of which have extensive floodplains and deltas, are important in the delivery of nutrients and sediments to marine environments, in methane emission to the atmosphere and in providing ecosystem services associated with their high biological productivity. These ecosystem functions entail biogeochemical processes that will be influenced by climate change. Evidence for recent climate-driven changes in tropical rivers exists, but remains equivocal. Model projections suggest substantial future climate-driven changes, but they also underscore the complex interactions that control landscape water balances, river discharges and biogeochemical processes. The most important changes are likely to involve: (1) aquatic thermal regimes, with implications for thermal optima of plants and animals, rates of microbially mediated biogeochemical transformations, density stratification of water bodies and dissolved oxygen depletion; (2) hydrological regimes of discharge and floodplain inundation, which determine the ecological structure and function of rivers and floodplains and the extent and seasonality of aquatic environments; and (3) freshwater-seawater gradients where rivers meet oceans, affecting the distribution of marine, brackish and freshwater environments and the biogeochemical processing as river water approaches the coastal zone. In all cases, climate change affects biogeochemical processes in concert with other drivers such as deforestation and other land use changes, dams and other hydrological alterations and water withdrawals. Furthermore, changes in riverine hydrology and biogeochemistry produce potential feedbacks to climate involving biogeochemical processes such as decomposition and methane emission. Future research should seek improved understanding of these changes, and long-term monitoring should be extended to shallow waters of wetlands and floodplains in addition to the larger lakes and rivers that are most studied.

Effects of Cluster Light Exposure on 3-Isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine Accumulation and Degradation Patterns in Red Wine Grapes (Vitis vinifera L. Cv. Cabernet Franc)	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY												The effects of light exposure on 3-isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine (IBMP) accumulation and degradation in Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Franc berries were assessed by comparison of shaded and exposed clusters within the same vine throughout a growing season. Twenty-seven vines were shoot-thinned to create regions of high and low cluster-light exposure within each vine. Samples were collected at 10 time points starting from 5 to 130 days postbloom. The experimental design allowed for intravine comparison of IBMP levels between treatments at each time. Vine-to-vine variability of IBMP and the correlation of IBMP to malic acid were also evaluated. Cluster exposure reduced accumulation of IBMP at all preveraison time points by 21-44%, but did not increase postveraison degradation. Significant vine-to-vine variability in IBMP content was observed, with the highest level of IBMP in shaded berries in the most vigorous block of vines. Although IBMP concentration by weight decreased significantly due to dilution just prior to color change (veraison), no significant IBMP degradation per berry occurred until after color change (day 70 postbloom). By contrast, malic acid degradation began prior to color change, and malic acid concentrations were not affected by cluster exposure preveraison, but were affected postveraison. A survey of 13 sites in New York state (Seneca Lake) showed that IBMP concentrations at 2 weeks preveraison were highly correlated (R-2 = 0.936, p < 0.0001) to levels at harvest, whereas classic grape maturity indices at harvest were uncorrelated with IBMP at harvest. In summary, light exposure conditions critically influence IBMP accumulation but not IBMP degradation.

This mission will provide a comprehensive inventory of worldwide water resources, lakes, reservoir storage, and river dynamics. In this work, we carried out a preliminary assessment of SWOT's Lake product Level 2 version 1.1, also known as "L2_HR_LakeSP". The analysis was performed across six diverse lakes on three continents, revealing an average median bias of 0.08 m with respect to the considered reference, after suitable outlier removal. An overall precision of 0.22 m was found, combined with an average correlation of 68% between SWOT and reference time series. Moreover, the accuracy varied in the considered six lakes, since biases up to some decimeters were found for some of them; they could be due to residual inconsistencies between the vertical reference frame of SWOT and that of the considered reference. In summary, the first analysis of the "L2_HR_LakeSP" product, Version 1.1, demonstrated the promising potential of SWOT for monitoring seasonal variations in water levels. Nevertheless, notable anomalies were found in the water masks, particularly in higher latitudes, suggesting potential difficulties in accurately delineating water bodies in those regions. Additionally, a discernible reduction in accuracy was observed towards the end of the monitoring period. These preliminary findings indicate some issues that should be addressed in future investigations about the quality and potential of SWOT's lake products for advancing our understanding of global water dynamics.

Aerosol pattern changes over the dead sea from west to east - Using high-resolution satellite data	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												The area of the Dead Sea, a terminal lake on the border between Israel and Jordan, has gone through extensive environmental changes in recent decades, stemming from several processes including extreme evaporation and land degradation. Our study explored the distribution and the long-term high-resolution climatology of the Dead Sea aerosols, using satellite-retrieved Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) measurements. We used the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm that provides AOD measurements at a 1 km resolution. MAIAC retrievals for the entire study period (2000-2016) have shown a very good agreement (r = 0.8) with the nearby AERONET station. For the first time, the AOD temporal distribution and its variability, on both Dead Sea coasts, were calculated on a monthly/seasonal basis. Three main aerosol pollution patterns (i.e. high-levels of AOD) emerged as follows: western focalized (75 and 59% of the months examined for Aqua and Terra, respectively), eastern focalized (14 and 24%), and similar levels of pollution on both coasts (11 and 17%, respectively). Using the Normalized AOD Difference (NAODD) metric, we studied how the AOD spatial patterns changed and when. Following the negative trends in most of the months, our analysis has demonstrated a shift towards unexplained increasing pollution levels over the Jordanian eastern side. For March-April, this shift had already occurred, and the potential reasons including changes in synoptic regimes are discussed. Local and global implications are of much regional interest because of the Dead Sea deterioration and the need for urgent environmental policy changes.																			1352-2310	1873-2844				DEC 15	2020	243								117737	10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.117737	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.117737													WOS:000587335700004

Disentangling the lifestyle of bacterial communities in tropical soda lakes	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Microbial lifestyles may reveal niche-specific signatures and can contribute to detecting the effects of abiotic fluctuations on biogeochemical cycles. Microorganisms make a tradeoff between optimizing nutrient uptake, improving biomass yield, and overcoming environmental changes according to environmental hostility. Soda lakes are natural environments rich in carbonate and bicarbonate water, resulting in elevated pH and salinities that frequently approach saturation. We hypothesized that during the dry period (elevated pH and salinity), microorganisms try to overcome this harshness by allocating energy to the cellular maintenance process. As these environmental conditions improve during the wet period, microorganisms will begin to invest in nutrient uptake. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated four soda lakes in two different seasons by applying metagenomics combined with flow cytometry (estimate heterotrophic bacterial biomass). The natural occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in some lakes is the main driver of carbon. These primary producers provide organic carbon that supports heterotrophic bacterial growth and, consequently, a high biomass yield. Under harsh conditions (dry season), cyanobacteria invest in nutrient uptake mechanisms, whereas heterotrophic bacteria allocate energy to survive at the expense of biomass yield.

Flux measurements were conducted using floating chambers with and without bubble shields, and by using a boundary layer gas transfer model before, during, and after an annually occurring algal bloom from June to October 2019. Water and air temperature, salinity, wind, sediment organic content, and organic content of floating algal biomass were found to successfully discriminate the different habitats in terms of methane flux, both over periods of days and over a season. Multivariate statistical analysis was used to establish the relative environmental forcing of methane emissions over one growth season for each flux method. Floating algal biomass carbon and sediment organic content were identified as the most important controlling factors for methane emissions based on flux chamber measurements over a period of days to weeks, whereas water and air temperature and wind velocity were the most important factors based on the gas transfer model on these time scales. Over the season, water and air temperature were the most important controlling factors with both methods. We present a first attempt how our observations can be extrapolated to determine the coastal methane emission along the coastline.																				2296-7745				AUG 12	2021	8								657459	10.3389/fmars.2021.657459	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.657459													WOS:000686169900001

Most of metal levels in Alburnus akili were higher than those of other fish species as followings: Pb 5.25 mg kg(-1), Cd 4.00 mg kg(-1), Zn 23.75 mg kg(-1), Ni 4.01 mg kg(-1), Cr 24.45 mg kg(-1), Mn 17.53 mg kg(-1), Co 5.90 mg kg(-1), Mg 283.06 mg kg(-1), Sr 27.40 mg kg(-1), K 514.09 mg kg(-1) and Li 49.38 mg kg(-1). The highest concentrations of Cu and Ca were determined in Scardinius erythrophthalmus as 2.68 mg kg(-1) and 538.83 mg kg(-1) respectively. The highest concentrations of Bi and Na were measured in Gobio gobio microlepidotus as 6.05 mg kg(-1) and 423.56 mg kg(-1) respectively. Maximum Fe (13.98 mg kg(-1)) content was determined in Tinca tinca compared to other species. Concentrations of Pb and Cd in the muscle tissue of all the fish species exceeded the tolerance levels of national and international guidelines but were below Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake (PTWI) limits set by FAO/WHO. The contents of Ni, Cr and Mn in specimens were also higher than the tolerance levels of some guidelines. On the contrary, levels of Zn, Cu and Fe were below the limits of guidelines and PTWI.

Microscopic analysis revealed that the varve record is curtailed due to the incomplete formation or preservation of annual laminae, necessitating interpolation. The program for varve interpolation presented here analyses the seasonal layer distribution and automatically derives a sedimentation rate estimate, which is the basis for interpolation, and applies it to complement the original varve count. As the interpolation is automated it largely avoids subjectivity, which manual interpolation approaches often suffer from. Application to the Late Glacial chronology from Lake Suigetsu demonstrates the implementation and the limits of the method. To evaluate the reliability of the technique, the interpolation result is compared with the C-14 chronology from Lake Suigetsu, calibrated with the tree-ring derived section of the IntCal09 calibration curve. The comparison shows that the accuracy of the interpolation result is well within the 68.2% probability range of the calibrated C-14 dates and that it is therefore suitable for calibration beyond the present tree-ring limit.

A semi-automated tool for surface water mapping with RADARSAT-1	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Fresh water is arguably the most vital resource for all aspects of a healthy and stable environment and society. Monitoring the extent of surface water enables resource managers to detect perturbations and long-term trends in water availability and set consumption guidelines accordingly. Radar in general, and RADARSAT-1 in particular, is very good at detecting open surface water and has been used operationally for flood monitoring in many countries. Significant radar data archives now exist to analyse seasonal, annual, and decadal trends in surface water availability. A software tool (Forest non-Forest Class Extraction or FnFCE), based on software initially designed for deforestation classification with RADARSAT-1 data and later modified to include a flood mapping capability, has been adapted for this surface water application. Three test sites have been selected to demonstrate this surface water mapping tool, including Fort Mackay, Alberta, a tar sands area with water used for industrial purposes; Cache Lake in Tuktut Nogait National Park, Northwest Territories, where the many park lakes are currently poorly monitored and understood; and Old Crow Flats, Yukon Territory, a large area of ponds and lakes thought to be at risk from permafrost degradation and important to caribou migration and oil and gas development. This paper describes the software tool and demonstrates preliminary results of monitoring seasonal and annual changes in surface water distribution using RADARSAT-1 imagery for the three test sites. An overview of the successes and limitations of the approach is given, as well as a summary of the current state of evolution of the method and the envisioned software development plan.

J	Li, TX; Guo, SB; An, DF; Nametso, M				Li, Tianxin; Guo, Shanbo; An, Difei; Nametso, Matomela			Study on water and salt balance of plateau salt marsh wetland based on time-space watershed analysis	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												We analysed the eco-hydrological characteristics of the Bojiang Haizi River basin, which is the location of the Erdos Larus Relictus Nature Reserve plateau salt marsh wetland. The study found that the restoration of the plateau salt marsh is more of a water quality problem than a water quantity problem. Simply maintaining the balance of water volume without considering water quality will destroy the original stable ecosystem. Therefore, water balance analysis was conducted for the overall water resources in the basin on the basis of simulated data of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool module. We examined remote sensing and water quality monitoring data via geographic information system-3D technology to meet the requirements of water quality and quantity in wetland restoration. We established the hydrological dynamic relationship model of lake storage capacity-elevation-area-salinity and found that the lake presents an alternating cyclic rule of salt accumulation and dilution during seasonal changes. This pattern is an important guarantee for the healthy and sustainable development of the salt marsh wetland. Lastly, the survival salinity of the organism was selected as the target salinity (5 g/L), and the corresponding target water amount was simulated as 20.17 x 10(6) m(3); the target lake area was 9.48 km(2). Through an analysis of three water transfer scenarios, we found that under the optimum balance condition between water quantity and salt concentration, simulating the water transfer mode in precipitation replenishment is an effective means to restore the wetland during breeding season. The findings of this study may improve our understanding of the eco-hydrological characteristics of plateau salt marsh wetlands and help managers protect and restore water balance using water-salt dynamic models.

This research reports the observed climatic data and measured water levels of saline lakes from the local meteorological stations in the Zabuye salt lake, the Dangqiong Co salt lake and the Bankog Co salt lake in recent two decades. Combining with satellite remote sensing maps, we have analyzed the changes of the water level of these three lakes in recent years and discussed the origins of the changes induced by the meteorological factors. The results show that the annual mean temperature and the water level reflect a general ascending trend in these three lakes during the observation period. The rising rates of the annual mean temperature were 0.08 degrees C/yr during 1991-2014 and 0.07 degrees C/yr during 2004-2014, and of the water level, were 0.032 m/yr and 0.24 m/yr, respectively. Analysis of changes of the meteorological factors shows the main cause for the increase of lake water quantity are the reduced lake evaporation and the increased precipitation in the lake basins by the rise of average temperature. Seasonal variation of lake water level is powered largely by the supply of lake water types and the seasonal change of regional climate.

It is hypothesized that most of these fatalities are due to localized, severe winds produced by intense thunderstorms over the lake during the rainy season and larger scale, intense winds over the lake during the dry season. The intense winds produce a rough state of the lake (big wave heights) that cause fishing boats to capsize. In this region, weather radars have never been a primary tool for monitoring and nowcasting high impact weather. The Tanzania Meteorological Agency operates an S-band polarimetric radar in Mwanza, Tanzania, along the south shore of Lake Victoria. This radar collects high temporal and spatial resolution data that is now being used to detect and monitor the formation of deep convection over the lake and improve scientific understanding of storm dynamics and intensification. Nocturnal thunderstorms and convection initiation over the lake are well observed by the Mwanza radar and are strongly forced by lake and land breezes and gust fronts. Unexpected is the detection of clear air echo to ranges >= 100 km over the lake that makes it possible to observe low-level winds, gust fronts, and other convergence lines near the surface of the lake. The frequent observation of extensive clear air and low-level convergence lines opens up the opportunity to nowcast strong winds, convection initiation, and subsequent thunderstorm development and incorporate this information into a regional early warning system proposed for Lake Victoria Basin (LVB). Two weather events are presented illustrating distinctly different nocturnal convection initiation over the lake that evolve into intense morning thunderstorms. The evolution of these severe weather events was possible because of the Mwanza radar observations; satellite imagery alone was insufficient to provide prediction of storm initiation, growth, movement, and decay.																				2073-4433				NOV	2019	10	11							706	10.3390/atmos10110706	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos10110706													WOS:000502272000068

Sinninghe; Schouten, Stefan			Long-chain diols in rivers: distribution and potential biological sources	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Long-chain diols (LCDs) occur widespread in marine environments and also in lakes and rivers. Transport of LCDs from rivers may impact the distribution of LCDs in coastal environments, however relatively little is known about the distribution and biological sources of LCDs in river systems. In this study, we investigated the distribution of LCDs in suspended particulate matter (SPM) of three river systems (Godavari, Danube, and Rhine) in relation with precipitation, temperature, and source catchments. The dominant long-chain diol is the C-32 1,15-diol followed by the C-30 1,15-diol in all studied river systems. In regions influenced by marine waters, such as delta systems, the fractional abundance of the C-30 1,15-diol is substantially higher than in the river itself, suggesting different LCD producers in marine and freshwater environments. A change in the LCD distribution along the downstream transects of the rivers studied was not observed. However, an effect of river flow is observed; i.e., the concentration of the C-32 1,15-diol is higher in stagnant waters such as reservoirs and during seasons with river low stands. A seasonal change in the LCD distribution was observed in the Rhine, likely due to a change in the producers. Eukaryotic diversity analysis by 18S rRNA gene sequencing of SPM from the Rhine showed extremely low abundances of sequences (i.e., <0.32% of total reads) related to known algal LCD producers. Furthermore, incubation of the river water with C-13-labeled bicarbonate did not result in C-13 incorporation into LCDs. This indicates that the LCDs present are mainly of fossil origin in the fast-flowing part of the Rhine. Overall, our results suggest that the LCD producers in rivers predominantly reside in lakes or side ponds that are part of the river system.					; Peterse, Francien/AAY-1473-2021; BALZANO, Sergio/L-7936-2017; Villanueva, Laura/N-3598-2014; Hefter, Jens/LNR-6235-2024; Peterse, Francien/H-5627-2011; Balzano, Sergio/L-7936-2017; Schouten, Stefan/P-4380-2016; van der Meer, Marcel/L-3450-2013; Mollenhauer, Gesine/B-5190-2015; Damste, Jaap/F-6128-2011; Mollenhauer, Gesine/AAD-8167-2019	Hefter, Jens/0000-0002-5823-1966; BALZANO, Sergio/0000-0002-3172-1332; Peterse, Francien/0000-0001-8781-2826; Hopmans, Ellen/0000-0002-8209-1334; van der Meer, Marcel/0000-0001-6454-1752; Mollenhauer, Gesine/0000-0001-5138-564X; Lattaud, Julie/0000-0001-8089-6502; 													1726-4170	1726-4189				JUL 9	2018	15	13					4147	4161		10.5194/bg-15-4147-2018	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-4147-2018													WOS:000437882200001

Polar lakes have short ice-free seasons, and small changes in ice cover duration have the potential to provoke alterations to ecosystem structure. However, these lakes are understudied, and the consequences for mixing regimes, thermal structures and biogeochemical processes remain unclear. We measured three annual cycles of dissolved oxygen, temperature and specific conductivity in a lake at similar to 83 degrees N to investigate limnological processes and their interannual variability. There were sharp interannual contrasts in lake dynamics, with state shifts in mixing, stratification and oxygen regimes due to air temperature variability and meteorological events. We also observed unusual thermal profiles that were associated with solute gradients. These striking differences underscore the sensitivity of high Arctic lakes to interannual variations in meteorological forcing, and their susceptibility to regime shifts in response to ongoing global change.

However, systematic reviews on how habitat features, sampling and data evaluation influence temporal patterns are rather sporadic. Here, we reviewed 307 peer-reviewed scientific articles to characterize the methods and the approaches, as well as to identify the knowledge gaps in the assessment of the temporal dynamics of freshwater fish assemblages with special regard to their stability patterns. The number of publications increased exponentially over decades. We revealed a highly uneven distribution of the studies among continents and ecosystems with a dominant number of papers derived from North America and Europe, and from lotic systems, especially. We also found large variability among studies even within similar habitat types in the examined spatial and temporal scales, sampling methods used, examined assemblage attributes, potential stressors and data analyses. Several knowledge gaps, such as the limited number of large-scale studies, the insufficient knowledge on the long-term dynamics of early life history stages and on trait-based assemblage organization, were highlighted. For enabling meaningful comparisons of fish assemblage dynamics in space and time, further developments in standardization procedures are needed across sampling and data evaluation possibilities. Publicly accessible long-term data sets with more details on sampling and environmental parameters would also be critically important to determine the effect of a variety of factors on the stability vs. variability of fish assemblages.

Macrophytes and groundwater drive extremely high organic carbon concentration of soda pans	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Endorheic soda pans are among the highest dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content aquatic systems on the planet with concentrations up to 1 g/L. Considering the importance of inland waters in the global carbon cycle, understanding the drivers of such outstanding organic carbon pools is eminent. The soda pans of the Carpathian Basin present a wide variability of biotic and abiotic characteristics that provide an adequate system to assess the determinants of extreme high DOC concentrations. Here, we demonstrate through a multi-site comparison, a multi-year seasonal monitoring, and a laboratory experiment that the dissolved organic matter content of the highest DOC concentration soda pans is primarily of groundwater and emergent macrophyte origin. More precisely, the multi-site comparison of 14 soda pans revealed that variation of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) content of the surface water of soda pans is partially explained by the CDOM content (22% of variation) of local groundwater, indicating the significant role of allochthonous terrestrial DOC sources. Further 23% of CDOM variation could be accounted for by Bolboschoenus maritimus species-specific emergent macrophyte cover, while the contribution of Phragmites australis cover was only minor. In line with the results of the multi-site comparison, our decomposition experiment demonstrated that both B. maritimus and P. australis have the potential to release substantial amount of organic matter into soda pans. However, the organic matter release of B. maritimus leads to twice as high DOC and 3.5-times higher CDOM concentrations than P. australis. Considering previous organic matter release studies, we concluded that P. australis is a relatively low organic matter releaser emergent macrophyte, and therefore the species composition of emergent macrophytes has to be carefully considered in autochthonous plant-derived DOM estimations. Finally, the multi-year seasonal monitoring of two distinctive soda pans showed that the high organic matter concentrations depend not only on their intrinsic characteristics but also on interannual variability. More precisely, we demonstrated that the highest CDOM and DOC concentrations that occurred in a coloured (i.e. brown, low total suspended solids) soda pan with extensive (95%) macrophyte cover dominated by B. maritimus were measured in a period characterised by high pH and low water levels, which were presumably the consequence of increased evaporation due to decreased precipitation and above average temperature. Our results indicate that considering climate change trends common for most endorheic regions (i.e. increased temperature and modified precipitation regimes), extremely high organic matter concentrations might become more frequent in the near future in local water bodies, particularly in those highly influenced by groundwater inflow. Furthermore, soda pans with vast specific macrophyte cover and substantial groundwater inflow might become organic carbon processing hotspots.

Significant seasonal isotopic variations exist in precipitation and river water, and there is 1-month delay in the river water response to precipitation. The river water is gradually enriched under the influence of evaporation. However, due to the influence of recharge from external water source, the evaporation ratios do not strictly increase with the flow distance. The seasonal isotopic values in groundwater fluctuate the least. River water supplies groundwater more than precipitation in dry season.

Effects of seasonal fluctuation of amazon river discharge on the spatial and temporal changes of meiofauna and nematodes in the amazonian coast	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												In the Amazonian coast seasonal changes of environmental characteristics are the main structuring factors of coastal benthic communities. Spatial and temporal variations in meiofauna and nematofauna were studied during rainy and dry seasons in the coastal zone of the Biological Reserve of Piratuba Lake (Bazil Amazonian coast). At each site (seven sites) five samples were taken in vegetated (inside the mangrove - 100m from the border) and non-vegetated (outside of the mangrove - 100 m from the border) areas. Each sample was sliced in 0-2 cm, 2-5 cm and 5-10 cm deep layers. Water surface temperature and salinity were determined. Meiofauna was composed of 15 taxa: Nematoda, Copepoda, Ostracoda, Amphipoda, Cladocera, Isopoda, Acari, Polychaeta, Gastropoda, Turbellaria, Rotifera, Loricifera, Nemertea, Kinorhyncha, and Insect larvae. Nematoda (39 genera in 14 families) was the dominant group, accounting for 70% of the total individuals. Dctptonema, Neochromadora, Hypodondolaimus, and Dichromadora were dominant. Only salinity significantly changed between seasons and was significantly higher in the dry season. Meiofauna and nematofauna density and richness were lower than those in other mangroves worldwide. The significant changes in meiofauna and nematofauna between seasons and depths were related to higher salinity and food availability during the dry season and more food and oxygen available close to the surface (0-2 cm depth). Meiofauna did not show significant differences between vegetated and non-vegetated areas; however, higher density and richness were generally recorded in the vegetated areas, where food is more abundant, and the substrate is more stable. Non-selective deposit-feeding nematodes were dominant in all areas, seasons and depths. During the rainy season, the second most abundant feeding group was predators/omnivores as a response to an increase in organic detritus, whereas epigrowth feeders were the second most abundant group during dry season due to increased phytoplankton and phytobenthic production.					de Melo, Thaise/I-3059-2013; Venekey, Virag/Y-5614-2019; Filho, Jose/I-6638-2013														0272-7714	1096-0015				OCT 31	2019	227								106330	10.1016/j.ecss.2019.106330	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2019.106330													WOS:000489190500035

Samples of atmospheric particles and food (obtained by market basket method) from Osaka, Japan were analyzed for DP (syn-, anti-) and PBDE using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. DP was detected in both atmospheric particles and food samples. Among the atmospheric particles, DP was detected in all samples. Sigma DP concentration was 7.-15.4 pg m(-3) and anti-DP was the dominant residue among DP isomers. PBDE was also detected in all the atmospheric particles. Sigma PBDE concentration was 9.9-23.3 pg m(-3). In the market basket study, DP was detected in Groups III (sugar and confectionary), V (legumes and their products), X (fish, shellfish, and their products), and XI (meat and eggs) at concentrations of 3.3, 2.8, 1.9, and 1.5 pg g(-1) wet wt, respectively. PBDE was detected in Groups III, IV (oils and fats), V, X, XI, and XIII (seasonings and other processed foods) at concentrations of 153, 79.1, 74.6, 308, 94.8, and 186 pg g(-1) wet wt, respectively. The daily intake of Sigma DP (750 pg day(-1)) via inhalation and diet was approximately one percent of that for Sigma PBDE (62 ng day(-1)). (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In aquatic environments, the detection of rare or low-abundance species is challenging at best, and discriminating between detection failure (null) and true absence (zero) can be difficult. We developed and applied environmental DNA (eDNA) markers to screen for occurrences of bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis), silver carp (H. molitrix), and grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) in Ontario waters of Lake Erie, Lake St. Clair, and tributaries, as part of ongoing efforts to prevent these Asian carps from becoming established in the Great Lakes. A network of 180 sites in nearshore and tributary habitats, selected based on perceived risk of fish access or habitat suitability, were sampled using both boat electrofishing and/or eDNA sampling (948 water samples) throughout the 2012 open-water season. Electrofishing efforts did not capture any Asian carps, and no positive detections of environmental DNA for any of these species were obtained using both conventional and quantitative PCR. These combined results suggest that these Asian carp species are not yet established in Ontario waters of Lake Erie or Lake St. Clair, and highlight the value of combining conventional fisheries assessment and environmental DNA surveillance for assessing the potential presence of invasive species in freshwater systems.

Substantial overnight reaeration by convective cooling discovered in pond ecosystems	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Trends in freshwater dissolved oxygen (DO) reflect whole-ecosystem properties and influence organismal survival and behavior. Here we show that small ponds have unique oxygen dynamics that differ from larger lakes. We discovered that ponds undersaturated in DO experienced substantial increases in oxygen concentration overnight. Nighttime increases in DO occurred on 45% of the nights sampled and resulted in DO saturation increasing 12-fold (22% saturation) on average. Oxygen spikes were likely to occur when ponds became at least 1.8 degrees C warmer than the air and later in the season when oxygen levels were low (<31% saturation) and the air was warm (5.8 degrees C). We demonstrate that overnight increases in surface water DO resulted from atmospheric oxygen invasion as opposed to internal production. Convective cooling enhanced turbulence and air-water gas exchange, leading to intense bursts of oxygen invasion during nighttime hours. This mechanism has not been demonstrated before and has important implications for the biogeochemistry of these systems, as well as understanding how organisms survive in hypoxic small ponds.					; Raymond, Peter/C-4087-2009	Raymond, Peter/0000-0002-8564-7860; Holgerson, Meredith/0000-0002-2275-9240; Zappa, Christopher J/0000-0003-0041-2913													0094-8276	1944-8007				AUG 16	2016	43	15					8044	8051		10.1002/2016GL070206	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016GL070206													WOS:000383290300030

We analyzed a population located in the eastern Amazon region in northern Brazil. At the study site, Parananema Lake, Parintins, Amazonas state (02 degrees 40'52 '' S, 56 degrees 47'15 '' W), the species completes its life cycle in a freshwater environment influenced by the dynamics of the Amazon River. In addition to describing the population structure, this study examined data on the mortality, recruitment, and sex ratio of the population. Data were collected between March 2013 and February 2014, during which 1,300 individuals were sampled, including 386 males and 911 females (of which 155 were ovigerous). No significant difference in the mean sizes of males and females was found, and females outnumbered males in every month of the collection period. The results indicate that M. amazonicum reproduces continuously throughout the year at the study site. Peaks of different magnitudes were observed in the population size of this demographic group, with the largest occurring during the river's low-water season. These reproductive pulses resulted in bimodal monthly histograms occurring precisely in months following the observed recruitment modes. The females in this location reached maturity while they remain small in size. The smallest ovigerous female measured 5.1 mm (CL), which may be related to rapid gonadal development or extreme environmental conditions. Mortality analyses indicate that the species is not being overexploited locally, meaning that the obtained results and values were not affected by pressure from fishing. Our results confirm the existence of variations between estuarine and inland populations of M. amazonicum and indicate that the dynamics of the Amazon River, which is unique in its size and water volume, influences the life-cycle strategies of the species in the study area.					; Fransozo, Adilson/AAU-8520-2020	Elias Da Silva, Thiago/0000-0003-4663-8475; 													0278-0372	1937-240X				MAR	2017	37	2					131	141		10.1093/jcbiol/rux006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jcbiol/rux006													WOS:000401916100002

Changes in hydrology, climate, population density, and land use influence water quality in this system. We investigated long term water quality dynamics (22 years) in space and time and identified potential changes in nutrient limitation based on nutrient ratios of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus. Water quality was assessed at five sites highlighting the dynamics in wet and dry seasons. Predictors of water quality included watershed land use, climate, population, and water level. Most water quality parameters varied across TSE, except pH and nitrate that remained constant at all sites. In the last decade, there is a change in the chemical nutrient ratio suggesting that nitrogen may be the primary limiting nutrient across the system. Water quality was strongly affected by development in the watershed i.e., flooded forest loss, climatic variation, population growth, and change in water level. Seasonal variations of water quality constituents were driven by precipitation and hydrology, notably the Mekong's distinct seasonal flood pulse.					; Soum, Savoeurn/LCD-4453-2024; Null, Sarah/E-4422-2011; Tromboni, Flavia/E-8883-2017; Null, Sarah/E-4422-2011	Ngor, Peng Bun/0000-0002-3659-6577; Soum, Savoeurn/0000-0001-5939-3732; CHAN, Bunyeth/0000-0001-9102-5534; Null, Sarah/0000-0001-7451-7908; Tromboni, Flavia/0000-0001-7287-8048; 														2073-4441				AUG	2021	13	15							2059	10.3390/w13152059	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13152059													WOS:000682168100001

Environmental DNA detection and abundance estimates comparable to conventional methods for three freshwater larval species at a power plant discharge	ENVIRONMENTAL DNA												Early life stage (ELS) fishes provide a valuable metric for species, population, and ecosystem monitoring. Industrial, manufacturing, and power generating facilities in the United States can be required to monitor ELS fishes to assess impacts of facility intake waters. Traditional methods for collecting, identifying, and enumerating ELS fishes include ichthyoplankton netting and pumping from intake and discharge waters. However, sampling at these sites can prove challenging from logistical and safety standpoints, with added challenges of identifying and post-processing of ELS fishes to quantify facility impacts on waterbodies for regulatory purposes. Methods utilizing environmental DNA (eDNA) may offer improvements in these areas. This study assessed the utility of novel, species-specific qPCR assays to detect eDNA from three differentially abundant fish species (alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus; Wilson, 1811), gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum; Lesueur, 1818), and yellow perch (Perca flavescens; Mitchill, 1814)) at the outflow of an industrial site. eDNA concentrations were compared with abundance estimates derived from two conventional collection methods to explore the potential utility of eDNA-based methods in future monitoring. The likelihood of detecting gizzard shad, yellow perch, and alewife in the discharge waters of the power generation station was not significantly different among eDNA, plankton netting, or pump sampling. Results suggest successful detections differ by species and time of year for each method. Gizzard shad eDNA relative abundance correlated strongly with total larval abundances captured by the pumping but not the netting methods, whereas yellow perch eDNA abundance was found to correlate with both conventional methods. Alewife was not detected by any method, consistent with documentation of the decline in this species within the lake. Overall, our study found a positive relationship between eDNA abundance and larval fish abundance in both daily and seasonal sampling, suggesting that fluctuations in eDNA concentration may be linked to larval abundance.

The Carpathian Basin is one of those regions very important for habitat and biodiversity conservation in Europe, with natural soda lakes found in Austria, Hungary and Serbia. In comparison to other two countries from Central Europe, algal biodiversity studies of saline soda lakes in Serbia are scarce. Lake Velika Rusanda has the highest measured salinity of all saline lakes in the Carpathian Basin and there were no reports of its diatom species richness and diversity till now. We conducted 2-year investigation programme to study biodiversity and seasonal dynamics of diatoms in this lake. A total of 27 diatom taxa were found, almost all of them attached to reed and much less in benthos and plankton. Five new diatom species for Serbia were recorded, Craticula halopannonica, Navicymbula pusilla, Hantzschia weyprechtii, Nitzschia thermaloides and Navicula staffordiae. The last mentioned is new for Europe as well. Lake Velika Rusanda is inhabited mostly by alkaliphilous and halophilic diatoms. Since diatoms are used as bioindicators in soda lakes, our results will improve their further application in ecological status assessment of these fragile habitats in the Carpathian Basin.

Seasonal changes predominant over manure application in driving dissolved organic matter shifts in agricultural runoff	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Non-point source nutrient pollution can cause eutrophication, hypoxic events, and harmful algal blooms in surface waters. Surface water eutrophication is frequently attributed to agricultural runoff, a known source of inorganic and organic nutrients to surface and subsurface waters. Analysis of dissolved organic matter (DOM) using ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry is an effective tool for characterizing diverse organic nitrogen and phosphorus components of DOM that may be mineralized and/or assimilated and ultimately contribute to eutrophication. An anion exchange resin was applied to extract DOM from surface and subsurface tile runoff from agricultural plots located within the Maumee River watershed (Ohio, USA) that received raw liquid manure, polymer-treated dewatered manure, or no manure (control). DOM extracts were analyzed using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry prior to manure application and during three runoff events after manure application. Organic nitrogen compounds were predominant, making up 38-48% of the total assigned formulas. Principle coordinates analysis indicated clustering predominately by sample month and secondarily by treatment. These findings show that a large amount of variability in DOM in runoff was observed regardless of manure application, indicating the important role played by natural processes in driving transformation of the DOM pool during the growing season. Molecular ions unique to runoff from manure-applied plots were also identified that may be useful in source-tracking of non-point source nutrient pollution in waters draining to Lake Erie.

J	Tunçsiper, B				Tuncsiper, Bilal			Nitrogen removal in an aerobic gravel filtration-sedimentation pond-constructed wetland-overland flow system treating polluted stream waters: Effects of operation parameters	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Nitrogen pollution in streams can be controlled by serially constructing natural wastewater treatment (NWT) systems inside streams. Therefore, a pilot-scale hybrid NWT system consisting of gravel filtration (GF), sedimentation pond (SP), gravel filtration-free water surface constructed wetland (GF-FWSCW), and gravel filtrationoverland flow (GF-OF) was installed in order to prevent contamination in a stream (Nigde stream) that feeds and pollutes surface water source (Akkaya lake). The pilot-scale system was installed on a new 60 m-long channel which was located off the stream. Changes in ammonium (NH4+-N), organic nitrogen (N-org.), total nitrogen (TN), and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) concentrations was routinely monitored in influent and effluent of all stages of the hybrid NWT system and the bottom sediment of the SP over a one-year operation period. According to the study results, while NH4+- N plus N-org. was reduced by an average of 75% (from 49,1 mg L-1 to 7,1mg L-1), TN was reduced by an average of 85% (from 50,2mg L-1 to 12,4 mg L-1). Colder seasons and higher hydraulic loading rates (HLRs) negatively affected nitrogen removal efficiency of the pilot-system. The use of vegetation and filtermediumhad a positive effect on the average removal efficiencies. The results showed that nitrogen pollution in polluted streams could be greatly reduced by establishing a NWT system in series within them. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Domine, F; Gallet, JC; Bock, J; Morin, S				Domine, Florent; Gallet, Jean-Charles; Bock, Josue; Morin, Samuel			Structure, specific surface area and thermal conductivity of the snowpack around Barrow, Alaska	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The structure of the snowpack near Barrow was studied in March-April 2009. Vertical profiles of density, specific surface area (SSA) and thermal conductivity were measured on tundra, lakes and landfast ice. The average thickness was 41 cm on tundra and 21 cm on fast ice. Layers observed were diamond dust or recent wind drifts on top, overlaying wind slabs, occasional faceted crystals and melt-freeze crusts, and basal depth hoar layers. The top layer had a SSA between 45 and 224 m(2) kg(-1). All layers at Barrow had SSAs higher than at many other places because of the geographical and climatic characteristics of Barrow. In particular, a given snow layer was remobilized several times by frequent winds, which resulted in SSA increases each time. The average snow area index (SAI, the dimensionless vertically integrated SSA) on tundra was 3260, higher than in the Canadian High Arctic or in the Alaskan taiga. This high SAI, combined with low snow temperatures, imply that the Barrow snowpack efficiently traps persistent organic pollutants, as illustrated with simple calculations for PCB 28 and PCB 180. The average thermal conductivity was 0.21 Wm(-1) K-1, and the average thermal resistance on tundra was 3.25 m(2) K W-1. This low value partly explains why the snow-ground interface was cold, around -19 degrees C. The high SAI and low thermal resistance values illustrate the interplay between climate, snow physical properties, and their potential impact on atmospheric chemistry, and the need to describe these relationships in models of polar climate and atmospheric chemistry, especially in a climate change context.					; Morin, Samuel/E-8005-2011	Bock, Josue/0000-0003-4574-9229; Gallet, Jean-Charles/0000-0002-6153-1361; Morin, Samuel/0000-0002-1781-687X; 													2169-897X					MAR 15	2012	117								D00R14	10.1029/2011JD016647	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2011JD016647													WOS:000301671400003

J	Ogawa, T; Ohki, K; Kamiya, M				Ogawa, Taku; Ohki, Kaori; Kamiya, Mitsunobu			Differences of spatial distribution and seasonal succession among Ulva species (Ulvophyceae) across salinity gradients	PHYCOLOGIA												Ulva species are common along seashores as well as in brackish lakes and estuaries, and recent molecular phylogenetic examinations have revealed inter-and intraspecific genetic diversity and wide distributions across oceans. However, Ulva species are difficult to identify because of their simple morphologies and high plasticity, and thus ecological properties such as salinity preference and phenology have been reported for a limited number of species. This study examined the genetic diversity, spatial distribution, and seasonal succession of Ulva species collected from various salinity regimes in Mikata-goko and Minami River, Fukui, Japan, during a 2-year period. By analysing the internal transcribed spacer regions of 125 specimens from a marine site and 1169 specimens from seven brackish sites, we detected four marine species (Ulva compressa, U. linza, U. torta, and Ulva sp. 1) and six brackish species (two subspecies of U. flexuosa, U. limnetica, U. prolifera, U. simplex, Ulva sp. 2, and Ulva sp. 3). Two additional species (U. californica and Ulva sp. 4) were found in other brackish lakes. Roughly three distribution patterns (low-and high-salinity brackish, and wide-range) were recognized among the brackish species. Phenological patterns were diverse among Ulva species: some species appeared only for a few months, and others were found at all times of the year. More than one ribotype, including heterozygous ribotypes, were detected within each of the five species (U. linza, U. prolifera, U. simplex, U. torta, and Ulva sp. 1). In the most dominant species U. prolifera, ribotypes pro1, pro2, and pro1/2 were distributed from low-to high-salinity brackish sites; whereas, the other five ribotypes were restricted to the high-salinity brackish sites, suggesting ecotypic differentiation within U. prolifera.

J	Webster, IT				Webster, Ian T.			The hydrodynamics and salinity regime of a coastal lagoon - The Coorong, Australia - Seasonal to multi-decadal timescales	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The Coorong is a choked coastal lagoon in South Australia that forms part of the terminal lake system at the end of the River Murray, Australia's major river. It is an inverse estuary with a constricted channel connection to the sea at one end and extends parallel to the coast for more than 100 km away from this inlet. The present paper considers the physical dynamics of the Coorong, particularly its ecologically important salinity and water level regimes, and how these respond to connectedness with the ocean, barrage flows and meteorological conditions. The approach combines hydrodynamic modelling with measurements and considers temporal variation in the system ranging from seasonal to multi-decadal timescales. The Coorong is relatively unusual in that the major freshwater input occurs through barrages much closer to the estuary mouth than to its head. Thus, the barrage flows only 'flush' the Coorong between the barrages and the sea. Over most of its length, salt accumulating through evapo-concentration mixes back out of the system by fluctuating water motions caused by sea level variations propagating through the inlet channel and by wind. By scouring the inlet channel on a seasonal basis, barrage flows facilitate the penetration of sea level variations into the Coorong leading to enhanced along-lagoon mixing. Further, barrage flows freshen the waters near the seaward end of the system causing water of lower salt content than sea water to replace evaporative losses in its interior. By increasing the water depth in the system, barrage flows facilitate the exchange between the North and South Lagoons of the Coorong which are its two major basins. The modelling supported by measurements shows how the salinity regime in the Coorong appears to have responded to multi-year cycles of variation in discharge of the River Murray over the last 50 years. Even before the present drought, which has seen salinity in the South Lagoon exceed four times sea water, the lagoon was dominantly hypersaline. The modelling suggests that the significant reductions in freshwater inflows to the Coorong due to water resource development would have caused the South Lagoon to evolve from a state of being usually brackish to marine into its present hypersaline state. The conceptual understanding of the Coorong's physical dynamics and their encapsulation in a hydrodynamic model are enabling strategies to be evaluated for alleviation of its present degraded condition, and for its improved future management.

Associations between extreme precipitation, drinking water, and protozoan acute gastrointestinal illnesses in four North American Great Lakes cities (2009-2014)	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												Climate change is already impacting the North American Great Lakes ecosystem and understanding the relationship between climate events and public health, such as waterborne acute gastrointestinal illnesses (AGIs), can help inform needed adaptive capacity for drinking water systems (DWSs). In this study, we assessed a harmonized binational dataset for the effects of extreme precipitation events (>= 90th percentile) and preceding dry periods, source water turbidity, total coliforms, and protozoan AGI - cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis - in the populations served by four DWSs that source surface water from Lake Ontario (Hamilton and Toronto, Ontario, Canada) and Lake Michigan (Green Bay and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA) from January 2009 through August 2014. We used distributed lag non-linear Poisson regression models adjusted for seasonality and found extreme precipitation weeks preceded by dry periods increased the relative risk of protozoan AGI after 1 and 3-5 weeks in three of the four cities, although only statistically significant in two. Our results suggest that the risk of protozoan AGI increases with extreme precipitation preceded by a dry period. As extreme precipitation patterns become more frequent with climate change, the ability to detect changes in water quality and effectively treat source water of varying quality is increasingly important for adaptive capacity and protection of public health.					; Foldy, Seth/HHZ-6504-2022; Chan, Laurie/C-4055-2014	Chan, Laurie/0000-0003-4351-7483; Foldy, Seth/0000-0002-5990-5512; Rose, Joan/0000-0002-5871-0211; Brubacher, Jordan/0000-0003-4252-9992; Graydon, Ryan/0000-0002-8598-0989; Faustman, Elaine/0000-0002-3085-6403; Dellinger, Matthew/0000-0002-5325-1546; Mezzacapo, Michael/0000-0002-8990-0333													1477-8920	1996-7829				MAY	2022	20	5					849	862		10.2166/wh.2022.018	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wh.2022.018		APR 2022						35635777					WOS:000787518000001

Seasonal variation in water quality, plankton diversity and microbial load of tropical freshwater lakes in Nigeria	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												Seasonal changes significantly affect tropical ecosystems; hence, verification of how these changes affect water quality is important for waterbodies that serve as water and food sources, particular as such changes are often associated with shifts in plankton diversity and microbial loads. This study assessed the seasonal changes in water quality, plankton diversity and microbial load in four lakes serving as sources of drinking water. Temperature, hardness and phosphate concentration were elevated in the dry season, and pH, biochemical oxygen demand, transparency, turbidity, total dissolved solids, conductivity, alkalinity and nitrate concentrations were elevated in the wet season. A phytoplankton analysis revealed that Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta, Cyanophyta and Dinophyta were most common, with the families Desmidiaceae, Microcystaceae and Euglenaceae (phylum Euglenophyta) displaying dominance. For zooplankton, Rotifera was most common, with Branchionidae dominating the lakes in both seasons. In the wet season, Chlorophyta, Cyanophyta, Bacillariophyta and Dinophyta dominated, with Aphanizomenonaceae and Microcystaceae the most diverse families. Disease-causing pathogens, Ascaridae, Trichuridae and Ancylostomatidae (phylum Nematoda), were detected during periods of high rainfall. The waters in the dry season had higher microbial loads than in the wet season, ranging from 1.50 to 233.50 CFU g(-1) (p < 0.05). This demonstrates the seasonal variations in risk to users and underlies the importance of regular assessment of water quality particularly given the threat of seasonal changes elated to climate change.

High-frequency remote monitoring of large lakes with MODIS 500 m imagery	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Satellite-based remote monitoring programs of regional lake water quality largely have relied on Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) owing to its long image archive, moderate spatial resolution (30 m), and wide sensitivity in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, despite some notable limitations such as temporal resolution (i.e., 16 days), data pre-processing requirements to improve data quality, and aging satellites. Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors on Aqua/Terra platforms compensate for these shortcomings, although at the expense of spatial resolution. We developed and evaluated a remote monitoring protocol for water clarity of large lakes using MODIS 500 m data and compared MODIS utility to Landsat-based methods. MODIS images captured during May-September 2001, 2004 and 2010 were analyzed with linear regression to identify the relationship between lake water clarity and satellite-measured surface reflectance. Correlations were strong (R-2 = 0.72-0.94) throughout the study period; however, they were the most consistent in August, reflecting seasonally unstable lake conditions and inter-annual differences in algal productivity during the other months. The utility of MODIS data in remote water quality estimation lies in intra-annual monitoring of lake water clarity in inaccessible, large lakes, whereas Landsat is more appropriate for inter-annual, regional trend analyses of lakes >= 8 ha. Model accuracy is improved when ancillary variables are included to reflect seasonal lake dynamics and weather patterns that influence lake clarity. The identification of landscape-scale drivers of regional water quality is a useful way to supplement satellite-based remote monitoring programs relying on spectral data alone. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Diet of walleye and sauger and morphological characteristics of their prey in Lake Winnipeg	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake Winnipeg has the second largest commercial walleye (Sander vitreus) fishery in North America. The lake has experienced and will continue to undergo comprehensive changes such as eutrophication, invasion of nonindigenous aquatic species, and climate change. The North and South Basins of the lake differ in many ways, e.g. mean water depth and temperature, turbidity, and fish community. The study objectives were to establish a baseline for diet of walleye and sauger (Sander canadensis) in Lake Winnipeg, to determine whether the diets currently differ between basins and among seasons, and to investigate whether the non-indigenous rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) contributes substantially to their diet. Walleye and sauger diets in the South Basin had more diverse species composition, whereas in the North Basin, the diet consisted almost entirely of the introduced rainbow smelt (as well as troutperch (Percopsis omiscomaycus) for sauger). Some seasonal variation was also documented and found to be attributable to the emergence of young-of-year fish and mayfly larvae. The predominant incorporation of the abundant and large rainbow smelt in the diets of walleye and sauger in the North Basin may lead to increased growth and condition of fish in this basin. These data provide a baseline for comparison in future investigations of walleye and sauger diets as changes occur in the food web of the lake with invasion of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) and spiny water fleas (Bythotrephes longimanus).

Spatio-temporal variation of environmental variables and aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages in Lake Nokou?, a RAMSAR site of Benin	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												Environmental characteristics and macroinvertebrate assemblages of Lake Nokou? (Benin) were investigated from September 2014 to July 2016. Seasonal and hydroclimatic changes, as well as anthropogenic activities were the overriding factors affecting environmental variables investigated. Analysis of macroinvertebrate community structure with several indices revealed a community structure changing across seasons and differing between the sites. Mollusca, Crustacea and Polychaeta were most abundant in the dry seasons, especially at sites close to the ocean, whereas Oligochaeta and Insecta (Diptera, Heteroptera, Coleoptera, Odonata and Ephemeroptera) were abundant in the wet seasons, especially during flood periods (short wet season) at the sites receiving fresh water and on roots of macrophytes. A redundancy analysis placed habitat suitability (temperature and macrophytes) and trophic status variables (NO2?, NO3?, conductivity and pH) as structuring drivers for macroinvertebrate assemblages. The current study demonstrates that spatial heterogeneity of macroinvertebrates of Lake Nokoue is related to the dynamics created by input of fresh water (wet seasons) or salt water (dry seasons), as well as spatial heterogeneity of anthropogenic activities (nutrients). It offers insights into the macroinvertebrate dynamics linked to the limnology of a West African lagoon, which could contribute to a better understanding of management and conservation measures.					; Odountan, Olaniran/JAN-8231-2023	ABOU, Youssouf/0000-0002-8273-0036; KOUDENOUKPO, Zinsou Cosme/0000-0002-6513-3264; Odountan, Olaniran Hamed/0000-0001-6947-0308; 													1608-5914	1727-9364				OCT 18	2019	44	3					219	231		10.2989/16085914.2019.1629272	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16085914.2019.1629272		OCT 2019											WOS:000490684400001

A total of 52 samples were collected from recreational lakes in Tianjin during a high-occurrence season (June-October) for the waterborne cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis, and the occurrence and genotypes of Cryptosporidium and Giardia were investigated. The results showed that 82.7% (43) and 98.1% (51) of samples were positive for Cryptosporidium oocyst and Giardia cysts, respectively. The mean concentration of parasites was 3.65 oocysts/10 L and 12.58 cysts/10 L, respectively. Molecular characterization revealed that the presence of Cryptosporidium parvum, C. andersoni, C. hominis, C. meleagridis, C. fragile, C. ubiquitum, and Giardia lamblia assemblage A, B and D. The protozoan contamination in the studied lakes may originate from animal feces on ground, which was washed into the lake by stormwater runoff. Nevertheless, there is a potential risk of infection during recreational activities in the lake because the dominant detected protozoan genotypes are common human pathogens. Moreover, microbial indicators analysis does not adequately indicate the protozoan contamination in recreational water. The information from this study will be valuable for future protozoan source tracking, and any further control interventions against Cryptosporidium and/or Giardia infection associated with recreational water.																			2045-2322					FEB 5	2018	8								2353	10.1038/s41598-018-20902-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-20902-3								29402951					WOS:000424087700025

The main assumptions tested in the present study are that (i) phytoplankton structure in these waterbodies is strongly dependent on the transportation with the river waters flowing through them and (ii) the importance of this stochastic transportation is decreasing as the connectivity with the river decreases allowing environmental filters to shape phytoplankton structure. The multivariate analysis showed that although phytoplankton was inoculated largely by Pearl River water inputs and inflow among the system, the hydraulic architecture of the reservoir network shaped and modulated the composition and abundance of phytoplankton.

Lateglacial-Holocene environments and human occupation in the Upper Lena region of Eastern Siberia derived from sedimentary and zooarchaeological data from Lake Ochaul	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												In the current study, different geochemical and biological proxies, including pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs, ostracods and molluscs, from an AMS radiocarbon-dated sediment core from Lake Ochaul (54 degrees 14 ' N, 106 degrees 28 ' E; 641 m a.s.l.) are presented and discussed. Ochaul is a fresh-water lake and an archaeological site situated ca. 100 km northwest of Lake Baikal in the upper reaches of the Lena River. The 260-cm-long sedimentary record presented here spans the Lateglacial-Holocene interval, between ca. 13,500 cal yr BP and the present. The reconstructions of the postglacial vegetation and lake system development are discussed along with the regional climate dynamics and the hemispheric-scale environmental changes. During the Allerod interstadial the region around Lake Ochaul was dominated by sparse taiga forests. Cooling during the Younger Dryas led to a more open tundra landscape where trees formed patchy forest stands in climatically favourable environments. This facilitated a rapid spread of forests at the onset of the Early Holocene during which the study region was probably characterized by seasonally dry climate controlled by the interplay of higher insolation, lower global sea levels and remaining ice sheets in the North Atlantic region. After thermal and moisture optimum conditions and a maximum spread of forests during the Middle Holocene, continuous cooling and a trend to more open forests landscapes marked the Late Holocene. These long-term trends were interrupted by several relatively short episodes of change in the vegetation and algal records, which coincide with short-term (centennial-scale) Northern Hemisphere cooling/drying phases. This shows that the regional vegetation reacted sensitively to these climate oscillations. Six AMS radiocarbon dates of bone material of large herbivorous animals from the Ochaul archaeological site located at the northern shore of the lake provide important information about prehistoric hunter-gatherers and indicate that activities at the site took place at ca. 27,780-27,160 cal yr BP (95% probability range) as well as during the Mesolithic (ca. 8850-8450 cal yr BP), Early, Middle and Late Neolithic (between ca. 6840 and 5490 cal yr BP) and the Iron Age (ca. 2120-1930 cal yr BP). Our results demonstrate that despite major environmental transformations following the Last Glacial Maximum, Lake Ochaul and the Malaya Anga River valley remained attractive for large herbivores and for prehistoric hunter-gatherers, even during the Middle Neolithic cultural "hiatus" (ca. 6660-6060 cal yr BP) in Cis-Baikal, as documented by the published archaeological records.					; Hoelzmann, Philipp/H-7008-2019; Shchetnikov, Alexander/GVU-4758-2022; Olschewski, Pascal/LRU-1821-2024; Danukalova, Guzel/A-8103-2014; Tarasov, Pavel/ABG-3993-2020	Kobe, Franziska/0000-0002-5097-0377; Osipova, Eugenia/0000-0003-3414-7409; Leipe, Christian/0000-0002-0805-2345; Goslar, Tomasz/0000-0002-1346-3122; Gliwa, Jana/0000-0002-4200-5112; Shchetnikov, Alexander/0000-0002-4591-6421; Hoelzmann, Philipp/0000-0001-8709-8474; Danukalova, Guzel/0000-0001-7602-5923; Olschewski, Pascal/0000-0002-2472-7138; 													1040-6182	1873-4553				JUN 20	2022	623				SI		139	158		10.1016/j.quaint.2021.09.019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2021.09.019		APR 2022											WOS:000798848300002
J	Hartnett, JJ				Hartnett, Justin J.			A classification scheme for identifying snowstorms affecting central New York State	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												The Great Lakes region experiences anomalously high seasonal snowfall totals relative to similar latitudes. Although lake-effect snowstorms are common in this region, snowfall occurs from a variety of storm types. This study examines snowstorms in a subsection of the Lake Ontario basin to develop a classification scheme to categorize the different types of snowstorms affecting the region. From 1985 to 2015, there were 11 different snowstorm types to affect the study area. The classification system was used to assess the frequency of, and snowfall produced by the different storm types within the eastern Great Lakes region. From the classification, snowstorms were categorized as either non-direct cyclonic storms (NDCS) or direct cyclonic storms (DCS). Lake-effect snowstorms, a type of NDCS, were the most frequent storm (35.1% of all storms) and accounted for approximately 39.4% of the snowfall. Most lake-effect storms (37.7%) produced moderate snowfall totals (10.2-25.3 cm), yet heavy snowfall storms (>= 25.4 cm) contributed significantly (rho <= .05) more to seasonal snowfall totals than lighter snowfall storms. Direct cyclonic clippers forming over high latitudes of northwestern Canada, were the most frequent DCS in Central New York (11.3% of all storms), with nearly three quarters of the storms originating over Alberta. These storms only contributed 9.2% of the seasonal snowfall in the study area, compared to 12.7% from direct cyclonic Nor'easters forming near the east coast of North America. Although Nor'easters occur less frequently than clippers, when they do occur, they tend to produce heavy widespread snowfall across the region. The classification system proposed can be modified to accommodate snow basins across the globe. Classifying snowstorms will help determine the seasonal snowfall contribution from different storms and aid in future climate predictions, as individual snowstorm types may respond differently to a warming global climate.

These harmful algal blooms are the most visible consequences of marine eutrophication, driven by a surplus of nutrients from anthropogenic sources and internal processes of the ecosystem. We present a novel Cyanobacterial Bloom Indicator (CyaBI) targeted for the ecosystem assessment of eutrophication in marine areas. The method measures the current cyanobacterial bloom situation (an average condition of recent 5 years) and compares this to the estimated target level for 'good environmental status' (GES). The current status is derived with an index combining indicative bloom event variables. As such we used seasonal information from the duration, volume and severity of algal blooms derived from earth observation (50) data. The target level for GES was set by using a remote sensing based data set named Fraction with Cyanobacterial Accumulations (FCA; Kahru & Elmgren, 2014) covering years 1979-2014. Here a shift-detection algorithm for time series was applied to detect time-periods in the FCA data where the level of blooms remained low several consecutive years. The average conditions from these time periods were transformed into respective CyaBI target values to represent target level for GES. The indicator is shown to pass the three critical factors set for marine indicator development, namely it measures the current status accurately, the target setting can be scientifically proven and it can be connected to the ecosystem management goal. An advantage of the CyaBI method is that it's not restricted to the data used in the development work, but can be complemented, or fully applied, by using different types of data sources providing information on cyanobacterial accumulations.					; Koponen, Sampsa/AAX-5895-2021	Anttila, Saku/0000-0001-7013-9575; Koponen, Sampsa/0000-0002-2959-5699; 													0303-2434					FEB	2018	64						145	155		10.1016/j.jag.2017.09.007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2017.09.007													WOS:000413880000013

In this study, we proposed the use of delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotopes as a proxy of zooplankton functional traits in Lake Maggiore, a large, deep subalpine Italian lake. We analyzed the seasonal pattern of delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures of different crustacean zooplankton taxa to determine food sources, preferred habitats, and trophic positions of species throughout one year. The cladocerans Daphnia longispina galeata gr., Diaphanosoma brachyurum, and Eubosmina longispina were grouped into a primary consumer functional group from their delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotopic signatures, but while the former two species shared the same food sources, the latter exhibited a more selective feeding strategy. Cyclopoid copepods occupied a distinct functional group from the other secondary consumers, being the most N-15 enriched group in the lake. The delta N-15 signature of calanoid copepods showed trophic enrichment in comparison to Daphnia and Eubosmina and linear mixing model results confirmed a predator-prey relationship.

Recruitment of migratory Characiforms in the different wetland habitats of Central Amazonia: Subsidies for sustainable fisheries management	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												By promoting the biological recruitment of relevant natural resources, wetlands offer a major ecosystem service. This study investigates the importance of wetland habitats of the central Amazon basin as sites for spawning and/or initial development of seven of the most important commercial Characiforms fish species. In order to confirm this importance, samples of the eggs, larvae, and juveniles of these fish species were collected during the four seasonal phases of the hydrological cycles of 2010 and 2011, in different aquatic environments of the wetland ecosystem in the central Amazon. The results confirmed that the flooding phase is the most important for the spawning of these species, and that they preferred to use the marginal areas of the central Amazon as spawning grounds. The larvae of these species colonize the confluence zone of the rivers and the mouths of the floodplain channels, principally during the initial stages (pre-flexion) of their ontogenetic development. The channels that connect the lakes to the rivers are the main dispersal route for the larvae, especially those in advanced stages of development (flexion/post-flexion), towards the internal of the wetland habitats, such as the lakes and large mattresses of floating vegetation. The different wetland habitats of this region provide an extremely important ecosystem service, playing a critical role in the recruitment of commercially-valuable fish species, and thus require adequate protection and management to ensure the continuity of fisheries and natural stocks.

J	Möller, P; Knappe, A; Dulski, P				Moeller, Peter; Knappe, Andrea; Dulski, Peter			Seasonal variations of rare earths and yttrium distribution in the lowland Havel River, Germany, by agricultural fertilization and effluents of sewage treatment plants	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												REE and Y (REY) distribution in the lowland Havel River passing the Federal State of Berlin, Germany, depends on contributions of point sources such pharmaceutical and high-tech industries, acid water from the open pit lignite mining, and medical application of very stable organic Gd chelates. Another omnipresent dispersed source of REY are water-soluble Ca-phosphates containing micro-amounts of Eu(II)-bearing barite as components of common agricultural fertilizers. After distribution in the field during the cold season (October through March) these Ca-phosphates dissolve and secondary phosphates and calcite precipitate both being enriched in light REE. Heavy REE are preferably exported by runoff together with part of the micro-contaminant barite leading to high Yb/Nd ratios in the Havel water and REY distribution patterns with only small Eu deficits. During the warm season (April through September) light REE together with phosphate are leached from secondary soil minerals by runoff. The micro-component barite is retained in vegetation-covered soil. Thus, REY patterns of Havel water show significant Eu deficits. The high Gd anomalies result from medical applications of Gd-chelates which after urination pass the sewage treatment plants. The seasonal variations of total Gd in the Havel River are artifacts based on seasonal locally varied discharge of effluents from sewage treatment plants. The natural Gd concentration of 8 pmol/l in the northern Havel is enhanced to 3300 pmol/l, when the Havel River leaves Berlin territory. The elimination of phosphate from Lake Tegel water affects the fractionation of REE but not the concentration of total Gd. Although enhanced in total phosphorus (TP), the REE concentrations in the water from the Spree River and the Teltow Canal are less than in the Havel water before their confluence. Only Yb and Lu do not decrease. The contributors of the Havel River are high in total organic carbon (TOC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) compared to the Havel water before their indicating that REY are preferentially sorbed by settling organic matter. Applying PHREEQC and assuming that only 10% of TP is present as ortho-phosphate yields that only carbonate complexes are essential. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is one of the great lakes in East Africa for which a significant rise in water level between 2019 and 2020 led to flooding, with major environmental consequences and social impacts. This study focused on the Lake Tanganyika basin water balance between 2003 and 2021 to assess the influence of recent climate variability on lake water level variations (due in particular to the floods of 2020 and 2021) and to explore early warnings of flooding in the lake's surrounding lowlands. This process is performed using remote sensing data. For the computation of the basin's water balance, we compared variations in the watershed total water storage (TWS) with the basin water flux calculated using rainfall, evaporation (E), evapotranspiration (ET) and discharges data. The space-time variations in rainfall, E and ET were analyzed by decomposing their time series into trend and seasonal signals and applying (only for rainfall) multivariate statistical analysis to the decomposed signals. For flood mapping, we calculated the MNDWI spectral water index from Sentinel-2 images acquired between 2017 and 2022. Our study showed that the basin water balance is closed when rainfall from Era5 is combined with E and ET from GLEV and MOD16A2, respectively. During the 2003-2021 period, over the entire watershed, water losses of similar to 70 km3 due to lake E were offset by an increase in water inflows of similar to 100 km3 in the rest of the watershed. During the period from 2003 to 2021, the E rate from the lake was stable overall, while the ET and rainfall mainly in the Malagarasi basin increased significantly. The surface water storage (SWS), which represents the variation in lake water volume derived from altimetry measurements, corresponds to 41.8% of the TWS, groundwater storage corresponds to 57.7% of the TWS, and the soil moisture is less than 0.5%. The TWS strongly correlated with the SWS (similar to 91%), with a one-month lag in the SWS variations in response to the TWS fluctuations. Therefore, the SWS in May, when the flood risk is the highest, was estimated using TWS in February, March and April with accuracies of 85%, 94% and 95%, respectively. This valuable information could be integrated into flood management tools, particularly for areas such as Gatumba city and the Ruzizi Delta Nature Reserve, which were heavily affected by the May 2021 floods.

Organic geochemistry of bulk sediment (particulate organic carbon, organic carbon to nitrogen molar ratio (C/N), stable carbon isotope (C-13) and grain size) and biomarker of bulk sediment (lignin phenols) were measured to trace the sources of POM. The range of C/N ratios (6.4-8.9), C-13 (-24.3 - -26.2 parts per thousand) and lignin phenols concentration 8 (0.45 mg/100 mg OC-2.00 mg/100 mg OC) of POM suggested that POM originated from the mixture of soil, plant tissue and autochthonous organic matter (OM) during the dry season. POM from lakes contained a higher portion of terrestrial OM than the mainstream, which was related to sand mining and hydropower erosion processes. A three end-member model based on C-13 and 8 was performed. The results indicated that soil contributed approximately 50% of OM to the POM, which is the dominant OM source in most stations. POM composition was affected by total suspended matter (TSM) and grain size composition, and the direct OM input from two lakes and channel erosion induced OM. The lower TSM concentration in January 2008 was mainly caused by seasonal variations; the impact from the TGD in the dry season was relatively small. A box model indicated that more than 90% of the terrestrial OM transported by the Changjiang in January 2008 was from the middle and lower drainage basins. Channel erosion induced OM, and contributions from Poyang Lake were the major terrestrial OM sources in the dry season.

J	Alexakis, D; Kagalou, I; Tsakiris, G				Alexakis, D.; Kagalou, I.; Tsakiris, G.			Assessment of pressures and impacts on surface water bodies of the Mediterranean. Case study: Pamvotis Lake, Greece	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The aim of the study presented in this article is to assess the ecological status of a surface water body in the Mediterranean using the methodological approach of Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response. Based on this approach for the case study analyzed (Pamvotis Lake, Greece), it is concluded that the main drivers, which lead to pressures in the study area are: intensive agricultural activities, alteration of hydrological regime, contamination from point sources and changes in the land-use and fish stocking. The ecological status is assessed by analysing data series of physical, chemical and biological elements that are available from early '80s. Findings suggest elevated nutrient concentrations sufficient for maintaining eutrophic conditions while their seasonal variability is mostly driven by factors as water level fluctuation, catchment runoff and in-lake biological processes. Subsequently, concerning biotic factors, the poor biodiversity mainly represented by the dominance of the most tolerant species, confirm the previous profile. Since, reference conditions have only recently been established in Greece, the ECOFRAME scheme and the guidelines proposed by the "Intercalibration Group for Mediterranean Lakes" were applied. In terms of the above elements; the water quality status could be characterized as "High", "High to Good" and "High to Bad", respectively, whereas the overall ecological status tends to shift in poor conditions. Finally, the major response actions needed should be in the direction of reduced application of fertilizers and chemicals in the cultivated land of the catchment, removal of the point-contamination sources from the catchment, appropriate land-use management and biomanipulation.

Metal cycling during sediment early diagenesis in a water reservoir affected by acid mine drainage	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The discharge of acid mine drainage (AMD) into a reservoir may seriously affect the water quality. To investigate the metal transfer between the water and the sediment, three cores were collected from the Sancho Reservoir (Iberian Pyrite Belt, SW Spain) during different seasons: turnover event; oxic, stratified period; anoxic and under shallow perennially oxic conditions. The cores were sliced in an oxygen-free atmosphere, after which pore water was extracted by centrifugation and analyzed. A sequential extraction was then applied to the sediments to extract the water-soluble, monosulfide, low crystallinity Fe(III)-oxyhydroxide, crystalline Fe(III)-oxide, organic, pyrite and residual phases. The results showed that, despite the acidic chemistry of the water column (pH <4), the reservoir accumulated a high amount of autochthonous organic matter (up to 12 wt.%). Oxygen was consumed in 1 mm of sediment due to organic matter and sulfide oxidation. Below the oxic layer, Fe(III) and sulfate reduction peaks developed concomitantly and the resulting Fe(II) and S(II) were removed as sulfides and probably as S linked to organic matter. During the oxic season, schwertmannite precipitated in the water column and was redissolved in the organic-rich sediment, after which iron and arsenic diffused upwards again to the water column. The flux of precipitates was found to be two orders of magnitude higher than the aqueous one, and therefore the sediment acted as a sink for As and Fe. Trace metals (Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, Ni, Co) and AI always diffused from the reservoir water and were incorporated into the sediments as sulfides and oxyhydroxides, respectively. In spite of the fact that the benthic fluxes estimated for trace metal and Al were much higher than those reported for lake and marine sediments, they only accounted for less than 10% of their total inventory dissolved in the column water.

J	Jiang, DB; Lang, XM; Tian, ZP; Guo, DL				Jiang, Dabang; Lang, Xianmei; Tian, Zhiping; Guo, Donglin			Last glacial maximum climate over China from PMIP simulations	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Using the results of 25 climate models under the framework of the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP) and available proxy data, this study examines the regional climate of China during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM: 21,000 years ago). Compared to the baseline climate, results show that annual surface temperature decreased by 2.00 degrees-7.00 degrees C in China during that period, with an average of 4.46 degrees C. for the ensemble mean of all models. Annual precipitation and evaporation during the LGM were 5-40% less than the baseline values, with an average reduction of 20% (0.60 mm/day) and a reduction of 21% (0.41 mm/day) at the national scale, based on results from 15 out of the 25 models. These models were selected for their ability to simulate the modern precipitation climatology and for the availability of suitable evaporation data. Both the geographical distribution and magnitude of changes in surface temperature, precipitation, and evaporation during the LGM varied with the seasons and with the models, particularly at the sub-regional scale. Model-data comparisons revealed that the 25 models successfully reproduced the surface cooling trend during the LGM, but they failed to reproduce its magnitude in all four regions of comparison, particularly in the Hexi Corridor and in North and Northeast China. The simulations with computed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) were in better agreement with proxy estimates of surface temperature than those with prescribed SSTs. On the other hand, large-scale LGM-minus-baseline anomalies in annual precipitation minus evaporation agreed well, in a qualitative manner, with lake status-based reconstructions of changes in annual water budgets in East China and the region of 35 degrees-42 degrees N, 74 degrees-97 degrees E. On the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, drier climates from the 15 models agreed with pollen-based reconstructions. For most parts of West China excluding the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, the simulations with computed (prescribed) SSTs are consistent (inconsistent) with reconstructed moister conditions.

The aim of this research was to determine spatial/temporal variations in water quality, to assess trophic state and to identify pollution sources. Protective measures and schemes were proposed to improve water quality in the lake. Discussion Hierarchical cluster analysis (CA) grouped the 12 sampling sites into two clusters (Eastern Chaohu Lake and Western Chaohu Lake). Temporal CA classified the 12 months into four periods (March-May; June-August; September-November; January, February and December) with a distinct regular seasonal cycle in Eastern Chaohu Lake and four periods (January-April and December; May, July and November; June, September and October; August) with an irregular seasonal cycle in Western Chaohu Lake. Trophic state index analysis showed that Eastern Chaohu Lake was in mesotrophic levels, while Western Chaohu Lake was in eutrophic and hypereutrophic levels. Based on pollutant source statistics data, the dominant pollution sources were identified as domestic sewage and non-point pollution in Eastern Chaohu Lake. Domestic sewage, industrial and non-point sources were contributed to eutrophication in Western Chaohu Lake.

The major peak at spectra corresponds to the annual cycle and semiannual oscillations peak is located at next vigorous. Effects of different global and regional factors on lake level changes are investigated by signal processing methods. Results show that annual cycle of Siberian High and Volga River discharge have the considerable effects on the Caspian Sea level changes in global and regional scales, respectively. Analyzing of seasonal cycle revealed that Volga river discharge is significant on sea level fluctuations by 1-month lag in northern and central sub-basins and 2 months delay for southern sub-basin. The results of long-term cycle show ascending trend of evaporation in Caspian central sub-basin, which it is the main driver of decreasing trend of the Caspian Sea level since 1990s.

Whether the improvements in compliance with 'test and treat' guidelines are consistent across different malaria endemicity areas has not been examined.MethodsData from 11 national, cross-sectional, outpatient malaria case-management surveys undertaken in Kenya from 2010 to 2016 were analysed. Four primary indicators (i.e., 'test and treat') and eight secondary indicators of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) dosing, dispensing, and counselling were measured. Mixed logistic regression models were used to analyse the annual trends in compliance with the indicators across the different malaria endemicity areas (i.e., from highest to lowest risk being lake endemic, coast endemic, highland epidemic, semi-arid seasonal transmission, and low risk).ResultsCompliance with all four 'test and treat' indicators significantly increased in the area with the highest malaria risk (i.e., lake endemic) as follows: testing of febrile patients (OR=1.71 annually; 95% CI=1.51-1.93), AL treatment for test-positive patients (OR=1.56; 95% CI=1.26-1.92), no anti-malarial for test-negative patients (OR=2.04; 95% CI=1.65-2.54), and composite 'test and treat' compliance (OR=1.80; 95% CI=1.61-2.01). In the low risk areas, only compliance with test-negative results significantly increased (OR=2.27; 95% CI=1.61-3.19) while testing of febrile patients showed declining trends (OR=0.89; 95% CI=0.79-1.01). Administration of the first AL dose at the facility significantly increased in the areas of lake endemic (OR=2.33; 95% CI=1.76-3.10), coast endemic (OR=5.02; 95% CI=2.77-9.09) and semi-arid seasonal transmission (OR=1.44; 95% CI=1.02-2.04). In areas of the lowest risk of transmission and highland epidemic zone, none of the AL dosing, dispensing, and counselling tasks significantly changed over time.ConclusionsThere is variability in health workers' compliance with outpatient malaria case-management guidelines across different malaria-risk areas in Kenya. Major improvements in areas of the highest risk have not been seen in low-risk areas. Interventions to improve practices should be targeted geographically.					; Macharia, Peter/E-2255-2015; Snow, Robert/AFR-1436-2022	Snow, Robert/0000-0003-3725-6088; Amboko, Beatrice/0000-0002-5754-3853; Macharia, Peter M/0000-0003-3410-1881														1475-2875				NOV 11	2020	19	1							406	10.1186/s12936-020-03479-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12936-020-03479-z								33176783					WOS:000593841700003

Future precipitation changes over Panama projected with the atmospheric global model MRI-AGCM3.2	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Future change in precipitation over Panama was investigated with 20-km and 60-km mesh global atmospheric models. The present-day climate simulations were conducted for 21 years from 1983 through 2003, driving models by observed historical sea surface temperatures (SST). The future climate simulations were conducted for 21 years from 2079 through 2099, driving models by future SST distributions projected by the Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models that participated in the Fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. The uncertainty of future precipitation change was evaluated by ensemble simulations giving four different SST patterns and three different cumulus convection schemes. In the future, precipitation increases over the central and eastern part of Panama from May to November corresponding to the rainy season. Uncertainty of future precipitation change depends on cumulus convection schemes rather than SST distributions. Increase of precipitation over most regions can be attributed to the increase of water vapor transport originated in the Caribbean Sea which converges over Panama. Precipitation averaged over the Panama canal, the Gatun lake and related river basin (79.0 degrees-80.5 degrees W, 8.5 degrees-9.5 degrees N) will increase during most of the rainy season persisting from May to October, while precipitation in dry season persisting from December to April does not change in the future.

Numerous theories for the mechanism responsible for the release of this gas into the water column have been put forth. These include changes in lake levels, seasonality, and seismic activity. The presence of gas in the sediments has been shown to cause acoustic blanking of the seismic signal. In effect, this means that areas of good seismic penetration are areas where gas is not present in the underlying sediment. In this study, 30 years of high-resolution seismic reflection data from the northwestern corner of the lake was examined. This database has allowed for the examination of changes in the spatial extent of gas in the area over time. Results show that the presence or absence of gas in the sediments does not adhere to one clear governing mechanism as previously assumed, but is rather a combination of factors that must be taken into account.

Yet, predicting bedload transport rates contributes to better river management, more appropriate river engineering works design, accurate knowledge of sediment delivery rates, which greatly benefits sediment related water resources management. Therefore, bedload, suspended load and runoff discharge were measured at the lower Gilgel Abay River in the Blue Nile catchment of Ethiopia. Catchment area is 3887 km(2), average stream discharge in the rainy season 315 (+/- 164) m(3) s(-1), and the stream surface gradient at the sampling station 0.0007 m m(-1). A standard Helley-Smith (U.S. BL-84) cable-suspended sampler was used to take 315 samples to measure bedload fluxes for the 2017 rainy season. The bedload predominantly comprises well to moderately well sorted, medium-sized sand (250-500 mu m) with a symmetric and leptokurtic distribution. The mean daily observed bedload discharge varies from 0.7 to 427.5 Mg d(-1) with an average rate of 175.1 Mg d(-1). Field observations also show that the bedload dynamics become larger near the river banks and decrease towards the middle of the river section due to the presence of a central bridge pier. The average suspended sediment load ranges from 247 to 220,028 Mg d(-1) and dominates the total sediment yield ( > 94.6%). The bedload accounts for only 0.1 to 5.4% of the total sediment load. The area-specific bedload and suspended load are also 0.6 and 22 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) respectively. The elongated planform growth of the Gilgel Abay River delta in Lake Tana is also in line with the predominance of very fine, suspended load in the sediment transport of this river, in addition to limited alongshore drifting given the low waves of Tana lake. Among the tested bedload prediction criteria, the stream-power based equations of Martin and modified Bagnold performed better. Yet, the bedload prediction performance of simple power regression equations based on runoff discharge and excess unit stream power parameters provided the best agreement with the observed bedload data (Adj. R-2 0.82-0.87). Finally, this study provides plausible estimates of bedload fluxes that are within predicted ranges reported for sand-bed rivers in Africa and other tropical regions.

Investigating the cross-scale processes behind land-use decisions of rural households is important for understanding the deferential effects of macrolevel forces across local social and environmental contexts. We combined quantitative analysis of household surveys and qualitative analysis of interviews and participant observations in eight villages in the Poyang Lake Region of China to investigate how macrolevel forces associated with policy reforms in China (i.e., urban job markets and agricultural markets) interact with microlevel factors (i.e., the biophysical environment, location, and household demographics) to shape land-use decisions of rural households. We also found differential regional government interventions that reinforced preexisting biophysical conditions to affect household crop choices, contributing to the maintenance of intensive two-season rice production in select agricultural bases. Our use of multilevel modeling and qualitative analysis enabled an improved understanding of the cross-scale processes behind household land-use decisions, which has practical implications for securing food production and promoting sustainable land use. ???????????????????????,???????????????????????????????????????,??????????????????????????????????????????????,??????????????????????????,?????????(?????????????)???????,??????????(???????????,??????)????,???????????????????????????????,??????????????????????,????????????,????????????????????????????,?????????????????????????,???????????????????????

J	Szczerba, A; Rzodkiewicz, M; Tylmann, W				Szczerba, Agnieszka; Rzodkiewicz, Monika; Tylmann, Wojciech			Modern diatom assemblages and their association with meteorological conditions in two lakes in northeastern Poland	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The population dynamics of diatoms are affected by a variety of environmental variables. Due to their short generation times and high sensitivity to changes in physicochemical conditions, diatoms are considered good environmental indicators. The main goal of our study was to find and explain the relationships between changes in meteorological conditions and diatom fluxes and taxonomic composition based on the example of two small lakes: Lazduny and Rzes ' niki. Using meteorological data, sediment traps, and regular measurements of limno-logical and hydrochemical properties of the water column, we collected a three-year-long, high-resolution series of observations. The results show that total diatom fluxes are indirectly influenced by changes in meteorological conditions, acting through changes in the mixing regimes that determine the nutrient and light availability in lakes. Statistical analyses showed that the variability of the diatom data is correlated with air temperature and wind speed. Nevertheless, their influence on diatom assemblages is most likely the surrogate for the complex changes in the physical structure of the investigated lakes. Despite many similarities between the studied lakes such as mixing regime patterns, dominant diatom taxa, and seasonal dynamics of diatom fluxes, we recorded differences in both the seasonal succession of specific diatom taxa and the occurrence of the peaks of total fluxes, and differences in taxonomic composition referring to less dominant taxa. We attribute these dissimilarities to the local conditions, such as the hydrological types of the lakes, the extent of the littoral zone, and exposure to the sunlight connected to the position in the catchment.					; Szczerba, Agnieszka/AAO-1871-2021; Rzodkiewicz (nee Lutyńska), Monika/KBD-2533-2024; Tylmann, Wojciech/AAL-3504-2021	Szczerba, Agnieszka/0000-0001-9342-0167; Tylmann, Wojciech/0000-0003-1749-5882; Rzodkiewicz (Lutynska), Monika/0000-0002-6672-2183; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				MAR	2023	147								110028	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110028	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110028		FEB 2023											WOS:000947300800001

The present study involved a comprehensive field study to determine concentrations of fourteen trace elements (Al, As, Cr, Co, Cd, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, V and Zn) in surface water and different fish species from Tonle Sap Lake in central Cambodia, during both the dry and wet seasons. Total arsenic (tAs) and Mn in surface water during the dry season exceeded WHO drinking water guidelines. Total mercury (tHg) concentrations (mu g/g wet wt.) in fish during the wet season (GM = 0.055; CI95 = 0.01-0.26) were approximately 15 times higher (P < 0.05) compared to those during the dry season (GM = 0.0035; CI95 = 0.0004-0.033). Mean target hazard quotients (THQs) for inorganic arsenic (iAs), methyl mercury (MeHg), Mn and Pb were > 1, with estimated maximum values greatly exceeding 1. Mean THQs of Zn, Cd, Ni and Se were very near 1, with estimated maximum values exceeding 1. The MeHg THQ (min-max range: 0.16-9.09) during the wet season was 7 times higher than in the dry season (min-max range: 0.05-1.35). Concentrations of Hg and other trace elements varied widely between fish species. The findings suggest that exposure of some trace elements via water and food is of concern in this region. High consumption rates of fish and rice key factors related to trace element exposure. Seasonal hydrology and species-specific bioaccumulation behaviour in the Tonle Sap Lake watershed also play an important role. The generated information will be useful to better mitigate trace element exposure in this region.					; Tan, Boon Huan/ABB-8381-2021	Bayen, Stephane/0000-0002-9935-6685; 													0147-6513	1090-2414				OCT 30	2018	162						112	120		10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.06.071	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.06.071								29990722					WOS:000440879500015

Partial migration to seasonally-unstable habitat facilitates biological invasions in a predator-dominated system	OIKOS												Although partial migration, a phenomenon in which some individuals in a population conduct seasonal migrations while others remain resident, is common among animals, its importance in facilitating biological invasions has not been demonstrated. To illustrate how partial migration might facilitate invasions in spatially complex habitats, we developed an individual-based model of common carp Cyprinus carpio in systems of lakes and winterkill-prone marshes in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB). Our model predicted that common carp are unable to become invasive in lakes of the UMRB unless they conduct partial migrations into winterkill-prone marshes in which recruitment rates are high in the absence of native predators that forage on carp eggs and larvae. Despite low dispersal rates of juveniles and higher mortality rates of migrants, partial migration was adaptive across a wide range of migration rates and winterkill frequencies. Partial migration rates as low as 10% and winterkill occurrence as infrequent as once in 20 years were sufficient to cause invasiveness because of carp's reproductive potential and longevity. Consistent with the results of our model, empirical data showed that lake connectivity to winterkill-prone marshes was an important driver of carp abundance within the study region. Our results demonstrate that biological invasions may be driven by a small, migratory contingent of a population that exploits more beneficial reproductive habitats.

The interaction of physical structure and nutrient loading drives ecosystem change in a large tropical lake over 40 years	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Many lakes across the world arc entering novel states and experiencing altered biogeochemical cycling due to local anthropogcnic stressors. In the tropics, understanding the drivers of these changes can be difficult due to a lack of documented historic conditions or an absence of continuous monitoring that can distinguish between intim- and inter-annual variation. Over the last forty years (1980-2020), Lake Yojoa (Honduras) has experienced increased watershed development as well as the introduction of a large net-pen Tilapia farm, resulting in a dramatic reduction in seasonal water clarity, increased trophic state and altered nutrient dynamics, shifting lake Yojoa from an oligotrophic (low productivity) to mesotrophic (moderate productivity) ecosystem. To assess the changes that have occurred in lake Yojoa as well as putative drivers for those changes, we compared Secchi depth (water clarity), dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations at continuous semi-monthly intervals for the three years between 1979 and 1983 and again at continuous 16-day intervals for 2018-2020. Between those two periods we observed the loss of a clear water phase that previously occurred in the months when the water column was fully mixed. Seasonal peaks in DIN coincident with mixing suggest that an enhanced accumulation of ammonium in the hypolimnion (the bottom layer of a stratified lake) during stratification, and release to the epilimnion (the top layer of a stratified lake) with mixing maintains high algal abundance and subsequently low Secchi depth during what was previously the clear water phase. This interaction of nutrient loading and Lake Yojoa's monomictic stratification regime illustrates a key phenomenon in how physical water column structure and nutrients interact in tropical monomictic lakes. This work highlights the need to consider nutrient dynamics of warm anoxic hypolimnions, not just surface water nutrient concentrations, to understand environmental change in these societally important but understudied ecosystems.

J	Herrera, EC; Nadaoka, K				Herrera, Eugene C.; Nadaoka, Kazuo			Temporal dynamics and drivers of lake ecosystem metabolism using high resolution observations in a shallow, tropical, eutrophic lake (Laguna Lake, Philippines)	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The physical, chemical, and biological dynamics under changing atmospheric conditions of Laguna Lake, Philippines were analyzed from intensive observations. Diel measurements were conducted for 48 continuous hours for both dry and wet tropical seasons in addition to fine resolution long-term monitoring. Results revealed significant vertical and diel variations of lake variables in spite of a shallow water depth (2.5 m) caused by the intense surface heating from solar irradiance (similar to 800 W m(2)) and accentuated by the lake's high turbidity (16-32 ftu). Late afternoon land-lake breeze (similar to 5-7 m s(-1)) regularly breaks daytime thermal stratification, and convective cooling at night maintains isothermal condition until dawn of the next day. The stratified condition demonstrated a wind-driven, density-induced 2-layer current pattern with a windward moving epilimnion (similar to 4 folds faster) and a compensating hypolimnetic flow in the general lake circulation direction. Laguna Lake was observed to have a dominating diel cycle but also undergoes significant seasonal limnological variations brought primarily by climate, hydrology, and its interaction with the adjacent sea. Significantly correlated variations of pH, chlorophyll-a and DO in the dry season were indicative of the higher biological activity associated with the intrusion of polluted waters from Metro Manila. The non-occurrence of thermal over-turn was observed to be regularly followed by bottom hypoxic conditions (2-4 mg L-1), indicative of the eutrophic condition of the lake and the importance of diel wind-induced mixing in the bottom supply of DO. Laguna Lake was found to be predominantly net heterotrophic (GPP:R < 1, NEP < 0). (C) 2021 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the oxic white water lakes, with neutral pH, high F-MeHg and P-MeHg concentrations were measured during the rising water stage (0.70 +/- 0.37 pmol/L, n = 26) and flood peak (14.19 +/- 9.32 pmol/g, n = 7) respectively, when the Amazon River water discharge into the lakes was at its maximum. The lowest mean values were reported during the dry season (0.18 +/- 0.07 pmol/L F-MeHg, n = 10 and 1.35 +/- 1.24 pmol/g P-MeHg, n = 8), when water and suspended sediments were outflowing from the lakes into the River. In these lakes, the MeHg concentrations were associated to the aluminium and organic carbon/nitrogen changes. In the black water lakes, with acidic pH and reducing conditions, elevated MeHg concentrations were recorded (0.58 +/- 0.32 pmol/L F-MeHg, n = 16 and 19.82 +/- 15.13 pmol/g P-MeHg, n = 6), and correlated with the organic carbon and manganese concentrations. Elevated values of MeHg partition coefficient (4.87 < K-d < 5.08 log (L/kg) indicate that MeHg is mainly transported associated with the particulate phase. The P-MeHg enrichment detected in all lakes suggests autochthonous MeHg inputs from the sediments into the water column. The MeHg mass balance showed that the Curuai floodplain is not the source of P-MeHg for the Amazon River. (C) 2017 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Mosquito abundances are strongly linked to the number of suitable larval habitats available. However, it is still not well understood how different land uses impact larval habitat quality in different parts of the world. We investigated links between land use practices and abundance of mosquito larvae in temporary ponds located in different land uses in a malaria expansion zone in Tanzania. Temporary ponds are often cited as important sources of mosquitoes but are also of substantial conservation concern being home to a unique fauna and flora. Often, they also have high socio-economic importance. Overall, encountered mosquito larval abundances were very low, both for the collected Anopheles gambiae s.l. and Culex quinquefasciatus. Although temporary ponds are important mosquito larval habitats in other parts of Africa, currently they are unlikely to be an important factor affecting the prevalence of mosquito borne diseases in the Manyara study region. Larval abundances in temporary ponds were higher in agricultural areas where more eutrophic conditions were found and minimal in residential areas. Overall, even though temporary ponds are often modified as rice paddies in the rainy season, they were in a good ecological condition and hosted a diverse assemblage of aquatic predators that likely prevented larval mosquitoes from reaching high densities. Maintaining this good condition by preventing pesticide and nutrient input as much as possible, can be important to prevent pond degradation that is likely to make these habitats more suitable for mosquitoes in the future.

Evaluation of the ecological health and food chain on the shores of four River Nile Islands, Egypt	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												This study was conducted to evaluate the impact of human activities on the ecological health and food chain at the shores of four Nile Islands in Great Cairo including El-Qeratten, El-Waraq, El-Zamalek, and El-Manial. Water quality, bacteria, phytoplankton, benthic algae, zooplankton, macrobenthic invertebrates, and bony fishes were examined at each island shore over two seasons including the lowest and the highest flow (February and July 2020, respectively). The obtained results showed that the average values of most of the chemicals in Nile Island's water were within the Egyptian water quality limits. Discriminant analysis of physicochemical factors revealed a similarity between El-Waraq and El-Qerateen and between El-Manial and El-Zamalek. El-Qeratten was the most polluted island. It has the highest total and fecal coliform bacteria count (3.155 and 3.050 Log MPN/100 mL, respectively). El-Zamalek shores have the highest phytoplankton (33,582 cells x 10(4) L-1) and zooplankton count (310,891 organisms x m(-3)) and phyto-biochemical values. Biochemical analysis of phytoplankton demonstrated the richness of the bulk by protein (> 85% of biomass), indicating that phytoplankton has a high nutritional value. Elevated zooplankton count was recorded at El-Zamalek, which coincided with the peak of phytoplankton abundance. Mollusca were the dominant macrobenthic invertebrates on most of the island's shores. Bony fishes were represented by 27 species and two crustaceans. The levels of the metals in fish samples were compared with the food safety guideline endorsed by the World Health Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization (WHO/FAO) to evaluate the toxicity level.					; Salem, Salem/R-4396-2018; Al-Afify, Afify/ADI-1499-2022; Zaher, Shymaa/ABC-8683-2021; El-Sherif, Dina/AAQ-7938-2021; abdelmageed, adel/K-5569-2019; Abdel-Satar, Amaal/AAJ-6756-2020; Ghonamy Salem, Salem/R-4396-2018	Othman, Amal/0000-0001-8864-4553; El-Sherif, Dina/0000-0002-8798-9004; Abdelmageed, Adel/0000-0003-3724-6509; Ahmed, Nehad/0000-0003-4439-4606; Ghonamy Salem, Salem/0000-0002-5203-5710; Abd Ellah, Radwan G./0000-0003-4231-6866													0167-6369	1573-2959				APR	2022	194	4							309	10.1007/s10661-022-09959-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-09959-w								35353284					WOS:000776104100002

The current study reports fisheries output using ICT at major landing sites and markets in Kenya and Uganda from the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI) Enhanced Fish Market Information Service (EFMIS) database for 2009 - 2017. Catch assessment survey data validated the use of market data in drawing conclusions. Regional Frame Survey data provided information before EFMIS, enabling comparisons of fish trade costings. The average quantity of fish traded in Kenya depended on seasons of active lake fishing, which occurs in January - March and August - October, while Uganda had an irregular pattern associated with fish trade throughout the year. The quantity of fish traded weekly depended on the average price of fish. Lower sales margins during the EFMIS project showed the merits of information sharing using ICT platforms for efficient and equitable fish trade. Such evaluation of fish market information is useful in fish trade policy formulation and for fisheries management and ecological sustainability in rural and peri-urban communities.					; Nyamweya, Chrispine/I-5429-2019	Aura, Christopher/0000-0001-9590-9652; Nyamweya, Chrispine/0000-0002-7135-7379													0969-997X	1365-2400				APR	2019	26	2					141	152		10.1111/fme.12334	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fme.12334													WOS:000460175900005

Beaver dams create wetland systems for waterbirds that are utilized throughout different stages of the breeding season. We studied how beaver-induced variability affected mobile pairs and more sedentary broods along with the production of Common Teal Anas crecca at the patch and landscape scale on their breeding grounds. Beavers Castor spp. are ecosystem engineers that enhance waterfowl habitats by impeding water flow and creating temporary flooding. Two landscapes in southern Finland with (Evo) and without (Nuuksio) American Beavers Castor canadensis were used in this study. To investigate the patch-scale effect, pair and brood densities along with brood production were first compared at beaver-occupied lakes and non-beaver lakes in the beaver landscape. Annual pair and brood densities/km shoreline and brood production were compared between beaver and non-beaver landscapes. Facilitative effects of beaver activity were manifest on brood density at both patch and landscape scales: these were over 90% and 60% higher in beaver patches and landscapes, respectively. An effect of beaver presence on pair density was only seen at the landscape level. Pair density did not strongly affect brood production, as shown earlier for relatively mildly density-dependent Teal populations. Because the extent of beaver flooding was a crucial factor affecting annual Teal production in the study area, we infer beaver activity has consequences for the local Teal population. Ecosystem engineering by the beaver could therefore be considered a restoration tool in areas where waterfowl are in need of high-quality habitats.					; Nummi, Petri/AAU-9666-2021	Holopainen, Sari/0000-0002-3271-4468; 													0019-1019	1474-919X				APR	2019	161	2					301	309		10.1111/ibi.12626	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.12626													WOS:000461902700005

Here, we give an integrative review of the observed and predicted impacts of climate change on shallow lakes in the Netherlands and put these impacts in an international perspective. Most of these lakes are man-made and have preset water levels and poorly developed littoral zones. Relevant climatic factors for these ecosystems are temperature, ice-cover and wind. Secondary factors affected by climate include nutrient loading, residence time and water levels. We reviewed the relevant literature in order to assess the impact of climate change on these lakes. We focussed on six management objectives as bioindicators for the functioning of these ecosystems: target species, nuisance species, invading species, transparency, carrying capacity and biodiversity. We conclude that climate change will likely (i) reduce the numbers of several target species of birds; (ii) favour and stabilize cyanobacterial dominance in phytoplankton communities; (iii) cause more serious incidents of botulism among waterfowl and enhance the spreading of mosquito borne diseases; (iv) benefit invaders originating from the Ponto-Caspian region; (v) stabilize turbid, phytoplankton-dominated systems, thus counteracting restoration measures; (vi) destabilize macrophyte-dominated clear-water lakes; (vii) increase the carrying capacity of primary producers, especially phytoplankton, thus mimicking eutrophication; (viii) affect higher trophic levels as a result of enhanced primary production; (ix) have a negative impact on biodiversity which is linked to the clear water state; (x) affect biodiversity by changing the disturbance regime. Water managers can counteract these developments by reduction of nutrient loading, development of the littoral zone, compartmentalization of lakes and fisheries management.

Occurrence and Bioaccumulation of Psychotropic Pharmaceuticals and Their Metabolites in Water and Fish in a Shallow Lake in China: Implications for Ecological and Human Health Risks	ACS ES&T WATER												Psychotropic pharmaceuticalsand their metabolites are a growing concern for aquatic environments and may accumulate in aquatic organisms. In this study, 21 parent psychotropic pharmaceuticals and 8 metabolites from three categories of psychotropic drugs (anxiolytics, antiepileptics, and antidepressants) were evaluated in Gao-Bao-Shaobo lake (GBSL), a shallow lake in China. Among them, 18 psychotropic pharmaceuticals and 8 metabolites were detected in water samples from GBSL (0.2 up to similar to 24.5 ng/L), and 13 psychotropic pharmaceuticals and 5 metabolites were identified in fish (1 up to similar to 126.2 ng/g dw). In the wet season, concentrations of psychotropic pharmaceuticals and their metabolites showed an increase from the inflow to the discharge subarea. Carbamazepine and sertraline were the dominant pharmaceuticals detected in fish with bioaccumulation factors, exceeding 5000 L/kg. Physicochemical parameters (log K-ow and MW) were negatively correlated with the pharmaceutical levels in fish. Carbamazepine posed a moderate risk to aquatic organisms in all subareas. Hazard quotient results showed that the consumption of fish from GBSL is unlikely to exhibit a direct adverse effect on humans. Our results indicated that a comprehensive understanding of psychotropic pharmaceutical contaminations in surface waters should consider not only the parent pharmaceuticals but also the subsequent accumulation of their metabolites in fish.					; Chen, Huihui/L-8521-2019; weng, yuxin/NFT-4581-2025; Martyniuk, Chris/KHV-3522-2024; zha, jinmiao/A-1604-2009	Chen, Huihui/0000-0003-2643-0597; Zhao, Zhonghua/0000-0002-0975-8200; Martyniuk, Christopher J./0000-0003-0921-4796														2690-0637				FEB 10	2023	3	2					520	531		10.1021/acsestwater.2c00553	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsestwater.2c00553													WOS:000936574800001

We hypothesized that such pollen rains act as subsidy pulses, promoting the development of a neustonic microbial food web and the transfer of pollen organic carbon to aquatic consumers. During a pine pollen rain event on an oxbow lake, microorganism concentrations were by far higher in the neuston, where pollen grains accumulated, than in the seston. Zooplankton species were also unevenly distributed in the two compartments. Bulk isotope and isotopes of fatty acid analyses revealed trophic partitioning among these zooplankton species, with some of the taxa foraging specifically on neuston, where they benefit from pollen-derived carbon. Microorganisms were identified as a key element in the trophic upgrading of pollen food quality and in the transfer of pollen carbon to metazoan consumers. Pollen rains may thus contribute, as an allochthonous food pulse, to aquatic production at specific seasons, but they may also act as a structuring factor in lake habitats.					; Kagami, Maiko/L-4430-2018; Masclaux, Helene/S-1265-2017	Perga, Marie-Elodie/0000-0002-9003-0769; Kagami, Maiko/0000-0003-3086-390X; Masclaux, Helene/0000-0002-5869-8419; Bec, Alexandre/0000-0003-4353-3766													0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	2013	58	4					1185	1195		10.4319/lo.2013.58.4.1185	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2013.58.4.1185													WOS:000322514600004

The sediments were collected on a total of nine sampling sites (three per Lake) during two campaigns (dry season and rainy season). The quality of the sediments was assessed on the basis of the enrichment factor (EF) and the labile or non-residual fraction (NRF) in relation to the values recommended for the quality of the sediments (Sediment Quality Guidelines, SQG). The distribution of rare earth elements shows enrichments in light rare earths superior to those of heavy rare earth elements during any season. Positive Ce anomalies are less noticeable and less variable between seasons than Eu anomalies. La/Yb ratios are positively correlated with the percentage of Al and Fe oxides and with the percentage of fine fractions. The main bearing phases of rare earth elements are, therefore, Al and Fe oxides and the finest fractions of the sediments. The concentrations of trace elements vary little, according to the seasons, but show strong variations from one element to another. The degrees of enrichment obtained are moderate for Bi, Cr, Ga, Mo, Pb, Sn, and Zn (1.5 < EF < 5) to significant for As, Cd, and Sb (5 < EF < 20) for all sites of Lake Be. For the sites of West Lake, the degrees of enrichment obtained are moderate for As, Cd, Cu, Mo, and Pb (1.5 < EF < 5) to a significance for As, Bi, Cd, Pb, Sb, Sn, and Zn (5 < EF < 20). Only the East Lake sites show high degrees of enrichment for elements such as Sb and Sn (20 < EF < 40). Trace elements (TE) such as As, Cd, Cu, and Ni have total concentrations within the range of variation of the SQG concentrations (particularly Probable Effect Level (PEL) and Effect Range Median (ERM)), whereas Cr, Pb, and Zn total concentrations are higher. The ranking of priority sites with respect to the sediment contamination is determined according to ERM and PEL quotients in relation to the probability of toxicity for benthic organisms. For almost all the sites, the priority is lowest to medium-low with regard to As, Cd, and Cu and medium-high (Cr and Ni) to highest (Pb and Zn), particularly for the East and West Lakes. Moreover, the NRF can represent significant percentages of the total TE concentrations: 5% to 15% for As, Bi, Ni, V, Mo, and Sc, 15% to 25% for Co, Cu, and Sr, 25% to 40% for Pb and Zn and, lastly, 47% to 55% for Cd.					; PROBST, Jean-Luc/Z-5802-2019	Probst, Jean-Luc/0000-0002-1295-5264; OURO-SAMA, Kamilou/0000-0001-9220-7487; 														2073-4441				NOV	2020	12	11							3026	10.3390/w12113026	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12113026													WOS:000594893000001

The new method was tested and validated over the Curuai floodplain in the lower Amazon River, where the entire bathymetry was surveyed in 2004, and water level gauge data has been available since 1960. The depth was estimated based on the relationship derived from IF and surveyed depth data, and the results were compared to those retrieved from bare-Earth DEM. We further assessed the sensitivity of the approach by analyzing the deepest part of the lake (i.e., permanent water body similar to 8m) with high IF, as well as the effect of gradual sedimentation in the lake over time. The results showed that the model is highly accurate and sensitive to IF changes even in the permanent water body areas, suggesting that this model can be used in other seasonal lakes worldwide with turbid-waters, where large-scale bathymetry surveys are not feasible due to high operation costs.

In this study, CH4 emissions from different land uses were measured in the TGR drawdown area. The average diffusive CH4 emissions were 2.61, 0.19, 0.18, and 0.12 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) in rice paddies, fallow lands, deforested lands, and croplands, respectively, and were positively related to the duration of the inundated season among the latter three land uses. On average the drawdown areas studied here (except rice paddies) were sources in the inundated season (0.22 +/- 0.26 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) and a sink in the drained season (-0.008 +/- 0.035 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)). The water level was the dominant factor that controlled whether the drawdown area was either inundated or drained, which in turn determined whether the drawdown area was a source or sink of CH4 emissions. The average diffusive CH4 emissions from the fallow lands, croplands, and deforested lands increased as the distance from the dam increased from Zigui (0.10 +/- 0.15 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) to Wushan (0.15 +/- 0.29 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) to Yunyang (0.24 +/- 0.27 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)), which could reflect different sediment characteristics and water velocities. The total CH4 emission from the drawdown area was estimated to range from 1033.5 to 1333.9 Mg CH4 yr(-1), which would account for 42-54% of the total CH4 emissions from the water surface of TGR.

We have comfirmed that MCs could accumulate and induce apoptosis in rat testis. The p53, Bax, and Bcl-2 protein play important roles in mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway, and this study aimed to investigate whether the p53, Bax, and Bcl-2 pathway is involved in microcystins-induced apoptosis in rat testis and discussed the possible mechanisms. Our results show that MCs led to persistent increase of transcriptional and protein level of P53 and Bax expression but led to decrease of Bcl-2 expression, resulting in an increased ratio of Bax to Bcl-2, which might contribute to apoptotic cell death of rat testis following MCs treatment. The increased ratio of expression of Bax to that of Bcl-2 induced by MCs suggests their important role in MCs-induced apoptosis in rat testis tissue. (c) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Ubiquity of Polynucleobacter necessarius ssp asymbioticus in lentic freshwater habitats of a heterogenous 2000 km2 area	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												P>We present a survey on the distribution and habitat range of Polynucleobacter necessarius ssp. asymbioticus (PnecC), a numerically and functionally important taxon in the plankton of freshwater systems. We systematically sampled stagnant freshwater habitats in a heterogeneous 2000 km2 area, together with ecologically different habitats outside this area. In total, 137 lakes, ponds and puddles were investigated, which represent an enormous diversity of habitats differing, e.g. in depth (< 10 cm - 171 m) and pH (3.9-8.5). PnecC bacteria were detected by cultivation-independent methods in all investigated habitats, and their presence was confirmed by cultivation of strains from selected habitats representing the whole studied ecological range. The determined relative abundance of the subspecies ranged from values close to the detection limit of FISH (0.2%) to 67% (average 14.5%), and the highest observed absolute abundance was 5.3 x 106 cells ml-1. Statistical analyses revealed that the abundance of PnecC bacteria was partially controlled by factors linked to concentrations of humic substances, which support the hypothesis that these bacteria utilize photodegradation products of humic substances. Based on the revealed statistical relationships, an average relative abundance of this subspecies of 20% in global freshwater habitats was extrapolated. Our study provides important implications for the current debate on ubiquity and biogeography in microorganisms.

Cyclical size change and population dynamics of a planktonic diatom, Aulacoseira baicalensis, in Lake Baikal	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												Most diatoms undergo a cyclical process of size reduction and size restoration, which is used to time their life cycle. However, the effect of this on population dynamics of natural populations is poorly understood. Therefore, their interaction was investigated over several life cycles of a planktonic diatom (Aulacoseira baicalensis) in Lake Baikal as part of a multidisciplinary study lasting 10 years. Changes in abundance and diameter were affected in a complex way by a number of interacting factors that included silica availability, the number of divisions in a growing season, diameter-dependent sedimentation losses, grazing, limited frustule lifetime and faster size decline than predicted in stressed cells. There was also a density-dependent effect on size restoration and the recruitment of large cells into the population, which interacted with the other factors to cause large changes in annual cell abundance observed in the lake over the last 60 years.

J	Marchetto, A; Rogora, M; Arisci, S				Marchetto, Aldo; Rogora, Michela; Arisci, Silvia			Trend analysis of atmospheric deposition data: A comparison of statistical approaches	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Numerical simulation was used to compare the most used trend analysis techniques on data series of ionic concentrations in atmospheric deposition. The Seasonal Kendall Test (SKT) showed the highest power, which increased in particular when using original weekly data instead of pooling together the samples in monthly or yearly volume-weighted averages. The simulation also showed that differences in power among tests and pooling intervals would be negligible for data series longer than about 12 years. We tested these results using data from a network of bulk deposition samplers at nine forest sites in Italy, for which data have been available since 1998. These sites were selected in different forests, ranging from arid Mediterranean evergreen oak forest to rainy Alpine beech or spruce forests. The results showed relevant differences as regards the number of significant trends detected using different techniques and different data pooling, even for 13-year data series. The use of minimum-maximum autocorrelation factor analysis allowed a better interpretation of the data, showing the main trend shapes among stations and variables. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Sediment deposition and sources into a Mississippi River floodplain lake; Catahoula Lake, Louisiana	CATENA												Floodplain lakes are important wetlands on many lowland floodplains of the world but depressional floodplain lakes are rare in the Mississippi River Alluvial Valley. One of the largest is Catahoula Lake, which has existed with seasonally fluctuating water levels for several thousand years but is now in an increasingly hydrologically altered floodplain. Woody vegetation has been encroaching into the lake bed and the rate of this expansion has increased since major human hydrologic modifications, such as channelization, levee construction, and dredging for improvement of navigation, but it remains unknown what role those modifications may have played in altering lake sedimentation processes. Profiles of thirteen Cs-137 sedinient cores indicate sedimentation has been about 0.26 cm y(-1) over the past 60 years and has been near this rate since land use changes began about 200 years ago (Pb-210, and C-14 in Tedford, 2009). Carbon sequestration was low (10.4 g m(-2) y(-1)), likely because annual drying promotes mineralization and export. Elemental composition (high Zr and Ti and low Ca and K) and low pH of recent (< similar to 60 y) or surface sediments suggest Gulf Coastal Plain origin, but below the recent sediment deposits, 51% of sediment profiles showed influence of Mississippi River alluvium, rich in base cations such as K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+. The recent shift to dominance of Coastal Plain sediments on the lake-bed surface suggests hydrologic modification has disconnected the lake from sediment-bearing flows from the Mississippi River. Compared to its condition prior to hydrologic alterations that intensified in the 1930s, Catahoula Lake is about 15 cm shallower and surficial sediments are more acidic. Although these results are not sufficient to attribute ecological changes directly to sedimentological changes, it is likely the altered sedimentary and hydrologic environment is contributing to the increased dominance of woody vegetation.

J	Li, XL; Xue, ZP; Gao, J				Li, Xilai; Xue, Zaipo; Gao, Jay			Dynamic Changes of Plateau Wetlands in Madou County, the Yellow River Source Zone of China: 1990-2013	WETLANDS												Plateau wetland is a special kind of ecosystem highly vulnerable to change and shrinkage owing to natural fluctuations and external disturbance. In the past wetlands have been mapped as a single category, making it difficult to assess the relative importance of natural and anthropogenic variables in the change. In this study, wetlands in Maduo County in the headwater zone of the Yellow River were mapped into six types based on their hydro-geomorphic properties from Landsat satellite images of 1990, 2001 and 2013. The changes between wetlands and non-wetlands in two separate decades were detected from the produced wetland maps in ArcGIS. The obtained results indicate that there were 8542 km(2) of wetlands (about 33 % of the county's territory) in 1990. They shrank to 7,061 km(2) in 2001, but expanded to 7,972 km(2) in 2013. During 1990-2001 all six types of wetland suffered a loss, with alpine wetland shrunk the most, followed by piedmont wetland. In general, the higher the ground at which a wetland was located, the more it lost. This trend of decrease was reversed in almost the same order during 2001-2013. Namely, the higher the ground of the wetland, the more it gained. Analysis of climate data suggests that temperature is not critical to the observed change in wetland area. Instead, it is the warm season rainfall that has exerted the most influence over the observed change. Population bears no clear relationship with wetland change. The reduced sheep population by 54.5 % during 2001-2013 helped to improve the eco-environment of the study area and to reverse the shrinking trend of wetlands.																			0277-5212	1943-6246				APR	2016	36	2					299	310		10.1007/s13157-016-0739-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-016-0739-6													WOS:000373643900009

Approximately 70% of the lakes are elliptical in shape and 15% are elongated. About 80% of the lakes are unfrozen to the bottom throughout the year while a larger portion of it, about 60%, may be underlain by taliks that penetrate permafrost The BLH-A Lake, a representative lake with 2-m deep water in the region, has been observed for about four years (from 2006 to 2009). Ice starts to cover on the lake-surface after mid-October, and its thickness increases to 60 to 70 cm by the end of cold season. The ice cover then starts to melt in later April and melts completely around mid-May. The lake-surface temperatures change sinusoidally with the air temperatures, but lagging about half a month. The water warms with the increase of the water depth, and the maximum annual temperature appears at depth of 1.5 m with a value of 14.3 degrees C on July 30, 2007. The lake-bottom temperatures are not isothermal at different depths for most time of a year. It may be related to the variable climate, little snow, and intensive solar radiation. The mean annual lake-bottom temperatures are about 5.5 degrees C in the deep pool with 2 m deep water and 4.3 degrees C in the shallow nearshore zone with 1 m deep water. The warm lake-bottom causes considerable disturbance to the permafrost. Surveyed data show that there is no permafrost under the lake when the mean annual lake-bottom temperature is over 5 degrees C.

The most rapid uptake and transformation of inorganic nitrogen occurred in the smallest streams. Ammonium entering these streams was removed from the water within a few tens to hundreds of meters. Nitrate was also removed from stream water but traveled a distance 5 to 10 times as long, on average, as ammonium. Despite low ammonium concentration in stream water, nitrification rates were high, indicating that small streams are potentially important sources of atmospheric nitrous oxide. During seasons of high biological activity, the reaches of headwater streams typically export downstream Less than half of the input of dissolved inorganic nitrogen from their watersheds.

J	Abegaz, NT; Tsidu, GM; Arsiso, BK				Abegaz, Nuredin Teshome; Tsidu, Gizaw Mengistu; Arsiso, Bisrat Kifle			Spatiotemporal Variability of the Lake Tana Water Quality Derived from the MODIS-Based Forel-Ule Index: The Roles of Hydrometeorological and Surface Processes	ATMOSPHERE												Lake Tana, the largest inland water body in Ethiopia, has witnessed significant changes due to ongoing urbanization and socioeconomic activities in recent times. In this study, the two-decade recordings of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used to derive Forel-Ule index (FUI). The FUI, which ranges from 1 (dark-blue pristine water) to 21 (yellowish-brown polluted water), is important to fully understand the quality and trophic state of the lake in the last two decades. The analysis of FUI over a period of 22 years (2000-2021) indicates that Lake Tana is in a eutrophic state as confirmed by FUI values ranging from 11 to 17. This is in agreement with the trophic state index (TSI) estimated from MERIS diversity-II chlorophyll a (Chl_a) measurements for the overlapping 2003-2011 period. The categorical skill scores show that FUI-based lake water trophic state classification relative to MERIS-based TSI has a high performance. FUI has a positive correlation with TSI, (Chl_a), turbidity, and total suspended matter (TSM) and negative relations with Chl_a and TSM (at the lake shoreline) and colored dissolved organic matter. The annual, interannual and seasonal spatial distribution of FUI over the lake show a marked variation. The hydro-meteorological, land-use-land-cover (LULC) related processes are found to modulate the spatiotemporal variability of water quality within the range of lower and upper extremes of the eutrophic state as revealed from the FUI composite analysis. The FUI composites were obtained for the terciles and extreme percentiles of variables representing hydro-meteorological and LULC processes. High FUI composite (poor water quality) is associated with above-normal and extremely high (85 percentile) lake bottom layer temperature, wind speed, precipitation, surface runoff, and hydrometeorological drought as captured by high negative standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI). In contrast, a high FUI composite is observed during below-normal and extremely low (15 percentile) lake skin temperature and evaporation. Conversely good water quality (i.e., low FUI) was observed during times of below-normal and above-normal values of the above two sets of drivers respectively. Moreover, FUI varies in response to seasonal NDVI/EVI variabilities. The relationship between water quality and its drivers is consistent with the expected physical processes under different ranges of the drivers. High wind speed, for instance, displaces algae blooms to the shoreline whereas intense precipitation and increased runoff lead to high sediment loads. Increasing lake skin temperature increases evaporation, thereby decreasing water volume and increasing insoluble nutrients, while the increasing lake bottom layer temperature increases microbial activity, thereby enhancing the phosphorus load. Moreover, during drought events, the low inflow and high temperature allow algal bloom, Chl_a, and suspended particles to increase, whereas high vegetation leads to an increase in the non-point sources of total phosphorus and nitrogen.

J	Duan, ZZ; Wang, MJ; Chang, XX; Gao, W				Duan, Zhongzhao; Wang, Mingjing; Chang, Xuexiu; Gao, Wei			Response of river-lake hydrologic regimes to local climate change in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau region, China	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												Climate change affects hydrological regimes by influencing precipitation and air temperature. The climate change effects on lake hydrology in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau of China remain unclear. Lake Dianchi, the Plateau's largest lake subject to human interference, was selected for the study. Algorithms based on historical meteorological data produced high-resolution climate change scenarios describing climate characteristics at a local watershed scale. Integrated river and lake hydrological models simulated changes in inflow, lake volume, and hydrological extremes under different scenarios. Results showed that Lake Dianchi Basin (LDB) inflow would decrease by 1.88 similar to 2.21% if air temperature increased by 1 similar to 2 degrees C but increase by 1.23 similar to 16.1% if precipitation increased by 5 similar to 20%. Lake volume would change minimally (decrease of 0.87 similar to 1.15%) if air temperature increased 1 similar to 2 degrees C and if precipitation increased 5 similar to 20% (increase of 0.04 similar to 4.12%); thus, the hydrological regimes of LDB are more sensitive to precipitation than air temperature. Changes to 3-day and 7-day maximum hydrological extremes were double those of 3-day and 7-day minimums, indicating precipitation-affected maximum extreme hydrological events during wet season more than minimum extreme hydrological events during dry season. In conclusion, both unevenly distributed precipitation and increasing air temperature will increase wet season floods and dry-season droughts in plateau lakes like Lake Dianchi.

Recent studies about these two denitrifying genes are focusing on sediment and wastewater microbe. In this study, we conducted a comparative analysis of the abundance and diversity of denitrifiers in the epiphyton of submerged macrophytes Potamogeton malaianus and Ceratophyllum demersum as well as in bacterioplankton in the shallow fresh lake Taihu, China. Results showed that nirK and nirS genes had significant different niches in epiphyton and bacterioplankton. Bacterioplankton showed greater abundance of nirK gene in terms of copy numbers and lower abundance of nirS gene. Significant difference in the abundance of nirK and nirS genes also existed between the epiphyton from different submerged macrophytes. Similar community diversity yet different community abundance was observed between epiphytic bacteria and bacterioplankton. No apparent seasonal variation was found either in epiphytic bacteria or bacterioplankton; however, environmental parameters seemed to have direct relevancy with nirK and nirS genes. Our study suggested that submerged macrophytes have greater influence than seasonal parameters in shaping the presence and abundance of bacterial denitrifiers. Further investigation needs to focus on the potential contact and relative contribution between denitrifiers and environmental factors.

This study analyzed hydrological data and concentrations of 11 water quality parameters, including total nitrogen, total phosphorus, ammonia nitrogen and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), for water samples collected from 15 sampling sites between 2009 and 2014. The water quality of sites in the northern Poyang Lake-Yangtze River waterway was influenced by different environmental parameters compared to sites in central lake, especially for Chl-a concentration. All pollutant parameters were significantly higher in the river phase (water level <14 m) than in the lake phase (water level >14 m) (p < 0.05). These results were confirmed via principal component analysis, which identified three principal components that explained over 79% of the dataset variance. Among all the parameters related to climatic factors, eutrophication and organic pollution were the most important contributors in water quality. Dilution was the controlling factor that drove the seasonal variability in the water quality of the Poyang Lake, China. This work further indicated that regulating pollutant effluents in tributaries and water level within the lake could improve the water quality in Poyang Lake, which may give some impetus for water quality management.					dai, xue/KFB-3128-2024; 陈, 雨薇/HKF-1175-2023														2073-4441					JUL	2016	8	7							296	10.3390/w8070296	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w8070296													WOS:000380764800029

An automatic cloud mask algorithm based on time series of MODIS measurements	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												[1] Quality of aerosol retrievals and atmospheric correction over land depends strongly on accuracy of the cloud mask (CM) algorithm. The heritage CM algorithms developed for AVHRR and MODIS use the latest sensor measurements of spectral reflectance and brightness temperature and perform processing at the pixel level. The algorithms are threshold-based and empirically tuned. They do not explicitly address the classical problem of cloud search, wherein the baseline clear-skies scene is defined for comparison. Here we report on a new land CM algorithm, which explicitly builds and maintains a reference clear-skies image of the surface (refcm) using a time series of MODIS measurements. The new algorithm, developed as part of the multiangle implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) algorithm for MODIS, relies on the fact that clear-skies images of the same surface area have a common textural pattern, defined by the surface topography, boundaries of rivers and lakes, distribution of soils and vegetation, etc. This pattern changes slowly given the daily rate of global Earth observations, whereas clouds introduce high-frequency random disturbances. Under clear skies, consecutive gridded images of the same surface area have a high covariance, whereas in presence of clouds covariance is usually low. This idea is central to initialization of refcm, which is used to derive cloud mask in combination with spectral and brightness temperature tests. The refcm is continuously updated with the latest clear-skies MODIS measurements, thus adapting to seasonal and rapid surface changes. The algorithm is enhanced by an internal dynamic land-water-snow classification coupled with a surface change mask. An initial comparison shows that the new algorithm offers the potential to perform better than the MODIS MOD35 cloud mask in situations where the land surface is changing rapidly and over Earth regions covered by snow and ice.

In this study, field plot experiments were conducted to investigate N losses through runoff and leaching for two consecutive years with 3 N fertilization rates in rice (Oryza sativa L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotations in the Taihu Lake region, China. A water collection system was designed to collect runoff and leachates for both the rice and wheat seasons. Results showed that dissolved N (DN), rather than particulate N (PN), was the main form of N loss by runoff. The NO3--N concentration in runoff was between 0.1 and 43.7 mg L-1, whereas the NH4+-N concentration ranged from below detection limit to 8.5 mg L-1. Total N (TN) loads by runoff were 1.0-17.9 and 5.2-38.6 kg ha(-1) during rice and wheat seasons, respectively, and the main loss occurred at the early growing stage of the crops. Nitrogen concentrations in leachates during the rice seasons were below 1.0 mg L-1 and independent of the N application rate, whereas those during the wheat season increased to 8.2 mg L-1 and were affected by the fertilizer rate. Annual losses of TN through runoff and leaching were 13.7-48.1 kg ha(-1) from the rice-wheat cropping system, accounting for 5.6%-8.3% of the total applied N. It was concluded that reduction in the N fertilization rate, especially when the crop was small in biomass, could lower the N pollution potential for water systems.

J	Deirmendjian, L; Descy, JP; Morana, C; Okello, W; Stoyneva-Gärtner, MP; Bouillon, S; Borges, AV				Deirmendjian, Loris; Descy, Jean-Pierre; Morana, Cedric; Okello, William; Stoyneva-Gartner, Maya P.; Bouillon, Steven; Borges, Alberto, V			Limnological changes in Lake Victoria since the mid-20th century	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Lake Victoria experienced a strong degradation of water quality between the 1960s and the 1990s and, as a consequence of eutrophication, the dominant phytoplankton group changed from diatoms to N-2-fixing cyanobacteria and there was a 2- to 10-fold increase in chlorophyll-a. The goal of this study is to determine whether the 2018-2019 physical (light, stratification) and ecological (nutrient, chlorophyll-a, phytoplankton composition) conditions in Lake Victoria changed from the 1990s. Samples were collected in 2018-2019 in nearshore and offshore waters (Uganda), during three contrasting seasons: heavy rains (March), low rains (October), and dry (June), which corresponded to distinct water column mixing regimes, respectively, late-stratified, early-stratified, and mixed regimes. At each station (48 nearshore and 25 offshore), we measured vertical profiles of temperature, oxygen, phytoplankton biomass and composition, inorganic nutrients, and particulate organic carbon, particulate nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). Chlorophyll-a concentrations in 2018-2019 were 10.3 +/- 7.1 and 2.8 +/- 1.1 mu g/L in the nearshore and offshore surface waters, respectively, close to those measured in the 1960s before eutrophication, but distinctly lower than those measured in the 1990s (71 +/- 100 and 14 +/- 6 mu g/L). The phytoplankton of Lake Victoria in 2018-2019 still appears dominated by diatoms and cyanobacteria. However, we observed more non-heterocystous filamentous and coccal/colonial cyanobacteria taxa that are better adapted to mixing conditions than gas-vacuolated heterocystous taxa, which were dominant in the 1990s. Particulate N was significantly lower in 2018-2019 than in the 1990s, indicative of less efficient N fixation. The dissolved silica concentrations in 2018-2019 were significantly higher with the concomitant reappearance of Aulacoseira spp., which was not observed in the 1990s, presumably due to low dissolved silica concentrations. As data from long-term monitoring are absent, the reasons for the lower chlorophyll-a concentrations in 2018-2019 compared to the 1990s are unclear. However, climatic controls (El Nino/La Nina conditions) may be an important factor influencing the historical trend in chlorophyll-a. Higher wind in 2018-2019 promoted vertical mixing, resulting in a deeper thermocline and surface mixed layers, which eventually lowered phytoplankton production in comparison to the 1990s. In contrast, the thermocline and surface mixed layers in the 1990s were shallower, enabling phytoplankton to stay suspended in the upper well illuminated water, allowing greater productivity. The lake in 2018-2019 is still P saturated, suggesting that another episode of high chlorophyll-a concentrations could develop if less windy conditions occur in future, or if continued warming of surface waters eventually overcomes the mixing from present windy conditions. This study gives insights about the present ecological functioning of Lake Victoria and emphasises the impacts of variations in climate on lake physics that changes the light environment for phytoplankton. A possible less windy period in the future resulting from a new El Nino phase or from climate change, will probably lead to another episode of eutrophication in Lake Victoria. As in 2018-2019 the lake was still saturated by nutrients, there is need to reduce the nutrient concentrations (especially P) to prevent future destructive eutrophic periods caused by reduced mixing.					; Deirmendjian, Loris/AAR-9024-2020; Borges, Alberto/C-4989-2008; Stoyneva-Gärtner, Maya/F-4549-2018; Bouillon, Steven/C-5177-2011; Morana, Cedric/AAL-5025-2021	Deirmendjian, Loris/0000-0002-5720-9951; Stoyneva-Gartner, Maya/0000-0003-2439-3737; Okello, William/0000-0001-7275-0423; Borges, Alberto V./0000-0002-5434-2247; Bouillon, Steven/0000-0001-7669-2929; Descy, Jean-Pierre/0000-0003-1649-7800; Morana, Cedric/0000-0002-5521-0414													0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	2021	66	8					1630	1647		10.1111/fwb.13780	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13780		JUN 2021											WOS:000663012700001

Water circulation in Toronto Harbour	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												We present an overview of physical processes that drive water circulation within the extended system of coastal embayments in the Toronto Harbour. The different water circulation patterns occur at various spatial and temporal scales, and our article provides context for the various efforts to improve water quality by the Toronto and Region Remedial Action Plan. Velocity profiles and water level measurements showed that the harbour's Helmholtz pumping mode drives a 1-h period oscillation, which can influence flushing of the shallow embayments. This process likely persists year-round and would lead to flushing time-scales of between 1-11 days for these shallow embayments. If this ubiquitous pumping is combined with solar heat fluxes, it partially explains the persistent temperature gradients amongst the shallow embayments. In the larger and deeper (similar to 10 m) Inner Harbour, the prevailing westerly winds drive most of the mean circulation, with a current entering through the Western Gap and leaving through the Eastern Gap. This wind driven circulation leads to a residence time of water in the Inner Harbour between 7-14 days. In addition, periodic strong and sustained westerly winds can induce frequent upwelling events in Lake Ontario (between 4 to 10 times during the stratified season) that mildly increase the exchange flow and help maintain good water quality by exchange nearshore waters with cleaner hypolimentic waters. The intrusion of cold water into the harbour can also lead to highly variable temperature regimes with sudden drops in temperature that could have negative effects on aquatic organisms.					; wells, mathew/A-7101-2012; Font, Liset/AAF-2618-2020; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010	Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; wells, mathew/0000-0003-3838-9202; Hlevca, Bogdan/0000-0001-6636-4139; Cruz Font, Liset/0000-0003-1809-1740; 													1463-4988	1539-4077					2018	21	3			SI		234	244		10.1080/14634988.2018.1500059	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634988.2018.1500059													WOS:000446707400003

Large surface water bodies have an ephemeral nature in the vast sedimentary plains of the Pampas (Argentina) where non-flooded periods alternate with flooding cycles covering up to one third of the landscape for several months. Based on temperature records from 17 sites located 1 to 700 km away from the Atlantic coast and MODIS land surface temperature data, we explore the effects of floods on diurnal and seasonal thermal ranges as well as temperature extremes. In non-flooded periods, there is a linear increase of mean diurnal thermal range (DTR) from the coast towards the interior of the region (DTR increasing from 10 to 16 K, 0.79 K/100 km, r (2) = 0.81). This relationship weakens during flood episodes when the DTR of flood-prone inland locations shows a decline of 2 to 4 K, depending on surface water coverage in the surrounding area. DTR even approaches typical coastal values 500 km away from the ocean in the most flooded location that we studied during the three flooding cycles recorded in the study period. Frosts-free periods, a key driver of the phenology of both natural and cultivated ecosystems, are extended by up to 55 days during floods, most likely as a result of enhanced ground heat storage across the landscape (similar to 2.7 fold change in day-night heat transfer) combined with other effects on the surface energy balance such as greater night evaporation rates. The reduced thermal range and longer frost-free periods affect plant growth development and may offer an opportunity for longer crop growing periods, which may not only contribute to partially compensating for regional production losses caused by floods, but also open avenues for flood mitigation through higher plant evapotranspirative water losses.					; Kuppel, Sylvain/H-6958-2019; Rusticucci, Matilde/K-5249-2017; Jobbágy, Esteban/A-6293-2010; Nosetto, Marcelo/JSK-2886-2023; Rusticucci, Matilde/Y-6481-2019	Di Bella, Carlos M./0000-0001-7044-0931; Rusticucci, Matilde/0000-0003-2588-6234; Nosetto, Marcelo/0000-0002-9428-490X; 													0177-798X	1434-4483				JAN	2018	131	1-2					111	120		10.1007/s00704-016-1959-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-016-1959-7													WOS:000419885200009

The spatial changes in population structure of L. inopinata match the within-lake hydraulic gradients, with the older instars preferentially deposited in the littoral zone while the younger instars being more abundant in deeper waters. We propose that molt and mortem remains of ostracods, especially those of the small juveniles, experience downslope transport. The magnitude of transport in a lake is controlled by wind-driven hydrodynamics. There is no chemical dissolution of ostracod valves in these alkaline lakes, and degradation is mainly represented by physical breakage. The preservation of L. inopinata is related to sedimentation rate and hydraulic stability, and the spatial pattern of preservation varies between lakes. Spatial and seasonal changes in sedimentation rate and hydraulic condition, and the ostracod life cycle may have contributed to this complexity. Adult and A-7 carapaces are the most frequent among the instars. We suggest that the preferential preservation of juvenile carapaces is either related to high mortality rate or to the good preservation in deep waters.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2015	747	1					1	18		10.1007/s10750-014-2118-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-014-2118-8													WOS:000349967400001

Sinninghe			Seasonal changes in glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether concentrations and fluxes in a perialpine lake: Implications for the use of the TEX86 and BIT proxies	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												To determine where and when glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) membrane lipids in lakes are produced, we collected descending particles in Lake Lucerne (Switzerland) using two sediment traps (at 42 and 72 m water depth) with a monthly resolution from January 2008 to late March 2009. Suspended particulate matter (SPM) was monthly filtered from the water column at three different depths. The potential application of GDGTs in palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic reconstructions was investigated by comparing core lipids and their relative GDGT distribution, with lake water temperatures throughout the year. Fluxes of GDGTs and their concentrations in the water column vary according to a seasonal pattern, showing a similar trend in the SPM and sediment traps. Fluxes and concentrations of isoprenoid GDGTs increase with depth, maximum values being observed in the deeper part of the water column, indicating production of isoprenoid GDGTs by Thaumarchaeota in the deep (similar to 50 m), aphotic zone of Lake Lucerne. The flux-weighted averages of the proxies TEX86 (0.27) and BIT (0.03) based on the total extracted GDGTs are similar at both trap depths. A sediment core from the same location showed that in the first few centimetres of the core TEX86 and BIT values of 0.29 and 0.07, respectively, are similar to those recorded for descending particles and SPM, indicating that the sedimentary TEX86 records the annual mean temperature of deeper waters in Lake Lucerne. TEX86 values are slightly higher below 20 cm in the core. This offset is interpreted to be caused by the present-day trophic state of the lake, which probably resulted in a deeper niche of the Thaumarchaeota. Branched GDGTs represent only a minor fraction of the total GDGTs in the lake and their origin remains unclear. Our data reveal that GDGTs in lakes have a large potential for palaeoclimatic studies but indicate that knowledge of the system is important for accurate interpretation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Variability in the mean latitude of the Atlantic Intertropical Convergence Zone as recorded by riverine input of sediments to the Cariaco Basin (Venezuela)	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Changes in the strength and position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) are an important component of climate variability in the tropical Atlantic. The Cariaco Basin, located on the northern margin of Venezuela, is sensitive to tropical Atlantic climate change and its sediments provide a record of past ITCZ behavior. Today, the Cariaco Basin experiences two distinct seasons that reflect the annual migration of the Atlantic ITCZ. Between January and March, when the ITCZ lies south of the equator, northeasterly trade winds sit directly over Cariaco Basin and strong coastal upwelling and dry conditions dominate. Beginning in June-July, as the ITCZ moves north, local rainfall reaches a maximum and the upwelling diminishes or disappears. Here we summarize new and previously published data on the river-derived terrigenous fraction of Cariaco Basin sediments, as well as comparisons to other paleoclimate records, which together suggest a coherent climatologic response in the tropical Atlantic triggered by a pattern of ITCZ migration that mimics the seasonal cycle. During periods of cooler North Atlantic SSTs, on time-scales ranging from the Little Ice Age to the Younger Dryas to the cold stadials of the last glacial, decreased detrital delivery to Cariaco Basin from local rivers suggests a southward shift in the mean latitudinal position of the ITCZ. During warm interstadials and periods of Holocene and deglacial warmth, northward shifts in ITCZ position and its belt of convective rainfall are inferred from increased dettrital delivery to the basin. Whether the rapid shifts in ITCZ position and precipitation recorded by Cariaco Basin sediments and other regional records reflect a response to forcing originating in the high latitude Atlantic or to forcing potentially sourced in the tropics is a key question yet to be fully answered.

Modeling the carbon isotope signatures of methane and dissolved inorganic carbon to unravel mineralization pathways in boreal lake sediments	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Vertical profiles of the concentration and isotopic composition (delta C-13) of methane (CH4) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), as well as of ancillary parameters, were obtained in the top 25 cm of a sediment column in a seasonally anoxic basin from an oligotrophic boreal lake. Modeling the profiles of CH4 and DIC concentrations and those of their delta C-13 signatures with reaction-transport equations allowed us to determine the organic matter (OM) degradation rates according to various reactions and to constrain the in situ isotopic fractionation factors and diffusivity coefficients of CH4 and DIC. This exercise reveals inter alia that (i) CH4 production occurs below a depth of 5 cm, with the highest production rate between 5 and 7.5 cm depth, (ii) all CH4 is produced through hydrogenotrophy, and (iii) methanogenesis yields a production rate of CH4 about three times greater than that of DIC. This latter observation indicates either that fermentation of OM is not the exclusive source of H-2 sustaining hydrogenotrophy, or that the commonly assumed model molecule CH2O does not adequately represent the fermenting OM, since its fermentation yields identical rates of CH4 and DIC production. The porewater profiles of Fe and SO42- suggest that some H-2 may be produced during the reoxidation of reduced sulfur by Fe(III), but the rate of H-2 production via this process, if active, would be insignificant in comparison to that required to sustain the estimated rate of hydrogenotrophy. We deduce that the imbalance between CH4 and DIC production rates is rather due to the fermentation of organic substrates that are more reduced than CH2O, i.e., having a negative average carbon oxidation state (COS). From the constraints on reaction rates and on fermentation pathways imposed by the delta C-13 data, we infer that the organic substrate fermenting between depths of 5 and 7.5 cm should have a COS of -1.87. We thus submit that CH4 is produced in the sediments of the seasonally anoxic basin of our boreal lake through hydrogenotrophy coupled to the fermentation of reduced organic substrates that can be represented by a mixture of fatty acids (e.g. C16H32O2; COS of -1.75) and fatty alcohols (e.g., C(16)H(3)4O; COS of -2.00). This study emphasizes the importance of characterizing the sedimentary OM undergoing mineralization in order to improve diagenetic model predictions of CH4 cycling in boreal lakes and of its significance in climate change.

J	Ludovisi, A				Ludovisi, Alessandro			Effectiveness of entropy-based functions in the analysis of ecosystem state and development	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Following the advances in the field of the thermodynamics of far-from-equilibrium systems, several ecological orientors (indicators able to describe the stage and orientation of ecosystem development) incorporating entropy terms have been proposed. Although most of the proposed functions have a good theoretical basis and have proved to perform adequately as ecological indicators, their suitability as ecological orientors has yet to receive a full confirmation in real case studies. The aim of the present contribution is to examine how several entropy-based indicators (exergy, structural information, entropy production, specific entropy production and the Eco-exergy index) perform as orientors when applied to a special case of ecological succession, i.e. eutrophication, in a homogeneous set of shallow lakes lying along a trophic gradient, from oligotrophy to hyper-eutrophy. The results show that a coherent pattern of response emerge, which is also consistent with the classical ecological theory. In particular, the maximisation of storage and the minimisation of specific entropy production are confirmed as the most reliable principles of ecosystem development, whereas the maximisation of dissipation (as entropy production) appears as a debatable criterion of development.

J	Boch, R; Spötl, C; Kramers, J				Boch, Ronny; Spoetl, Christoph; Kramers, Jan			High-resolution isotope records of early Holocene rapid climate change from two coeval stalagmites of Katerloch Cave, Austria	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Two coeval stalagmites from Katerloch Cave show pronounced intervals of low delta O-18 values around 8.2, 9.1, and 10.0 kyr (all ages are reported before the year 2000 AD) and represent an inorganic U-Th dated climate archive from the southeast of the European Alps, a region where only very few well-dated climate records exist. The 0 isotope curves, providing near-annual resolution, allow a direct comparison to the Greenland ice core records, as temperature was the primary factor controlling the 0 isotopic composition of Katerloch speleothems. The 8.2 kyr climate anomaly lasted about one century, from 8196 to 8100 yr, with a maximum amplitude of 1.1 parts per thousand at 8175 yr. The event is characterized by a rapid onset and a more gradual demise and U-Th data as well as annual lamina counting support a rapid climate change towards cooler conditions within 10-20 yr. There is no strong evidence that the 8.2 kyr anomaly was superimposed on a pronounced longer-term cooling episode, nor do the new data support two separate cooling events within the 8.2 kyr event as reported by other studies. Our record also shows a distinct climate anomaly around 9.1 kyr, which lasted 70-110 yr and showed a maximum amplitude of 1.0 parts per thousand, i.e. it had a similar duration and amplitude as the (central) 8.2 kyr event. Compared to the 8.2 kyr event, the 9.1 kyr anomaly shows a more symmetrical structure, but onset and demise still occurred within a few decades only. The different progression of the 8.2 (asymmetrical) and 9.1 kyr anomaly (symmetrical) suggests a fundamental difference in the trigger and/or the response of the climate system. Moreover, both stalagmites show evidence of a climate anomaly around 10.0 kyr, which was of comparable magnitude to the two subsequent events. Using a well constrained modern calibration between air temperature and delta O-18 of precipitation for the study area and cave monitoring data (confirming speleothem deposition in Katerloch reflecting cave air temperature), a maximum cooling by ca 3 degrees C can be inferred at 8.2 and 9.1 kyr, which is similar to other estimates, e.g., from Lake Ammersee north of the Alps. The O isotopic composition of meteoric precipitation, however, is a complex tracer of the hydrological cycle and these temperature estimates do not take into account additional effects such as changes in the source area or synoptic shifts. Apart from that, the relative thickness of the seasonally controlled lamina types in the Katerloch stalagmites remains rather constant across the intervals comprising the isotopic anomalies, i.e. the stalagmite petrography argues against major shifts in seasonality during the early Holocene climate excursions.

Drivers of zooplankton beta diversity in natural shallow lakes and artificial reservoirs in the Neotropics	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Anthropogenic stressors on aquatic environments change the relative importance of environmental conditions on spatial species distributions in a regional pool. One way to assess the spatial species distribution is measure the beta diversity. This study analyzed the difference in zooplankton beta diversity between natural lakes and artificial reservoirs, to understand whether reservoirs affect beta diversity, and the relative importance of deterministic processes for the spatial distribution of species. We measured beta diversity using Raup-Crick dissimilarity and analyzed the relative impact of environmental filters on beta diversity in 30 reservoirs and 29 shallow lakes located in Brazil, during two seasons (dry and rainy period). Rotifer beta diversity did not differ between lakes and reservoirs, while copepod beta diversity was higher in reservoirs. Environmental filters were important during the dry period for both lakes and reservoirs, indicating that deterministic processes could drive beta diversity during that season. Environmental productivity, estimated by chlorophyll-a, was associated with zooplankton beta diversity in lakes and reservoirs. The spatial turnover of zooplankton communities depended on the biological characteristics of zooplankton groups, and their responses to environmental filters.

Unfortunately, natural factors and human activities, have resulted in declining water quality and eutrophication. These changes directly affect lake ecological environments and the ability for people to live off of the affected water. Satellite remote sensing data is important because it can quickly provide comprehensive, real-time, dynamic water quality information; it must supplement conventional water quality monitoring techniques. In this study, water from the Poyang Lake entryway and surface was collected from April to December in 2009 and analyzed via MODIS remote sensing data. The data and a comprehensive scoring method was used to establish surface water transparency, total phosphorus inversion model, and nutritional status. The results showed that eutrophication averaged at 59.8.; however, the nutritional status varies greatly in the wet season, normal season, and dry season. The nutritional status is highest in dry season, followed by normal season, and lowest in wet season. Moreover, the eutrophication degree increases gradually year by year.																			0255-660X	0974-3006				OCT	2016	44	5					837	842		10.1007/s12524-015-0519-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-015-0519-4													WOS:000382664900017
J	Luomba, J; Chuenpagdee, R; Song, AM				Luomba, Joseph; Chuenpagdee, Ratana; Song, Andrew M.			A Bottom-Up Understanding of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing in Lake Victoria	SUSTAINABILITY												Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is a major concern in fisheries management around the world. Several measures have been taken to address the problem. In Lake Victoria, the alleviation of IUU fishing is implemented through the Regional Plan of Action (RPOA-IUU), which restricts use of certain fishing gear, as well as prohibits fishing in closed areas and during closed seasons. Despite the long-term efforts to monitor and control what goes on in the fisheries, IUU fishing has persisted in Lake Victoria. Inspired by interactive governance theory, this paper argues that the persistence of IUU fishing could be due to different images that stakeholders have about the situation, rather than the lack of management competency. Through structured interviews with 150 fisheries stakeholders on Ijinga Island in the southeastern part of Lake Victoria, Tanzania, using paired comparison questionnaires, the study elicits stakeholders' perspective about the severity of different locally-pertinent fishing-related activities. The results show that while fisheries stakeholder groups agree on their judgments about certain fishing gears, some differences are also apparent. For instance, fisheries managers and scientists do not always agree with fishing people about what activities cause the most damage to fisheries resources and ecosystem. Further, they tend to consider some IUU fishing-related activities less damaging than some non-IUU fishing. Such disparity creates governability challenges, pointing to the need to revisit relevant regulatory measures and to make them consistent with the knowledge and judgments of all stakeholders. Based on these findings, we discuss governing interventions that may contribute to addressing IUU fishing in Lake Victoria and elsewhere.

However, determining the parameter of the initial flush in different areas may pose challenges in storm runoff management strategies. To address this issue, Erhai Lake in China, Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, was selected as an example for the study. Erhai Lake is a typical mesotrophic lake with the profound influence of NPSP. The NPSP control strategy in this area will provide a valuable reference for other lakes. In 2021, 289 storm events and 190 ditchwater samples were detected around Erhai Lake. The average flow in the ditches ranged from 0.004 to 0.147 m3/s, the instant total nitrogen (TN) concentration ranged from 0.28 to 91.43 mg/L, and the instant total phosphorus (TP) concentration ranged from 0.26 to 7.35 mg/L in the storm events. It was found that the concentration of pollutants was lower than expected in the initial flush period. Instead, the event mean concentrations of TN and TP were 9.3 and 2.1 times higher than in the wet seasons, showing high nutrient concentration levels throughout the entire rainfall period. To manage storm runoff effectively, a flow-processes-division method was proposed to analyze the inflow condition and pollutant removal rate in different runoff periods. The peak flow interception strategy was recommended as the optimal stormwater management plan, as it showed the highest inflow conditions and 50% pollutant removal rate. Considering the need to reduce the constant flush of stormwater runoff, it is essential to establish a healthy water cycle system to alleviate NPSP and raise the Erhai water level. The storm runoff management method can serve as a practical tool for lake areas that do not exhibit initial flush characteristics.

J	Sinang, SC; Reichwaldt, ES; Ghadouani, A				Sinang, Som Cit; Reichwaldt, Elke S.; Ghadouani, Anas			Spatial and temporal variability in the relationship between cyanobacterial biomass and microcystins	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The increasing incidence of toxic cyanobacterial blooms, together with the difficulties to reliably predict cyanobacterial toxin (e.g. microcystins) concentration, has created the need to assess the predictive ability and variability of the cyanobacterial biomass-microcystin relationship, which is currently used to assess the risk to human and ecosystems health. To achieve this aim, we assessed the relationship between cyanobacterial biomass and microcystin concentration on a spatiotemporal scale by quantifying the concentration of cyanobacterial biomass and microcystin in eight lakes over 9 months. On both a temporal and spatial scale, the variability of microcystin concentration exceeded that of cyanobacterial biomass by up to four times. The relationship between cyanobacterial biomass and microcystin was weak and site specific. The variability of cyanobacterial biomass only explained 25 % of the variability in total microcystin concentration and 7 % of the variability of cellular microcystin concentration. Although a significant correlation does not always imply real cause, the results of multiple linear regression analysis suggest that the variability of cyanobacterial biomass and cellular microcystin concentration is influenced by salinity and total phosphorus, respectively. The weak cyanobacterial biomass-microcystin relationship, coupled with the fact that microcystin was present in concentrations exceeding the WHO drinking water guidelines (1 mu g L-1) in most of the collected samples, emphasizes the high risk of error connected to the traditional indirect microcystin risk assessment method.

It showed a tendency of metal accumulation in the following order: Zn > Ni > Cu > Co > Cr > Pb > Cd. A two-way ANOVA indicated the metal accumulation was insig-nificant with respect to season (n = 421, p = 0.59) and sector (n = 32, p = 0.61). The estimated daily intake (EDI), targeted hazard quotient (THQ) and hazard index (HI), and carcinogenic risks (CR) revealed no potential human health risks and were safe for consumption. The pollution load index (PLI) of <1, Geo-accumulation index (Igeo,) and contamination factor (CF) indicated that the study area was unpolluted. This pioneering study highlighted that P. monodon was nurtured well in the healthy habitat of Chilika lagoon and the fair level of metal content made it an excellent source of dietary components.					; Muduli, Dr.Pradipta/A-7645-2016	Das, Mira/0000-0002-8476-2146; 													0025-326X	1879-3363				MAR	2023	188								114632	10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.114632	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.114632		JAN 2023						36706548					WOS:000926785200001
J	Lahiri, C; Davidson, GR				Lahiri, Chayan; Davidson, Gregg R.			Heterogeneous oxygenation of wetland soils with increasing inundation: Redox potential, water depth, and preferential flow paths	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Saturated wetland soils are typically depleted in oxygen due to rapid consumption by biological processes. Fine-grained sediments limit the vertical flux of oxygenated surface water. In forested wetlands potential exists for advective transport along preferential flow pathways created by decomposing roots or tree remains, resulting in isolated zones of oxygenated pore water. This potential is enhanced in wetlands that are perched above the regional water table, where increases in surface-water depth create significant downward hydraulic gradients. Along the Mississippi River floodplain, many wetlands are now perched as a result of groundwater mining. This study was conducted at Sky Lake, MS, through a growing season, with high temporal-resolution monitoring of redox potential as a proxy for the delivery of oxygenated surface water at 30 and 60 cm depths at six locations. Results showed reducing conditions at all locations under moderate inundation, but redox potential rose significantly at a subset of locations when surface-water exceeded one meter in depth. Rising redox potential is argued to represent localised advective transport of oxygen in excess of the rate of biological consumption. Wetland plants growing in perennially saturated soils may benefit from periodic increases in water depth and subsequent increase in the flux of oxygen along preferential flow paths.

J	Timsic, S; Patterson, WP				Timsic, Sandra; Patterson, William P.			Spatial variability in stable isotope values of surface waters of Eastern Canada and New England	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												A total of 294 surface water samples were collected in Eastern Canada and the New England states of the USA in 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013 and analyzed for delta O-18 and delta D values to investigate climatic controls on hydrology and to test whether isotope values of surface waters can provide a suitable calibration for evaluation of paleoenvironmental proxy data in this region. Results demonstrate that surface waters in this region exhibit latitudinal gradients, with some overprinting by regional trends. Surface water delta O-18 and delta D values range from -2.8%, to -16.0%,, and from -23.8%o to -118.5%o, respectively. Regression of all 6180 and delta D values yields a surface water line (SWL) (delta D = 7.53(+/- 0.11)delta O-18 + 3.81(+/- 1.12); r(2) = 0.95; n = 294), similar to slopes of 7.63(+/- 0.06) and 7.96(+/- 0.1) based on monthly and annual precipitation amount-weighted means for GNIP/CNIP stations in this study area. At smaller spatial scales evaporation and greater water residence time generate lake SWL with lower slope (7.50) than river SWL (7.80). At greater spatial scales, delta O-18 and delta D values of lakes and rivers show a more uniform distribution, thus reflecting the prevalence of regional over local hydrological effects. Contour maps of surface water delta O-18 and delta D values exhibit more detail than existing global precipitation models and suggest (a) a progressive decrease in delta(OH2O)-O-18 and MHz values towards higher latitudes via Rayleigh distillation and (b) generally higher delta(OH2O)-O-18 and 6DH(2)O values in Western Newfoundland likely due to its proximity to the ocean. Contour maps predict the average annual-amount weighted delta O-18 and delta D values of precipitation provided by GNIP/CNIP networks fairly well. It was also determined that recycled moisture supplies a significant proportion of precipitation in the southern/western parts of our study area, while evaporation could be a more dominant factor for interior Labrador. In addition, a strong agreement is observed between temperature and precipitation/surface water delta O-18 and delta D values, suggesting that delta O-18 and delta D values of surface waters can provide a suitable template and aid for ongoing paleoenvironmental research in this region.

Soil-Air exchange controls on background atmospheric concentrations of organochlorine pesticides	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Soils are the major terrestrial reservoir of persistent organic pollutants, and thus net volatilization from soil, when it happens, may exert a control on the atmospheric occurrence and variability of organic pollutants. Here, we report and discuss the concentrations of legacy organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) such as hexachlorobenzene (HCB), hexaclorocyclohexanes (HCH) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) in the atmosphere and in soils, their measured fugacities in soil, the soil-air partition coefficients (K-SA) and soil-air fugacity ratios (f(s)/f(a)) in rural background areas of N-NE Spain and N-NW England. Four sampling campaigns were carried out in Spain and UK to assess seasonal variability and differences between sampling sites. K-SA values were significantly dependent on soil temperature and soil organic matter quantity, and to a minor extent on organic matter type. HCH isomers and DDT metabolites in soil are close to equilibrium with the overlying atmosphere at rural background areas of Spain with a tendency to volatilize and deposit during warm and cold periods, respectively. The mixture of HCH and DDT found in the atmosphere is clearly strongly influenced by the mixture of HCH and DDT which escapes from soil, with significant correlations between them (r(2) ranging between 0.63-0.76 and p-level <0.001 for the Ebro sampling sites), thus suggesting a close coupling of air and soil concentrations, demonstrating that net volatilization from soil control the atmospheric levels of OCPs in the Northern Spain background atmosphere. Conversely, soils at rural UK sites were usually a sink for atmospheric DDT and HCH, but not for HCB. The negative statistically significant relationship found between log KSA and the log (f(s)/f(a)) ratio, suggests that high latitude regions, due to the high soil organic matter content and lower temperatures, will act as larger traps and accumulate more atmospheric OCPs. Thus, the extent to which soils are secondary sources to the atmosphere is currently dependent on the reservoir potential of soils for OCPs and shows a marked seasonality in their strength.					; Cabrerizo, Ana/D-8256-2018; Dachs, Jordi/LOU-0520-2024; Jones, Kevin/F-4296-2014; Cabrerizo, Ana/AAA-9050-2020	Dachs, Jordi/0000-0002-4237-169X; Cabrerizo, Ana/0000-0002-5933-1483; Jones, Kevin Christopher/0000-0001-7108-9776; 													1680-7316	1680-7324					2011	11	24					12799	12811		10.5194/acp-11-12799-2011	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-11-12799-2011													WOS:000298667600017

Analysis of rainfall onset, cessation and length of growing season for western Kenya	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Onset, cessation and length of growing season statistics are generated for both long and short rainy seasons in western Kenya. Onset identification is based on a daily analysis of the soil water balance over the initial growth stage (30 days) by identifying and quantifying the risk of failure of crop development. Cessation is based on a daily analysis of the soil water balance by identifying and quantifying the water stress in the root zone for maize. The length of growing season for a particular year is obtained from the difference between cessation and onset of that year. Historical daily climatic data of a 15-34-year period and soil data from 26 stations, spatially distributed in the study area, were considered. Results indicate that there exist organized progression of rainfall onset within the western Kenya region with the long rains showing a southerly progression while the short rains show a south-westerly progression. Cessation of rainfall for both seasons show strong localized influences, mainly surrounding Lake Victoria and forested areas, including orographic features. For stations with long length of growing season, the length varies more than the onset date. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Our study seeks to establish the distribution and host-plant relationship of ACT across citrus production areas in Kenya. We also modelled the risk of spread using the maximum entropy modelling algorithm with known occurrence data. Our results infer that ACT is widely distributed and causes severe damage to four alternative host plants belonging to the family Rutaceae. The adults, immature stages (eggs and nymphs), galls and the percentage of infested leaves were significantly higher in shaded than unshaded trees. However, adult ACTs preferred Kenyan highlands to Victoria Lake and coastal regions. The average area under the curve of the model predictions was 0.97, indicating an optimal model performance. The environmental variables that most influenced the prediction were the precipitation of wettest quarter, precipitation of wettest month, mean diurnal range, temperature seasonality and mean temperature of the coldest quarter. The current prediction of ACT exceeded its existing range, especially in the Western, Nyanza, Central, Rift valley and Eastern regions of Kenya. The model predicted a contraction of suitable habitats for a potential spread in 2040 with an inland shift to higher altitudes in the cooler regions. The potential for further expansion to climatically suitable areas was more pronounced for the 2080 forecast. These findings provide relevant information to improve monitoring/surveillance and designing IPM strategies to limit its spread and damage.

EPIDEMIOLOGY OF EMYDOIDEA HERPESVIRUS 1 IN FREE-RANGING BLANDING'S TURTLES (EMYDOIDEA BLANDINGII) FROM ILLINOIS	JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE												Herpesvirus infections have been associated with high morbidity and mortality in populations of captive emydid chelonians worldwide, but novel herpesviruses have also recently been identified in apparently healthy free-ranging emydid populations. Blanding's turtle (Emydoidea blandingii), an endangered species in Illinois, has experienced range-wide declines because of habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation. A novel herpesvirus, Emydoidea herpesvirus 1 (EBHV1), was identified in Blanding's turtles in DuPage County, IL, in 2015. Combined oral-cloacal swabs were collected from radio transmitter-fitted and trapped (n = 54) turtles multiple times over the 2016 activity season. In addition, swabs were collected at a single time point from trapped and incidentally captured (n = 84) Blanding's turtles in DuPage (n = 33) and Lake (n = 51) counties over the same field season. Each sample was tested for EBHV1 using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). EBHV1 was detected in 15 adult females for an overall prevalence of 10.8% (n = 15/138; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.2-17.3%). In radio transmitter-fitted females, there was a significantly higher prevalence of EBHV1 DNA in May (23.8%, n = 10/42) than June (3.6%, n = 1/28), July (0%, n = 0/42), August (0%, n = 0/47), or September (7.7%, n = 3/39) (odds ratio: 12.19; 95% CI: 3.60-41.30). The peak in May corresponds to the onset of nesting and may be associated with increased physiologic demands. Furthermore, all positive turtles were qPCR negative in subsequent months. There were no clinical signs associated with EBHV1 detection. This investigation is the critical first step to characterizing the implications of EBHV1 for Blanding's turtle population health and identifying management changes that may improve sustainability.

Accounting for phenology in the analysis of animal movement	BIOMETRICS												The analysis of animal tracking data provides important scientific understanding and discovery in ecology. Observations of animal trajectories using telemetry devices provide researchers with information about the way animals interact with their environment and each other. For many species, specific geographical features in the landscape can have a strong effect on behavior. Such features may correspond to a single point (eg, dens or kill sites), or to higher dimensional subspaces (eg, rivers or lakes). Features may be relatively static in time (eg, coastlines or home-range centers), or may be dynamic (eg, sea ice extent or areas of high-quality forage for herbivores). We introduce a novel model for animal movement that incorporates active selection for dynamic features in a landscape. Our approach is motivated by the study of polar bear (Ursus maritimus) movement. During the sea ice melt season, polar bears spend much of their time on sea ice above shallow, biologically productive water where they hunt seals. The changing distribution and characteristics of sea ice throughout the year mean that the location of valuable habitat is constantly shifting. We develop a model for the movement of polar bears that accounts for the effect of this important landscape feature. We introduce a two-stage procedure for approximate Bayesian inference that allows us to analyze over 300 000 observed locations of 186 polar bears from 2012 to 2016. We use our model to estimate a spatial boundary of interest to wildlife managers that separates two subpopulations of polar bears from the Beaufort and Chukchi seas.					; Scharf, Henry/AAC-4453-2019	Scharf, Henry/0000-0002-9266-4191; 													0006-341X	1541-0420				SEP	2019	75	3					810	820		10.1111/biom.13052	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/biom.13052								30859552					WOS:000488608100009

We collected palynological samples from the same level as megafossil plants, and conducted a detailed taxonomic analysis of the pollen and spores in order to augment the megafossil record, to extend documentation of the Middle Jurassic palynoflora, and to examine implications for palaeogeography, palaeoecology and palaeoclimate in north China during the Jurassic. Forty-four genera and 87 species of palynomorphs were identified. Pollen of gymnosperms dominates numerically, followed by spores of pteridophytes. Most taxa, including bisaccate pollen of conifers, monosulcate pollen of Cycadales, Bennettitales or Ginkgoales, along with Cyathidites, Deltoidospora, Granulatisporites, Osmundacidites and Classopollis, are common elements known elsewhere during the Jurassic. Based on comparisons with similar palyno-assemblages in the Jurassic of China, the age of the Daohugou locality is interpreted to be late Middle Jurassic. According to the palaeobotanical and palaeopalynological information, the Daohugou flora is attributed to the warm-temperate to medium temperate zone with seasonal change. By studying the ecological and climatic preferences of the main plant groups, five types of palaeolandscape in the Jurassic of Daohugou are proposed: (1) mesic upland (Pinaceae, Podocarpaceae, Czekanowskiales and Bennettitales), (2) mesic lowland (Pinaceae, Podocarpaceae, Ginkgoales, Czekanowskiales and Cycadales, together with some hygrophilous bryophytes, lycophytes and ferns), (3) dry upland (Czekanowskiales), (4) dry lowland (Czekanowskiales and Cheirolepidiaceae) and (5) waterside (plants growing along streams or near lakes, including bryophytes, lycophytes, ferns and probably some pteridosperms). According to the plant assemblage, the Daohugou flora corresponds to that of the Middle Jurassic Northern Floristic Province of China, which experienced a transition from a humid, warm climate to a hotter climate with seasonal drought.																			0191-6122	1558-9188				MAY 4	2015	39	2					270	287		10.1080/01916122.2014.961664	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01916122.2014.961664													WOS:000354779900008

The high -Andean Lake Sibinacocha has been regulated since 1988 to increase energy production of the Machupicchu hydropower plant. In this study, river streamflow changes are evaluated by analyzing precipitation and discharge trends using indicators of hydrologic alteration and ecoflow for natural (1965-1987) and altered (1988-2016) flow regimes.New hydrological insights for the region: For the altered flow regime, an ecodeficit of about 20% (compared to natural river flow) and an ecosurplus > 30% were found during the wet season (December-February) and dry season (June-August), respectively. These changes have reduced the risk of water shortage (dry season) and flood (wet season) and contribute to increasing water use including hydropower production, irrigation and drinking water. However, river alteration might lead to considerable impacts on riverine ecosystems.Despite major limitations related to data scarcity and complex environmental processes in the basin, our results highlight the usefulness of combined methods of hydrological alteration and ecoflow to effectively evaluate water regime changes in regulated basins. An integrated scientific approach is necessary to address uncertainties and develop meaningful future water availability scenarios that guide hydropower projects with improved water and energy security considering minimal impacts on human and natural systems.

High-resolution reconstruction of 8.2-ka BP event documented in Pere Noel cave, southern Belgium	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												A distinct shift in O-18, C-13 and trace element contents of the Pere Noel (PN) stalagmite from southern Belgium revealed an abrupt climatic anomaly at 8.13 +/- 0.03 ka BP (before present=before 1950AD). This anomaly is characterized by a maximum drop in the O-18 (-1.4 parts per thousand compared the mean) between 8.13 and 8.10 ka BP (+/- 0.03). This drop of O-18 coincides with a decrease in C-13 and trace element (Sr, Ba and Mg) concentrations suggesting drier conditions. Our precise chronology provides the timing of the outburst of proglacial lakes Agassiz and Ojibway that caused the O-18, C-13 and trace elemental anomalies at 8.13-8.10 +/- 0.03 ka BP, which corresponds to the 8.2-ka BP event. The PN stalagmite bears O-18 values in fluid inclusions that covary with the O-18 values in calcite, suggesting that the speleothem calcite O-18 primarily reflects variations in the rainfall O-18. Comparison of the PN record with different marine and terrestrial archives during the 8.2-ka BP event shows a good agreement in timing and duration, suggesting that the PN speleothem can be regarded as a valuable proxy to better understand the 8.2-ka BP event.					; CHENG, HAI/H-3413-2017; Cheng, Hai/H-3413-2017; Edwards, R./I-3124-2014	Verheyden, Sophie/0000-0002-1755-0389; van der Lubbe, Jeroen/0000-0001-7545-6502; fagel, nathalie/0000-0002-8231-8295; Cheng, Hai/0000-0002-5305-9458; Vonhof, Hubert/0000-0002-0897-8244; 													0267-8179	1099-1417				OCT	2018	33	7					840	852		10.1002/jqs.3064	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jqs.3064													WOS:000446667100008

Val			The Green Bay saga: Environmental change, scientific investigation, and watershed management	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The Green Bay watershed, draining a total area of approximately 40,468 km(2), comprises about a third of the Lake Michigan drainage. In the early years, fur trade was the dominant economic activity within the watershed. Later, when timber harvesting, papermaking, and agriculture came on the scene in the 19th and early 20th centuries, major environmental changes occurred in a relatively short period of time. Nutrient and sediment loadings, accompanied by organic wastes from sawmills and paper mills, resulted in a pollutant overload in the Fox River and in the eutrophication of the waters of lower Green Bay. Citizen complaints about these severely degraded conditions initiated a period of scientific investigation. Starting slowly with a few studies and surveys in the first half of the 20th century, serious investigatory work began at mid-century with support from the University of Wisconsin Sea Grant Institute. Examples of topics that have been investigated since then with support from numerous sources are: biological oxygen demand (BOD), phosphorus and total suspended solids loads, trophic status and food chain efficiencies, coastal wetland characterization, dynamics of the benthic layer, algae and abiotic solids, phosphorus cycling and mass balance, PCBs, seasonal hypoxia, and climate change impacts. These studies have provided the scientific foundation for government-led programs such as the Green Bay Remedial Action Program, the PCB clean-up program, and the TMDL program. Progress has been made-reduction in BOD is an example-but a fuller rehabilitation of this large-scale ecosystem remains an elusive goal. The saga goes on.

Evaluating RADARSAT-2 for the Monitoring of Lake Ice Phenology Events in Mid-Latitudes	REMOTE SENSING												Lake ice is an important component in understanding the local climate as changes in temperature have an impact on the timing of key ice phenology events. In recent years, there has been a decline in the in-situ monitoring of lake ice events in Canada and microwave remote sensing imagery from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is more widely used due to the high spatial resolution and response of backscatter to the freezing and melting of the ice surface. RADARSAT-2 imagery was used to develop a threshold-based method for determining lake ice events for mid-latitude lakes in Central Ontario from 2008 to 2017. Estimated lake ice phenology events are validated with ground-based observations and are compared against the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS band 2). The threshold-based method was found to accurately identify 12 out of 17 freeze events and 13 out of 17 melt events from 2015-2017 when compared to ground-based observations. Mean absolute errors for freeze events ranged from 2.5 to 10.0 days when compared to MODIS imagery while the mean absolute error for water clear of ice (WCI) ranged from 1.5 to 7.1 days. The method is important for the study of mid-latitude lake ice due to its unique success in detecting multiple freeze and melting events throughout the ice season.					; Brown, Laura/F-5932-2011	Murfitt, Justin/0000-0002-7388-0964; Howell, Stephen/0000-0002-4848-9867; Brown, Laura/0000-0002-3173-8433													2072-4292					OCT	2018	10	10							1641	10.3390/rs10101641	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs10101641													WOS:000448555800141

Spatial abundance and distribution of picocyanobacterial communities in two contrasting lakes revealed using environmental DNA metabarcoding	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Freshwater picocyanobacteria (Pcy) are important yet understudied components of lake ecosystems. Most previous studies have relied on cell abundances to assess Pcy dynamics in largely oligotrophic lakes, while little is known about spatial diversity and dynamics across different lake types. In the present study we assessed the horizontal-spatial abundance and community structure of Pcy in two contrasting (oligotrophic and hypertrophic) New Zealand lakes using epifluorescence microscopy and 16S rRNA metabarcoding. Pcy abundance and community composition differed significantly both between and within the oligotrophic and hypertrophic lakes. While spatial variability was observed in both study lakes, these differences were particularly pronounced in the oligotrophic, morphometrically complex Lake Wanaka where cell abundances were typically higher in bays than open-water sites and community structure differed significantly between sites. Community structuring appeared to be driven by localised environmental conditions, with different factors influencing each lake. These results suggest that single spot-samples are insufficient to gain an understanding of Pcy dynamics and consequently, phytoplankton dynamics in lakes.

Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in saline lakes plays an important role in the global carbon cycle and isa key regulator of saline lake ecosystem functions through biotic and abiotic processes. However, the origin, composition, and cycling of DOM in saline lakes, especially hypersaline lakes, remain largely unknown. In this study, two lake brine DOM samples and three input river DOM samples from a hypersaline lake, Da Qaidam Lake (DQL) in the Qaidam Basin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), were isolated and analyzed using a multi-analytical approach. The results indicated that, although terrestrial in origin, the DOM composition and features of DQL were dominated by indigenous in-lake processes owing to the very long water residence time of the lake brine. Lake DOM contained more aliphatic compounds but fewer aromatic compounds than DOM from the rivers. Lake DOM also exhibited more chemodiversity and contained highly saturated and oxidized components that were incorporated with heteroatoms. Despite the limited contributions from riverine DOM, some special features of lake DOM, such as the high content of sulfur-bearing components, may be partly related to the long-term accumulation of hotspring riverine input. Flocculation, photodegradation, microbial degradation, evapo-concentration, and primary production processes were considered synergistic factors in the persistence and fea-tures of the hypersaline lake DOM. The results of this study can further our knowledge of the transformation and long-term turnover of DOM in hypersaline lakes and how DOM chemodiversity changes across wide aquatic ecosystems.

Flow regime and nutrient input control invasive alien aquatic plant distribution and species composition in small closed estuaries	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Nutrient pollution is facilitating the encroachment of invasive aquatic plants in various water bodies globally. This study investigated seasonal aquatic macrophyte responses in two temporarily closed estuaries with different nutrient inputs. Consistent effluent discharge from the upstream wastewater treatment works (WWTW) facilitated the establishment of numerous freshwater invasive alien aquatic plants (IAAPs) in the uThongathi Estuary. IAAPs (Myriophyllum aquaticum, Pistia stratiotes and Pontederia crassipes) were only displaced from the estuary after high flow events (>5 m(3) s(-1)). In the less polluted uMdlotane Estuary nutrient pulses (>1 mg/L DIN) associated with high rainfall changed the aquatic macrophyte composition. The nutrient tolerant non-rooted Ceratophyllum demersum outcompeted the rooted submerged macrophyte Stuckenia pectinata. Species composition changed in response to flow and nutrient inputs, with the exception of emergent macrophytes, such as the grass Echinochloa pyramidalis, that remained consistent in cover and distribution in the uMdlotane Estuary. This study demonstrated that aquatic macrophytes are more responsive to nutrient inputs in unimpacted estuaries compared to consistently nutrient-rich systems where flow is an important driver of IAAPs community dynamics. Many temporarily closed estuaries are subjected to nutrient pollution from WWTWs and restoration efforts such as diversion of discharges to constructed wetlands needs urgent implementation.					; Adams, Janine/AAA-9865-2021; Lemley, Daniel/J-1328-2019	Nunes, Monique/0000-0002-6538-1815; Lemley, Daniel Alan/0000-0003-0325-8499; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				MAY 1	2022	819								152038	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.152038	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.152038		MAR 2022						34861302					WOS:000820289800011

We sampled 38 sites along the Solimoes/Amazon and Negro rivers and their tributaries during distinct phases of the annual flood-pulse. MeHg dynamics in both basins was contrasted to provide insight into the factors controlling export of MeHg to the Amazon system. The export of MeHg by rivers was substantially higher during high-water in both basins since elevated MeHg concentrations and discharge occurred during this time. MeHg concentration was positively correlated to % flooded area upstream of the sampling site in the Solimoes/Amazon Basin with the best correlation obtained using 100 km buffers instead of whole basin areas. The lower correlations obtained with the whole basin apparently reflected variable losses of MeHg exported from upstream wetlands due to demethylation, absorption, deposition, and degradation before reaching the sampling site. A similar correlation between %flooded area and MeHg concentrations was not observed in the Negro Basin probably due to the variable export of MeHg from poorly drained soils that are abundant in this basin but not consistently flooded.					; forsberg, bruce/AAE-4092-2020; Amaral, João Henrique/AAC-4315-2022; Malm, Olaf/H-1724-2012; Py-Daniel, Sarah/C-9625-2015; Kasper, Daniele/K-7141-2013; Bastos, Wanderley/AAQ-5875-2020	Amaral, Joao Henrique/0000-0002-8992-6082; Malm, Olaf/0000-0002-4116-7160; Rodrigues Bastos, Wanderley/0000-0002-2105-9947; Kasper, Daniele/0000-0002-6475-1327; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				DEC 19	2017	51	24					14182	14191		10.1021/acs.est.7b04374	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.7b04374								29172464					WOS:000418625900020

Changes in Movements of Chinook Salmon between Lakes Huron and Michigan after Alewife Population Collapse	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Alewives Alosa pseudoharengus are the preferred food of Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Alewife populations collapsed in Lake Huron in 2003 but remained comparatively abundant in Lake Michigan. We analyzed capture locations of coded-wire-tagged Chinook Salmon before, during, and after Alewife collapse (1993-2014). We contrasted the pattern of tag recoveries for Chinook Salmon released at the Swan River in northern Lake Huron and Medusa Creek in northern Lake Michigan. We examined patterns during April-July, when Chinook Salmon were primarily occupied by feeding, and August-October, when the salmon were primarily occupied by spawning. We found evidence that Swan River fish shifted their feeding location from Lake Huron to Lake Michigan after the collapse. Over years, proportions of Swan River Chinook Salmon captured in Lake Michigan increased in correspondence with the Alewife decline in Lake Huron. Mean proportions of Swan River fish captured in Lake Michigan were 0.13 (SD = 0.14) before collapse (1993-1997) and 0.82 (SD = 0.22) after collapse (2008-2014) and were significantly different. In contrast, proportions of Medusa Creek fish captured in Lake Michigan did not change; means were 0.98 (SD = 0.05) before collapse and 0.99 (SD = 0.01) after collapse. The mean distance to the center of the coastal distribution of Swan River fish during April-July shifted 357 km (SD = 169) from central Lake Huron before collapse to central Lake Michigan after collapse. The coastal distributions during August-October were centered on the respective sites of origin, suggesting that Chinook Salmon returned to release sites to spawn regardless of their feeding locations. Regarding the impact on Alewife populations, this shift in interlake movement would be equivalent to increasing the Chinook Salmon stocking rate within Lake Michigan by 30%. The primary management implication is that interlake coordination of Chinook Salmon stocking policies would be expected to benefit the recreational fishery.

Shoreline change near inlet includes change in position and shape of inlet, inlet channel length, and spit growth/erosion. These variable features of lagoon inlet(s) critically depend on alongshore sediment transport (LST) and discharge (water and sediment) from the lagoon to the sea. The LST and the processes responsible for sand spit growth/erosion, considered as important attributes of inlet stability, are the subject matter of the present investigation and hence the study assumes importance. The study includes integration of observational and modeling framework. Observations include nearshore wave, bathymetry, beach profile, shoreline and sediment grain size of spits while numerical modeling includes simulation of the wave using MIKE 21 Spectral Wave model and LST simulation using LITtoral DRIFT. The results indicate that the predominant wave directions as S and SSE, which induces round the year south to north alongshore transport with significant seasonal variation in magnitude. The estimated LST closely matches with previous studies near Chilika inlet and for other locations along the Odisha coast. Besides temporal variability, the study reveals spatial variability in alongshore transport near Chilika inlet and considers it as one of the important attributes along with northward spit growth for inlet migration/closure/opening.					; MOHANTY, PRATAP/E-8254-2014; Pradhan, Subhasis/O-8441-2018	Gorozabel, Robinson/0000-0001-5822-5411; Pradhan, Subhasis/0000-0002-1435-5553; Mohanty, Pratap Kumar/0000-0002-1188-2008; 													0149-0419	1521-060X					2017	40	2-3			SI		187	203		10.1080/01490419.2017.1299059	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490419.2017.1299059													WOS:000404253100009

Effect of large weirs on abundance and diversity of migratory Labeobarbus species in tributaries of Lake Tana, Ethiopia	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												Lake Tana has a remarkable fish diversity, including 17 endemic Labeobarbus species, of which nine spawn in the inflowing rivers. Three of the migratory species are threatened, namely the endangered Labeobarbus macrophtalmus and the vulnerable L. acutirostris and L. platydorsus. In July-November 2016 during the wet season netting upstream and downstream of large weirs in two rivers and in two undammed rivers showed that weirs had a severe negative effect on migratory Labeobarbus, including the three threatened species. Of eight Labeobarbus species caught below the Gelda River weir, only L. intermedius was recorded above the weir, and in the Shini River, five Labeobarbus species were caught below the weir, but none above it. Labeobarbus diversity below the Gelda River weir (H' = 1.4) was significantly different to that above the weir (H' = 0), whereas in the two rivers without any weirs, Labeobarbus diversity downstream (H' = 1.39 and 1.55) was not significantly different from that upstream ( H' = 1.52 and 1.40). Therefore, specific mitigation measures, such as fishways, need to be designed from the outset of proposed weir and instream dam construction.					; Getahun, Abebe/NTR-3079-2025; Kidane, Shewit/ABC-6155-2020; Adugna, Berihun Tefera/A-8755-2017; Gedif, Birhanu/MBG-8505-2025; Mhiret, Demesew/KUC-9862-2024; Adugna, Berihun/A-8755-2017	Alemaw Mhiret, Demesew/0000-0002-6318-3612; Adugna, Berihun/0000-0002-9632-2658													1608-5914	1727-9364					2017	42	4					367	373		10.2989/16085914.2017.1411774	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16085914.2017.1411774													WOS:000419304300007

A Global eDNA Comparison of Freshwater Bacterioplankton Assemblages Focusing on Large-River Floodplain Lakes of Brazil	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												With its network of lotic and lentic habitats that shift during changes in seasonal connection, the tropical and subtropical large-river systems represent possibly the most dynamic of all aquatic environments. Pelagic water samples were collected from Brazilian floodplain lakes (total n = 58) in four flood-pulsed systems (Amazon [n = 21], Araguaia [n = 14], Parana [n = 15], and Pantanal [n = 8]) in 2011-2012 and sequenced via 454 for bacterial environmental DNA using 16S amplicons; additional abiotic field and laboratory measurements were collected for the assayed lakes. We report here a global comparison of the bacterioplankton makeup of freshwater systems, focusing on a comparison of Brazilian lakes with similar freshwater systems across the globe. The results indicate a surprising similarity at higher taxonomic levels of the bacterioplankton in Brazilian freshwater with global sites. However, substantial novel diversity at the family level was also observed for the Brazilian freshwater systems. Brazilian freshwater bacterioplankton richness was relatively average globally. Ordination results indicate that Brazilian bacterioplankton composition is unique from other areas of the globe. Using Brazil-only ordinations, floodplain system differentiation most strongly correlated with dissolved oxygen, pH, and phosphate. Our data on Brazilian freshwater systems in combination with analysis of a collection of freshwater environmental samples from across the globe offers the first regional picture of bacterioplankton diversity in these important freshwater systems.

High altitude tropical shallow lakes are a special case, showing similarities with temperate and tropical lakes. We studied the ecology of the eutrophic high-altitude tropical lake Yahuarcocha in the Ecuadorian Andes and evaluated the potential of biomanipulation to control eutrophication. With a toxin-producing Cylindrospermopsis bloom, low Secchi depth and low submerged macrophyte cover, Yahuarcocha is clearly in a turbid ecosystem state. Relatively low nutrient concentrations should theoretically allow for a shift to a clear water state through biomanipulation. Top-down control of phytoplankton by zooplankton, however, is complicated by the (1) absence of predatory fish, (2) fish community dominated by small poecelid species, (3) lack of a refuge for zooplankton from fish predation within the macrophytes, and (4) persistent, grazing resistant bloom of the cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis. In these aspects, lake Yahuarcocha is more similar to tropical shallow lakes, probably because water temperature is high relative to the mean air temperature and because of the absence of a cold season. The fish and macrophyte communities consisted almost entirely of exotic species. The exotic fish species probably stabilized the turbid state in the lake.

The average MCs concentrations for Radix swinhoei (pulmonate) and Margarya melanioides (prosobranch) tended to be similar for the different organs: the highest values in the hepatopancreas (9.33 by 3.74 mu g/g DW), followed by digestive tracts (1.66 by 3.03 mu g/g DW), gonads (0.45 by 1.34 mu g/g DW) and muscles (0.22 by 0.40 mu g/g DW). Pulmonate had higher value than prosobranch because of the stronger bioaccumulation ability in hepatopancreas. The levels in organs of R. swinhoei were correlated with environmentally dissolved MCs, but influenced by intracellular MCs for M. melanioides.

J	Wilson, HF; Xenopoulos, MA				Wilson, Henry F.; Xenopoulos, Marguerite A.			Ecosystem and seasonal control of stream dissolved organic carbon along a gradient of land use	ECOSYSTEMS												We examined the influence of watershed land use and morphology on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration in 32 south-central Ontario streams having varying agricultural land-use intensities in their catchments. For streams in this region, both univariate and multivariate regression models identify the proportion of the watershed with poorly drained soils (r(2) up to 0.67) as a better predictor of stream DOC concentrations than any other landscape characteristic, including the proportion of the watershed as wetland. Agricultural land use did not strongly influence DOC concentrations in our study area; however, we do show that land-use changes could significantly alter the delivery of DOC to streams in the region. We also identify how landscape-DOC relationships change over a 2-year time period, as related to season, regional climatic conditions, soil moisture, and hydrology. Our results indicate that the relationships between landscape predictors and stream DOC concentrations are temporally dynamic. Strong temporal trends are shown seasonally and in association with climate, through its control of modelled soil moisture conditions. During periods of positive and negative deviation from normal soil moisture conditions, the relationships of DOC concentrations with landscape characteristics become less predictable. We show that these dominant patterns are likely a function of varying flow paths and that anthropogenic changes that affect soil moisture conditions or flow path will in turn strongly influence DOC dynamics.

Oxygen-controlled recirculating seepage meter reveals extent of nitrogen transformation in discharging coastal groundwater at the aquifer-estuary interface	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Nutrient loads delivered to estuaries via submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) play an important role in the nitrogen (N) budget and eutrophication status. However, accurate and reliable quantification of the chemical flux across the final decimeters and centimeters at the sediment-estuary interface remains a challenge, because there is significant potential for biogeochemical alteration due to contrasting conditions in the coastal aquifer and surface sediment. Here, a novel, oxygen- and light-regulated ultrasonic seepage meter, and a standard seepage meter, were used to measure SGD and calculate N species fluxes across the sediment-estuary interface. Coupling the measurements to an endmember approach based on subsurface N concentrations and an assumption of conservative transport enabled estimation of the extent of transformation occurring in discharging groundwater within the benthic zone. Biogeochemical transformation within reactive estuarine surface sediment was a dominant driver in modifying the N flux carried upward by SGD, and resulted in a similar percentage of N removal (similar to 42-52%) as did transformations occurring deeper within the coastal aquifer salinity mixing zone (similar to 42-47%). Seasonal shifts in the relative importance of biogeochemical processes including denitrification, nitrification, dissimilatory nitrate reduction, and assimilation altered the composition of the flux to estuarine surface water, which was dominated by ammonium in June and by nitrate in August, despite the endmember-based observation that fixed N in discharging groundwater was strongly dominated by nitrate. This may have important ramifications for the ecology and management of estuaries, since past N loading estimates have generally assumed conservative transport from the nearshore aquifer to estuary.

The recent creation of reservoirs has caused a rapid increase in the area of the world's littoral zones. To investigate the effects of water depth and water level fluctuation on CH4 fluxes, and how these are coupled with vegetation and nutrients, we used static closed chamber and gas chromatography techniques to measure CH4 fluxes in the littoral zone of a large reservoir near Beijing, China, from November 2011 to October 2012. We found that CH4 flux decreased significantly along a transect from open water to dry land, from 3.1 mg m (-2) h (-1) at the deep water site to approximately 1.3 mg m (-2) h (-1) at the shallow water site, and less than 0.01 mg m 22 h 21 in the non-flooded area. Water level influenced CH4 flux by affecting soil properties including soil redox potential, soil carbon and nitrogen, and bulk density. The largest emission of all was from the seasonally flooded site after a flooding event ( up to 21.1 mg m (-2) h (-1)), which may have been caused by vegetation decomposition. Submerged sites had greater emissions, while the driest site had lower emissions. Immediately after the monthly measurements had been made, we removed the aboveground vegetation to enable an assessment of the gas transportation per unit of biomass. Removal of biomass decreased emissions by up to 53%. These results indicated the dominant effect of water depth on CH4 flux through effects of soil conditions, plant species composition and distribution. This study suggests that temporally flooded wetlands, including littoral zones, contribute significantly to the global CH4 burden. However, the current challenge is to capture their spatial extent and temporal variation in the fluxes.

As one of the core areas in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), the headwater region of the Yangtze, Yellow, and Lancang Rivers is a water source for billions of people in Asia. However, previous studies failed to provide complete open-surface water data and watershed-level analysis for this region. Utilizing the Google Earth Engine platform and vegetation-water algorithm, we interpreted open-surface water bodies from all available Landsat surface reflectance data and generated annual 30-m water body frequency maps for 1987-2021, which is a complete open-surface water body dataset in the study area. Compared to the Joint Research Centre's Global Surface Water dataset, the dataset in our study maintains consistency in 90.1 % of pixels and achieved correct classification in 74.6 % of pixels within the inconsistent areas. The perennial water body area exhibited an increase from 232,335 to 293,534 ha. Instead, the seasonal water body area notably declined from 223,809 to 182,003 ha. The Yangtze River headwater region shows an increase in perennial water bodies, with no significant variation in seasonal water bodies. The Yellow River headwater region experiences an increase in perennial water bodies but a decrease in seasonal water bodies. Remarkably, in the Lancang River headwater region, with lower water body density, both the perennial and seasonal water body areas decreased by 36.8 % and 48.8 %, respectively. The divergent changes in the headwater region of the Three Rivers are primarily attributed to spatial heterogeneity in the temperature effects on water bodies. Anticipated increases in the temperature are expected to amplify these differences. Our findings suggest that climate-driven open-surface water body changes are ongoing in this core area in the QTP, threatening the water security of densely populated East and Southeast Asia in the future.

Climatic factors as risks of recent ecological changes in the shallow zone of Lake Baikal	RUSSIAN GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS												Eutrophication processes have been recorded in many world's freshwater reservoirs, which are sources of drinking water. More and more investigations show that global warming is the mam natural factor that causes eutrophication. In recent years, signs of eutrophication have also been recorded in Lake Baikal containing 20% of the world's freshwater reserves. Therefore, we performed the first comprehensive analysis of long-term changes in climatic parameters capable to provoke negative changes in the shallow zone. The largest number of anomalies of climatic indices has been recorded in the 21st century. Moreover, the current decade has been the most favorable for the emergence of negative processes in the lake (outbreak of the mass growth of algae and aquatic vegetation, rotting of their remains at the bottom and on the shores of the lake, changes in the structure and zoning of biocoenoses, etc.). The mam natural conditions favoring the emergence of negative signs are elevated temperatures of the air and lake shore water, reduced amount of precipitation, reduced inflow of river waters into Baikal and lowering of its water level, low-water season, and weakening of wind currents, water exchange processes, and, as a result, water self-purification. In the period of continuing global warming, it is necessary to study the climate effect on the processes in the shallow zone and to carry out long-term monitoring for elucidation of recent and expected changes in the ecological state of Lake Baikal and for their valid interpretation.

J	Zhang, F; Wang, J; Wang, XP				Zhang, Fei; Wang, Juan; Wang, Xiaoping			Recognizing the Relationship between Spatial Patterns in Water Quality and Land-Use/Cover Types: A Case Study of the Jinghe Oasis in Xinjiang, China	WATER												To understand the relationship between spatial water quality patterns and changes in land-use/cover types in the Jinghe Oasis, 47 water sampling sites measured in May and October 2015 were divided into six cluster layers using the self-organizing map method, which is based on non-hierarchical k-means classification. The water quality indices included the chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids (SS), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), chromaticity (SD), and turbidity (NUT). Data was also collected on the changes in the farmland, forest-grassland, water body, salinized land, and other land types during the wet and dry seasons. Then, we combined these data with the classification results of the GF-1 remote sensing satellite data obtained in May and October 2015 and analyzed the influences of land-use/cover type on water quality for different layers and seasons. The results indicate that Clusters 1 to 3 included monitoring samples from the wet season (May 2015), whereas Clusters 4 to 6 included monitoring samples from the dry season (October 2015). In general, the COD, SS, NUT, TN, and NH3-N values were high around the Ganjia Lake Haloxylon natural conservation area in the southern Ebinur Lake region, east of Ebinur Lake, and around the Kuitun River during the wet season. The SD values around these areas were high. Moreover, high BOD and TP values were mainly concentrated around the Ganjia Lake Haloxylon natural conservation area, as well as the Kuitun River, during the dry season. In the discussion on the relationship between the different water quality parameters and land-use/cover type changes, we determined that farmland, forest-grassland, and salinized land significantly influenced the water quality parameters in the Jinghe Oasis. In addition, the influences of various land-use/cover types on the water quality parameters in the research zone during the different seasons exhibited the following descending order of magnitude: farmland forest-grassland salinized land water body others. Moreover, their influences were lower during the wet season than the dry season. In conclusion, developing research on the relationship between the spatial framework of the water quality in the Jinghe Oasis and land-use/cover type changes is significant for the time sequence distribution of water quality in arid regions from both theoretical and practical perspectives.

Cholera Hot-Spots and Contextual Factors in Burundi, Planning for Elimination	TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE												The Republic of Burundi first reported cholera cases in 1978 and outbreaks have been occurring nearly every year since then. From 2008-2020, 6949 cases and 43 deaths were officially reported. To evaluate Burundi's potential to eliminate cholera, we identified hotspots using cholera incidence and disease persistence as suggested by the Global Task Force for Cholera Control. The mean annual incidence for each district that reported cholera ranged from 0.29 to 563.14 cases per 100,000 population per year from 2014-2020. Ten of 12 Health Districts which recorded cholera cases reported a mean annual incidence >= 5 per 100,000 for this time period. Cholera cases occur during the second half of the year in the areas near Lake Tanganyika and along the Ruzizi River, with the highest risk district being Bujumbura Centre. Additional research is needed to understand the role of Lake Tanganyika; risks associated with fishing; migration patterns; and other factors that may explain cholera's seasonality. Due to the consistent epidemiological pattern and the relatively small area affected by cholera, control and elimination are feasible with an integrated program of campaigns using oral cholera vaccine over the short term and community-based interventions including WASH activities for sustained control.

Parasitic Infections, Anemia and Malnutrition Among Rural Settled and Mobile Pastoralist Mothers and Their Children in Chad	ECOHEALTH												Malnutrition, resulting from various etiologies, is common in rural Chadian women and children. This cross-sectional study assessed the spectrum of parasitic infection and level of anemia and their effect on nutritional status in settled and mobile pastoral mothers and children near Lake Chad. Intestinal parasites were evaluated using direct fecal smears and the Kato-Katz technique. Malaria status was determined using Paracheck-Pf(A (R)) rapid diagnostic test, and anemia was assessed with the Hemocue photometer. Nutritional status was evaluated using anthropometric parameters. At the end of the 2008 wet season, the prevalence of malnutrition was 36% [confidence interval (CI) 30-42] among women and 15% (CI 11-18) among children. The prevalence of intestinal parasitic infection was 75% (CI 68-83) among women and 60% (CI 53-66) among children. The predominant helminth species was Ascaris lumbricoides while Entamoeba histolytica/dispar was the most common protozoan. The hookworm prevalence was 14% (CI 8-20) in women and 18% (CI 13-23) in children. Malaria prevalence was low among women (1%, CI 0.5-2) and children (3% CI 2-5). No significant difference was observed in the prevalence of parasitic infection between the mobile pastoralist and rural sedentary populations. Thirty-four percent (CI 27-40) of nonpregnant women, 53% (CI 34-72) of pregnant women, and 27% (CI 23-32) of children were anemic. In subjects infected with Plasmodium, all women and 54% (CI 22-85) of children were anemic. Malnutrition was significantly associated with anemia in mothers and with selected intestinal parasites, anemia and age in their children.

Stromatolite lamination frequency, Walker Lake, Nevada: Implications for stromatolites as biosignatures	GEOLOGY												Lamination in stromatolites (considered some of the oldest fossils on Earth) is commonly interpreted to record the periodic response of a microbial community to daily, seasonal, or perhaps yearly environmental forcing, but the inability to date ancient stromatolites precludes an understanding of the lamination formation processes. We use high-resolution C-14 dating of Holocene stromatolites from Walker Lake, Nevada (United States), to construct a record of lamination rate over the course of accretion. Laminae formed with a period of 5.6 +/- 1.6 yr/lamination at the base of the structure, 1.6-2.8 +/- 1.9 yr/lamination in the middle, and 4.5 +/- 0.8 yr/lamination at the top of the laminated portion. The predominant 4-6 yr periodicity indicates that lamination formation is likely more closely related to regional climate forcing (e.g., El Nino Southern Oscillation) versus the typical diurnal or seasonal changes in microbial mats traditionally assumed for most ancient stromatolites. Thus, generalizations regarding the influence of microbial mats on stromatolite lamination and the use of stromatolites as biosignatures need careful consideration.																			0091-7613					JUN	2012	40	6					499	502		10.1130/G32675.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/G32675.1													WOS:000304515000005

Three seasonal data, including water quality and phytoplankton, were collected from the five lakes. The results demonstrated clear differences in water parameters and phytoplankton compositions in different lakes. The phytoplankton was dominated by Bacillariophyta, followed by Cyanobacteria and Chlorophyta in Lake Qinghai, Lake Keluke, and Lake Tuosu. It was dominated by Cyanobacteria (followed by Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta in Lake Yanghe) and Cyanobacteria (followed by Chlorophyta and Cryptophyta in Lake Taihu). The temperature was an essential factor favoring the growth of Cyanobacteria, Chlorophyta, and Bacillariophyta, especially Cyanobacteria and Chlorophyta. The pH had significantly negative relationships with Cyanobacteria, Chlorophyta, and Bacillariophyta. Particularly, a high pH might be a strong and negative factor for phytoplankton growth in alpine lakes. A high salinity was also an adverse factor for phytoplankton. Those results could provide fundamental information about the phytoplankton community and their correlated factors in the alpine lakes of the Tibetan Plateau, contributing to the protection and management of alpine lakes.																				1660-4601				MAR	2022	19	5							3135	10.3390/ijerph19053135	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19053135								35270826					WOS:000771418800001

Physiological and nutritional constraints on zooplankton productivity due to eutrophication and climate change predicted using a resource-based modeling approach	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Emerging evidence suggests that zooplankton production is affected by physiological and nutritional constraints due to climate change and eutrophication, which in turn could have broad implications for food-web dynamics and fish-eries production. In this study, we developed a resource-based zooplankton production dynamics model that causally links freshwater cladoceran and copepod daily production-to-biomass (P/B) ratios with water temperature, phytoplankton bio-mass and community composition, and zooplankton feeding selectivity. This model was used to evaluate constraints on zooplankton growth under four hypothetical scenarios: involving natural plankton community seasonal succession; lake fertilization to enhance fisheries production; eutrophication; and climatic warming. Our novel modeling approach predicts zooplankton production is strongly dependent on seasonal variation in resource availability and quality, which results in more complex zooplankton dynamics than predicted by simpler temperature-dependent models. For mesotrophic and hypereutrophic lakes, our study suggests that the ultimate control over zooplankton P/B ratios shifts from physiological control during colder periods to strong resource control during warmer periods. Our resource-based model provides impor-tant insights into the nature of biophysical control of zooplankton under a changing climate that has crucial implications for food web energy transfer and fisheries production.					; Brett, Michael/A-2066-2010; Arhonditsis, George/AAI-7897-2020; Stockwell, Jason/HSC-4786-2023; Zhang, Chen/G-9555-2016; Winder, Monika/F-5318-2016	Arhonditsis, George/0000-0001-5359-8737; Stockwell, Jason/0000-0003-3393-6799; Zhang, Chen/0000-0003-3212-4270; Brett, Michael/0000-0002-8796-9863; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				MAR	2022	79	3					472	486		10.1139/cjfas-2021-0071	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2021-0071													WOS:000761477200009

Seasonal and spatial variability of CO2 in aquatic environments of the central lowland Amazon basin	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Different sources and processes contribute to pCO(2) and CO2 exchange with the atmosphere in the rivers and floodplains of the Amazon basin. We measured or estimated pCO(2), CO2 fluxes with the atmosphere, planktonic community respiration (PCR), and environmental and landscape variables along the Negro and Amazon-Solimoes rivers during different periods of the fluvial hydrological cycle. Values of pCO(2) ranged from 307 to 7527atm, while CO2 fluxes ranged from -9.3 to 1128mmolm(-2)d(-1) in the Amazon-Solimoes basin. In the Negro basin, pCO(2) values ranged from 648 to 6526 atm, and CO2 fluxes from 35 to 1025mmolm(-2)d(-1). In a general linear model including data from Negro and Amazon-Solimoes basins, seasonal and spatial variation in flooded vegetated habitat area, dissolved oxygen, depth and water temperature explained 85% of surface pCO(2) variation. Levels of pCO(2) varied with inundation extent, with higher pCO(2) values occurring in periods with greater water depth and inundation area, and lower dissolved oxygen concentrations and water temperatures. In a separate analysis for the Amazon-Solimoes river and floodplains, ecosystem type (lotic or lentic), hydrological period, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, depth and dissolved phosphorus explained 83% of pCO(2) variation. Our results demonstrate the influence of alluvial floodplains and seasonal variations in their limnological characteristics on the pCO(2) levels in river channels of the lowland Amazon.

However, combined effects of drift macroalgae and warming on the occurrence and intensity of hypoxia are not well understood, although these anthropogenic stressors have co-occurred. We conducted 10 seasonally replicated 7-day algal enclosure/exclosure experiments at a shallow coastal zone in the eutrophic Nakaumi Lagoon, western Japan, to evaluate the combined effects of drift algae and water warming on occurrence and intensity of diel-cycling hypoxia. Experimental units were 1x1m plots of the sandy bottom fenced within 1m height with plastic mesh that excluded or included drift algae, with automated dissolved oxygen (DO) sensors deployed at the sediment surface. DO fluctuated over a diel cycle for both algal treatments, and algal presence and elevated temperature additively amplified the diel DO cycle. Algal presence and elevated temperature synergistically increased the occurrence and intensity of diel-cycling hypoxia. The occurrence of hypoxia, including anoxia, increased non-linearly in the presence of algae when mean water temperature exceeded similar to 25 degrees C, whereas such drastic increase in the hypoxia occurrence was not observed in the absence of algae. Furthermore, the daily minimum DO declined more steeply with warming under algal presence than the absence of algae. These results suggest that coastal areas in the lagoon are now seriously threatened by simultaneous progressions of eutrophication linking to algal bloom and global warming.

However, variations in alpha may be large for ephemeral lakes. Poyang Lake, which is the largest freshwater lake in China, is water-covered and wetland-covered during its high-water and low-water periods, respectively, over a year. This paper examines the seasonal and diurnal variations in alpha using eddy covariance observation data for Poyang Lake. The results show that alpha = 1.26 is overall feasible for both periods at daily and subdaily scales. No obvious seasonal trend was observed, although the standard deviation in alpha for the wetland was larger than that for the water surface. The mean bias in evaporation estimations using the PTE was less than 5 W.m(-2) during both periods, and the root mean square errors were much smaller than the average evaporation measurements at daily scale. U-shaped diurnal patterns of alpha were found during both periods, due partly to the negative correlation between alpha and the available energy (A). Compared to the vapor pressure deficit (VPD), wind speed (u) exerts a larger contribution to these variations. In addition, u is positively correlated with alpha during both periods, however, VPD was positively and negatively correlated with alpha during the high-water and low-water periods, respectively. Subdaily alpha exhibited contrasting clusters in the (u, VPD) plane under the same available energy ranges. Our study highlights the seasonal and diurnal course of alpha and suggests the careful use of PTE at subdaily scales.

Macrozoobenthic communities of the saline Bolshaya Samoroda River (Lower Volga region, Russia): species composition, density, biomass and production	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												We investigated species composition, density, biomass and estimated production of macrozoobenthos communities in the middle and mouth reaches of the saline Bolshaya Samoroda River (Volgograd region, Russia) from May 2013 to April 2014. A total of 30 euryhaline and halophilic taxa were found during the study period. There were significant differences in the species composition between both study sites that could be explained by differences in ecological conditions. The production of macrozoobenthos in the middle reach was 22.54 g dry wt m(-2) yr(-1), and in the mouth reach the production was 117 g dry wt m(-2) yr(-1). In all seasons of the year at both sites, the greatest contribution to benthic production was made by the same taxonomic groups. Diptera dominated at both sites. Amphipods were abundant only in the middle reach. In the middle reach, the greatest contributions to production were made by Gammarus lacustris, Sphaeromias pictus and Glyptotendipes salinus, and in the mouth reach, Microchironomus deribae, Tanytarsus kharaensis and Chironomus salinarius contributed to benthic production the most.

However, estimates of the CO2 content of the atmosphere at the time the sediments in Gale crater were deposited are far less than needed by any climate model to maintain temperatures warm enough for sustained open water lake conditions due to the low solar energy input available at that time. To reconcile some of the in-situ sedimentological evidence for liquid water with climate modeling studies, we perform the water budget of evaporation against precipitation to estimate the minimum lifetimes and the rainfall requirements for open water and ice-covered lakes in Gale crater, for a wide range of pressures and temperatures. We found that both open water and ice-covered lakes are possible, and that ice-covered lakes provide better consistency in regards of the low erosion rates estimates for the Hesperian. We incrementally test the existence of open water conditions using energy balance calculations for the global, regional, and seasonal temperatures, and we assess if the preservation of liquid water was possible under perennial ice covers. We found scenarios where lacustrine conditions are preserved in a cold climate, where the resupply of water by the inflow of rivers and high precipitation rates are substituted by an abutting glacier. For equatorial temperatures as low as 240 K-255 K, the ice thickness ranges from 3 to 10 m, a value comparable to the range of those for the perennially ice-covered lakes in Antarctica (3-6 m). The ice-covered lake hypothesis is a compelling way to decouple the mineralogy and the climate by limiting the gas exchanges between the sediment and the CO2 atmosphere, and it eliminates the requirement for global mean temperatures above the freezing point. Not only do ice-covered lakes provide a baseline for exploring the range of possible lake scenarios for Gale crater during the Hesperian that is fully consistent with climate studies, but also they might have been ideal environments to sustain life on Mars.

In this study, total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) levels were measured in three size fractions of zooplankton collected from three reservoirs (Hongfeng, Baihua, and Aha Reservoir) and one wetland in karst areas to understand mercury accumulation in zooplankton from alkaline environments. The results showed that the alkaline waters had lower zooplankton MeHg levels (0.1 to 66.8 ng g(-1)) than most of the acidic waters reported. However, the zooplankton THg levels (6.3 to 494.9 ng g(-1)) were comparable. The macro-zooplankton (> 500 mu m) had significantly higher THg and MeHg levels than meso-zooplankton (116 to 500 mu m) in the three reservoirs at all seasons, which showed biomagnification of mercury in the food chain. The correlation between Hg in water and zooplankton and Hg in zooplankton of different sizes indicated that THg bioaccumulation in zooplankton was related to the THg levels in water; however, MeHg bioaccumulation in zooplankton was controlled by many other factors, such as their feeding and living habits. In the three reservoirs, the THg and MeHg concentrations in zooplankton decreased with increasing eutrophication. However, compared with the three reservoirs, Caohai Wetland, with large amounts of aquatic plants, had a much lower trophic level and higher MeHg content in water but much lower zooplankton MeHg levels and bioaccumulation factors (BAFs). The large amounts of plant residue might dilute mercury in the food chain, revealing that high primary production could result in lower Hg bioaccumulation, rather than only being influenced by nutrient levels.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				MAR	2020	27	8					8596	8610		10.1007/s11356-019-07479-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-07479-8								31907806					WOS:000517084600070

The experiments were conducted using the litter bag method for representative plants, Carex lasiocarpa and Calamagrostis angustifolia, in both non-flooded and flooded areas between November 2011 and November 2013. Heterogeneous effects of the freeze season and its interaction with hydrological regimes on the decomposition of the litter of various species and organs were observed. The litter decomposition occurred during the freeze season and made a significant contribution to the loss throughout the year. The two-year mass-loss of C. lasiocarpa and C. angustifolia and their organs re ordered differently between the freeze season and the freeze-free season. The proportion of litter mass-loss during the freeze season accounting for the whole year in the flooded area were greater than that in the non-flooded area, except for the C. angustifolia root litter. The litter mass-losses of entire C. lasiocarpa and C. angustifolia during the freeze season were greater than those during the freeze-free season in the flooded area, while the pattern was opposite in the non-flooded area. The effect of environmental factors on litter decomposition might override the effects of litter substrate quality. The total N and P of the litter of the entire C. lasiocarpa and entire C. angustifolia increased significantly relative to the initial values after two years and tended to enrich more in the litter under flooded conditions than under non-flooded conditions. The results highlighted the heterogeneous effects of the freeze season and its interaction with hydrological regimes on various species and organs, which would provide management and restoration options for degraded wetlands caused by climate change.

Environmental DNA (eDNA) technology offers numerous advantages for biodiversity assessment. However, the utilization of eDNA techniques for freshwater snail monitoring remains limited. In this study, we screened primers for assessing freshwater snail diversity using eDNA technology and constructed a comprehensive database for Poyang Lake. Using eDNA technology, a total of 21 species of snails were detected in Poyang Lake, while traditional methods detected only 11 species. Notably, all species collected by traditional methods were also detected by eDNA technology. Additionally, environmental DNA methods detected the invasive snail Pomacea canaliculata, while traditional methods did not. In this study, eleven intermediate host snail species for parasitic disease were identified using eDNA methods, while six were detected through traditional sampling techniques. The eDNA metabarcoding analysis showed that the alpha and beta diversity levels of snails in Poyang Lake did not vary significantly, indicating that results obtained by eDNA sampling are not influenced by the season in which samples were collected. The correlation analysis between the community structure of snails and environmental factors in Poyang Lake revealed significant impacts of total nitrogen, chlorophyll a, water depth, and water temperature on the snail community structure. These results confirm that eDNA technology can be exploited to monitor freshwater snail biodiversity.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				JAN	2024	158								111577	10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.111577	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.111577		JAN 2024											WOS:001166212100001

Palla in a constructed wetland of the Venice lagoon watershed	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												A recently constructed wetland, located in the Venice lagoon watershed, was monitored to investigate growth dynamics, nutrient and heavy metal shoot accumulation of the two dominating macrophytes: Phragmites australis and Bolboschoenus maritimus. Investigations were conducted over a vegetative season at three locations with different distance to the inlet point to assess effects on vegetation. The distance from the inlet did not affect either shoot biomass or nutrients (N, P, K and Na) and heavy metals (Cr, Ni, Cu and Zn) shoot content. With the exception of Na, nutrient and heavy metal concentrations were higher in shoots of P. australis than in B. maritimus. Heavy metal concentration in the incoming water and in the soil was not correlated to the plant content of either species. Shoot heavy metal concentrations were similar to those reported in the current literature, but accumulation generally increased towards the end of the growing season. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Barbiero, RP; Lesht, BM; Warren, GJ				Barbiero, Richard P.; Lesht, Barry M.; Warren, Glenn J.			Recent changes in the offshore crustacean zooplankton community of Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Crustacean zooplankton communities in the offshore of Lake Ontario have undergone substantial changes between 1997 and 2011. A shift was apparent in 2004 from an initial assemblage dominated by cyclopoid copepods (mostly Diacyclops thomasi), Daphnia retrocurva and bosminids, and with Cercopagis pengoi (which invaded the lake in 1998) the dominant predatory cladoceran, to one characterized by reduced numbers of cyclopoids, a more varied predatory dadoceran community, and increased biomass of calanoid copepods. These changes represented a shift from a community which has been relatively stable in the offshore of the lake for at least 40 years. A further change was seen in 2008, marked by increased biomass of Leptodiaptomus sicilis, Bythotrephes longimanus and Daphnia mendotae. Unlike the somewhat similar changes seen recently in the zooplankton communities of Lakes Huron and Michigan, the shifts in Lake Ontario have not been accompanied by a trend towards increased oligotrophy. A more likely explanation for the observed shifts in Lake Ontario is decreased vertebrate predation, likely due to alewife declines, and changes in the predatory invertebrate community.

Three hundred and thirty eight nonempty stomach samples were analysed using frequency of occurrence and volumetric methods of analysis. Detritus, insects, macrophytes, zooplankton and fish were the dominant food categories by occurrence, and they occurred in 79.6%, 63.6%, 63.0%, 56.2% and 15.4% of the stomachs, respectively. Volumetrically, the above food items comprised 24.3%, 14.1%, 14.5%, 19.3% and 21.8% of the total volume of food categories. Phytoplankton and gastropods were of low importance, and they occurred in 28.7% and 8.6% of the stomachs, respectively. Their volumetric contributions were 3.2% and 2.8% of the total volume of food categories. During the dry month, fish, zooplankton, insects and detritus were important food categories, while during the wet month detritus, macrophytes, insects and gastropods were important. Smaller catfish diets were dominated by detritus, macrophytes and insects, whereas larger catfish shifted to fish and zooplankton. Based on the results, C. gariepinus was found to be omnivorous in its feeding habits in Lake Koka.

Stake Observations: A Comparison in the Lake Vostok Region, Central East Antarctica	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												The surface mass balance (SMB) is very low over the vast East Antarctic Plateau, for example in the Vostok region, where the mean SMB is on the order of 20-35 kg m(-2) a(-1). The observation and modeling of spatio-temporal SMB variations are equally challenging in this environment. Stake measurements carried out in the Vostok region provide SMB observations over half a century (1970-2019). This unique data set is compared with SMB estimations of the regional climate models RACMO2.3p2 (RACMO) and MAR3.11 (MAR). We focus on the SMB variations over time scales from months to decades. The comparison requires a rigorous assessment of the uncertainty in the stake observations and the spatial scale dependence of the temporal SMB variations. Our results show that RACMO estimates of annual and multi-year SMB agree well with the observations. The regression slope between modelled and observed temporal variations is close to 1.0 for this model. SMB simulations by MAR are affected by a positive bias which amounts to 6 kg m(-2) a(-1) at Vostok station and 2 kg m(-2) a(-1) along two stake profiles between Lake Vostok and Ridge B. None of the models is capable to reproduce the seasonal distributions of SMB and precipitation. Model SMB estimates are used in assessing the ice-mass balance and sea-level contribution of the Antarctic Ice Sheet by the input-output method. Our results provide insights into the uncertainty contribution of the SMB models to such assessments.

Thad			Partitioning whole-lake denitrification using in situ dinitrogen gas accumulation and intact sediment core experiments	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We measured in situ hypolimnion and metalimnion dinitrogen (N-2) accumulation rates and N-2 production from sediments in contact with the reservoir epilimnia for 3 small (< 1 km(2)) and shallow reservoirs with inherently low stratification stability. Hypolimnion areal denitrification rates ranged from 98.6 to 168 mu mol N-2-N m(-2) h(-1), while metalimnion rates were up to two times greater. A laboratory experiment simulating the temporary breakdown and reestablishment of the oxycline confirmed that short-term metalimnetic denitrification could be important in reactive nitrogen (N) loss in these reservoirs. Net denitrification occurred in sediments in contact with reservoir epilimnia during seasonal mixing, but net N-2 fixation occurred in these sediments during stratification. The observed shift between net denitrification and net N-2 fixation in epilimnetic sediments corresponded with an annual cycle of nitrate availability in the epilimnia. Annual whole-reservoir denitrification rates ranged from 12 to 23 g N m(-2) yr(-1). The hypolimnion contribution to annual denitrification was 16-25%. Sediments in contact with epilimnia were the greatest N-2 source in all of the reservoirs. However, denitrification in the anoxic metalimnion was of similar magnitude to denitrification in epilimnetic sediments at one reservoir, and variability in metalimnetic denitrification rates was related to the strength of stratification stability. Integrating habitat-specific measurements into whole-lake denitrification rates showed that hydrologically dynamic habitats represent important denitrification hotspots, and that periodic disturbances fuel hot moments for denitrification.

In Lake Tinnsjoen, one of the largest and deepest lakes in Norway, the salmonid fish, Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus(L.)), has likely radiated within 9,700 years after deglaciation into ecologically and genetically segregated Piscivore, Planktivore, Dwarf, and Abyssal morphs in the pelagial, littoral, shallow-moderate profundal, and deep-profundal habitats. We compared trait variation in the size of the head, the eye and olfactory organs, as well as the volumes of five brain regions of these four Arctic charr morphs. We hypothesised that specific habitat characteristics have promoted divergent body, head, and brain sizes related to utilized depth differing in environmental constraints (e.g., light, oxygen, pressure, temperature, and food quality). The most important ecomorphological variables differentiating morphs were eye area, habitat, and number of lamellae. The Abyssal morph living in the deepest areas of the lake had the smallest brain region volumes, head, and eye size. Comparing the olfactory bulb with the optic tectum in size, it was larger in the Abyssal morph than in the Piscivore morph. The Piscivore and Planktivore morphs that use more illuminated habitats have the largest optic tectum volume, followed by the Dwarf. The observed differences in body size and sensory capacities in terms of vision and olfaction in shallow and deepwater morphs likely relates to foraging and mating habitats in Lake Tinnsjoen. Further seasonal and experimental studies of brain volume in polymorphic species are needed to test the role of plasticity and adaptive evolution behind the observed differences.

We apply the results of laboratory tests to a Quaternary sediment record. The combination of silt production, relative quartz enrichment in the silt fraction, and quartz grain micromorphology is traced in a multi-100-kyr lake sediment archive as indicator data for cryogenic weathering. Constant cryogenic weathering conditions are inferred for at least the last 220 000 years from a lake sediment core of El'gygytgyn Crater, northeast Russia. This is the longest continuous terrestrial archive currently known for the continental Arctic. Quartz enrichment in the fines evolves from seasonal freezethaw weathering as demonstrated in laboratory testing where over 100 freeze and thaw cycles crack quartz grains preferentially over feldspar. Microscopic grain features demonstrate that freezethaw cycling probably disrupts quartz grains along mineral impurities such as bubble trails, gasliquid inclusions, or mineralogical sub-grain boundaries. Single-grain micromorphology (e.g. angular outlines, sharp edges, microcracks, brittle surfaces) illustrates how quartz becomes fragmented due to cryogenic cracking of the grains. The single-grain features stemming from the weathering dynamics are preserved even after a grain is transported off site (i.e. in mobile slope material, in seasonal river run-off, into a lake basin) and may serve as first-order proxy data for permafrost conditions in Quaternary records.

J	Yoon, Y; Beighley, E				Yoon, Yeosang; Beighley, Edward			Simulating streamflow on regulated rivers using characteristic reservoir storage patterns derived from synthetic remote sensing data	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												This study presents a method to estimate streamflow in rivers regulated by lakes or reservoirs using synthetic satellite remote sensing data. To illustrate the approach, the new reservoir routing method is integrated into the Hillslope River Routing model, and a case study is presented for the highly regulated river in the Cumberland River basin (46,400km(2)). The study period is April-May 2000, which contains a significant flood event that occurred in 1-2 May 2000. The model is shown to capture storage/release characterises in eight reservoirs with a mean normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 20% for entire simulation period and 27% for the May flood event. These errors are 69 and 75%, respectively, less than the NRMSE if reservoirs are not included in the model. Given the limitations of satellite missions, the impacts of the revisit cycles and operational periods are quantified. We used 26 observation sets of satellite altimetry over Cumberland River basin that are generated by considering both repeat cycles and satellite operation periods. For the revisit cycles, increasing the interval of repeat cycle leads to a corresponding increase of mean NRMSE from 27 to 59% as a result of sampling fewer flood events and smoothing of the change in storage signal as a result of longer intervals between visits. For the operation periods, the impact of data periods is limited because of the strong seasonal pattern of reservoir operations. Overall, the results suggest that the generalized routing model derived from reservoir stage observations can be used to simulate reservoir operating conditions, which can be used in forecasting hydrologic impacts of land cover or climate change.

The contents of total-phosphorus, nitrate nitrogen, and ammonium nitrogen in rural aquatic bodies typical of the Taihu Lake region (Yixing, Wangzhuang, and Xinzhuang) were determined during 2 years. The results showed that the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus during the rainy season were higher than in other months. The concentration of ammonium nitrogen in farmland drainage was higher than that of nitrate nitrogen. Ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen were the main pollution sources in rural groundwater. However, the pollution by ammonium nitrogen was worse than nitrate nitrogen. The annual average values of ammonium nitrogen in Yixing and Wangzhuang were 1.596 and 2.103 mg L (-aEuro parts per thousand 1); with maximum values of 5.782 and 5.441 mg L (-aEuro parts per thousand 1), respectively, exceeding the lower limit for type V water quality by a factor of 10. Concentrations of nitrate nitrogen in groundwater in Xinzhuang from May to September exceeded the limit value (10 mg L (-aEuro parts per thousand 1)) for drinking water prescribed by the World Health Organization. Therefore, this groundwater was not suitable to drink. In Taihu Lake, the average concentration of phosphorus over 2 years was 0.492 mg L (-aEuro parts per thousand 1) and pollution by phosphorus in Taihu Lake was worse than other farmland drainage because of the trend of total-phosphorus accumulation. In addition, the average concentrations of nitrate nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen in Taihu Lake were 2.152 and 2.885 mg L (-aEuro parts per thousand 1), respectively over 2 years, indicating that the water in the Taihu Lake is constantly in danger of eutrophication. Because of the transformation of ammonium nitrogen to nitrate nitrogen, there was a connection between the concentrations of ammonium nitrogen in farmland drainage and nitrate nitrogen in groundwater. There was also a significant positive linear correlation between the concentrations of ammonium nitrogen in farmland drainage and in shallow groundwater.

Knowledge of the minimum ecological water demand (EWD) is thus necessary to ensure the basic health of lake ecosystems. This study analyzed the spatiotemporal evolution of water boundaries using Landsat satellites data via remote sensing technology from 2002 to 2017 in East Juyan Lake, an inland desert terminal lake of the Heihe River in northwest China. The minimum lake water demand was determined using two estimation methods: the lake-evaporation-oriented EWD method and the minimum water level method. In the latter method, both lake topography (using water-level area curves) and biological survival demands (using bighead carps as indicators) were considered to derive the minimum lake EWD. Water diversion to the lake over the past 15 years has increased the lake's area, but there are still marked intra-annual seasonal variations. The annual minimum lake water demand was suggested to be 54 x 10(6) m(3)/year by comparing the different methods; however, it was not satisfied, and the lake survival was endangered when the occurrence frequency of the annual runoff in the Zhengyixia hydrological station exceeded 65%. This study offered promising directions for inland lake water resource management.

In January (dry season) and August 2019 (wet season), we detected the N2O concentrations from cascade reservoirs in Lancang-Mekong River Yunnan section by using static headspace gas chromatography and estimated the emission flux by the boundary layer approach to explore the influencing factors, especially the impact of cascade reservoirs development and operation. In the Lancang River (Yunnan section), the longitudinal distribution of N2O concentration along the cascade reservoirs showed seasonal differences. The average concentrations of N2O during the dry season and the wet season were 13.50 +/- 2.00 nmol/L and 16.40 +/- 4.10 nmol/L, respectively. The reservoirs with thermal stratification in both seasons were the Xiaowan (XW), Nuozhadu (NZD), and Jinghong (JH) reservoirs. The vertical distribution of N2O concentration was depth dependent (i.e., the deeper the location, the higher the concentration) in reservoirs with thermal stratification and uniform in reservoirs without thermal stratification. Dissolved oxygen (DO), water temperature, and other biogenic elements were the main factors affecting N2O distribution. The average N2O emission flux in the cascade reservoirs was 12.80 +/- 2.60 mu mol m(2)center dot day(-1)during the dry season and 16.10 +/- 4.75 mu mol m(2)center dot day(-1)during the wet season. The annual average N2O emission fluxes of all reservoirs were in an order of JH > XW > Dachaoshan (DCS) > NZD > Miaowei (MW) > Gongguoqiao (GGQ) > Manwan (Man W). In 2019, a total of 3.37 x 10(6) mol year(-1)(94.39 ton N2O-N year(-1)) was released from the water surface of the cascade reservoirs, which accounted for approximately 0.31% of the total N2O emissions from reservoirs worldwide. This study shows the cascade reservoirs development and operations have made the Lancang River (Yunnan section) a major area for N2O emissions.

Biological and physical evidence for extreme seasonality in central Permian Pangea	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Climate models indicate increased desertification in the continental interior of Pangea during the Permian, which would have affected the composition of the flora and fauna. We present a multi-proxy paleoenvironmental reconstruction of a terrestrial ecosystem in central Pangea of Lopingian age. The reconstruction is based on biological and physical data from the Moradi Formation, located in the Tim Mersoi sub-Basin, northern Niger. Paleosols and sedimentological evidence indicate that the prevailing climate was semi-arid to very arid with marked intervals of high water availability. Carbon stable isotope data from organic matter and paleosols suggest that both the soil productivity and actual evapotranspiration were very low, corresponding to arid conditions. Histological analysis of pareiasaur bones shows evidence of active metabolism and reveals distinct growth marks. These interruptions of bone formation are indicative of growth rhythms, and are considered as markers for contrasting seasonality orepisodic climate events. The macrofossil floras have low diversity and represent gymnosperm dominated woodlands. Most notable are ovuliferous dwarf shoots of voltzian conifers, and a 25-m long tree trunk with irregularly positioned branch scars. The combined biological and physical evidence suggests that the Moradi Formation was deposited under a generally arid climate with recurring periods of water abundance, allowing for a well-established ground water-dependent ecosystem. With respect to its environment, this system is comparable with modern ecosystems such as the southern African Namib Desert and the Lake Eyre Basin in Australia, which are discussed as modern analogues.

Solms) biomass in Lake Tana, Ethiopia	ALL LIFE												This study aimed at assessing the characteristics of water hyacinth biomass in Lake Tana. Explanatory research design was used based on biomass samples and satellite images acquired along with field observation and literature reviews. The results showed that high amount of N and P nutrients, shallow nature of the Lake and suitable climatic conditions of the area are the causes for the weeds' proliferation. The mean NDVI values were -0.542 to 0.828 and -0.628 to 0.877 in the dry and wet seasons, respectively. The spatial distribution of the weed was 2126.9 ha and 592.4 ha during the wet and dry seasons. The weed has recorded a mean leaf length of 9.3 cm, petiole length of 28.1 cm, root shoot ratio of 3.3, leaf blade area of 55.6 cm(2) and leaf area index of 11343.9 cm(2). In addition, a mean of 10.9 leaves per plant and 18.6 plants per 0.25m(2) was found. Furthermore, the biomass analysis revealed 1,990,787.8 tons of wet and 554,523.8 tons of dry water hyacinth biomass can be harvested from the Lake per year. Stakeholders shall work on control of water hyacinth biomass as a short-term measure and reduction of nutrient inflow into the Lake as a long-term measure.

Isotope-based water balance assessment of open water wetlands across Alberta: Regional trends with emphasis on the oil sands region	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: Water sampling for stable isotopes (O-18 and H-2) was carried out during 2009-2019 across Alberta, Canada, as part of a survey targeting 1022 open water wetlands. The study presents the first site-specific wetland water balance assessment spanning Grassland, Parkland, Foothills, Mountains, and Boreal regions, including the oil sands region, a corridor of rapid development.& nbsp;Study focus: Climate reanalysis, watershed data, and isotopic data for wetlands were incorporated into a steady-state isotope mass balance model, and applied to estimate site-specific evaporation losses from the wetlands, as well as runoff, groundwater inflow, total outflow, and seasonal drawdown. Regional-scale water balance fluxes, water balance indicators and site-specific classifications were mapped and described.& nbsp;New hydrological insights for the region: Systematic variations in evaporation losses, watershed runoff to wetlands, wetland discharge, and net groundwater inflow are revealed across the major subregions of Alberta including the oil sands region. Isotope balance calculations suggest that 13% of wetlands are predominantly evaporative, 87% have surface and/or groundwater outflow, 90% have positive water yields, 47% likely have groundwater inflow, and 2% are apparently fed by allochthonous water sources (either snow or glacial melt). For the 3 oil sands regions, a scoping survey suggests that between 20% and 40% of wetlands within the bitumen zones are detectably groundwater reliant compared to 35-50% in the wider vicinity of the deposits.					; Gibson, John/D-1897-2009	Birks, Sandra/0000-0003-0970-682X; 														2214-5818				APR	2022	40								101036	10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.101036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.101036		FEB 2022											WOS:000783431400001

The structures and dynamics of the OABC were determined by partially sequencing cloned 16S rRNA genes, and by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis. One hundred ninety-two T-RFs were detected from the two sites, but only 17 T-RFs were dominant, suggesting that specific microbial populations were adapted to the unique niche provided by the organic aggregates (OA). Phylogenetically, Beta-and Alphaproteobacteria constituted the numerically most important heterotrophic bacterial group. Analysis of similarity revealed significant intra-lake heterogeneity, and significant temporal shifts in OABC. Canonical correspondence analysis demonstrated that site-specific differences in sediment resuspension and nutrient enrichment (namely nitrate and total phosphorus) were the forces driving the intra-lake differences in OABC. Water temperature and dissolved oxygen were related to the seasonal dynamics of OABC. The annual succession in OABC was significant in Meiliang Bay, but not in the lake center. In addition, nearly 35% of the bacterial sequences from OA related to bacteria from soils, activated sludge, sediments, and other habitats, indicating the potential importance of allochthonous bacteria in OABC.

American crocodiles (Crocodylus acutus) as restoration bioindicators in the Florida Everglades	PLOS ONE												The federally threatened American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) is a flagship species and ecological indicator of hydrologic restoration in the Florida Everglades. We conducted a long-term capture-recapture study on the South Florida population of American crocodiles from 1978 to 2015 to evaluate the effects of restoration efforts to more historic hydrologic conditions. The study produced 10,040 crocodile capture events of 9,865 individuals and more than 90% of captures were of hatchlings. Body condition and growth rates of crocodiles were highly age-structured with younger crocodiles presenting with the poorest body condition and highest growth rates. Mean crocodile body condition in this study was 2.14 +/- 0.35 SD across the South Florida population. Crocodiles exposed to hypersaline conditions (> 40 psu) during the dry season maintained lower body condition scores and reduced growth rate by 13% after one year, by 24% after five years, and by 29% after ten years. Estimated hatchling survival for the South Florida population was 25% increasing with ontogeny and reaching near 90% survival at year six. Hatchling survival was 34% in NE Florida Bay relative to a 69% hatchling survival at Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge and 53% in Flamingo area of Everglades National Park. Hypersaline conditions negatively affected survival, growth and body condition and was most pronounced in NE Florida Bay, where the hydrologic conditions have been most disturbed. The American crocodile, a long-lived animal, with relatively slow growth rate provides an excellent model system to measure the effects of altered hydropatterns in the Everglades landscape. These results illustrate the need for continued long-term monitoring to assess system-wide restoration outcomes and inform resource managers.

Hierarchical cluster analysis grouped Nyando, Nzoia and Sondu Miriu River stations into clusters corresponding to major land use classes of the catchments. Mixed agriculture (MA) in Nyando showed higher NO3- compared to the other land uses. Nitrate levels obtained (0.1-11.6 mg L-1) are higher than those reported in previous studies. Hydrochemistry support isotope data indicating that ammonium-based fertilizers and soil N were the major NO3- sources in tea dominated areas with average delta N-15 (6.5 +/- 1.3 parts per thousand), delta O-18 (6.7 +/- 2.3 parts per thousand) values. Manure/sewage were the main source in MA areas with average delta N-15 (8.4 +/- 2.4 parts per thousand), delta O-18 (7.8 +/- 5.4 parts per thousand) values. Sewage was the likely source in urban, residential & industrial areas recording average delta N-15 (10.0 +/- 2.4 parts per thousand), delta O-18 (6.9 +/- 3.7 parts per thousand) values. delta N-15 between land uses were significantly different (p < 0.0001) while delta O-18 were similar (p = 0.4). Seasonally, inorganic/organic fertilizers influenced river NO3- mostly in the wet cropping season. Lower NO3- concentrations observed in Nyando and Sondu Miriu during dry or start-wet season could be a result of in situ denitrification.

Application of Land Use Regression to Identify Sources and Assess Spatial Variation in Urban SVOC Concentrations	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Land use regression (LUR), a geographic information system (GIS), and measured air concentrations were used to identify potential sources of semivolatile organic contaminants (SVOCs) within an urban/suburban region, using Toronto, Canada as a case study. Regression results suggested that air concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and polycyclic musks (PCMs) were correlated with sources at a scale of <5 km. LUR was able to explain 73-90% of the variability in PCBs and PCMs, and 36-89% of PBDE and PAH variability, suggesting that the latter have more spatially complex emission sources, particularly for the lowest and highest molecular weight compounds/congeners. LUR suggested that similar to 75% of the PCB air concentration variability was related to the distribution of PCBs in use/storage/building sealants, similar to 60% of PBDE variability was related to building volume, similar to 55% of the PAH variability was related to the distribution of transportation infrastructure, and similar to 65% of the PCM variability was related to population density. Parameters such as population density and household income were successfully used as surrogates to infer sources and air concentrations of SVOCs in Toronto. This is the first application of LUR methods to explain SVOC concentrations.

Water quality changes and organic matter removal using natural bank infiltration at a boreal lake in Finland	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) refers to intentional infiltration of surface water to an aquifer for facilitating natural water treatment and storage. MAR is often used as a treatment to remove natural organic matter from water in drinking water production. The sustainability of MAR depends on how the aquifer capacity to remove organic matter will evolve over the long term. This report explores the behavior of MAR systems by using a natural lake-aquifer system as a surrogate. Natural infiltration of lake water to groundwater has been going on for millennia at the research site in Finland chosen for this study. According to the measurements, the mean concentration of total organic carbon (TOC) in lake water was 3.0 mg/L. Within the distance of 3 m from the lake bank (retention time 7-15 days), already 46% of TOC was removed. At greater distances along the flow paths within the aquifer, 80-90% of TOC was removed. The observed TOC removal in the aquifer was slightly higher than the reported values at MAR sites, indicating that MAR can be an effective solution to the problem of removing natural organic matter in the long term. Signs of accumulation of organic matter were not observed in the aquifer, which suggests that biodegradation was the main removal method, and the role of sorption was minor. Several processes had an impact on oxygen levels in the aquifer, which led to spatial and seasonal changes in the redox conditions and in the iron and manganese concentrations in groundwater.

The present study describes the geochemical distribution, the provenance and the degree of weathering in surface sediments in parts of Bandipora-Ganderbal areas, Kashmir valley, western Himalaya. Following the standard operating procedure of the Geological Survey of India, high-density sediment sampling over an area of 800 km(2) of toposheet Nos. 43J/11 and 43J/12 (part) was carried during the Field Season Programme of 2014-2015. A total of 200 stream and slope wash sediment samples collected on a 2 x 2 grid pattern, covering an area of 800 km(2) and 10 numbers of duplicate samples were used in this study. An analysis of major and trace element concentrations of the sediment samples revealed significant changes corresponding to different geological formations of the area. The correlation matrix of SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, Fe2O3, MnO, K2O, Th and Y showed a positive correlation with each other and negative correlation with CaO, MgO and Sr, thereby indicating two dominant geological provenances of the sediments. Two dominant geochemical patterns revealed provenances from basaltic and carbonate rock formations in the area. Furthermore, an analysis of geochemical weathering indices (chemical index of alteration and chemical index of weathering) revealed a poor (27) to moderate (78) degree of weathering in this area. This observation is further substantiated by the immaturity of the soil sediments in the area.

Limited seasonal variation in food quality and foodweb structure in an Adirondack stream: insights from fatty acids	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Together terrestrial and aquatic resources fuel stream food webs. Past work suggests that both terrestrial and aquatic resources can vary in multiple metrics of food quality, such as elemental, macronutrient, and fatty acid (FA) composition, and that resource quality may vary seasonally in temperate systems. However, studies on FA composition in stream food webs, especially those quantifying seasonal patterns, remain scarce. We documented foodweb structure and examined FA composition as a metric of food quality in an Adirondack stream throughout the temperate growing season to understand from where stream consumers derived energy, how food quality varied among resources, and whether these patterns shifted seasonally. In spite of major seasonal shifts in environmental factors, such as light availability and temperature, we found limited seasonal variation in the FA composition of basal resources and macroinvertebrates. Instead, we found consistent differences in FA composition between aquatic and terrestrial basal resources and between macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups. Foodweb structure also was consistent throughout the growing season, and macroinvertebrates and fish relied on a mix of terrestrial and aquatic resources. Our results suggest that stream consumers in heavily forested reaches rely upon low-quality terrestrial resources supplemented with higher-quality aquatic resources throughout the year.

Outcomes of submerged macrophyte restoration in a shallow impounded, eutrophic river	HYDROBIOLOGIA					8th International Shallow Lakes Conference	OCT 12-17, 2014	Middle E Tech Univ, Limnology Lab, Antalya, TURKEY		Middle E Tech Univ, Limnology Lab			Restoration of submerged macrophytes in eutrophic shallow freshwater ecosystems is rarely undertaken without additional measures to improve water clarity. Increasing water clarity is extremely difficult to achieve in some eutrophic waters, so this study trialled the establishment of macrophytes directly into a turbid, phytoplankton-dominated system. The submerged macrophyte Vallisneria australis grew successfully in five 48-m(2) protective exclosures, from transplants attached to steel mesh for anchorage in flocculent sediments. Plant growth, water quality, and zooplankton and macroinvertebrate richness and abundance were measured and compared with open water control plots throughout the growing season. V. australis grew well despite poor water quality (total phosphorus 44-1400 A mu g l(-1); total nitrogen 650-14,000 A mu g l(-1); chlorophyll a 1.6-770 A mu g l(-1); turbidity 3-207 NTU), attaining 85-100% cover after 6 months. Water quality was not improved within macrophyte meadows and zooplankton grazing was not enhanced. Richness and abundance of macroinvertebrates increased and additional native macrophyte species colonised the exclosures. Co-dominance of phytoplankton and macrophytes was achieved in exclosures, with beneficial outcomes for biodiversity. Rapid destruction of macrophyte meadows by waterbirds on removal of protective cages indicated the need for continued protection for long-term establishment of submerged macrophytes.

J	Chen, LF; Peng, SL; Liu, JG; Hou, QQ				Chen, Leifu; Peng, Shaolin; Liu, Jingang; Hou, Qianqian			Dry deposition velocity of total suspended particles and meteorological influence in four locations in Guangzhou, China	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												Dry deposition velocity of total suspended particles (TSP) is an effective parameter that describes the speed of atmospheric particulate matter deposit to the natural surface. It is also an important indicator to the capacity of atmosphere self-depuration. However, the spatial and temporal variations in dry deposition velocity of TSP at different urban landscapes and the relationship between dry deposition velocity and the meteorological parameters are subject to large uncertainties. We concurrently investigated this relationship at four different landscapes of Guangzhou, from October to December of 2009. The result of the average dry deposition velocity is (1.49 +/- 0.77), (1.44 +/- 0.77), (1.13 +/- 0.53) and (1.82 +/- 0.82) cm/sec for urban commercial landscape, urban forest landscape, urban residential landscape and country landscape, respectively. This spatial variation can be explained by the difference of both particle size composition of TSP and meteorological parameters of sampling sites. Dry deposition velocity of TSP has a positive correlation with wind speed, and a negative correlation with temperature and relative humidity. Wind speed is the strongest factor that affects the magnitude of TSP dry deposition velocity, and the temperature is another considerable strong meteorological factor. We also find out that the relative humidity brings less impact, especially during the dry season. It is thus implied that the current global warming and urban heat island effect may lead to correlative changes in TSP dry deposition velocity, especially in the urban areas.																			1001-0742	1878-7320					2012	24	4					632	639		10.1016/S1001-0742(11)60805-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-0742(11)60805-X								22894097					WOS:000303297400009

Nowhere to hide: impact of a temperature-sensitive amphibian pathogen along an elevation gradient in the temperate zone	ECOSPHERE												Amphibians are rapidly disappearing from habitats around the world and a major cause of these declines is the amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis ("Bd"). The growth rate of Bd is strongly temperature-dependent, and in areas where temperatures are well outside the envelope in which Bd has high growth rates, amphibians may be afforded a refuge from the effects of Bd. This possibility has received considerable empirical support in hot climates, but remains largely untested in cold climates. We conducted a five-year study of the impact of Bd on the declining Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog (Rana sierrae) across an elevation/temperature gradient in Yosemite National Park using three approaches: (1) resurveys of all 285 R. sierrae populations to describe the landscape-scale patterns of Bd infection intensity, frog population size, and frog population persistence; (2) detailed description of seasonal patterns in temperatures and corresponding Bd infection intensities on R. sierrae; and (3) a frog translocation experiment in which infected R. sierrae from a single source lake were introduced into each of five lakes along an elevation gradient. We predicted that infection intensity should decrease with increasing elevation (i.e., decreasing temperature), and consequently frog survival, population size, and population persistence should increase with elevation. Results from resurveys indicated that frog population size increased with elevation but Bd infection intensity and frog population persistence were unrelated to elevation. Seasonal temperatures varied widely but had no significant effect on Bd infection intensity. Results from the translocation experiment indicated that Bd infection intensity and frog survival following translocation were also unrelated to water temperature. Therefore, contrary to the widely-accepted paradigm that cold environments should strongly limit effects of Bd on amphibians, we found little or no evidence of such limitation at even the highest elevations. Therefore, in temperate montane ecosystems it is unlikely that high elevations will provide amphibians with a refuge from Bd.

The late Pleistocene (20,000-12,000 C-14 years BP) was cold and dry, with (1) low lake levels in the Rift Valley, (2) large debris fans on the flanks of Lake Abhe basin, and (3) the Blue Nile transporting coarse bedload. Then, a period with abundant and less seasonal rains existed between 11,500 and 4800 C-14 years BP, as suggested by increased arboreal pollen, high river and lake levels, low river turbidities and soil formation. Around 5000-4800 C-14 years BP, there was a shift to more and conditions and more soil erosion. Many phenomena that were previously interpreted as climate-driven might, however, well be of anthropic origin. Thick sediment deposits on pediments as well as an increase of secondary forest, scrub and ruderal species in pollen diagrams are witnesses of this human impact. One important aspect of the late Quaternary palaeoenvironment is unclear: changes in Nile flow discharges and Rift Valley lake levels have been linked to changes in precipitation depth. Most authors do not take into account changes in land use in the highlands, nor changes in the seasonality of rain, both of which can lead to a change in runoff coefficients. Tufa and speleothem deposition around 14,000 years ago tend to indicate that at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), conditions might have been wetter than generally accepted. The most important present-day geomorphic processes are sheet and rill erosion throughout the country, gullying in the highlands, and wind erosion in the Rift Valley and the peripheral lowlands. Based on existing sediment yield data for catchments draining the central and northern Ethiopian highlands, an equation was developed allowing to assess area-specific sediment yields: SY = 2595A(-0.29) (n = 20; r(2) = 0.59) where SY = area-specific sediment yield (t km(-2) year(-1)), and A = drainage area (km(2)). With respect to recent environmental changes, temporal rain patterns, apart from the catastrophic impact of dry years on the degraded environment, cannot explain the current desertification in the driest parts of the country and the accompanying land degradation elsewhere. Causes are changing land use and land cover, which are expressions of human impact on the environment. Deforestation over the last 2000-3000 years was probably not a linear process in Ethiopia. Studies on land use and land cover change show, however, a tendency over the last decades of increasing removal of remnant vegetation, which is slowed down or reversed in northern Ethiopia by a set-aside policy. Ongoing land degradation requires urgent action at different levels of society. Soil and water conservation (SWC) structures are now widely implemented. Local knowledge and farmer's initiatives are integrated with introduced SWC techniques at various degrees. Impact assessments show clear benefits of the soil conservation measures in controlling runoff and soil erosion. In high rain areas, runoff management requires greater emphasis during the design of soil conservation structures. In such areas, investment in SWC might not be profitable at farm level, although benefits for society are positive. This pleads in favour of public support. The present land degradation in the Ethiopian highlands has a particular origin, which includes poverty and lack of agricultural intensification. Causes of these are to be found in the nature of past and present regional social relations as well as in international unequal development. This review strengthens our belief that, under improved socio-economic conditions, land husbandry can be made sustainable, leading to a reversal of the present desertification and land degradation of the Ethiopian highlands.

The potential precursors of perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) present in the water were converted via hydroxyl radical oxidation. Over 3 seasons, the average concentration ranges of the 15 PFAA ( n-ary sumation 15PFAA) concentrations in Nansi Lake, inflowing tributaries, and STPs were 22.8-70.3, 19.5-43.5, and 84.1-129 ng L-1, respectively. Per-fluorooctanoic acid, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and short-chain PFAA (perfluorocarboxlate acid <8, perfluorosulfonate acids <6) were present in high concentrations in the lake and tributaries. PFAA concentration was the lowest during the wet season and the highest during the dry season. Moreover, PFAA precursors were converted to perfluorocarboxlate acid. The concentration of C8-based precursors was higher than that of the C6 -based precursors in the lake and tributaries. The concentration of PFAA in the fish liver was higher than that in fish muscles, and PFOS was the dominant chemical present in fish. Potential risk assessment based on Envi-ronment Quality Standard revealed heavy PFOS contamination in the fish. Thus, the water of Nansi Lake was heavily polluted by PFAS.

A radar map of Titan Seas: Tidal dissipation and ocean mixing through the throat of Kraken	ICARUS												We present a radar map of the Titan's seas, with bathymetry estimated as proportional to distance from the nearest shore. This naive analytic bathymetry, scaled to a recent radar sounding of Ligeia Mare, suggests a total liquid volume of 32,000 km(3), at the low end of estimates made in 2008 when mapping coverage was incomplete. We note that Kraken Mare has two principal basins, separated by a narrow (similar to 17 km wide, similar to 40 km long) strait we refer to as the 'throat'. Tidal currents in this strait may be dramatic (similar to 0.5 m/s), generating observable effects such as dynamic topography, whirlpools, and acoustic noise, much like tidal races on Earth such as the Corryvreckan off Scotland. If tidal flow through this strait is the dominant mixing process, the two basins take 20 Earth years to exchange their liquid inventory. Thus compositional differences over seasonal timescales may exist, but the composition of solutes (and thus evaporites) over Croll-Milankovich timescales should be homogenized. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We provide summary statistics including number of evacuations and evacuees, evacuation duration, seasonality, evacuation causes, community types, structure losses, and fatalities. We also investigate temporal and spatial patterns.Key results Between 1980 and 2021, there were 1393 wildland fire evacuation events with 576,747 people evacuated. During this period, there was an overall increase in frequency of evacuations, number of evacuees, and duration of events. Structure loss occurred during 194 evacuation events, with 4105 homes burned. We estimate wildland fire evacuations cost at least CAD3.7 billion (excluding structural losses), jumping to CAD4.6 billion if we include productivity losses. Indigenous peoples are disproportionately impacted in wildfire evacuations compared to the general Canadian population.Conclusions Wildland fire evacuations continue to occur across Canada and are increasing.Implications The findings from this study give us a better understanding of the characteristics of wildland fire evacuations, which can help guide emergency management. This paper summarises data on wildland fire evacuations in Canada between 1980 and 2021.

Influenza causes significant morbidity among children. Previous studies used indirect case ascertainment methods with little cost data. We sought to measure the burden of laboratory-confirmed influenza from hospitalized children. METHODS. We conducted a retrospective cohort study during 3 viral seasons at Primary Children's Medical Center (Salt Lake City, UT). Children <= 18 years of age who were hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza infection were included. Outcomes included hospitalization rates, complications including intensive care unit stays, mechanical ventilation, length of stay, and total hospital costs. RESULTS. A total of 325 children had hospitalizations attributable to influenza over 3 viral seasons: 28% < 6 months of age, 33% between 6 and 23 months of age; and 39% < 2 years of age; 37% had high-risk medical conditions. Population-based rates of hospitalization for Salt Lake County residents ranged from 6.3 to 252.7 per 100 000 children. The highest rates were in children younger than 6 months, and rates decreased with increasing age. Forty- nine (15%) children had an ICU stay; 27 required mechanical ventilation, and half of these patients were > 2 years of age. Total hospital cost for the cohort was $ 2 million; 55% was accounted for by children > 2 years of age. Length of stay and total hospital costs were significantly higher in all children > 2 years of age compared with children < 6 months of age and were comparable to all children 6 to 23 months of age. CONCLUSIONS. Proven influenza infection in children results in substantial hospital resource utilization and morbidity. Nationwide, the median hospital costs may total $ 55 million. Our data support the Advisory Committee on Immunization's recommendations to expand the use of influenza vaccine to children > 2 years of age.					; Srivastava, Ruby/AAX-8343-2021; Kumar, Praveen/KHC-7586-2024	Byington, Carrie/0000-0002-7350-9495; Srivastava, Rajendu/0000-0003-0649-6222; 													0031-4005	1098-4275				DEC	2006	118	6					2409	2417		10.1542/peds.2006-1475	http://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.2006-1475								17142526					WOS:000242478900018

This study utilized eDNA metabarcoding to examine the seasonal and spatial distribution of phytoplankton and their relationship with environmental factors in the Chai River, Kunming, China, in the dry, and wet seasons. The process detected 108 genera of phytoplankton, which were members of 11 phyla, 41 orders, and 60 families. Distinct differences in seasonal and spatial distribution patterns of phytoplankton diversity, including community structure, alpha-diversity, and representative functional groups, were observed. In the dry season, Pseudanabaena, Microcystis, and Synechococcus were the predominant genera in Cyanophyta, and Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta and Euglenophyta were predominant in the eukaryotic phytoplankton. While in the wet season, Cylindrospermopsis, Microcystis, and Planktothrix predominated in the Cyanophyta, and Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta and Xanthophyta predominated in the eukaryotic phytoplankton. Significant differences were shown by a principal coordinate analysis and PERMANOVA test among the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the phytoplankton communities except for the cyanobacterial community structure between the upper and lower reaches at the wet season (p > 0.05). The representative functional groups of phytoplankton varied from A, D, E, LM, L0, N, S1, MP, P, TB, TC, U, W0, W1, Xph, Y, and Z in the dry season to A, B, D, E, F, J, MP, LM, S1, SN, TC, P, W0, W1, X2, and Y in the wet season. Significant differences in the water temperature (WT), pH, chemical oxygen demand, oxygen consumed, nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), and chlorophyll a were exhibited between the dry and wet seasons (p < 0.05). In the dry season, WT, NO3-N, and pH had a substantial influence on the functional groups LM, N, and L0 of the cyanobacteria. The EC and total nitrogen (TN) had a substantial influence on the functional groups A and Y of the eukaryotic phytoplankton. In the wet season, the electrical conductivity (EC), TN, and dissolvable total phosphorus (DTP) primarily affected the functional groups LM and S1, while EC, DPI, and soluble reactive phosphorus had a substantial influence on the functional groups A and Y. This study provides insights on the conservation of phytoplankton diversity and healthy management of the Chai River.

J	Shahbazi, S; Mousavi, Z; Rezaei, A				Shahbazi, Saeedeh; Mousavi, Zahra; Rezaei, Abolfazl			Constraints on the hydrogeological properties and land subsidence through GNSS and InSAR measurements and well data in Salmas plain, northwest of Urmia Lake, Iran	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data, along with exploration well data, are used to investigate elastic and inelastic land displacements across the Salmas plain, northwest Iran. GNSS measurements (2006-2012) show that the long-term and seasonal variability of the hydraulic head in the Salmas confined aquifer system (SCAS) control the vertical land deformation. A combination of drought and overextraction from SCAS led to significant changes in the head and land deformation after the 2006-2008 period. It was observed that the amplitude of the seasonal component of the hydraulic head and land-deformation time series increased about 2.5 times after this period. InSAR analysis over period 2014-2018 also revealed that the SCAS is prone to both long-term subsidence (average similar to 60 +/- 3 mm/year in the line-of-sight direction of the satellite) and seasonal elastic vertical deformation (similar to 60 mm). The seasonal elastic components of the vertical land deformations are used to precisely map the boundary of the SCAS. The average skeletal storativity of the SCAS is estimated to be similar to 0.028 and the time delay between the change in seasonal hydraulic head and its corresponding elastic deformation in the aquifer system is 0-150 days. The total groundwater storage variation of the aquifer system is computed to be similar to 18 million m(3) from 2015 to 2018. Furthermore, the irreversible component of groundwater storage variations associated with the dewatering of compacted aquitards is estimated to be similar to 2.33 times greater than its recoverable component from aquifer units.

J	Çelekli, A; Lekesiz, Ö				Celekli, Abuzer; Lekesiz, Omer			Limno-ecological assessment of lentic ecosystems in the western Mediterranean basin (Turkey) using phytoplankton indices	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Great attention has been given to freshwater ecosystems worldwide due to the increased exploitation of water resources and the degradation of water quality. This study was aimed to demonstrate the phytoplankton-stressor interactions using multivariate approaches and assess the ecological conditions of 28 sampling stations of 12 lentic ecosystems (five lakes and seven reservoirs) in the western Mediterranean basin using phytoplankton indices in dry and rainy seasons 2018. Freshwater and brackish water systems were separately ordinated by canonical correspondence analysis. The brackish ecosystems were under pressures of Ar (arsenic), N-NO2-(nitrite), Ca (calcium), EC (electrical conductivity), Cl (chloride), B (boron), etc., whereas shallow freshwater ecosystems were associated with total organic carbon. These factors had significant effects on phytoplankton distribution among lentic ecosystems on the basin. Ecological associations of phytoplankton assemblages varied in the western Mediterranean basin during the study.Pseudanabaena catenataandPalatinus apiculatus, considered tolerant taxa, are associated with higher Ar, EC, and V (vanadium) whileDesmodesmus abundansandMicrocystis flos-aquaeare related to total organic carbon. The modified PTI (phytoplankton trophic index) had the highest correlation coefficient value. Scores of the PTI varied from 2.02 in cavdir Reservoir to 2.59 in Lake Kocagol. Results of phytoplankton indices indicated that two (Golhisar and Yazir) lakes and two (Yaprakli and cavdir) reservoirs were classified as Good, and three lakes and five reservoirs were classified as Moderate condition. Other predicted classifications (high, poor, and bad) by phytoplankton metrics were not represented. The modified PTI could be a suitable phytoplankton metric for assessing the ecological status of lentic ecosystems in the Mediterranean system according to its highest correlation coefficient value. Overall, the results of this limno-ecological study demonstrated that responses of phytoplankton taxa to explanatory factors provide crucial ecological information about their ecology and to estimate the ecological status of lentic ecosystems.

Sheetflow fluvial processes in a rapidly subsiding basin, Altiplano plateau, Bolivia	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Although facies models of braided, meandering and anastomosing rivers have provided the cornerstones of fluvial sedimentology for several decades, the depositional processes and external controls on sheetflow fluvial systems remain poorly understood. Sheetflow fluvial systems represent a volumetrically significant part of the non-marine sedimentary record and documented here are the lithofacies, depositional processes and possible roles of rapid subsidence and arid climate in generating a sheetflow-dominated fluvial system in the Cenozoic hinterland of the central Andes. A 6500 m thick succession comprising the Late Eocene-Oligocene Potoco Formation is exposed continuously for > 100 km along the eastern limb of the Corque syncline in the high Altiplano plateau of Bolivia. Fluvial sandstone and mudstone units were deposited over an extensive region (> 10 000 km(2)) with remarkably few incised channels or stacked-channel complexes. The Potoco succession provides an exceptional example of rapid production of accommodation sustained over a prolonged period of time in a non-marine setting (> 0.45 mm year(-1) for 14 Myr). The lower approximate to 4000 m of the succession coarsens upward and consists of fine-grained to medium-grained sandstone, mudstone and gypsum deposits with palaeocurrent indicators demonstrating eastward transport. The upper 2500 m also coarsens upward, but contains mostly fine-grained to medium-grained sandstone that exhibits westward palaeoflow. Three facies associations were identified from the Potoco Formation and are interpreted to represent different depositional environments in a sheetflow-dominated system. (i) Playa lake deposits confined to the lower 750 m are composed of interbedded gypsum, gypsiferous mudstone and sandstone. (ii) Floodplain deposits occur throughout the succession and include laterally extensive (> 200 m) laminated to massive mudstone and horizontally stratified and ripple cross-stratified sandstone. Pedogenic alteration and root casts are common. (iii) Poorly confined channel and unconfined sheet sandstone deposits include laterally continuous beds (50 to > 200 m) that are defined primarily by horizontally stratified and ripple cross-stratified sandstone encased in mudstone-rich floodplain deposits. The ubiquitous thin-sheet geometry and spatial distribution of individual facies within channel sandstone and floodplain deposits suggest that confined to unconfined, episodic (flash) flood events were the primary mode of deposition. The laterally extensive deposition and possible distributary nature of this sheetflow-dominated system are attributed to fluvial fan conditions in an arid to semi-arid, possibly seasonal, environment. High rates of sediment accumulation and tectonic subsidence during early Andean orogenesis may have favoured the development and long-term maintenance of a sheetflow system rather than a braided, meandering or anastomosing fluvial style. It is suggested here that rapidly produced accommodation space and a relatively arid, seasonal climate are critical conditions promoting the generation of sheetflow-dominated fluvial systems.

Friendly competition: evidence for a dilution effect among competitors in a planktonic host-parasite system	ECOLOGY												The "dilution effect'' concept in disease ecology offers the intriguing possibility that clever manipulation of less competent hosts could reduce disease prevalence in populations of more competent hosts. The basic concept is straightforward: host species vary in suitability ( competence) for parasites, and disease transmission decreases when there are more incompetent hosts interacting with vectors or removing free-living stages of a parasite. However, host species also often interact with each other in other ecological ways, e. g., as competitors for resources. The net result of these simultaneous, multiple interactions ( disease dilution and resource competition) is challenging to predict. Nonetheless, we see the signature of both roles operating concurrently in a planktonic host-parasite system. We document pronounced spatiotemporal variation in the size of epidemics of a virulent fungus (Metschnikowia bicuspidata) in Midwestern U. S. lake populations of a dominant crustacean grazer ( Daphnia dentifera). We show that some of this variation is captured by changes in structure of Daphnia assemblages. Lake-years with smaller epidemics were characterized by assemblages dominated by less suitable hosts ("diluters,'' D. pulicaria and D. retrocurva, whose suitabilties were determined in lab experiments and field surveys) at the start of epidemics. Furthermore, within a season, less suitable hosts increased as epidemics declined. These observations are consistent with a dilution effect. However, more detailed time series analysis ( using multivariate autoregressive models) of three intensively sampled epidemics show the signature of a likely interaction between dilution and resource competition between these Daphnia species. The net outcome of this interaction likely promoted termination of these fungal outbreaks. Should this outcome always arise in "friendly competition'' systems where diluting hosts compete with more competent hosts? The answers to this question lie at a frontier of disease ecology.					; Duffy, Meghan/E-6867-2016; Simonis, Juniper/AAE-2410-2019	Simonis, Juniper/0000-0001-9798-0460; Duffy, Meghan/0000-0002-8142-0802													0012-9658	1939-9170				MAR	2009	90	3					791	801		10.1890/08-0838.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-0838.1								19341148					WOS:000263776800019
J	Grabas, GP; Fiorino, GE; Reinert, A				Grabas, Greg P.; Fiorino, Giuseppe E.; Reinert, Amy			Vegetation species richness is associated with daily water-level fluctuations in Lake Ontario coastal wetlands	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The effects of seasonal and multi-year water-level fluctuations on coastal wetland vegetation communities have been intensively studied in the Great Lakes, but there is relatively little information on how daily water-level fluctuations (driven by wind tides and seiches) influence them. We examined the relationship between daily water level fluctuation intensity and species richness for five vegetation guilds (i.e., submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), emergent, meadow marsh, shrub and upland) at 13 Lake Ontario wetlands sampled from 2010 to 2015. At each site, portable water-level loggers were used to determine the mean daily fluctuation intensity (range: 12.20-106.85 cm), and vegetation data were collected along an elevation gradient from 0.8 m below to 1.2 m above the long-term average shoreline. Linear mixed-effects models were fitted for each vegetation guild to assess the relationship between fluctuation intensity and species richness. We found an elevation-dependent relationship with fluctuation intensity for all guilds except SAV. Higher daily fluctuation intensity (i.e., more frequent significant changes in water levels) causes periodic de-watering of elevations below the shoreline and flooding of elevations above the shoreline which inhibits the establishment of shrub and upland species while maintaining rich emergent and meadow marsh communities. Increased emergent richness was evident at the 0.4 m, -0.2 m, 0 m, and +0.2 m depth and increased meadow marsh richness was evident at the +1.0 and +1.2 depth, whereas decreased richness was evident for shrubs at +0.4 and + 0.6 m and for upland vegetation at +0.4 m. Our results suggest that daily fluctuation intensity is an important factor influencing wetland vegetation community biodiversity.

In this study, the aim was to determine the dominant processes governing the total suspended solid (TSS) concentration at the water surface in Tonle Sap Lake, Cambodia, which is a large, shallow-water lake. Satellite remotely sensed daily reflectance data from 2003 to 2017 were used. Seasonal changes in TSS concentration indicated that bottom sediment resuspension during dry seasons was mostly caused by wind and the TSS concentration was closely correlated with the water depth of the lake. The TSS concentration during flood periods was controlled by both wind and inflow currents from the Tonle Sap River. Additionally, we confirmed that surface/subsurface flow with a low TSS concentration from forests on the floodplain lowered the TSS concentration year round, except during August and September. This fact implied that the floodplain forest area decrease may increase the lake TSS concentration. An analysis of the long-term changes in TSS indicated that a decrease in the water level during flood periods resulted in the high TSS concentrations observed during the subsequent dry periods. Therefore, climate change and water resource development, which are likely to cause water level reductions in the Mekong River during flood periods, may increase the TSS concentration in Tonle Sap Lake, particularly during the dry season.					; Hoshikawa, Keisuke/AAK-5162-2020; Fujihara, Yoichi/G-6724-2012; SOK, Ty/HKW-6412-2023	Fujihara, Yoichi/0000-0001-5129-5548; SOK, Ty/0000-0001-7185-698X; Nakamura, Takashi/0000-0003-3069-8879; Hoshikawa, Keisuke/0000-0002-7664-3956; 													0885-6087	1099-1085				OCT 15	2019	33	21					2745	2758		10.1002/hyp.13525	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.13525		AUG 2019											WOS:000479821800001

Predicting non-point source of pollution in Maithon reservoir using a semi-distributed hydrological model	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Non-point source (NPS) pollution has been emerged as a major cause for reduced water quality of a lake due to increased human interference and disturbances in the natural condition of the surrounding catchment. The impact is, even more, worsening in the monsoon season when there is increased surface runoff. In the present study, an attempt has been made to predict the seasonal (monsoon) NPS loading in terms of sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorous in Maithon reservoir using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrologic model. The SWAT model was initially calibrated using monthly runoff and sediment yield data of monsoon period for the year 1998-2005 using observed data of Rajdhanwar station followed by its validation for the observed monthly runoff and sediment data from Giridih and Santrabad for the same duration. The calibrated SWAT model was used to predict the sediment, total nitrogen, and phosphorous influx in the Maithon reservoir. It has been observed that average sediment yield from different micro-watersheds varies from 0.231 to 7.458 ton/ha, while average monthly nitrogen and phosphorous yields vary from 0.224 to 1.377 kg/ha and 0.073 to 0.363 kg/ha, respectively, during the monsoon period. On the other hand, the net monthly average sediment yield and total nitrogen and phosphorous yields in the reservoir were found to be 1.53 M ton, 1834.2 kg, 191.1 kg, respectively. The results indicate there is a substantial influx of nutrients and sediments into the Maithon reservoir. The study not only provides insights on the potential NPS pollutant loading in the reservoir but also enables to identify the hotspot of NPS pollution where immediate mitigation measures have to be taken at priority basis.

More than 216 taxa were observed, revealing a rich circumpolar diatom flora, including many undescribed taxa. Widely distributed taxa were the most abundant by cell densities, while circumpolar taxa were the most species rich. Stream and pond habitats hosted different assemblages, and varied along a pH gradient. Diatoma tennis was the most abundant and ubiquitous taxon. However, several circumpolar taxa such as Charnaepinnularia gandrupn, Cymbella botellus, Psammothidium sp. and Humidophila laevissima were also found in relatively high abundances. Aerophilic taxa were an important component of FJL diatom assemblages (Humidophila spp., Caloneis spp. and Pinnularia spp.), reflecting the large and extreme seasonal changes in Arctic conditions. We predict a decrease in the abundance of circumpolar taxa, an increase in local (alpha-) freshwater diatom diversity, but a decrease in regional diversity (circumpolar homogenization) as a result of current warming trends and to a lesser extent the increasing human, footprint in the region.

William			Late-Holocene floodplain development, land-use, and hydroclimate-flood relationships on the lower Ohio River, US	HOLOCENE												Floodplain development, land-use, and flooding on the lower Ohio River are investigated with a 3100-year-long sediment archive from Avery Lake, a swale lake on the Black Bottom floodplain in southern Illinois, US. In all, 12 radiocarbon dates show that Avery Lake formed at 1130 BCE (3100 cal. yr BP), almost 3000 years later than previously thought, indicating that the Black Bottom floodplain is younger and more dynamic than previously estimated. Three subsequent periods of extensive land clearance were identified by changes in pollen composition, corresponding to Native American occupations before 1500 CE and the current Euro-American occupation beginning in the 18th century. Sedimentation rates prior to 1820 CE changed independently of land clearance events, suggesting natural as opposed to land-use controls. Comparison with high-resolution paleoclimate data from Martin Lake, IN, indicates that lower Ohio River flooding was frequent when cold-season precipitation originating from the Pacific/Arctic predominated when atmospheric circulation resembled positive Pacific North American (PNA) conditions and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) was in a positive mean state (1130 BCE to 350 CE and 1150-1820 CE). Conversely, Ohio River flooding was less frequent when warm-season precipitation from the Gulf of Mexico prevailed during negative PDO- and PNA-like mean states (350 and 1150 CE). This flood dynamic appears to have been fundamentally altered after 1820 CE. We suggest that extensive land clearance in the Ohio River watershed increased runoff and landscape erosion by reducing interception, infiltration, and evapotranspiration, thereby increasing flooding despite a shift to negative PDO- and PNA-like mean states. Predicted increases in average precipitation and extreme rainfall events across the mid-continental US are likely to perpetuate current trends toward more frequent flood events, because anthropogenic modifications have made the landscape less resilient to changing hydroclimatic conditions.					; Gilhooly III, William/LBH-5383-2024	Gilhooly, William/0000-0002-5931-5571; Wilson, Jeremy/0000-0002-9968-438X; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				DEC	2019	29	12					1856	1870	0959683619865598	10.1177/0959683619865598	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683619865598		JUL 2019											WOS:000480093800001

To investigate how the dynamics of CDOM in Lake Taihu are influenced by upstream inflow runoff, four sampling cruises, differing in hydrological conditions, were undertaken in the lake and its three major tributaries, rivers Yincun, Dapu, and Changdou. CDOM absorption, fluorescence spectroscopy, chemical oxygen demand (COD), and stable isotope delta C-13 and delta N-15 measurements were conducted to characterize the dynamics of CDOM. The mean absorption coefficient a(350) collected from the three river profiles (5.15 +/- 1.92 m(-1)) was significantly higher than that of the lake (2.95 +/- 1.88 m(-1)), indicating that the upstream rivers carried a substantial load of CDOM to the lake. This finding was substantiated by the exclusively terrestrial signal exhibited by the level of delta C-13 (-26.23 +/- 0.49aEuro degrees) of CDOM samples collected from the rivers. Mean a(350) and COD in Lake Taihu were significantly higher in the wet season than in the dry season (t test, p < 0.0001), suggesting that the abundance of CDOM in the lake is strongly influenced by hydrological conditions of the watershed. Four components were identified by parallel factor analysis, including two protein-like components (C1 and C2), a terrestrial humic-like component (C3), and a microbial humic-like (C4) component. The contribution percentage of the two humic-like components relative to the summed fluorescence intensity of the four components (C (humic)) increased significantly from the dry to the wet season. This seasonal difference in contribution further substantiated that an enhanced rainfall followed by an elevated inflow runoff in the lake watershed in the wet season may result in an increase in humic-like substances being discharged into the lake compared to that in the dry season. This finding was further supported by an elevated a(250)/a(365) of CDOM samples collected in the lake in the wet season than in the dry season. Significantly higher mean levels of C3 and a(350) were recorded for CDOM samples collected from River Yincun than those from rivers Dapu and Changdou, differing in seasons, suggesting the significance of terrestrial CDOM input from River Yincun.

Patterns of Ecosystem Metabolism in the Tonle Sap Lake, Cambodia with Links to Capture Fisheries	PLOS ONE												The Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia is a dynamic flood-pulsed ecosystem that annually increases its surface area from roughly 2,500 km(2) to over 12,500 km(2) driven by seasonal flooding from the Mekong River. This flooding is thought to structure many of the critical ecological processes, including aquatic primary and secondary productivity. The lake also has a large fishery that supports the livelihoods of nearly 2 million people. We used a state-space oxygen mass balance model and continuous dissolved oxygen measurements from four locations to provide the first estimates of gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) for the Tonle Sap. GPP averaged 4.1 +/- 2.3 g O-2 m(-3) d(-1) with minimal differences among sites. There was a negative correlation between monthly GPP and lake level (r = 0.45) and positive correlation with turbidity (r = 0.65). ER averaged 24.9 +/- 20.0 g O-2 m(-3) d(-1) but had greater than six-fold variation among sites and minimal seasonal change. Repeated hypoxia was observed at most sampling sites along with persistent net heterotrophy (GPP < ER), indicating significant bacterial metabolism of organic matter that is likely incorporated into the larger food web. Using our measurements of GPP, we calibrated a hydrodynamic-productivity model and predicted aquatic net primary production (aNPP) of 2.0 +/- 0.2 g C m(-2) d(-1) (2.4 +/- 0.2 million tonnes C y(-1)). Considering a range of plausible values for the total fisheries catch, we estimate that fisheries harvest is an equivalent of 7-69% of total aNPP, which is substantially larger than global average for marine and freshwater systems. This is likely due to relatively efficient carbon transfer through the food web and support of fish production from terrestrial NPP. These analyses are an important first-step in quantifying the resource pathways that support this important ecosystem.

J	Daly, GL; Wania, F				Daly, GL; Wania, F			Organic contaminants in mountains	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The study of organic contaminants at high altitudes is motivated by the potential risk that they pose to humans living in, or depending on resources derived from, mountains, and to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in alpine areas. Mountains are also ideal settings to study contaminant transport and behavior along gradients of climate and surface cover. Information on organic contaminants in mountains is compiled from the literature and synthesized, with a focus on atmospheric transport and deposition, contaminant dynamics in alpine lakes and aquatic organisms, and concentration differences with altitude. Diurnal mountain winds, in connection with enhanced deposition at higher elevations caused by low temperatures and high precipitation rates, conspire to make mid-latitude mountains become convergence zones for selected persistent organic chemicals. In particular, the more volatile constituents of contaminant mixtures seem to become enriched, relative to the less volatile constituents at higher altitudes. For selected contaminants, concentration inversions (i.e., concentrations that increase with elevation) have been observed. A notable difference between cold trapping in high latitudes and high altitudes is the likely importance of precipitation. High rates of snow deposition in mid- and high-latitude mountains may lead to a large contaminant release during snowmelt. Regions above the tree line often have little capacity to retain the released contaminants, suggesting the potential for a highly dynamic contaminant fate situation during the snow-free season with significant revolatilization and runoff. The chemical and environmental factors that control the orographic cold trapping of organic contaminants should be examined further by measuring and comparatively interpreting concentration gradients along several mountain slopes with widely different characteristics.

We sampled 35 and 42 brackish lagoons (salinity ranging from 0.3 to 55 parts per thousand) in Mediterranean Catalonia (NE Spain) and northern-temperate Denmark, respectively. No significant differences were found in total crustacean zooplankton species richness or cladoceran richness between the climatic regions. Calanoid richness was higher in Denmark than in Catalonia, while cyclopoid richness was higher in Catalonia. Salinity was the most important variable associated with zooplankton species richness in both regions, richness of total zooplankton species, cladocerans and cyclopoids being negatively related with salinity. In both regions, a shift occurred from dominance of large filter feeding cladoceran species at low salinities to copepods and small cladoceran species at higher salinities. Cladoceran richness increased with increasing total phosphorus, but was not influenced by total nitrogen or chlorophyll-a. Trophic structure in Mediterranean brackish lagoons showed a more pronounced seasonal variation than in north temperate brackish lagoons. Our results imply that the indirect effects of climate warming, such as changes in salinity and hydrology, will have a larger impact on brackish lagoon ecosystems than the increase in temperature per se.

Variability of nutrients and phytoplankton biomass in a shallow brackish water ecosystem (Chilika Lagoon, India)	LIMNOLOGY												Seasonal and spatial variations in water quality parameters, such as nutrients [NH4 (+)-N, NO (2) (-) -N, NO (3) (-) -N, PO (4) (3-) -P, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP)], Secchi disc depth, salinity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a, primary productivity and phytoplankton standing stock, were studied in Chilika Lagoon (from 27 sampling locations) during 2001-2003 to assess the present ecological status. The study was undertaken after a major hydrological intervention in September 2000, which connected the lagoon body and the Bay of Bengal via a manmade opening (new mouth). Current and old data on water quality were also compared to establish the changes that had occurred after the hydrological intervention. Multivariate techniques and gridding methods were used to investigate the spatial and seasonal variability of the data and to characterize the trophic evolution of the basin. Results of principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the 27 stations can be classified into five groups based on similarities in the temporal variation of nutrients, chlorophyll a concentration, salinity, and other physicochemical parameters. The tributaries and the exchange of lagoon water with the Bay of Bengal most probably determine the water quality and the dynamics of the ecosystem. Hydrodynamics of the lagoon, weed coverage, input of urban sewage through tributaries and agricultural runoff are probably the key factors controlling the trophic conditions of the lagoon. An increase in salinity and total phosphorus was noted after the new mouth was opened, while the total suspended sediment load, the water column depth, and nitrogenous nutrients decreased. The new mouth opening also brought changes in the phytoplankton species composition.

J	Berthold, M; Paar, M				Berthold, Maximilian; Paar, Martin			Dynamics of primary productivity in relation to submerged vegetation of a shallow, eutrophic lagoon: A field and mesocosm study	PLOS ONE												Aquatic ecosystems nowadays are under constant pressure, either from recent or historical events. In most systems with increased nutrient supply, submerged macrophytes got replaced by another stable state, dominated by phytoplankton as main primary producer. Yet, reducing the nutrient supply did not yield the aimed goal of restored habitats for submerged macrophytes in systems worldwide. The question arises, why submerged macrophytes do not re-colonize, and if they are actually competitive. Therefore, primary production assays were conducted in ex-situ bentho-pelagic mesocosms and compared to the actual ecosystem, a turbid brackish lagoon of the southern Baltic Sea. Mesocosm were either manipulated to be colonized by macrophytes, or stayed phytoplankton dominated. Oxygen evolution was monitored over a period of five months in 5 min (mesocosms) to 10 min (ecosystem) intervals. Surface and depth-integrated production was calculated to analyse seasonal and areal resolved production patterns. It was found that macrophyte mesocosms were more stable, when considering only surface O-2 production. However, calculating depth-integrated production resulted in net-heterotrophy in both shallow mesocosms approaches and the actual ecosystem. This heterotrophy is likely mediated by sediment respiration and POC accumulation in mesocosms, and a low share of productive to respiring water column in the actual ecosystem. Therefore, it seems unlikely that macrophytes will re-settle, as constant net-heterotrophy may allow for high-nutrient turnover at sediment-water interfaces and within the water column, favouring phytoplankton. These results will assist decision makers in developing more effective restoration measures that can mitigate the negative effects of eutrophication on ecosystem function and services.					; Berthold, Maximilian/Q-3844-2019	Berthold, Maximilian/0000-0003-1985-6426; 													1932-6203					MAY 6	2021	16	5							e0247696	10.1371/journal.pone.0247696	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247696								33956797					WOS:000664611400008
J	Yu, K; Hu, CM				Yu, Kun; Hu, Chuanmin			Changes in vegetative coverage of the Hongze Lake national wetland nature reserve: a decade-long assessment using MODIS medium-resolution data	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												Wetlands are important ecosystems on Earth. However, global wetland coverage is being reduced due to both anthropogenic and natural effects. Thus, assessment of temporal changes in vegetative coverage, as a measure of the wetland health, is critical to help implement effective management plans and provide inputs for climate-related research. In this work, 596 moderate- resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250-m resolution images of the Hongze Lake national wetland nature reserve from 2000 to 2009 were used to study the vegetative coverage (above the water surface) of the reserve. Three vegetation indices [normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced VI (EVI), and floating algae index (FAI)] were compared to evaluate their effectiveness in assessing relative changes. FAI was less sensitive than NDVI and EVI to aerosol effects and showed less statistical error than NDVI and EVI. Longterm FAI data revealed clear seasonal cycles in vegetative coverage in the 113-km(2) core area of the reserve, with annual maximal coverage relatively stable after 2004. This suggests that the national wetland nature reserve was well protected through the study period. However, vegetative coverage decreased due to the flooding event in 2003. Moreover, correlation analysis showed that annual sunshine duration collectively played a significant role in affecting the wetland vegetative coverage. (c) The Authors.

J	Feyte, S; Gobeil, C; Tessier, A; Cossa, D				Feyte, Stephane; Gobeil, Charles; Tessier, Andre; Cossa, Daniel			Mercury dynamics in lake sediments	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Triplicate porewater depth-profiles of pH and concentrations of total Hg (Hg-T), methylmercury (MeHg), Fe, Mn, sulfate, total sulfide, total zero-valent sulfur, organic C and major ions were determined at two sampling dates in a perennially oxygenated basin and a seasonally anoxic basin from Lake Tantare, a Canadian Shield lake. The vertical distribution of Hg-T, MeHg, acid volatile sulfide, total S, Fe, Mn, Al and organic C were also determined in dated sediment cores from the same lake basins and from the deepest site of two other lakes, one also located in the Canadian Shield and the other in the Northeastern part of the Appalachian Mountains. Application of a one-dimensional transport-reaction equation to the dissolved Hg-T and MeHg profiles constrains the depth intervals (zones) where these species are produced or consumed in the sedimentary column and yields estimates of net reaction rates of Hg-T or MeHg in each of the zones as well as their fluxes at the sediment-water interface. Dissolved Hg-T and MeHg diffused from the overlying water into the sediments, except for MeHg at one of the sampling dates in the perennially oxygenated basin. About 97% and 50% of the MeHg flux to the sediments is presently deposited with settling particles in the perennially oxygenated and seasonally anoxic basins, respectively. Removal of porewater Hg-T and MeHg occurred at all dates and sampling sites. Comparison of the consumption zones of porewater Hg-T and MeHg with the profiles of ancillary parameters, coupled with thermodynamic calculations, suggest that pure Hg mineral phases do not form in the sediments, that Hg-T and MeHg adsorption onto authigenic Fe oxyhydroxides occurs in minor proportions, and that the association of Hg-T and MeHg to Fe sulfide phases or sulfidized organic matter is possible. Assuming that the net consumption of MeHg in the porewaters was essentially due to demethylation, an apparent first-order rate constant for MeHg demethylation of 0.04-0.8 d(-1) was estimated. Production of porewater MeHg occurred only in the perennially oxygenated basin, at sediment depths where SO4 was consumed. Assuming that the net production of porewater MeHg was essentially due to methylation, an apparent first-order rate constant for Hg methylation ranging between 0.006 d(-1) and 0.1 d(-1) was calculated. These field-derived Hg methylation and MeHg demethylation rate constant values are within the range of those derived from Hg-spiked experiments. We also show that the post-depositional redistribution of total Hg during the early stages of sediment diagenesis is minor and that the solid-phase Hg-T record can be used to reconstruct the evolution of the anthropogenic Hg-T deposition.

Cladophora is distributed throughout Mikata-goko, an area consisting of five coastal lakes that are directly or indirectly connected to the sea, resulting in a salinity gradient ranging from fully marine to freshwater. To elucidate genetic and ecological variation in Cladophora, we monthly compared ribosomal internal transcribed spacer sequences of Cladophora specimens across six study sites characterized by different salinity regimes for a year. A total of 12 ribotypes were detected and assigned to six species, four of which were restricted to the marine habitat. Ribotype I of C. vagabunda (L.) Hoek was distributed in high-salinity brackish waters (mean salinity =13 psu; maximum salinity =31 psu), whereas C. vagabunda ribotype II and C. glomerata were abundant in low-salinity brackish waters (mean salinity =5 psu; maximum salinity =10 psu). Although Cladophora albida (Nees) Kutz. and C. glomerata (L.) Kutz. were collected during all four seasons, C. laetevirens (Dillwyn) Kutz., C. oligocladoidea Hoek and Chihara, C. opaca Sakai and C. vagabunda displayed marked seasonal variation. Culture experiments revealed that optimal salinity conditions for vegetative growth vary among ribotypes collected from different salinity regimes, suggesting that Cladophora distributions are controlled by ribotype-specific ecophysiological adaptations. In contrast, temperature optima and tolerance were similar among ribotypes showing different seasonalities, and thus their phenologies may be controlled by other environmental factors or biotic conditions, such as reproductive maturity and spore germination.

Impact of land use on surface water quality: a case study of active agriculturally disturbed basin in China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Nitrogen and phosphorus pollution caused by land use seriously threatens the surface water ecosystem. However, the relationship between surface water quality and land use remains obscure in multiple spatiotemporal scales. The spatiotemporal variation characteristics of the eutrophication degree were discussed via the in situ investigation, and the effects of land use on water quality were quantitatively studied through correlation analysis and redundancy analysis in the Honghu Lake Basin, a typical active agriculturally disturbed basin. Results show that the water quality of the entire basin has suffered from serious nitrogen (with the total nitrogen ranging from 1.90 to 11.72 mg/L in the dry season and 1.07-9.24 mg/L in the rainy season) and phosphorus (with the total phosphorus ranging from 0.07 to 1.78 mg/L in the dry season and 0.02-0.56 mg/L in the rainy season) pollution. Seasonally, the nutrient concentration in dry the season are approximately 14-46% higher than those in the rainy season, and the nutrient concentration upstream is higher in spatial distribution. Correlation analysis indicates that forest and wetland were negatively correlated with nutrient concentrations, while cultivated land and residence community were positively correlated with nutrient concentrations. Redundancy analysis shows that the spatial variation of the water quality is best explained at a small scale (1000 m buffer) and in the rainy season (55%). Our study can provide a strategy for land use planning for water quality management and protection in a typical agriculturally disturbed basin, like the Honghu Lake basin.					; Wang, Zhi/W-5911-2019	wang, zhi/0000-0002-6832-7013; 													1735-1472	1735-2630				MAY	2022	19	5					4435	4446		10.1007/s13762-021-03363-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-021-03363-6		MAY 2021											WOS:000647553400006
J	Kakouei, K; Kraemer, BM; Adrian, R				Kakouei, Karan; Kraemer, Benjamin M.; Adrian, Rita			Variation in the predictability of lake plankton metric types	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Statistical and climate models are frequently used for biodiversity projections under future climatic changes, but their predictive capacity for freshwater plankton may vary among different species and community metrics. Here, we used random forests to model plankton species and community metrics as a function of biological, climatic, physical, and chemical data from long-term (2000-2017) monitoring data collected from Lake Muggelsee Berlin, Germany. We (1) compared the predictability of well-known lake plankton metric types (biomass, abundance, taxonomic diversity, Shannon diversity, Simpson diversity, evenness, taxonomic distinctness, and taxonomic richness) and (2) assessed how the relative influence of different environmental drivers varies across lake plankton metric models. Overall, the metric predictability was highest for biomass and abundance followed by taxonomic richness. The biomass of dominant phytoplankton taxonomic groups such as cyanobacteria (adjusted-R-2 = 0.53) and the abundance of dominant zooplankton taxonomic groups such as rotifers (adjusted-R-2 = 0.59) and daphnids (adjusted-R-2 = 0.51) were more predictable than other metric types. The plankton metric predictability increased when grouping phytoplankton species according to their functional traits (adjusted-R-2 = 0.37 +/- 0.14, mean +/- SD, n = 36 functional groups) compared to higher taxonomic units (adjusted-R-2 = 0.25 +/- 0.15, n = 22 taxonomic groups). Light, nutrients, water temperature, and seasonality for phytoplankton and food resources for zooplankton were the main drivers of both taxonomic and functional groups, giving confidence that our models captured the expected major environmental drivers. Our quantitative analyses highlight the multidimensionality of lake planktonic responses to environmental drivers and have implications for our capacity to select appropriate metrics for forecasting the future of lake ecosystems under global change scenarios.

While distance sampling theory provides a robust framework for estimating animal abundance, implementing a constrained, non-systematic transect design could bias density estimates. Here, we assessed potential bias associated with line distance sampling surveys along roads based on a case study with olive baboons (Papio anubis) in Lake Manyara National Park (Tanzania). This was achieved by comparing density estimates of olive baboons derived from road transect surveys with density estimates derived from estimating the maximum number of social groups (via sleeping site counts) and multiplying this metric with the estimated average size of social groups. From 2011 to 2019, we counted olive baboons along road transects, estimated survey-specific densities in a distance sampling framework, and assessed temporal population trends. Based on the fitted half-normal detection function, the mean density was 132.5 baboons km(-2) (95% CI: 110.4-159.2), however, detection models did not fit well due to heaping of sightings on and near the transects. Density estimates were associated with relatively wide confidence intervals that were mostly caused by encounter rate variance. Based on a generalized additive model, baboon densities were greater during the rainy seasons compared to the dry seasons but did not show marked annual trends. Compared to estimates derived from the alternative method (sleeping site survey), distance sampling along road transects overestimated the abundance of baboons more than threefold. Possibly, this overestimation was caused by the preferred use of roads by baboons. While being a frequently used technique (due to its relative ease of implementation compared to spatially randomized survey techniques), inferring population density of baboons (and possibly other species) based on road transects should be treated with caution. Beyond these methodological concerns and considering only the most conservative estimates, baboon densities in LMNP are among the highest across their geographic distribution range.					; Kiffner, Christian/F-4088-2012; Knauf, Sascha/F-1661-2017	Zinner, Dietmar/0000-0003-3967-8014; Kiffner, Christian/0000-0002-7475-9023													1932-6203					FEB 2	2022	17	2							e0263314	10.1371/journal.pone.0263314	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263314								35108346					WOS:000775890100056

Experimental constraints on the composition and dynamics of Titan's polar lakes	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Titan's polar lakes are thought to be predominantly composed of liquid ethane and methane; however, little is known on the ratio of these hydrocarbons in the lakes, and the stability and dynamics of these mixtures. Here we provide the first experimental constraints under Titan surface conditions of liquid hydrocarbon mixture evaporation. Our results are relevant to Titan's polar temperatures and pressures (similar to 92 K and 1.5 bar), and cover a wide range of methane-ethane compositions. We show that evaporation is negligible for pure ethane, but increases nearly linearly with increasing methane concentration. Early dissolution of N-2 results in ternary mixtures evaporating, which is modeled by a 'hybrid' thermodynamic equilibrium approach combining Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory with a diffusion and buoyancy-driven mass flux model. The approach follows the experimental evaporation rate measurements presented in this study, and allows for the calculation of the corresponding liquid methane-ethane-nitrogen ratios. Such results along with Cassini inferred lake evaporation rates can be used to estimate the composition of Titan's polar liquids, and may have implications on their origin. Our results suggest that Ontario Lacus is predominantly composed of ethane (>50-80 mol%), indicating it may be a residual lake following extensive seasonal methane evaporation, and/or might be in contact with a subsurface liquid reservoir.

Food quality mediated constraints on Daphnia performance were assessed by comparing somatic growth rates with seston characteristics (multiple regression analysis) and by manipulating the elemental and biochemical composition of natural seston experimentally (nutrient supplementation). Results were compared to similar experiments carried out previously (1997) during a mesotrophic phase of the lake. In the oligotrophic phase, particulate carbon and phosphorus concentrations were lower, fatty acid concentrations were higher, and the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton was less diverse, with a more diatom- and cryptophytes-dominated community, compared to the previous mesotrophic phase. Multiple regression analysis indicated a shift from a simultaneous limitation by food quantity (in terms of carbon) and quality (i.e. a-linolenic acid) during the mesotrophic phase to a complex multiple nutrient limitation mediated by food quantity, phosphorus, and omega-3 fatty acids in the following oligotrophic phase. The concomitant supplementation experiments also revealed seasonal changes in multiple resource limitations, i.e. the prevalent limitation by food quantity was accompanied by a simultaneous limitation by either phosphorus or omega-3 fatty acids, and thus confirmed and complemented the multiple regression approach. Our results indicate that seasonal and annual changes in nutrient availabilities can create complex co-limitation scenarios consumers have to cope with, which consequently may also affect the efficiency of energy transfer in food webs.					; Martin-Creuzburg, Dominik/C-6361-2011; Wacker, Alexander/I-8277-2012	Wacker, Alexander/0000-0001-9687-6477; Martin-Creuzburg, Dominik/0000-0002-4248-0730; 													0030-1299	1600-0706				OCT	2012	121	10					1702	1712		10.1111/j.1600-0706.2011.20461.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2011.20461.x													WOS:000308634600020
J	Steinsberger, T; Wüest, A; Müller, B				Steinsberger, Thomas; Wueest, Alfred; Mueller, Beat			Net Ecosystem Production of Lakes Estimated From Hypolimnetic Organic Carbon Sinks	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												This study presents a novel concept for estimating net ecosystem production (NEP), the export of organic carbon (OC) from the productive surface layer to the deep-water (hypolimnion) of 11 seasonally stratified lakes, varying in depth and trophic state. As oxygen remineralizes settling OC at a constant ratio, NEP is equivalent to the areal hypolimnetic mineralization rate (AHM) plus burial in the sediment. Two major interferences have to be considered, however. First, OC from terrestrial sources, not originating from primary production, consumes a fraction of oxidants. Second, sediment diagenetic processes of lakes in trophic transition (e.g., undergoing eutrophication or reoligotrophication) that are not in quasi-steady-state with actual fluxes of OC from the productive surface layer, bias the NEP estimation. In these cases, the flux of reduced substances diffusing from the sediment must be subtracted. This results in some overestimation for lakes with high allochthonous loads, and slight underestimation in lakes that are not in quasi-steady-state, because the actual sediment burial of autochthonous OC is small but not negligible. The presented approach requires data from routinely available monitoring and thus can be applied to historic data. The temporal integration over the productive season makes the estimation of NEP robust. Based on a historic 47 years long data record of Lake Geneva, NEP estimations (similar to 70 gC m(-2)) from AHM rates agree well with P and N export budgets from the productive surface zone, which help to verify and constrain the uncertainty of the estimates.

High Hg concentrations have previously been measured in Amazonian waterbodies, both resulting from natural and anthropogenic sources. However, few studies have been conducted so far in Amazonian lakes that are fished by local populations. In addition, few of those studies included methylmercury (MeHg), the most toxic and bioaccumulative Hg form, and evaluated the influence of physico-chemical conditions and season on Hg dynamics. In the present study, total Hg (THg) and MeHg concentrations were measured in bottom sediment as well as in two fish and two crocodile species of the Amazonian Cunia Lake. Bottom sediment MeHg concentrations were higher in the dry season than in the wet season, which is related to differences in physico-chemical (pH and electrical conductivity) conditions. Diet appeared to be related with animal tissue MeHg concentrations, with the herbivorous fish having lower MeHg levels than the predatory fish and crocodiles. Based on the measured tissue concentrations and published data on local person weight and fish consumption, MeHg risk to Cunia Lake populations was estimated. Although the MeHg fish tissue concentrations did not exceed national and international standards, a significant risk to the local population is anticipated due to their high fish consumption rates.

Samples from 62 groundwater wells consisting of shallow wells (hand dug, depth <10 m) and boreholes (machine drilled, depth >15 m) were obtained during wet (May-July 2017) and dry (February 2018) seasons and analyzed for physicochemical and isotopic (delta N-15-NO3-, delta O-18-NO3-, and delta B-11) parameters. Groundwater NO3- concentrations ranged from <0.04 to 90.6 mg L-1. Boreholes in Ahero town showed significantly higher NO3- (20.0-70.0 mg L-1) than boreholes in the Kano plains (<10.0 mg L-1). Shallow wells in Kisumu gave significantly higher NO3- (11.4-90.6 mg L-1) than those in the Kano plains (<10.0 mg L-1). About 63% of the boreholes and 75% of the shallow wells exceeded the drinking water WHO threshold for NO3- and NO2- (nitrite) during the study period. Mean delta N-15-NO3- values of 14.8 parts per thousand +/- 7.0 parts per thousand and 20.7 parts per thousand +/- 11.1 parts per thousand, and delta O-18-NO3- values of 10.2 parts per thousand +/- 5.2 parts per thousand and 13.2 parts per thousand +/- 6.0 parts per thousand in wet and dry seasons, respectively, indicated manure and/or sewage as main sources of groundwater NO3-. However, a concurrent enrichment of delta N-15 and delta O-18 was observed, especially in the dry season, with a corresponding NO3- decrease, indicating in situ denitrification. In addition, partial nitrification of mostly sewage derived NH4+ appeared to be responsible for increased NO2- concentrations observed in the dry season. Specifically, targeted delta B-11 data indicated that sewage was the main source of groundwater NO3- pollution in shallow wells within Kisumu informal settlements, boreholes in Ahero, and public institutions in populated neighborhoods of Kano; while manure was the main source of NO3- in boreholes and shallow wells in the Kano and planned estates around Kisumu. Waste-water sanitation systems in the region should be urgently improved to avoid further deterioration of groundwater sources.					; Boeckx, Pascal/J-3668-2013; Mureithi, Stephen M./H-3609-2019; Mureithi, Stephen/H-3609-2019	Nyilitya, Benjamin/0000-0002-2796-1886; Boeckx, Pascal/0000-0003-3998-0010; Mureithi, Stephen M./0000-0002-2616-6995; 														2073-4441				FEB	2020	12	2							401	10.3390/w12020401	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12020401													WOS:000519846500092

A study of fourteen (sub)tropical Chinese reservoirs with contrasting nutrient concentrations	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Stocking of filter-feeding fish is a common tool used in Chinese reservoirs to increase fish production because of low natural recruitment. Whether such stocking has important negative effects on zooplankton with cascading effects on phytoplankton is debated. We compared the zooplankton communities in fourteen reservoirs with different nutrient concentrations and fish densities. Both chlorophyll a (Chla) and fish catch were positively related with total phosphorus (TP), whereas zooplankton biomass did not show a similar relationship with TP. Zooplankton seemed to be influenced by fish as high fish catches coincided with a low proportion of calanoids of the total copepod biomass, a high proportion of rotifers of the total zooplankton biomass, a low zooplankton:phytoplankton biomass ratio, and the absence of Daphnia irrespective of TP concentration. Both zooplankton biomass and most of the zooplankton:phytoplankton biomass ratios were among the lowest reported in the literature for the nutrient range studied. Furthermore, the Chla:TP ratio was higher than what is typically observed in temperate lakes. We conclude that top-down control of zooplankton is of key importance in reservoirs in South China where frequent stocking of filter-feeding fish seems to contribute to poor water quality in the form of higher algal biomass and reduced clarity.

Open-loop direct surface water cooling and surface water heat pump systems - A review	HVAC&R RESEARCH												Direct surface water cooling systems utilize lake or seawater to provide cooling for buildings or district cooling systems, without using a heat pump to lower the temperature further. Surface water heat pump systems can provide heating and/or cooling for buildings and district heating/cooling systems, using lake or seawater as their heat source/sink. These systems have been used from the 1940s, yet neither design guidelines nor energy calculation procedures have been developed. Under the right circumstances, direct surface water cooling systems can have remarkably high seasonal system coefficients of performanceas high as 25. Surface water heat pump systems can also have high seasonal system coefficients of performance; values as high as 4.2 for cooling and 4.0 for heating have been reported. The performance of both system types will depend heavily on the pumping/piping system design. This article reviews the available literature describing previously installed systems and the necessary componentsintake devices, piping, pumps, heat exchangers, heat pumps and/or chillers, and outfall devices.

However, the pollution status of pond system around Poyang Lake was seldom studied. Here, we investigated the water and sediment chemical characteristics, phytoplankton and benthic macroinvertebrates, as well as habitat conditions of 23 rural ponds around Poyang Lake. Results showed that water quality of 91.3% rural ponds was inferior V (National Surface Water Environmental Quality Standard of China) with the main pollutants of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). In rural ponds, fifty-nine species of phytoplankton and nineteen benthic macroinvertebrates were identified, Cyanophyta and Chlorophyta were the dominant phytoplankton groups, and oligochaetes and aquatic insects were the most dominant taxa among all benthic macroinvertebrates. And an integrated evaluation system based on chemical, biological and physical index was set up to assess the pollution status of rural ponds. According to the composite integrity index, 2 rural ponds (8.70%) were classified as Very poor, 9 rural ponds (39.13%) were classified as Poor, 9 rural ponds (39.13%) were classified as Fair, and 3 rural ponds (13.04%) were classified as Good. And the composite integrity index in 4 counties followed the sequence of Xingzi County (0.598, Fair) > Jinxian County (0.425, Fair) > Xinjian County (0.379, Poor) > Nanchang County (0.335, Poor). Therefore, measures should be taken for improving the water quality, habitat conditions and biotic community of rural ponds, especially for the severely polluted rural ponds in Xinjian and Nanchang County.					he, feng/HOF-1989-2023														1386-2588	1573-5125				SEP	2022	56	3					775	791		10.1007/s10452-021-09931-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-021-09931-9		JAN 2022											WOS:000748159200001
J	Bolpagni, R				Bolpagni, Rossano			Linking vegetation patterns, wetlands conservation, and ecosystem services provision: From publication to application	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												Natural wetlands emerge as the best sites to preserve the diversity of aquatic and riparian vegetation; however, especially in the lowlands, pristine wetlands and aquatic ecosystems have almost completely disappeared through land reclamation and agricultural development. Actions are needed, therefore, to maintain and recreate a wide network of wetlands able to preserve adequate levels of vegetation diversity. Focusing on a complex wetland system located in an overexploited plain, the article entitled 'The importance of being natural in a human-altered riverscape: Role of wetland type in supporting habitat heterogeneity and the functional diversity of vegetation', published in 2016 inAquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems(AQC) explored the role of wetland origin and hydrology as the main drivers of physical and vegetation functional diversity, following a hierarchical sampling approach. The main results reinforced the key contribution of natural sites in maintaining vegetation diversity in heavily impaired riverine contexts, suggesting a direct effect of the interannual and seasonal dynamics of water-level variations in the observed vegetation patterns. The article offered an important contribution to our knowledge of vegetation patterns in wetlands, partly attributed to the innovative functional, hierarchical approach applied which is able to guarantee reliable data on the distribution patterns of physical heterogeneity and wetland vegetation. The findings of the article have been applied and adopted in a series of technical handbooks designed, inter alia, to support the monitoring programmes of habitats of community interest or vegetation of relevance for aquatic biodiversity conservation. In addition, this article has helped to raise awareness of the essential roles played by wetlands in agricultural landscapes and has emphasized the need for a better synergy between the European Habitats Directive and the Water Framework Directive. Several ecological recovery projects have been funded in line with the results described in theAQCarticle.

Source-controlled carbonate deposits are widely distributed in the Es-3(L) unit of the Shulu Sag and display strong vertical and horizontal variations in lithofacies, geochemical, and reservoir characteristics. Based on core data, thin-section petrography, stable delta C-13 isotope analyses, and organic geochemistry data, eight lithofacies with distinctly different characteristics and origins are identified. Clast-supported terrigenous carbonate rudstone and matrix-supported terrigenous carbonate rudstone were sourced from the surrounding Cambrian-Ordovician carbonate bedrocks and are widely distributed at the edge of the sag in fan delta environments. Some of the rudstones were transported from the littoral zone to profundal zone by slide and slump processes. Mixed-source rudstone was mainly deposited by sandy debris flow. Carbonate lithic sandstone and carbonate lithic siltstone were mainly formed by turbidity current deposition in a sublacustrine setting. Irregular-laminated marlstone was mainly formed by muddy turbidity currents, and massive marlstone was formed by turbid clouds in a relatively turbulent deep water environment. Regular-laminated marlstone is thought formed by seasonal laminae due to seasonal variations by suspension settling in the anoxic deep, quiet lake environment. Calcareous mudstone possibly formed by shallow lake gravity flow in a shallow lake environment. Various of pores have been identified in the Es-3(L) rocks: pores and cracks inside gravels, seams around gravels, intergranular pores, intercrystalline pores, intragranular pores, dissolution pores, organic matter pores, fractures and fracture-related pores. Different lithofacies have different space types, porosities and permeability. Clast-supported terrigenous carbonate rudstone has the best reservoir qualities, with the highest porosity and permeability. Laminated marlstone is the second best reservoir type. These two lithofacies can be the target for tight oil exploration in the study area.																			0920-4105	1873-4715				SEP	2020	192								107180	10.1016/j.petrol.2020.107180	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petrol.2020.107180													WOS:000575129700004

The influences of WLFs have been well studied for many lake biotas but the microeukaryotic community remains one of the least-explored features. This study employed high-throughput 18S rRNA gene sequencing to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of microeukaryotic communities in the dry and wet seasons with concomitant change of nutrients in Poyang Lake, which experiences huge seasonal WLFs. The results showed that the dry season and wet season had distinct microeukaryotic community compositions and structures. In the dry season, Ciliophora (13.86-40.98%) and Cryptomonas (3.69-18.64%) were the dominant taxa, and the relative abundance of these taxa were significant higher in the dry season than wet season. Ochrophyta (6.88-45.67%) and Chlorophyta (6.31-22.10%) was the dominant taxa of microeukaryotic communities in the wet season. The seasonal variation of microeukaryotic communities was strongly correlated to seasonal nutrient variations. Microeukaryotic communities responded significantly to dissolved organic carbon, total nitrogen, nitrate, and soluble reactive phosphorus in the dry season, and correlated to nitrate and total phosphorus in the wet season. The microeukaryotic community showed different modular structures in two seasons, and nutrient variations were the key factors influencing seasonal variations of the modular structures. Moreover, microeukaryotic community networks based on different seasons indicated that the microeukaryotic community co-occurrence patterns were not constant but varied largely associating with the nitrogen and phosphorus variations under the effects of WLFs. Our results are important for understanding how microeukaryotic communities respond to nutrient variation under seasonal water level fluctuation.					; Ren, Ze/AAB-2920-2019	QU, Xiaodong/0000-0002-4090-4982; Liu, Yang/0000-0001-8959-1529; Ren, Ze/0000-0002-1473-2697; 														2073-4441				SEP	2020	12	9							2317	10.3390/w12092317	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12092317													WOS:000580166700001

Fisheries of the Cambodian Mekong are characterized by high diversity and productivity. However, few studies have focused on broad scale patterns and fish assemblage structure of this important system at a national level. Here, we describe spatial and seasonal variation in fish assemblages by analyzing one year of daily fish catch data sampled at 32 sites covering Cambodia's main inland water bodies. We recorded 125 fish species. Four clusters were distinguished based on assemblage composition similarity, and 95 indicator species were identified to characterize each of the identified assemblage clusters. High diversity fish assemblages were associated with the upper Mekong system and Mekong/Bassac/Tonle Sap Rivers in Kandal Province and southern Tonle Sap Lake while lower diversity assemblages were observed in the Mekong River in Kratie and the northern area of the Tonle Sap Lake. We find significant variation in the assemblage composition between wet and dry seasons, indicating strong seasonal species turnover within clusters. Length-weight relationship analysis indicated a negative allometric growth among a majority of indicator species, reflecting suboptimal conditions for growth. Our study establishes contemporary structure and diversity patterns in the Lower Mekong River system of Cambodia, which can be used to map fish biodiversity hotspots and assess key indicative fish stocks' statuses for conservation and management.

Results indicate most of the aquatic products from the three large lakes seem to be unsafe for human consumption due to microcystin accumulations, with the estimated daily intake (EDI) values 5-148 times, 2-50 times and 1.5-4 times higher than the tolerable daily intake (TDI) value in Taihu, Chaohu and Dianchi, respectively. In addition, the toxin accumulation in the harvested organisms varied intensity from month to month and by species which suggests that consumption risks may be reduced or avoided by either adjusting the legal fishing seasons or the species of fish and shellfish harvested. This study will provide new information about the risks associated with the consumption of aquatic products and suggests possible management strategies to reduce or avoid potential health risks.

The aim of the present study was to assess the spatial and temporal (long-term and seasonal) variability of the physico-chemical and organic water parameters in the headwaters of the Krka River and its tributaries, as representatives of a typical karst ecosystem, situated in one of the largest karst areas in Europe, Dinarides in Croatia. It is affected in its upper reaches by improperly treated wastewaters, so anthropogenic influences and ecological status were estimated with the aim to present consequences of pollution exposure and importance of strict monitoring of such sensitive karst ecosystems worldwide. Results indicated degraded water quality, poor ecological status, and disturbed seasonal fluctuations at wastewater-influenced sites, primarily due to high levels of nutrients and organic matter. However, improvement was observed downstream in the Krka National Park, confirming the self-purification as important processes in dynamic karst rivers. Natural seasonality, observed at sites without wastewater influence, was mainly driven by fluctuations in water levels and primary production during the year. Literature analysis by CiteSpace pointed to scarce data on this topic worldwide (China and the USA account for 49% of all publications) and in Europe (34%). Therefore, such study is a valuable contribution in presenting the long-term and seasonal variability of ecological water parameters and in providing a more comprehensive understanding of the health of catchment under influence of multiple stressors.					; Valić, Damir/AAJ-1602-2021; Marijić, Vlatka/AAE-5365-2021; Redžović, Zuzana/JGL-9328-2023; Kralj, Tomislav/KFS-4889-2024; Mijošek, Tatjana/JCD-8782-2023; Cvetkovic, Zelimira/JMC-7102-2023	Mijosek Pavin, Tatjana/0000-0001-7336-2086; Filipovic Marijic, Vlatka/0000-0003-0581-6511; Cvetkovic, Zelimira/0000-0003-2537-0916; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2024	31	3					3887	3901		10.1007/s11356-023-31418-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-023-31418-3		DEC 2023						38097833					WOS:001125962400007

In order to assess the spatial and temporal extent of gyres and eddies, their dynamics and vertical structure, as well as to validate their prediction in numerical simulation results, detailed transect field observations are needed. However, at present it is difficult to forecast when and where such transect field observations should be taken. To overcome this problem, a novel procedure combining 3D numerical simulations, statistical analyses, and remote sensing data was developed that permits determination of the spatial and temporal patterns of basin-scale gyres during different seasons. The proposed gyre identification procedure consists of four steps: (i) data pre-processing, (ii) extracting dominant patterns using empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of Okubo-Weiss parameter fields, (iii) defining the 3D structure of the gyre, and (iv) finding the correlation between the dominant gyre pattern and environmental forcing. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed procedure was validated in Lake Geneva. For the first time in a lake, detailed field evidence of the existence of basin-scale gyres and (sub)mesoscale eddies was provided by data collected along transects whose locations were predetermined by the proposed procedure. The close correspondence between field observations and detailed numerical results further confirmed the validity of the model for capturing large-scale current circulations as well as (sub)mesoscale eddies. The results also indicated that the horizontal gyre motion is mainly determined by wind stress, whereas the vertical current structure, which is influenced by the gyre flow field, primarily depends on thermocline depth and strength. The procedure can be applied to other large lakes and can be extended to the interaction of biological-chemical-physical processes.					; Soulignac, Frédéric/MZQ-7046-2025; Barry, David/C-6077-2008; Barry, D./C-6077-2008	Soulignac, Frederic/0000-0002-0371-8857; Foroughan, Mehrshad/0000-0001-8814-5420; Hamze-Ziabari, Seyed Mahmood/0000-0002-9825-7335; Barry, David/0000-0002-8621-0425; 													1991-959X	1991-9603				DEC 8	2022	15	23					8785	8807		10.5194/gmd-15-8785-2022	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-8785-2022													WOS:000894940300001

The effects of hydropattern and predator communities on amphibian occupancy	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Complex, interactive ecological constraints regulate species distributions, and understanding these factors is crucial for predicting species persistence. We used occupancy analysis, which corrects for imperfect detection, to test the importance of abiotic and biotic habitat and landscape factors on probability of occupancy by Boreal Chorus Frog (Pseudacris maculata (Agassiz, 1850)) tadpoles. We hypothesized that hydropattern and predators are primarily important because they affect desiccation and predation risk and can interact in ways difficult to predict. We surveyed 62 wetland sites across an elevational gradient in Colorado, USA, and modeled patterns in P. maculata occupancy. Tadpoles were most frequently present in intermediate-length hydropattern systems with lower desiccation risk and no predatory fish because of occasional drying. Pseudacris maculata occupancy had a strong negative relationship with fish presence, while tadpoles, odonate larvae, and Barred Tiger Salamanders (Ambystoma mavortium mavortium Baird, 1850) frequently co-occurred. Dry seasonal conditions will likely result in fewer intermediate-length hydropattern ponds available for amphibian breeding. We hypothesize that this will force P. maculata to breed in habitats with fish. As habitats shrink, predators that co-occur with P. maculata are expected to concentrate in the remaining habitat and increase predation risk for developing tadpoles (assuming predators are similarly constricted in their habitat use as amphibians are).					; Bailey, Larissa/ABH-3513-2020; Murphy, Melanie/D-2605-2009	Funk, W.

Surficial water bodies are often interconnected with groundwater, forming a physical continuum, and their interaction has been reported as a crucial driver for organic matter (OM) inputs in groundwater systems. However, despite the growing concerns related to increasing anthropogenic pressure and effects of global change to groundwater environments, our understanding of the dynamics regulating subterranean carbon flows is still sparse. We traced carbon composition and transformations in an arid zone calcrete aquifer using a novel multidisciplinary approach that combined isotopic analyses of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and inorganic carbon (DIC) (delta C-13(DOC), delta C-13(DIC),(14)C(DOC)and(14)C(DIC)) with fluorescence spectroscopy (Chromophoric Dissolved OM (CDOM) characterisation) and metabarcoding analyses (taxonomic and functional genomics on bacterial 16S rRNA). To compare dynamics linked to potential aquifer recharge processes, water samples were collected from two boreholes under contrasting rainfall: low rainfall ((LR), dry season) and high rainfall ((HR), wet season). Our isotopic results indicate limited changes and dominance of modern terrestrial carbon in the upper part (northeast) of the bore field, but correlation between HR and increased old and(13)C-enriched DOC in the lower area (southwest). CDOM results show a shift from terrestrially to microbially derived compounds after rainfall in the same lower field bore, which was also sampled for microbial genetics. Functional genomic results showed increased genes coding for degradative pathways-dominated by those related to aromatic compound metabolisms-during HR. Our results indicate that rainfall leads to different responses in different parts of the bore field, with an increase in old carbon sources and microbial processing in the lower part of the field. We hypothesise that this may be due to increasing salinity, either due to mobilisation of Cl(-)from the soil, or infiltration from the downstream salt lake during HR. This study is the first to use a multi-technique assessment using stable and radioactive isotopes together with functional genomics to probe the principal organic biogeochemical pathways regulating an arid zone calcrete system. Further investigations involving extensive sampling from diverse groundwater ecosystems will allow better understanding of the microbiological pathways sustaining the ecological functioning of subterranean biota.

In the research reported here, we used MODIS satellite data to establish the time series of lake ice extent and extracted lake ice phenology dates and durations for eight large typical lakes in Northeast China for the hydrological years from 2003 to 2016. The MODIS-derived results were validated against ice records at hydrological stations. The mean absolute error for a freeze-up start (FUS), freeze-up end (FUE), break-up start (BUS) and break-up end (BUE) was 3.1, 4.8, 6.6 and 6.6 days, respectively. Our findings indicated that the investigated lakes were tending to freeze later and melt earlier and were frozen for a shortened period over time. FUS was experiencing a delay of 0.65 days per year and BUE was advancing by 0.19 days per year, implying a decrease of frozen duration (FD) of 0.84 days per year taking all eight lakes into consideration. The lake ice duration increased with latitude, and the lakes with a relatively smaller area had a higher yearly rate of change and were more variable compared with the larger ones. The relationship between lake ice phenology and other influencing factors was evaluated using correlation coefficients and partial least squares regression. The results showed that the freeze-up process was more dependent on the lake morphometry, while the break-up process was more dependent on climate changes, particularly on air temperature, which had the highest correlation coefficient (r = -0.69, p < 0.01).

Changes in species composition during annual cyanobacterial dominance in a tropical reservoir: physical factors, nutrients and grazing effects	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Trends in recent years have indicated that cyanobacterial blooms in tropical reservoirs are increasing in frequency, magnitude and geographical distribution. Funil Reservoir in southeastern Brazil has experienced eutrophication in the recent decades, resulting in lasting and intense toxic cyanobacterial blooms. As input of nutrients is high during the year, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of other variables related to changes in cyanobacterial biomass and composition. The dominant group found over the entire study period was Cyanobacteria (97% of total biomass), which contributed to low diversity. A shift of nitrogen-fixing (Anabaena circinalis and Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii) and non nitrogen-fixing (Microcystis aeruginosa) cyanobacteria was observed. Redundancy analysis indicated that physical factors such as temperature, changes in the mixing zone and light intensity were the main driving factors of the seasonal succession. Nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria dominated in periods of low light in the deepest mixing zone, and also seemed to have experienced stronger grazing effects as the density of the large zooplankton group was related to cyanobacteria biomass. M. aeruginosa bloomed in warm stratified waters, high water levels and during months with more daylight, when the zooplankton density was drastically reduced. Although the long-standing dominance of cyanobacteria may be related to high nutrient availability, the present study showed that under high and constant input of nutrients, other factors, especially physical variables, present. a more plausible explanation to promote changes in species composition.					; Huszar, Vera/J-7126-2012; de oliveira e azevedo, sandra/G-8362-2015; Soares, Maria/E-9397-2013; Marinho, Marcelo/C-1515-2013	Castelo Branco, Christina W/0000-0002-0509-171X; Marinho, Marcelo/0000-0001-5661-4528; Huszar, Vera/0000-0002-8096-1404													0948-3055	1616-1564					2009	57	2					137	149		10.3354/ame01336	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame01336													WOS:000272197000003

Several process-based models have been developed to quantify the magnitude and estimate spatial and temporal variations in CH4 emissions from global wetlands. Reliable models are required to estimate global wetland CH4 emissions. This study aimed to test two process-based models, CH4 MODwetland and Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM), against the CH4 flux measurements of marsh, swamp, peatland and coastal wetland sites across the world; specifically, model accuracy and generality were evaluated for different wetland types and in different continents, and then the global CH4 emissions from 2000 to 2010 were estimated. Both models showed similar high correlations with the observed seasonal/annual total CH4 emissions, and the regression of the observed versus computed total seasonal/annual CH4 emissions resulted in R-2 values of 0.81 and 0.68 for CH4 MODwetland and ILM, respectively. The CH4MOD(wetland )produced accurate predictions for marshes, peatlands, swamps and coastal wetlands, with model efficiency (EF) values of 0.22, 0.52, 0.13 and 0.72, respectively. TEM produced good predictions for peatlands and swamps, with EF values of 0.69 and 0.74, respectively, but it could not accurately simulate marshes and coastal wetlands (EF < 0). There was a good correlation between the simulated CH4 fluxes and the observed values on most continents. However, CH4MOD(wetland) showed no correlation with the observed values in South America and Africa. TEM showed no correlation with the observations in Europe. The global CH4 emissions for the period 2000-2010 were estimated to be 105.31 +/- 2.72 Tg yr(-1) by CH4 MODwetland and 134.31 +/- 0.84 Tg yr(-1) by MM. Both models simulated a similar spatial distribution of CH4 emissions globally and on different continents. Marshes contribute 36 %-39 % of global CH4 emissions. Lakes/rivers and swamps are the second and third greatest contributors, respectively. Other wetland types account for only approximately 20 % of global emissions. Based on the model applicability, if we use the more accurate model, i.e., the one that performs best as evidenced by a higher model efficiency and a lower model bias, to estimate each continent and wetland type, we obtain a new assessment of 116.99-124.74 Tg yr(-1) for the global CH4 emissions for the period 2000-2010. Our results imply that performance at a global scale may conceal model uncertainty. Efforts should be made to improve model accuracy for different wetland types and regions, particularly hotspot regions, to reduce the uncertainty in global assessments.					; Zhang, Wen/AAH-6060-2020; Yu, Lijun/AAJ-6691-2020; Qin, Zhangcai/ADO-1115-2022; Zhang, Ran/GZG-8709-2022; Li, Tingting/AAJ-7797-2020; Wang, Guocheng/M-3857-2013; Zhang, Qing/AAJ-7307-2020	QIN, ZHANGCAI/0000-0001-9414-4854; Zhang, Wen/0000-0001-6670-3057; yu, ling fei/0000-0002-4960-8899; Li, Tingting/0000-0002-6338-2769													1991-959X	1991-9603				AUG 26	2020	13	8					3769	3788		10.5194/gmd-13-3769-2020	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-3769-2020													WOS:000566347300001

This study aimed at a) characterizing the seasonal and annual emissions of both gases from the major cropping systems, and b) determining their direct emission factors (EF(d)s) as the key parameters for inventory compilation. Measurements of N2O and NO emissions were conducted year-round in the Tai-Lake region using a static opaque chamber method. The measurements involved a typical rice-wheat rotation ecosystem and a vegetable field. The two types of croplands were subjected to both a fertilized treatment and a control treatment without nitrogen addition. In the rice-wheat ecosystem, N2O emissions were measured throughout an entire year-round rotation spanning from June 2003 to June 2004, whereas NO emissions were measured only during the non-rice period. In the vegetable field, both N2O and NO emissions were measured from November 2003 to November 2004. During the investigation period, the average cumulative N2O and NO emissions under the fertilized conditions amounted to 3.80 and 0.80 (during the non-rice period for NO) kg N ha(-1), respectively, in the rice-wheat field, and 20.81 and 47.13 kg N ha(-1), respectively, in the vegetable field. The average total N2O and NO emissions under the control conditions were 1.39 and 0.29 (during the non-rice period for NO) kg N ha(-1), respectively, in the rice-wheat rotation, and 2.98 and 0.80 kg N ha(-1), respectively, in the vegetable field. The direct emission factor (EFd, which is defined as the loss rate of applied nitrogen via N2O or NO emissions in the current season or year) of N2O was annually determined to be 0.56 % in the rice-wheat field, while the seasonal EFd of NO was 0.34 % during the non-rice period of the rotation cycle. In the vegetable field, the seasonal EF(d)s of N2O and NO varied from 0.15 % to 14.50 % and 0.80 % to 28.21 %, respectively, among different crop seasons; and the annual EF(d)s were 1.38 % and 3.59 %, respectively. This study suggests that conventional vegetable fields associated with intensive synthetic nitrogen application, as well as addition of manure slurry, may substantially contribute to the regional N2O and NO emissions though they account for a relatively small portion of the farmlands in the Tai-Lake region. However, further studies to be conducted at multiple field sites with conventional vegetable and rice-based fields are needed to test this conclusion.

High values were detected in particulate fractions, with peak values 28.25 ng/L for geosmin (GEO), 45.18 ng/L for dimethyltrisulfide (DMTS), 714.77 ng/L for beta-cyclocitral, 11.23 ng/L for beta-ionone in surface water, and 14.21 ng/L for GEO, 103.68 ng/L for DMTS, 11.97 ng/L for beta-ionone in overlying water, all exceeding their odor thresholds. The maximum off-flavor concentrations in sediment ranged from 2010.76 ng/kg for GEO to 1.7 ng/kg for beta-ionone. Positive correlations could be found not only between Anabaena and particulate GEO (r = 0.813, p < 0.01), but also between Microcystis and total beta-cyclocitral (r = 0.652, p < 0.01) or beta-ionone (r = 0.560, p < 0.01) in surface water. TP, TN, PO4-P, Chl-a and organic matter contributed significantly to the variations of T&O compounds in water or sediment. The cause of the variations of T&O compounds was the accumulation and degradation of cyanobacteria in water rather than nutrient-rich sediment.																			0007-4861	1432-0800				FEB	2016	96	2					186	191		10.1007/s00128-015-1698-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-015-1698-y								26585647					WOS:000368716700010

The lake lies in a closed basin and its limnology, ecology, and fisheries are driven by seasonal cycles of flooding from the Omo River, which provides more than 90% of the lake's inflow. Lake Turkana is a unique ecosystem and is home to at least 79 fish species (12 endemic), the world's largest remaining population of Nile crocodile, and hundreds of resident and migratory bird species. The lake has considerable fisheries resources that contribute to food security, employment, and the general wellbeing of local communities. Lake Turkana is also the least studied of the Great Lakes of Africa, due to its remoteness, the absence of necessary scientific infrastructure, and the scarcity of trained personnel in the field of aquatic sciences and fisheries in the region. Here, we present a review based on the available literature and on expert discussions and surveys to synthesize current knowledge, research gaps, and opportunities for increasing our knowledge on this unique ecosystem. Our literature review showed that there is a marked lack of interdisciplinary and applied research on Lake Turkana, and that much of the work published on the system (63.3%) focuses on previous geological periods rather than the current state of the ecosystem. We highlight four critical steps that need to be taken to improve research into this system: local capacity building, consistent monitoring and data sharing, sustainable financing, and strengthened collaborative networks.(c) 2022 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

The influence of the southeast trade winds on the limnology of Lake Tanganyika is well known. Upwelling occurs to the south and downwelling to the north from May to September and subsequent upwelling and blooms at the northern end of the lake. However, the influence of the shifts in wind speed and direction after the SE trade winds, including the Northeast trade winds, and any further internal wave driven upwelling requires investigation. Here we use images from remote-sensing during a 12 year period (2003-2014) to illustrate intense phytoplankton blooms at the southeast of Lake Tanganyika in April-May, a period characterized by relaxation of the Northeast trade winds. Phytoplankton blooms progressed around the lake after a massive cyanobacteria bloom at the northern end in September 2018; recent and historical observations and local knowledge show similar patterns. Lake Tanganyika limnological cycle is revised to include four main periods: two trade winds seasons and two inter-monsoon seasons (April-May and September-October) with lake-wide up and downwelling of the thermocline associated with the monsoons, and upwelling associated with subsequent internal waves in the inter-monsoon period which are linked with increased phytoplankton blooms and sometimes also fish kills.					; Plisnier, Pierre-Denis/ABG-2933-2020	Plisnier, Pierre-Denis/0000-0002-6481-0964; Cocquyt, Christine/0000-0002-0047-4180													0380-1330					DEC	2023	49	6							102247	10.1016/j.jglr.2023.102247	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2023.102247		DEC 2023											WOS:001140203500001

The characterization of the microbial community in aquatic environments is fundamental for understanding its functioning, particularly under the increasing pressure posed by land conversion and climate change. Here, we aim to characterize the structure (abundance, richness, and diversity) and composition of the Bacteria and Archaea in the sediment of two natural ponds belonging to different basins that primarily differ in size and depth in the Cerrado. Sediment samples were collected in the dry and rainy seasons and the transition periods between both. The structure and composition of Bacteria and Archaea were assessed by 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. We identified 45 bacterial and four archaeal groups. Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria dominated the bacterial community, while Euryarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota dominated the archaeal community. Seasonal fluctuations in the relative abundance of microbial taxa were observed, but pond characteristics were more determinant to community composition differences. Microbial communities are highly diverse, and local variability could partially explain the microbial structure's main differences. Functional predictions based in 16S rRNA gene accessed with Tax4Fun indicated an enriched abundance of predicted methane metabolism in the deeper pond, where higher abundance of methanogenic archaeaMethanocella,Methanosaeta, and Methanomicrobiaceae was detected. Our dataset encompasses the more comprehensive survey of prokaryotic microbes in Cerrado's aquatic environments. Here, we present basic and essential information about composition and diversity, for initial insights into the ecology of Bacteria and Archaea in these environments.					; Bustamante, Mercedes/GQZ-8625-2022; Marques, Nubia/ABB-8246-2021; Kruger, Ricardo/Y-9595-2019	SILVEIRA, RAFAELLA/0000-0003-4407-9374; de Roure Bandeira de Mello, Thiago/0000-0002-2373-9647; Sartori Silva, Maria Regina/0000-0003-2158-0078; Marques, Nubia/0000-0001-9183-9335; Kruger, Ricardo/0000-0002-8443-9402													0095-3628	1432-184X				APR	2021	81	3					563	578		10.1007/s00248-020-01574-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-020-01574-x		AUG 2020						32829441					WOS:000561729000001

Proboscidean isotopic compositions provide insight into ancient humans and their environments	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Isotopic analyses of proboscidean remains (e.g., mammoth, mastodon, gompothere, elephant) can provide significant insights into past environmental conditions and animal behaviour. Because they are associated with humans over a broad geographical and temporal scale, proboscidean remains can also be used to understand the activities and environmental contexts of ancient humans. This paper reviews the isotopic literature on proboscideans, including (1) bulk tissue approaches to understanding past climate, vegetation patterns, and migrations, (2) serial sampling approaches to understanding seasonal variations, and (3) direct uses of proboscidean isotopic compositions to investigate human lifeways, including Neandertal and Upper Paleolithic humans in Europe and Paleoindian/Clovis people in North America.

J	Ahmed, M; Mumtaz, R; Anwar, Z				Ahmed, Mehreen; Mumtaz, Rafia; Anwar, Zahid			An Enhanced Water Quality Index for Water Quality Monitoring Using Remote Sensing and Machine Learning	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL												Water quality deterioration is a serious problem with the increase in the urbanization rate. However, water quality monitoring uses grab sampling of physico-chemical parameters and a water quality index method to assess water quality. Both processes are lengthy and expensive. These traditional indices are biased towards the physico-chemical parameters because samples are only collected from certain sampling points. These limitations make the current water quality index method unsuitable for any water body in the world. Thus, we develop an enhanced water quality index method based on a semi-supervised machine learning technique to determine water quality. This method follows five steps: (i) parameter selection, (ii) sub-index calculation, (iii) weight assignment, (iv) aggregation of sub-indices and (v) classification. Physico-chemical, air, meteorological and hydrological, topographical parameters are acquired for the stream network of the Rawal watershed. Min-max normalization is used to obtain sub-indices, and weights are assigned with tree-based techniques, i.e., LightGBM, Random Forest, CatBoost, AdaBoost and XGBoost. As a result, the proposed technique removes the uncertainties in the traditional indexing with a 100% classification rate, removing the necessity of including all parameters for classification. Electric conductivity, secchi disk depth, dissolved oxygen, lithology and geology are amongst the high weighting parameters of using LightGBM and CatBoost with 99.1% and 99.3% accuracy, respectively. In fact, seasonal variations are observed for the classified stream network with a shift from 55:45% (January) to 10:90% (December) ratio for the medium to bad class. This verifies the validity of the proposed method that will contribute to water management planning globally.					; Anwar, Zahid/ACP-7624-2022; Mumtaz, Rafia/O-7715-2016	Ahmed, Mehreen/0000-0003-0996-3156; Mumtaz, Rafia/0000-0002-0966-3957; Anwar, Zahid/0000-0002-4608-4305														2076-3417				DEC	2022	12	24							12787	10.3390/app122412787	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app122412787													WOS:000902166200001
J	Sarin, C; Klomjek, P				Sarin, Charoon; Klomjek, Pantip			Spatial and seasonal distribution of microplastic in surface water of Bueng Boraphet Wetland-a Ramsar wetland in Thailand	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												This study sought to assess microplastic contamination in the surface water of the inland freshwater wetland, Bueng Boraphet Wetland, Thailand, which is a lentic system with various land-use patterns, including community areas, agricultural areas, and natural resource conservation areas. In 2019, water samples were collected during the wet and dry periods from the three land-use zones at depths of 0-30 cm using a plankton net with 333 mu m in mesh size. The water samples were digested via a wet peroxide oxidation process prior to the identification of microplastic morphology using a stereomicroscope. The polymer types of microplastic were analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry. Microplastic was found to range from 0.00 to 4.61 particles/m(2) (0.34 +/- 0.81 particles/m(2)) or 0.0 to 19.57 particles/m(3) (1.44 +/- 3.4 particles/m(3)). Furthermore, significantly high amounts of microplastics were found in samples from the community area. No microplastic was detected in the sample from the natural resource conservation area. The quantity of microplastic did not significantly differ between the sampling periods. Polymer types, including polyester, polypropylene, and polyethylene terephthalate, were identified in this study. The microplastics were predominantly small and were colored black or red. Microplastic with a fiber shape (93.8%) was observed. Besides the specific gravity of the microplastic and hydrological characteristics, the high concentration of microplastics found in samples from the community area (0.62 +/- 0.79 particles/m(2) or 2.63 +/- 3.36 particles/m(3)) is likely related to the high human pressure. As microplastic contamination can impact aquatic animals and wetland ecosystems, appropriate control measures for human activities and plastic waste management are required.

J	Moreno, E; Conde-Porcuna, JM; Gómez, A				Moreno, Emilio; Conde-Porcuna, Jose M.; Gomez, Africa			Barcoding rotifer biodiversity in Mediterranean ponds using diapausing egg banks	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												The biodiversity of Mediterranean freshwater bodies is among the most threatened worldwide; therefore, its accurate estimation is an urgent issue. However, traditional methods are likely to underestimate freshwater zooplankton biodiversity due to its high species seasonality and cryptic diversity. We test the value of applying DNA barcoding to diapausing egg banks, in combination with the creation of a reference collection of DNA barcodes using adult individual samples, to characterize rotifer communities. We use monogonont rotifers from two lakes in Donana National Park and one from Ruidera Natural Park in Spain as models to create a reference collection of DNA barcodes for taxonomically diagnosed adult individuals sampled from the water column, to compare with the sequences obtained from individual eggs from the diapausing egg banks. We apply two different approaches to carry out DNA taxonomy analyses, the generalized mixed Yule coalescent method (GMYC) and the Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD), to the obtained sequences and to publicly available rotifer sequences. We obtained a total of 210 new rotifer COI sequences from all three locations (151 diapausing eggs and 59 adults). Both GMYC and ABGD generated the same 35 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), revealing four potential cryptic species. Most sequences obtained from diapausing eggs (85%) clustered with sequences obtained from morphologically diagnosed adults. Our approach, based on a single sediment sample, retrieved estimates of rotifer biodiversity higher than or similar to those of previous studies based on a number of seasonal samples. This study shows that DNA barcoding of diapausing egg banks is an effective aid to characterize rotifer diversity in Mediterranean freshwater bodies.

This study is among the first to explore intra-lake horizontal heterogeneity of organic-aggregate-associated bacterial community composition (OABC) in the large, shallow, and eutrophic Lake Taihu. During November 2006, samples were collected at four locations representing different trophic states and food web structures. Regional variability of OABC and diversity were studied by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis and comparative analysis of four large 16S ribosomal RNA clone libraries. Our results demonstrate that OABC were numerically dominated by members of the beta-proteobacteria (19.2-38.6%), Bacteroidetes (3.6-20.0%), and alpha-proteobacteria (11.5-19.2%) groups. The dominance of the Bacteroidetes group was related to algae-based aggregates. Horizontal heterogeneity of OABC exists within habitats, suggesting that the trophic state of the water and the physicochemical properties of organic aggregates (OA) play a key role. Diverse bacterial communities found on OA were substantially different from free-living ones. Comparative statistical analyses of the habitats of OA-associated bacteria highlight the potential ecological importance of the exchange between OABC and the surrounding planktonic community. Lastly, we found at least 45% of sequences closely related to ones previously found in soils, sludge, sediments, and other habitats. This demonstrates that microorganisms from terrestrial and sediment habitats are an important component of OA.

J	Williams, MW; Seibold, C; Chowanski, K				Williams, Mark W.; Seibold, Christine; Chowanski, Kurt			Storage and release of solutes from a subalpine seasonal snowpack: soil and stream water response, Niwot Ridge, Colorado	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Much of the research on the chemistry of snow and surface waters of the western US, Europe, and Asia has been conducted in high-elevation catchments above treeline. Here we provide information on the solute content of the seasonal snowpack at the Soddie site on Niwot Ridge, Colorado, a subalpine site near treeline. We focus on the storage and release of both inorganic and organic solutes to the soils underneath the snowpack, and subsequent effects on the chemical and nutrient content of the underlying soil solution and the adjacent headwater stream. The concentration of inorganic nitrogen (N) stored in the seasonal snowpack at the Soddie site of about 11 mu eq L-1 was on the upper end of values reported for the northern hemisphere when compared to most areas of the Alps, Himalayas, and Tien Shan mountain ranges, but consistent with other reports of snowpacks in the Rocky Mountains. The storage of inorganic N in the snowpack at maximum accumulation averaged about 17 meq m(-2), or 170 eq ha(-1) (on the order of 2 kg-N ha(-1)). Solutes were released from storage in the form of an ionic pulse, with a maximum concentration factor of about four. In contrast to the seasonal snowpack, the dominant form of N in the soil solution was dissolved organic N. Thus, soils underlying the seasonal snowpack appear to assimilate inorganic N released from storage in the snowpack and convert it to organic N. A two component mixing model suggests that the majority of streamflow was this year's snowmelt that had infiltrated the subsurface and undergone subsequent biological and geochemical reactions. The inorganic N in surface waters at the headwaters of Como creek were always near or below detection limits, suggesting that this area at treeline is still N-limited.																			0168-2563	1573-515X				AUG	2009	95	1					77	94		10.1007/s10533-009-9288-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-009-9288-x													WOS:000267390600006

Environmental shifts in and around Lake Pannon during the Tortonian Thermal Maximum based on a multi-proxy record from the Vienna Basin (Austria, Late Miocene, Tortonian)	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The Neogene Lake Pannon was the largest lake that ever existed in Europe. It attained its greatest extent during the Tortonian Thermal Maximum. For the first time, results from a detailed lake record documenting about 85 kyr of Late Miocene time in a continuously recovered, 60-m-long, clay-rich core of Lake Pannon are reported. This record includes the transition from the lake's maximum transgression into its high-stand at around 10.4 Ma. The environmental development of Lake Pannon during its maximum extent is interpreted based on integrated paleontological, sedimentological, mineralogical and geochemical data. The maximum extent coincided with stable sedimentation of clay, little influx from the hinterland, low surface productivity and severe bottom-water anoxia. The clay mineralogy of the lower part of the core points to prevailing chemical weathering based on the illite/smectite ratios. Distinct Fe, Mn and Ba enrichments are interpreted to have formed close to sulfate-methane transition zones during the maximum flooding. The highstand phase was marked by rapid environmental shifts with frequent phases of well-oxygenated bottom waters. These phases are reflected by rich benthic communities including stenohaline tunicates. The increased input of detritic kaolinite suggests a shift towards physical weathering and higher precipitation coinciding with a shift in the provenance of clay minerals. Increasing amounts of nutrients stimulated surface water productivity and nannoplankton blooms. Despite the offshore position of the core at similar to 8 km from the mountainous ranges of the Alps, strong fluvial input is reflected from 32.5 to 30.3 m by coarser sediment and the occurrence of terrestrial and freshwater molluscs. The Rhenodanubian Flysch Unit was the main source of the siliciclastics of the core and was drained by the Paleo-Wien river. Drainage from the Calcareous Alps was limited to an exceptionally strong fluvial event and related deposits, which documents the presence of a second river in the southwest, which might represent the Paleo-Liesing. The dominance of smectite throughout the core suggests a temperate climate with distinct seasonality during the Tortonian Thermal Maximum. In view of the autochthonous ascidian sclerites in three samples, and assuming generally similar ecological requirements for both Pannonian and modern tunicates, we conclude a polyhaline salinity for Lake Pannon around 10.4 Ma.

J	Shi, W; Wang, MH				Shi, Wei; Wang, Menghua			Characterization of Particle Backscattering of Global Highly Turbid Waters From VIIRS Ocean Color Observations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Normalized water-leaving radiance spectra nL(w)() at the near-infrared (NIR) from five years of observations (2012-2016) with the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) are used to derive the particle backscattering coefficients b(bp)() for global highly turbid coastal and inland waters. Based on the fact that the absorption coefficient of sea water a(w)() is generally much larger than those of the other constituents a(iop)() at the NIR wavelengths in coastal and inland waters, an NIR-based b(bp)() algorithm for turbid coastal and inland waters has been developed and used in this study. This algorithm can be safely used for highly turbid waters with nL(w)(745) and nL(w)(862)<approximate to 6 and approximate to 4 mW cm(-2) m(-1) sr(-1), respectively. Seasonal and interannual variations of b(bp)() in China's east coastal region, the Amazon River Estuary, the La Plata River Estuary, the Meghna River Estuary, the Atchafalaya River Estuary, and Lake Taihu are characterized and quantified. The coefficient b(bp)() can reach over approximate to 3-4 m(-1) in the Amazon River Estuary and China's east coastal region. The Amazon River Estuary is identified as the most turbid region in the global ocean in terms of b(bp)() magnitude. b(bp)() spectra in these five highly turbid regions are also seasonal-dependent and regional-dependent. In the highly turbid waters of China's east coastal region and the Amazon River Estuary, b(bp)() generally increases in wavelength from 410 to 862 nm, while it decreases in the La Plata River Estuary and Atchafalaya River Estuary. This is attributed to the different particle size distributions in these waters. The geophysical implication of the b(bp)() spectral curvatures for different waters is discussed. To improve global b(bp)() for both open oceans and coastal turbid waters, a new combined NIR-based and Quasi-Analytical Algorithm (QAA)-based b(bp)() algorithm is proposed and demonstrated.

Comparison analyses showed a phylogenetic difference between attached and free-living communities for the two bacterial groups. For Betaproteobacteria, the betaI clade was detected at all sampling dates in free-living and attached bacterial communities and was the dominant clade contributing to 57.8% of the total retrieved operational taxonomic units (OTUs). For Actinobacteria, the acIV cluster was found to be dominant, followed by acI contributing to 45% and 25% of the total retrieved OTUs, respectively. This study allows the determination of eight new putative clades among the Betaproteobacteria termed lbI-lbVIII and a new putative clade named acLBI belonging to the Actinobacteria. The seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton and zooplankton communities have been reflected as changes in distinct bacterial phylotypes for both attached and free-living communities. For attached communities, relationships were observed between Actinobacteria and Chrysophyceae, and between Betaproteobacteria and Dinophyceae and Chlorophyceae biomass. On the other hand, within free-living communities, few actinobacterial clades were found to be dependent on either nutrients or phytoplankton communities, whereas Betaproteobacteria were mainly associated with biological parameters (i.e. phytoplankton and copepod communities).					; Mangot, Jean-Francois/A-8918-2010; Domaizon, Isabelle/A-2517-2011	Viviane, RAVET/0000-0001-7574-992X; Bronner, Gisele/0000-0002-4863-4518; Mangot, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-6225-8889; Domaizon, Isabelle/0000-0001-9785-3082													0168-6496	1574-6941				SEP	2011	77	3					461	476		10.1111/j.1574-6941.2011.01130.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.2011.01130.x								21585402					WOS:000293684700001
J	Lofgren, BM; Rouhana, J				Lofgren, Brent M.; Rouhana, Jonathan			Physically Plausible Methods for Projecting Changes in Great Lakes Water Levels under Climate Change Scenarios	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												A method for projecting the water levels of the Laurentian Great Lakes under scenarios of human-caused climate change, used almost to the exclusion of other methods in the past, relies very heavily on the large basin runoff model (LBRM) as a component for determining the water budget for the lake system. This model uses near-surface air temperature as a primary predictor of evapotranspiration (ET); as in previous published work, it is shown here that the model's very high sensitivity to temperature causes it to overestimate ET in a way that is greatly at variance with the fundamental principle of conservation of energy at the land surface. The traditional formulation is characterized here as being equivalent to having several suns in the virtual sky created by LBRM. More physically based methods show, relative to the traditional method, often astoundingly less potential ET and less ET, more runoff from the land and net basin supply for the lake basins, and higher lake water levels in the future. Using various methods of estimating the statistical significance, it is found that, at minimum, these discrepancies in results are significant at the 99.998% level. The lesson for the larger climate impact community is to use caution about whether an impact is forced directly by air temperature itself or is significantly forced by season or latitude independently of temperature. The results here apply only to the water levels of the Great Lakes and the hydrology of its basin and do not affect larger questions of climate change.

Greenhouse Gas Fluxes of a Shallow Lake in South-Central North Dakota, USA	WETLANDS												Greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes of aquatic ecosystems in the northern Great Plains of the U.S. represent a significant data gap. Consequently, a 3-year study was conducted in south-central North Dakota, USA, to provide an initial estimate of GHG fluxes from a large, shallow lake. Mean GHG fluxes were 0.02 g carbon dioxide (CO2) m(-2) h(-1), 0.0009 g methane (CH4) m(-2) h(-1), and 0.0005 mg nitrous oxide (N2O) m(-2) h(-1). Fluxes of CO2 and CH4 displayed temporal and spatial variability which is characteristic of aquatic ecosystems, while fluxes of N2O were consistently low throughout the study. Comparisons between results of this study and published values suggest that mean daily fluxes of CO2, CH4, and N2O from Long Lake were low, particularly when compared to the well-studied prairie pothole wetlands of the region. Similarly, cumulative seasonal CH4 fluxes, which ranged from 2.68-7.58 g CH4 m(-2), were relatively low compared to other wetland systems of North America. The observed variability among aquatic ecosystems underscores the need for further research.					; Tangen, Brian/LGY-3948-2024	Tangen, Brian/0000-0001-5157-9882; 													0277-5212	1943-6246				AUG	2016	36	4					779	787		10.1007/s13157-016-0782-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-016-0782-3													WOS:000380067000017

Our aim was to reduce N runoff from paddy fields by fertilizer management and inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). In northeast China, Shuangcheng city in Heilongjiang province, a field experiment was conducted, using rice provided with 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% of the local norm of fertilization (including N, phosphorus and potassium), with or without inoculation with Glomus mosseae. The volume, concentrations of total N (TN), dissolved N (DN) and particulate N (PN) of runoff water were measured. We found that the local norm of fertilization led to 18.9 kg/ha of N runoff during rice growing season, with DN accounting for 60%-70%. We also found that reduction in fertilization by 20% cut down TN runoff by 8.2% while AMF inoculation decreased N runoff at each fertilizer level and this effect was inhibited by high fertilization. The combination of inoculation with AMF and 80% of the local norm of fertilization was observed to reduce N runoff by 27.2%. Conclusively, we suggested that the contribution of AMF inoculation combined with decreasing fertilization should get more attention to slow down water eutrophication by reducing N runoff from paddy fields.

The fatty acid compositions of seawater fish species were found to be 25.5-39.4% saturated (SFA), 13.2-29.0% monounsaturated (MUFAs) and 25.2-48.2% polyunsaturated acids (PUFAs), whereas the fatty acid compositions of freshwater fish from Lake Seyhan consisted of 28.0-34.6% saturated (SFA), 10.7-22.7% monounsaturated (MUFAs) and 23.2-43.7% polyunsaturated acids (PUFAs). The proportions of n3 PUFAs of seawater fish (ranging from 22.6 for waker to 44.2% for blue fish) were higher than those of n3 PUFAs of freshwater fish (ranging from 11.5% for North African catfish to 28.4% for zander). However, the levels of n6 PUFAs of seawater fish (ranging from 0.43% for blue fish to 14.4% for sea bass) were lower than those of n6 PUFAs of freshwater fish (ranging from 5.27% for kutum to 16.8% for tench). The results showed that fatty acid profiles of most freshwater fish are basically comparable to those of seawater fish as sources of PUFAs. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Li, JF; Wang, JW; Yang, LY; Ye, HP				Li, Jianfeng; Wang, Jiawei; Yang, Liangyan; Ye, Huping			Spatiotemporal change analysis of long time series inland water in Sri Lanka based on remote sensing cloud computing	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Sri Lanka is an important hub connecting Asia-Africa-Europe maritime routes. It receives abundant but uneven spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall and has evident seasonal water shortages. Monitoring water area changes in inland lakes and reservoirs plays an important role in guiding the development and utilisation of water resources. In this study, a rapid surface water extraction model based on the Google Earth Engine remote sensing cloud computing platform was constructed. By evaluating the optimal spectral water index method, the spatiotemporal variations of reservoirs and inland lakes in Sri Lanka were analysed. The results showed that Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI(sh)) could accurately identify the water boundary with an overall accuracy of 99.14%, which was suitable for surface water extraction in Sri Lanka. The area of the Maduru Oya Reservoir showed an overall increasing trend based on small fluctuations from 1988 to 2018, and the monthly area of the reservoir fluctuated significantly in 2017. Thus, water resource management in the dry zone should focus more on seasonal regulation and control. From 1995 to 2015, the number and area of lakes and reservoirs in Sri Lanka increased to different degrees, mainly concentrated in arid provinces including Northern, North Central, and Western Provinces. Overall, the amount of surface water resources have increased.

Remote detection of Tamax has widely relied on the empirical relationship between air temperature and land surface temperature (LST), a product derived from remote sensing. However, little is known about how such a relationship is affected by the high heterogeneity in landscapes and dynamics in seasonality. This study aims to advance our understanding of the roles of land cover and seasonal variation in the estimation of Tamax using the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) LST product. We developed statistical models to link Tamax and LST in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China for five major land-cover types (i.e., forest, shrub, water, impervious surface, cropland, and grassland) and two seasons (i.e., growing season and non-growing season). Results show that the performance of modeling the Tamax-LST relationship was highly dependent on land cover and seasonal variation. Estimating Tamax over grasslands and water bodies achieved superior performance; while uncertainties were high over forested lands that contained extensive heterogeneity in species types, plant structure, and topography. We further found that all the land-cover specific models developed for the plant non-growing season outperformed the corresponding models developed for the growing season. Discrepancies in model performance mainly occurred in the vegetated areas (forest, cropland, and shrub), suggesting an important role of plant phenology in defining the statistical relationship between Tamax and LST. For impervious surfaces, the challenge of capturing the high spatial heterogeneity in urban settings using the low-resolution MODIS data made Tamax estimation a difficult task, which was especially true in the growing season.					cai, yl/AIF-1659-2022; Chen, Gang/AAG-9414-2020	Chen, Gang/0000-0002-7469-3650													2072-4292					MAR	2017	9	3							233	10.3390/rs9030233	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs9030233													WOS:000398720100047
J	Paull, TM; Finkelstein, SA; Gajewski, K				Paull, Tara M.; Finkelstein, Sarah A.; Gajewski, Konrad			Interactions between climate and landscape drive Holocene ecological change in a High Arctic lake on Somerset Island, Nunavut, Canada	ARCTIC SCIENCE												This study presents a diatom-based analysis of the post-glacial Holocene environmental history at Lake RS29 on Somerset Island in the Canadian High Arctic. Earliest post-glacial diatom assemblages (10 200-10 000 cal yr BP) consisted mainly of small, benthic fragilarioid taxa. Poor diatom preservation in the early Holocene (similar to 10 000-6200 cal yr BP) is associated with warm conditions, as determined by pollen data from the same core and other paleoclimate estimates from the region. Analysis of this and other sites from across the Canadian Arctic suggest that zones of poor diatom preservation or diatom absence in lake sediment records may be associated with warm conditions. After 6200 cal yr BP, acidophilic assemblages consisting of Aulacoseira spp. and a suite of periphytic taxa indicate acidification since the mid-Holocene. During this time period, cooling causing changes in lake ice phenology was likely a major driver of the reconstructed mid-Holocene pH decline. Watershed processes, including reduced fluxes of base cations as the rate of sediment accumulation slowed, may also be contributors to long-term shifts in lake water pH and associated changes in diatom assemblages. The uppermost sediments in the Lake RS29 record were characterized by abrupt declines in Aulacoseira alpigena and increases in benthic diatom taxa Cyclotella sensu lato, suggesting an increase in lake water pH and longer ice-free seasons.					; Finkelstein, Sarah/K-8202-2012	Finkelstein, Sarah/0000-0002-8239-399X; 														2368-7460				MAR	2017	3	1					17	38		10.1139/as-2016-0013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/as-2016-0013													WOS:000416398600002

The branched GDGTs (bGDGTs) were > 0.6 ng/l and isoprenoid GDGTs (iGDGTs) > 0.3 ng/l in most SPM samples in May and July, whereas, iGDGTs were on average about 10 x more abundant than bGDGTs in December. The results suggest that the abundance of bGDGTs and iGDGTs in the Yangtze River at the TGD varied seasonally, which might be affected by soil runoff and in situ production. Despite these effects, the TEX86-inferred temperature derived from SPM reflected the measured river surface water temperature in the sampling months, suggesting that planktonic Thaumarchaeota might actively make iGDGTs in the river water near the TGD throughout the year. The bGDGT-derived CBT/MBT temperature from the SPM was not significantly different among the three seasons and the values together averaged 15.2 +/- 0.7 degrees C, close to the annual mean air temperature (16.9 degrees C) in the region near the TGD. However, the bGDGT-derived pH(CBT) values were close to the water pH and slightly higher than the pH of the local soil. These results suggest that the sources of bGDGTs in the river water are complicated and that bGDGTs may not solely derive from the local soil runoff. Nevertheless, our study highlights the potential of using TEX86 and MBT/CBT proxies for a better understanding of the source and mechanism of GDGT production in riverine systems increasingly affected by the construction of dams.

How Landscape Patterns Affect River Water Quality Spatially and Temporally: A Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression Approach	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS												. The water quality of a river can be considered a function of its surrounding landscape. Understanding the relationship between landscape patterns and river water quality is essential for optimizing landscape patterns to reduce watershed pollution and has not yet been solved. A multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) model was used to explore the associations between the landscape patterns and water quality. Our results showed that landscape metrics have varied relationships with the water quality across spatial scales in different seasons. The strongest independent influencing variable for NO3--N, NH4+-N, and TN was tea gardens, residential land, and varied seasonally, respectively. The impacts of the landscape metrics on the TP were relatively weak throughout the year at the watershed scale. The influence of landscape metrics on NO3--N was more significant during the flood season, whereas that on NH4+-N was more notable during the non-flood season. Seasonal changes in the influencing landscape metrics of TN were not regular. Although landscape composition more significantly influenced water quality than configuration, the Shannon's diversity index and patch density were important configuration indices that significantly impacted water quality. Therefore, with limited land availability, it is essential to optimize the landscape spatial configuration without changing the composition of the watershed to reduce the risk of river pollution. This study further indicated that the MGWR model can well quantify the effects of landscape pattern on water quality at the watershed scale.

Phytoplankton is an important component of the aquatic ecosystem, which plays an important role as a bioindicator for the assessment of aquatic health. The present study was conducted between 2018 and 2019 to understand the seasonal variation in the phytoplankton diversity of the Charaganga wetland and, parallelly, in the river Ganga in Nabadweep, India. The study explains how riverine connectivity affects the structure of the algal community in the wetland ecosystem. In the study, it has been observed that in the wetland, maximum mean phytoplankton density was noticed during pre-monsoon, i.e., 4079 unit l(-1) followed by post-monsoon 3812 unit l(-1) and monsoon 550 unit l(-1), respectively. In the river system, the phytoplankton density varied from 78 unit l(-1) to 653 unit l(-1) seasonally, i.e., highest during monsoon and lowest during pre-monsoon. In both the ecosystems, i.e., wetland and river, the supreme influential group was Cyanophyceae followed by diatoms. One-way ANOVA showed a significant variation (p > 0.05) of three algal groups of phytoplankton (Bacillariophyceae, Coscinodiscophyceae, Chlorophyceae) in the river, while in the wetland, no significant variation (p > 0.05) was found among the other algal groups. The observed higher Shannon and Margalef's species richness value in the wetland was observed than in the river defines the significance and importance of the wetland ecosystem, which may support the growth and conservation of various aquatic organisms as well. The study highlighted that the influencing abiotic factors like water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and nutrients have affected the phytoplankton community in both the water bodies, i.e., wetland and river. We concluded that river connectivity is required to restore the biotic flora of the wetland ecosystem.

Recharging groundwater by rejuvenating dried surface reservoirs using recycled water is a new sustainable solution. To ensure the prevention of groundwater contamination and associated health risks (as recycled water is used), it is crucial to assess the surface reservoir water quality. The study for the first time suggests the Lake2K model, a one-dimensional mechanistic mass-balance model, to simulate the changes in water quality in a series of man-made surface water reservoirs where recycled water flows under an indirect groundwater recharge scheme (soil aquifer treatment system). The model was developed, calibrated, and validated using field observations to estimate degradation/reaction rate constants for various water quality parameters. The observed average degradation/reaction rate constants for parameters including ammonia-N, nitrate-N, total nitrogen, total organic carbon, and organic phosphorous were 0.043 day-1, 0.04 day-1, 0.043 day-1, 0.055 day-1, and 0.056 day-1, respectively, which were found to be relatively high compared to existing literature, indicating a greater degradation of these parameters in warmer climates. The results showed that the water quality improved significantly as the water progressed through the reservoirs, aligning with field observations. Additionally, the simulated seasonal variations revealed that the maximum growth rate of phytoplankton occurred during July, August, and September for each reservoir, while the nutrient pool (nitrate-N and orthophosphates) experienced the greatest depletion during this growth period. These findings shed light on the dynamics of surface water quality in regions facing water scarcity and contribute to the development of sustainable groundwater management strategies.

Microbial communities of the Lemon Creek Glacier show subtle structural variation yet stable phylogenetic composition over space and time	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Glaciers are geologically important yet transient ecosystems that support diverse, biogeochemically significant microbial communities. During the melt season glaciers undergo dramatic physical, geochemical, and biological changes that exert great influence on downstream biogeochemical cycles. Thus, we sought to understand the temporal melt-season dynamics of microbial communities and associated geochemistry at the terminus of Lemon Creek Glacier (LCG) in coastal southern Alaska. Due to late season snowfall, sampling of LCG occurred in three interconnected areas: proglacial Lake Thomas, the lower glacial outflow stream, and the glacier's terminus. LCG associated microbial communities were phylogenetically diverse and varied by sampling location. However, Betaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes dominated communities at all sampling locations. Strict anaerobic groups such as methanogens, SRI, and OP11 were also recovered from glacier outflows, indicating anoxic conditions in at least some portions of the LCG subglacial environment. Microbial community structure was significantly correlated with sampling location and sodium concentrations. Microbial communities sampled from terminus outflow waters exhibited day-to-day fluctuation in taxonomy and phylogenetic similarity. However, these communities were not significantly different from randomly constructed communities from all three sites. These results indicate that glacial outflows share a large proportion of phylogenetic overlap with downstream environments and that the observed significant shifts in community structure are driven by changes in relative abundance of different taxa, and not complete restructuring of communities. We conclude that LCG glacial discharge hosts a diverse and relatively stable microbiome that shifts at fine taxonomic scales in response to geochemistry and likely water residence time.

Spatial and temporal scales of aquatic bacterial beta diversity	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Understanding characteristic variation in aquatic bacterial community composition (BCC) across space and time can inform us about processes driving community assembly and the ability of bacterial communities to respond to perturbations. In this study, we synthesize BCC data from north temperate lakes to evaluate our current understanding of how BCC varies across multiple scales in time and space. A hierarchy of average similarity emerged with the highest similarity found among samples collected within the same lake, especially within the same basin, followed by similarity among samples collected through time within the same lake, and finally similarity among samples collected from different lakes. Using decay of similarity across time and space, we identified equivalent temporal (1 day) and spatial (10 m) scales of BCC variation. Finally, we identify an intriguing pattern of contrasting patterns of intra- and inter-annual BCC variation in two lakes. We argue our synthesis of spatio-temporal variation of aquatic BCC informs expectations for the response of aquatic bacterial communities to perturbation and environmental change. However, further long-term temporal observations will be needed to develop a general understanding of inter-annual BCC variation and our ability to use aquatic BCC as a sensitive metric of environmental change.					; Jones, Stuart/ABD-5264-2021; McMahon, Katherine/JXY-0145-2024	McMahon, Katherine D./0000-0002-7038-026X; Jones, Stuart/0000-0003-4740-6721														1664-302X					2012	3								318	10.3389/fmicb.2012.00318	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2012.00318								22969757					WOS:000208863600030

Studying the temporal dynamics patterns of algal production efficiency and its drivers in individual lakes is useful for analyzing the evolutionary trajectory of Chla-TP changes, and identifying the main controlling factors of eutrophication to guide lake management. In this study, we used a dataset for the Lake Gehu (1986-2020) to analyze the drivers of the ETP variability on interannual and seasonal time scales and to quantify the relative impacts and contributions of nutrient and climatic factors on the ETP. The results showed a negative correlation of the Chla-TP relationship appeared in years with very high ETP. The effects of nutritional and climatic factors on the ETP at different time scales were quantified using a generalized additive model. The results showed that the total phosphorus (TP) concentration had a significant effect on the interannual ETP variation, explaining up to 28.9 %. At the intra-annual scale, climatic variables had a much greater effect on the ETP than the nutrient concentration, and the explanatory effect was ranked as temperature > wind speed > rainfall > total nitrogen (TN). Based on the characteristics of seasonal ETP variations, the TPa of Lake Gehu were 50 mu g/L, 33 mu g/L, 20 mu g/L with ETP levels of 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, respectively. This research highlights the significance of nutrient and cli-matic factors in interannual and seasonal scale, respectively. In addition, ETP influenced by the coupling of nutrient and climate provides a criterion for establishing the seasonal nutrient threshold of lakes.

Therefore, in this study, modern pollen rain was characterized using artificial pollen traps under different ecological conditions and climatic seasons in Trilha da Mata Lake, Carajas North Ridge, southeastern Amazonia. The collection of pollen rain data comprises the total period from September 2015 to August 2016. There were two periods of low rainfall (September to December 2015 and May to August 2016) and one period of high rainfall (January to April 2016). The first two periods were represented by a predominance of canga vegetation pollen relative to forest pollen. Under dry conditions, the associations among the taxa Aparisthmium/Alchornea, Myrcia and Bellucia dichotoma were considered important for forest ecosystems, while those among Pleroma, Hyptis parkeri, Borreria and Perama carajensis were considered important for canga ecosystems. Under wet conditions, the forests were well represented by Schefflera, Anthurium lindmanianum, Pseudopiptadenia suaveolens and Glycydendron, and the most represented canga vegetation in the pollen rain were Poaceae undif., Miconia, M. acutistipula var. ferrea and Psychotria. Aparisthmium/Alchornea and Poaceae undif. Aparisthmium/Alchornea was related to periods of low water availability, and Poaceae undif. was associated with marshy or flooded environments. Thus, an increase in the influx of Poaceae undif. pollen grains was determined by variations in the extension of flooded areas, indicating an increase in the amount of rainfall and not the opposite case. Thus, future studies on vegetation reconstruction must consider modern pollen assemblages to precisely determine paleoenvironmental and paleoclimate conditions during sediment deposition.					; Alves, Ronnie/U-9893-2019; Lopes, Karen/ABB-9841-2020; Secco, Ricardo/X-1977-2019; Romeiro, Luiza de/JHT-1542-2023; Guimarães, José/D-2079-2013	GUIMARAES, JOSE TASSO/0000-0002-5772-5104; da Silva Lopes, Karen/0000-0002-1608-550X; Silva, Edilson/0000-0001-9766-2278; de Araujo Romeiro, Luiza/0000-0002-3920-7987; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				MAY	2020	30	5					721	732	0959683619895586	10.1177/0959683619895586	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683619895586		JAN 2020											WOS:000507194300001

Fluvial Impact of Extensive Active Layer Detachments, Cape Bounty, Melville Island, Canada	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH					2nd Sediment Budgets in Cold Environments Workshop	SEP 15-19, 2007	Abisko, SWEDEN					Exceptional and persistent warm temperatures recorded during July 2007 at Cape Bounty, Melville Island, Canada (74 degrees 54'N, 109 degrees 35'W), resulted in rapid and deep active layer formation. The thickened active layer, together with up to 10.8 mm of rainfall in late July, resulted in widespread active layer detachments across the West watershed during 23-31 July. Mapping indicates that approximately 1.9% of the watershed was directly impacted by disturbances. By contrast, only two small detachments occurred in the adjacent East watershed. The immediate fluvial impact of the detachments was primarily in the form of abrupt, short-lived rises in river turbidity, along with a more gradual increase ill discharge and overall turbidity. Sediment transport Pulses resulted from the hydrological connection of major detachment slides, most of which were upslope from the main channel. The largest detachment dammed the river over a length of 200 m, and resulted ill an upstream pond and prolonged increased sediment transport. In total, the increased sediment transport during the last week of July amounted to an estimated 44.3 Mg, or 18% of the seasonal yield. While the detachments had an immediate and substantial impact on river conditions, erosion of unstable material is likely to have a Sustained impact on watershed fluxes in future years.

Climate change in Brazil: perspective on the biogeochemistry of inland waters	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												Although only a small amount of the Earth's water exists as continental surface water bodies, this compartment plays an important role in the biogeochemical cycles connecting the land to the atmosphere. The territory of Brazil encompasses a dense river net and enormous number of shallow lakes. Human actions have been heavily influenced by the inland waters across the country. Both biodiversity and processes in the water are strongly driven by seasonal fluvial forces and/or precipitation. These macro drivers are sensitive to climate changes. In addition to their crucial importance to humans, inland waters are extremely rich ecosystems, harboring high biodiversity, promoting landscape equilibrium (connecting ecosystems, maintaining animal and plant flows in the landscape, and transferring mass, nutrients and inocula), and controlling regional climates through hydrological-cycle feedback. In this contribution, we describe the aquatic ecological responses to climate change in a conceptual perspective, and we then analyze the possible climate-change scenarios in different regions in Brazil. We also indentify some potential biogeochemical signals in running waters, natural lakes and man-made impoundments. The possible future changes in climate and aquatic ecosystems in Brazil are highly uncertain. Inland waters are pressured by local environmental changes because of land uses, landscape fragmentation, damming and diversion of water bodies, urbanization, wastewater load, and level of pollutants can alter biogeochemical patterns in inland waters over a shorter term than can climate changes. In fact, many intense environmental changes may enhance the effects of changes in climate. Therefore, the maintenance of key elements within the landscape and avoiding extreme perturbation in the systems are urgent to maintain the sustainability of Brazilian inland waters, in order to prevent more catastrophic future events.

J	Hipsher, C; Barker, J; MacKay, A				Hipsher, Carissa; Barker, Joel; MacKay, Allison			Impact of bloom events on dissolved organic matter fluorophore signatures in Ohio waters	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Due to the increase in severe cyanobacterial blooms in drinking water sources and recreational waters across the globe, inexpensive and reliable methods of detecting oncoming blooms arc needed. Cyanobacterial blooms can contribute substantially to the bulk chromophoric dissolved organic matter pool. Thus, the fluorescence signature of organic matter derived from these blooms may be an indicator of upcoming blooms. Water samples from five sites around Ohio were collected regularly between February and October 2017. A PARAFAC model was developed to determine if these protein-like fluorophores could be linked to bloom biomass and whether they were absent in dissolved organic matter from oligotrophic waters. One reference site at an oligotrophic reservoir was included to confirm the lack of protein-like fluorophores in the absence of a bloom event. We found that an increase in tryptophan-like and tyrosine-like fluorophores occurs before the increase in chlorophyll a levels, associated with bloom biomass, in some Ohio waters affected by cyanobacterial blooms; however, protein-like fluorophores are not correlated with levels of the cyanotoxin, microcystin. The excitation and emission wavelengths of these fluorophores (tryptophan-like: 239/341 nm, tyrosine-like: 248/306 nm) may be used to monitor impending blooms in waters heavily impacted by cyanobacteria but may not be applicable to waters receiving treated wastewater discharges.

It is the fourth Italian largest lake and is one of the largest endorheic basins in western Europe. Because of its shallow depth and the absence of natural outflows, the lake, in historical times, alternated from periods of floods to strong decreases of the water level during periods of prolonged drought. Lake water is characterised by a NaCl composition and relatively high salinity. The geochemical and isotopic monitoring of lake water from 2006 to 2018 shows the presence of well-defined seasonal trends, strictly correlated to precipitation regime and evaporation. These trends are clearly highlighted by the isotopic composition of lake water (delta O-18 and delta D) and by the variations of dissolved mobile species. In the long term, a progressive warming of lake water and a strong increase of total dissolved inorganic solids have been observed, indicating Lake Trasimeno as a paradigmatic example of how climate change can cause large variations of water quality and quantity. Furthermore, the rate of variation of lake water temperature is very close to the rate of variation of land-surface air temperature, LSAT, suggesting that shallow endorheic lakes can be used as a proxy for global warming measurements.

Genetic structure in Elk persists after translocation	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Elk (Cervus canadensis) translocation success is thought to be facilitated by high post-release herd cohesion and limited movements; both should ensure genetic mixing following release. Such mixing is important to reduce potential effects of inbreeding or genetic drift, which can be especially important in small founding populations. We had a natural experiment where we could evaluate genetic mixing of 2 distinct lineages of elk after translocation to the same area. Founding elk ultimately came from north and south of a road barrier at Elk Island National Park (EINPN or EINPS, respectively), Alberta, Canada and the 2 groups were genetically distinct. During 2000 to 2003, elk originating from Elk Island National Park were translocated to Cumberland Mountains, Tennessee (TNCM) and Great Smoky Mountains National Park, North Carolina (GSMNP), USA (some elk spent time at Land Between the Lakes Recreation Area, Kentucky, USA, before their final translocation). At TNCM, translocated elk were hard released, whereas at GSMNP elk were held in pens up to 60 days before release (i.e., soft release). We hypothesized that associations formed in the source population would affect genetic structure in the future population. We predicted that matrilineal groups would stay closer together and have similar movements after translocation. We used 16 microsatellite markers to analyze genetic composition and structure of translocated elk and their offspring in the years after release. Most source elk used for translocation strongly assigned to either EINPN or EINPS (93.2%, n=204). Evaluating the genetic structure of offspring after translocation, we found the 2 genetic groups mostly persisted 11 years following release. We measured the Euclidean distance between all possible pairs of telemetered female elk during each season and year and calculated the maximum distance moved from the release sites for females surviving >1 year. Mean Euclidean distances between pairwise locations of female elk were similar for each genetic cluster for each area. The mean distances for all paired locations (genetic clusters combined) in TNCM were 14.67km (n=4,57613.23 [SD]) and in GSMNP were 9.30km (n=1,468 +/- 9.75). However, when looking at only simultaneous locations <50m apart, the frequency of occurrence was higher (P<0.001) for elk with the same genetic structure (71.1%) compared with those with different structure (28.9%). The maximum distance travelled from the release site was not different for the 2 genetic groups, but EINPN females tended to travel farther. Pairwise female distances were lower in GSMNP where we used a soft release. Release methodology and social structure appear to affect movements and possibly genetic mixing after translocation. Given that restoration success can depend on maintaining genetic diversity and number of founders, our analyses suggest that within-cluster breeding bias can result in lower genetic variability and a smaller effective population size than previously assumed.

Apart from the monitoring initiatives recommended in the Global Monitoring Plan for POPs, the study discussed 7 OCPs and 18 PCB congeners determined in three Cyprinidae species (rudd, carp, and Prussian carp) from Vransko Lake (Croatia), which are widely domesticated and reared as food fish across Europe and Asia. We exploit advanced classification algorithms, the Kohonen self-organizing maps (SOM) and Decision Trees (DT), to search for POP patterns typical for the investigated species. As indicated by SOM, some of the dioxin-like and non-dioxin-like PCBs (PCB-28, PCB-74, PCB-52, PCB-101, PCB-105, PCB-114, PCB-118, PCB-156 and PCB-157), alpha-HCH and beta-HCH caused dissimilarities among fish species, but regardless of their weight and length. To support these suggestions, DT analysis sequenced the fish species and seasons based on the concentration of heavier congeners. The presented assumptions indicated that the supplemental application of SOM and DT offers advantageous features over the usually rough interpretation of POPs pattern and over the single use of the methods.					; Jovanović, Gordana/L-8167-2015; Antanasijević, Davor/D-4242-2014; Jovanovic, Gordana/L-8167-2015; Popovic, Aleksandar/P-2390-2016	Klincic, Darija/0000-0003-0793-0991; Jovanovic, Gordana/0000-0001-8657-423X; Popovic, Aleksandar/0000-0003-0162-9612; Matek Saric, Marijana/0000-0003-2734-7955													0013-9351	1096-0953				AUG	2018	165						349	357		10.1016/j.envres.2018.05.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2018.05.003								29783084					WOS:000437551200041

Elevated phosphorus levels are a concern due to their ability to cause changes in freshwater ecosystems that are detrimental to humans and wildlife. In the present study, long-term trends in total phosphorus (TP) concentrations from 20 rivers in central Massachusetts from 1999 to 2013 were investigated. Kendall's correlation coefficients were used to demonstrate that 18 of the 20 rivers had significant reductions in TP concentrations (P < 0.05). A similar trend was found when flow-adjusted TP concentrations were analyzed. At the beginning of monitoring activities, the average TP concentration in 9 of the 20 rivers was greater than 0.05 mg/L and 6 of these 9 rivers contained TP concentrations greater than 0.1 mg/L; about fifteen years later, only 3 rivers contained TP greater than 0.05 mg/L and none had concentrations> 0.1 mg/L. TP decreases were greater in rivers with more anthropogenic inputs. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the decline of TP in these Massachusetts streams is likely the result of advancements in wastewater treatment and implementation of effective non-point source management practices.

J	Freese, HM; Martin-Creuzburg, D				Freese, Heike M.; Martin-Creuzburg, Dominik			Food quality of mixed bacteria-algae diets for Daphnia magna	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Bacteria can comprise a large fraction of seston in aquatic ecosystems and can therefore significantly contribute to diets of filter-feeding zooplankton. To assess the effect of three heterotrophic bacteria (Flavobacterium sp., Pseudomonas sp. and Escherichia coli) on survival, growth and egg production of juvenile Daphnia magna during six-day growth experiments, five ratios of bacteria-Scenedesmus obliquus mixtures were fed. Potential growth-limiting effects mediated by essential biochemicals were assessed upon supplementation of pure bacterial diets with a sterol (cholesterol) or a polyunsaturated fatty acid (EPA). Pure bacterial diets always had detrimental effects on Daphnia. However, cholesterol supplementation of Flavobacterium sp. enhanced growth rates of Daphnia. Diets containing Pseudomonas impaired Daphnia growth even at low dietary proportions (20%), indicating their toxicity. In contrast, Daphnia grew at relative high dietary proportions of Flavobacterium sp. and E. coli (80-50%). In fact, diets containing small proportions of these heterotrophic bacteria (Flavobacterium a parts per thousand currency sign50%, E. coli 20%) even significantly increased Daphnia growth rates compared to pure algal diets, indicating a nutritional upgrading by these bacteria. Our results suggest that the relative contribution of bacteria and phytoplankton to total dietary carbon as well as their phylogenetic composition strongly influence Daphnia fitness and potentially other filter-feeding zooplankton under field conditions.

Seasonality and disturbance: annual pattern and response of the bacterial and microbial eukaryotic assemblages in a freshwater ecosystem	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												High-throughput pyrosequencing of SSU rDNA genes was used to obtain monthly snapshots of eukaryotic and bacterial diversity and community structure at two locations in Lake Texoma, a low salinity lake in the south central United States, over 1 year. The lake experienced two disturbance events (i) a localized bloom of Prymnesium parvum restricted to one of the locations that lasted from January to April, and (ii) a large (17cm), global rain event in the beginning of May, overlaid onto seasonal environmental change. Eukaryotic species richness as well as both eukaryotic and bacterial community similarity exhibited seasonal patterns, including distinct responses to the rain event. The P.parvum bloom created a natural experiment in which to directly explore the effects of an Ecosystem Disruptive Algal Bloom (EDAB) on the microbial community separated from seasonal changes. Microbial species richness was unaffected by the bloom, however, the eukaryotic community structure (evenness) and the patterns of both eukaryotic and bacterial community similarity at bloom and non-bloom sites were statistically distinct during the 4 months of the bloom. These results indicate that physical and biological disturbances as well as seasonal environmental forces contribute to the structure of both the eukaryotic and bacterial communities.					; Hambright, Karl/D-4086-2012	Najar, Fares Z./0000-0003-1174-6206; Hambright, K.

Cyanobacteria, a phylum of bacteria that obtains energy by oxygenic photosynthesis, can be found in almost every terrestrial and aquatic habitat on Earth and play an important role in global carbon and oxygen cycles and as food sources for fish. However, common bloom-forming cyanobacteria in the genus Microcystis produce microcystins that are toxic to human beings and aquatic animals and can have disastrous effects in aquatic ecosystems. 2. Algal species follow seasonal successions of bloom formation and Microcystis spp. have been reported to be more competitive than other algal species in lakes. However, so far there has been no clear demonstration of competition among Microcystis species. 3. By means of growth experiments, we demonstrate that two common cyanobacterial species Microcystis aeruginosa FACHB-905 and Microcystis flos-aquae FACHB-1028, which are the dominant toxigenic species in Lake Taihu, exhibit a competitive relationship under coculture condition, the former outcompeting the latter. 4. We show that M. aeruginosa is a superior competitor to M. flos-aquae regardless of temperature, nutrients and initial abundance ratios. Moreover, both unicultured filtrates of M. aeruginosa and cocultured filtrates of both species strongly inhibit the growth of M. flos-aquae. 5. An analysis using gas chromatography mass spectrometry of extracts of filtrates from unicultures and cocultures indicates that some extracellular allelopathic compounds produced by M. aeruginosa, such as D-limonene and 1-chlorine heptacosane, might play important roles in competition among the species.																			0046-5070					SEP	2013	58	9					1831	1839		10.1111/fwb.12172	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12172													WOS:000321328800006

However, the variations in environmental factors may have an impact on the quality of water, as changes in these attributes may affect the water bodies. These factors include the topographical, geological, lithological and soil type parameters of the watershed. In this study, the relationship amongst the physico-chemical, topographical, geological, lithological and soil type parameters of Rawal watershed was evaluated. The parameters included in the present study could be classified as follows: (a) water quality parameters (b) topographical parameters, (c) geological parameters, (d) lithological parameters, and (e) soil type parameters. Water quality parameters consisted of dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity and temperature. The topographical parameters include the slope and aspect of the watershed while the lithological, geological and soil type parameters include the lithology, geology and soil type of the watershed. Pearson's correlation was used to determine the relationship amongst these different parameters. The results have revealed that the correlations of the topographical, lithological, geological parameters with the water quality parameters in the Rawal watershed for the monsoon seasons of June to August mostly have the same trend. Throughout the four year time period, turbidity and temperature parameters had positive correlations with soil type (ranging 0.03-0.24), however had weak correlation with geological and lithological parameters. Dissolved oxygen did not show any relationship with topographical and lithological parameters. The results for pH show that it has weak to fair positive correlations with topographical parameters. However, this analysis is based on the Landsat 8 images extracted for the monsoon seasons of the years of 2017-2020, and to examine a more prominent impact of geographical or environmental factors on the physico-chemical features, a large dataset should be considered.

We examined site-to-site differences in the pattern of variation in the daily water temperatures observed at water intakes located in nearshore regions of the Great Lakes. Data from 28 nearshore sites spread across all five lakes were analyzed. At each site, daily differences between nearshore and lake-wide surface water temperatures varied systematically with season, and these seasonal patterns varied systematically from site to site. We characterized these patterns using an index derived from quantile regression. Index values were related to site-specific factors such as depth, fetch and exposure. We broadened these empirical analyses to develop a tool for extending, to nearshore water temperatures, previously published projections of climate change impacts on lake-wide mean surface water temperatures. This tool provided projections of the possible impacts of increasing surface water temperatures on nearshore water temperatures under a climate change scenario for the Great Lakes region. Projections were generated for nearshore sites characterized by a range of depth and fetch values representative of those found throughout the Great Lakes. Projected impacts varied with site characteristics, with likely implications for biological activity and human use.

However, there has been a lack of research on the seasonal variation of sediment microorganisms in the sediments of small river basins in typical semi-arid region. In this study, high-throughput DNA sequencing was used to investigate the fungal community and its influencing factors in the sediment of the Dali River in the dry and wet seasons. The results showed that there were obvious seasonal differences in fungal alpha diversity. The diversity and richness of fungi in the dry season were greater than that in the wet season, but the evenness of fungi in the dry season was lower than that in the wet season. In addition, Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the most important phyla in the Dali River fungal community, but their distributions showed clear seasonal differences. In the dry season, the relative abundance of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were 12.34-46.42% and 17.59-27.20%, respectively. In the wet season, the relative abundances of these two phyla were 24.33-36.56% and 5.75-12.26%, respectively. PICRUSt2 was used to predict the metabolic function of fungal community in the sediment, and it was found that at the first level, the proportion of biosynthesis in the dry season was higher than that in the wet season. The ecological network structure showed that the fungal community in the wet season was more complex and stable than that in the dry season. The characteristic fungi in the dry season sediment were chytrid fungi in the family Rhizophydiaceae and the order Rhizophydiales, whereas those in the wet season sediment were in the orders Eurotiales and Saccharomycetales. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that the physicochemical properties of water and sediment together explained a greater proportion of the dry-season fungal community changes than of the wet-season changes. In the dry season, temperature and ammonia nitrogen in the water were the main factors affecting the change of fungal community, whereas in the wet season, total nitrogen concentration of the water, electrical conductivity, total organic carbon and available phosphorus of the sediment, pH, and temperature were the main factors affecting the changes in fungal community composition. The results of this study enhanced our understanding of microbial communities in semi-arid river ecosystems, and highlight the importance of the management and protection in river ecosystems.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				DEC	2023	30	59					123694	123709		10.1007/s11356-023-31042-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-023-31042-1		NOV 2023						37993647					WOS:001126554100008

Thermokarst lakes and ponds (TLPs), which are widely distributed in the Lena Basin in the Russian Arctic, play a vital role in altering local ecosystem. However, the detailed distribution of TLPs in the Lena Basin still remains poorly known. In this study, we built the first 10 m resolution TLP dataset for the Lena Basin in the 2020 thawing season by utilizing 4902 Sentinel-2 images. A robust mapping workflow was developed and implemented in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The accuracy assessment demonstrates a satisfactory accuracy (93.63%), and our results exhibit a better consistency with real TLPs than global water body products. A total of 380,477 TLPs (similar to 0.53% of the total surface area of the Lena Basin) were identified, showing an uneven distribution in the five sub-basins. The TLPs were found to be mainly located within plain areas, with an active layer thickness in the range of 80-100 cm. The higher ground ice content and mean annual ground temperature were favorable for TLP development. This dataset will be valuable for investigating the complex interaction between TLPs and permafrost. It will also serve as a baseline product for better incorporating thermokarst processes into permafrost-climate models.

J	Li, XX; Qin, XC; Yang, J; Zhang, YZ				Li, Xiangxiang; Qin, Xiaochen; Yang, Jun; Zhang, Yizhi			Evaluation of ERA5, ERA-Interim, JRA55 and MERRA2 reanalysis precipitation datasets over the Poyang Lake Basin in China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Increasing variability of precipitation induced by climate change raises uncertainties for ecosystem services and agricultural production in the Poyang Lake Basin (PLB), China. Reanalysis precipitation datasets (RPDs) are attractive alternatives for monitoring the hydro-climate cycles. However, their applicability in China has mainly been evaluated at the national scale, while less attention has been paid to the PLB or southeastern China. Here, we apply various metrics to evaluate the magnitude and spatial similarity of annual, monthly, different intensities and the spatial structure of precipitation from four reanalysis-the fifth global atmospheric analysis dataset of the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) (ERA5), Interim ECMWF Reanalysis (ERA-Interim), Japanese 55-year Reanalysis project (JRA55) and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2), against the rain-gauges over the PLB during 1980-2018. The results showed that the detection capacity of ERA5 and MERRA2 shifted around 2002, whereas that of ERA-Interim and JRA55 did not substantially change. Before 2002, ERA-Interim had the lowest biases for the magnitude of annual, monthly and different intensities of precipitation (except for heavy rain), while ERA5 and MERRA2 had strengths in capturing spatial correlation. Notably, ERA5 and MERRA2 had region-wide wet and dry biases, respectively, before 2002, which can be attributed mainly to the estimation of flood season precipitation (from April to June) and heavy rain. In contrast, the fractional contribution of light-moderate rain was underestimated and overestimated by ERA5 and MERRA2, respectively. However, after 2002, because of the improved reproducibility of flood season precipitation and heavy rain magnitude, the systematic biases of ERA5 and MERRA2 significantly decreased, especially for ERA5, which outperformed other RPDs on all aspects of precipitation. The conclusions of this paper suggest that the variation of applicability over time should be seriously tested before the utilization of RPDs in hydro-climate analyses.						li, xiangxiang/0000-0002-2133-8188													0899-8418	1097-0088				DEC 30	2022	42	16					10435	10450		10.1002/joc.7915	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.7915		NOV 2022											WOS:000883184400001

In this study, the snowline and SLA over the Tibetan plateau (TP) during 2001 to 2013 are extracted using the cloud-removed MODIS daily fractional snow cover (FSC) products combined with digital elevation model (DEM), and the spatiotemporal changes of SLA and their response to the changing temperature are examined. The proposed MODIS-based SLA-extracting methodology includes cloud removal from MODIS FSC data, the determination of the snowline and SLA, and the establishment of the snowline altitude field (SLAF). Results show that the SLA in the interior of the TP is obviously higher than the peripheral mountainous area due to the complex terrain. There is no obvious trend of SLA change during the examined period although a strong seasonal and interannual variability of SLA is discovered. The interannual fluctuation of SLA in the snowmelt period can be explained by the high-positive correlations between the SLA and temperature. The MODIS-based SLA-extracting method described has a good application potential in SLA monitoring for other regions.

The effect of physicochemical parameters on the abundance of zooplankton of River Adada, Enugu, Nigeria	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Because of the pivotal role of zooplankton in most aquatic ecosystems; there is constant need to explore the effect of stressors (such as physicochemical properties of freshwater) on their abundance. We documented the effect of temperature, pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrate (NO3-), and phosphate (PO43-) on the abundance of zooplankton of the River Adada, Nigeria. Using a manual pump, zooplankton were collected from three strategic stations from January to April (dry season) and June to September (rainy season). A total of 2,219 (dry = 945; rainy = 1,274) zooplankton occurred in the following descending order of abundance: copepods < rotifers < cladocerans < ostracods < insect larva. Whereas based on species number, cladocerans (n = 10) < copepods (n = 8) < rotifers (n = 7) < insect larva (n = 4) < ostracods (n = 2) occurred in this descending order. The downstream (station C) had more zooplankton (dry = 427; rainy = 391), followed by the mid-stream (station B; dry = 216; rainy = 591) and upstream (station A; dry = 302; rainy = 292). There was also a significant (P < 0.05) joint interactive effect of thermal condition on turbidity, pH, DO, PO43- and NO3- to influence zooplankton abundance. Indicating that temperature is an important factor determining the assemblage of zooplankton in freshwater. Nevertheless, to assure an accurate evaluation of the effect of physicochemical parameters on zooplankton abundance in freshwater, future studies should include extended study periods and make use of more sophisticated trapping technique that would ensure the collection of a larger sample size with more species of zooplankton.

High-resolution Sr-isotopic evolution of Black Sea water during the Holocene: Implications for reconnection with the global ocean	MARINE GEOLOGY												The 10 m-thick Holocene succession at core site M02-45 (41 degrees 41.17'N, 28 degrees 19.08'E, -69 m water depth) has key advantages for investigation of the Sr-isotopic evolution of the Holocene Black Sea. Earlier studies have focussed on thinner successions and coquinas. At the M02-45 site (augmented by nearby core M05-03P),Sr-87/Sr-86 determinations on mollusc shells extracted at mostly 10-20 cm depth increments provide a temporal resolution mostly < 200 years in sediment older than similar to 5500 cal yr BP, and similar to 20-25 years for the early Holocene reconnection between the Black Sea (formerly the Neoeuxine Lake) and the global ocean. Isotopic measurements are in stratigraphic order, so temporal trends are unambiguous. Measurements were made using a Neptune multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICPMS) and have 1 sigma uncertainties of similar to +/- 0.000015. There are four stages of Sr-87/(86) Sr increase and salination associated with the reconnection. From 12,145-9580 cal yr BP (stage A), before first Mediterranean inflow, the Sr-isotopic ratio varied from 0.708847-0.708881. Modelling suggests that the Sr concentration in the Neoeuxine Lake might have been several times higher than modern river values because of evaporative concentration. For similar to 100 years immediately before reconnection (9580-9490 cal yr BP, stage B),Sr-87/(86) values dropped to their lowest levels: 0.708841-0.708843. Abruptly (in geological terms),Sr-87/(86) then began to climb starting 9465-9490 cal yr BP and reached a quasi-steady-state 'plateau' with ratios similar to 0.708965 by similar to 9380 cal yr BP (stage C). The sharp Sr-87/(86) increase marks the first significant intrusion of saline water into a previously isolated Neoeuxine Lake. The quasi-steady-state condition lasted 350-400 years. Subsequently, starting similar to 8985 cal yr BP and proceeding to the present day, there was a step-wise rise of Sr-87/(86) to modern levels (stage D), during which a salinity threshold was passed that allowed widespread replacement of brackish-water faunas by Mediterranean species. Modelling suggests that the lake/sea level likely did not, and could not, rise from -120 m to - 30 m between 9490 and 9380 cal yr BP unless (a) the Sr concentration in the pre-reconnection Neoeuxine Lake was 3-4 times higher than today, or (b) the water column was strongly stratified during first entry of saline water. The second alternative is very unlikely because of seasonal vertical mixing (downwelling/upwelling) in what was then a rather homogeneous temperate lake. Catastrophic flooding of a lowstand lake would require an average discharge through the Strait of Bosphorus of similar to 9500 m(3)s(-1), whereas saline entry of Mediterranean water as an underflow into an already high lake could reproduce the first stage of Sr-87/(86) increase with an average discharge as low as similar to 2200 m(3)s(-1). Because the M02-45 site is similar to 50 m above the late Pleistocene lowstand shoreline and contains sub-wavebase sediments with Sr-87/(86) values that record the first entry of saline water into the Neoeuxine Lake, the surface of the lake must have been significantly higher than - 70 m at the time of the reconnection. Two prominent 'plateaux' which punctuate the long-term Sr-87/(86) increase are attributed to decadal to centennial periods of increased discharge from European rivers, creating a positive hydrological balance and effectively blocking or seriously impeding saline-water advance up the Strait of Bosphorus toward the Black Sea.					; Grimes, Vaughan/AAG-5174-2021	Grimes, Vaughan/0000-0002-2177-3147; 													0025-3227	1872-6151				JAN	2019	407						213	228		10.1016/j.margeo.2018.11.004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.margeo.2018.11.004													WOS:000456222900014

Consequently, reproductive effort in capital breeders is expected to depend on traits associated with energy storage rather than environmental conditions at the time of reproduction. Based on a 15-year dataset, we investigate the effect of phenotype (body size and condition) and environmental conditions (intensity of hydrological seasons, predator density, and density of conspecifics) on fecundity three capital breeding fish species from the strongly seasonal Amazon River floodplain: Psectrogaster rutiloides, Triportheus angulatus, and Acestrorhynchus falcirostris. Fecundity of all three species was strongly correlated with phenotype and modulated by unfavorable environmental conditions during the period of reproduction, especially high density of conspecifics. Fecundity was negatively affected by the density of conspecifics for small females of A. falcirostris, and for T. angulatus females with poor body condition. Fecundity of P. rutiloides declined during periods of drought when density of conspecifics was highest. A clear tradeoff between quantity and quality of oocytes was found only for P. rutiloides. This study highlights that reproductive allocation of capital breeders in seasonal environments is strongly linked to environmental conditions before and during the reproductive period.

The mean CH4 fluxes were 66.0 +/- 44.1 mu g m(-2) h(-1) in the bispecies polyculture system of swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus with kuruma shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus (PM) and 68.7 +/- 39.5 mu g m(-2) h(-1) in the trispecies polyculture system of swimming crab with shrimp and short-necked clam Ruditapes philippinarum (PMR), and no significant differences were observed between them. CH4 emissions showed temporal variability during the farming season, peaking in mid-August. The linear mixed-effect model demonstrated that air temperature was the main regulator of CH4 fluxes rather than the internal physical and chemical properties of the systems. Air, water and sediment temperatures explained 58.9, 61.4 and 55.3% of the CH4 flux variations in the PM and 64.6, 57.1 and 60.8% of the variations in the PMR, respectively. Reducing organic matter accumulation in the sediment by means of im-proving feeding efficiency and the application of integrated aquaculture are likely to be effective in reducing CH4 emissions from aquaculture systems.					; Zhang, Dongxu/KMA-1901-2024	Dong, Shuanglin/0000-0003-0320-9136; 													1869-215X	1869-7534					2019	11						63	73		10.3354/aei00295	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/aei00295													WOS:000461443700002

Microbial community diversity patterns are related to physical and chemical differences among temperate lakes near Beaver Island, MI	PEERJ												Lakes are dynamic and complex ecosystems that can be influenced by physical, chemical, and biological processes. Additionally, individual lakes are often chemically and physically distinct, even within the same geographic region. Here we show that differences in physicochemical conditions among freshwater lakes located on (and around) the same island, as well as within the water column of each lake, are significantly related to aquatic microbial community diversity. Water samples were collected over time from the surface and bottom-water within four freshwater lakes located around Beaver Island, MI within the Laurentian Great Lakes region. Three of the sampled lakes experienced seasonal lake mixing events, impacting either 02, pH, temperature, or a combination of the three. Microbial community alpha and beta diversity were assessed and individual microbial taxa were identified via high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Results demonstrated that physical and chemical variability (temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH) were significantly related to divergence in the beta diversity of surface and bottom-water microbial communities. Despite its correlation to microbial community structure in unconstrained analyses, constrained analyses demonstrated that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration was not strongly related to microbial community structure among or within lakes. Additionally, several taxa were correlated (either positively or negatively) to environmental variables, which could be related to aerobic and anaerobic metabolisms. This study highlights the measurable relationships between environmental conditions and microbial communities within freshwater temperate lakes around the same island.

Heavy metals in water, sediment, fish and associated risks from an endorheic lake located in Southern Africa	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The study assessed heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb and Zn) and physico-chemical parameters in water, sediments and fish from an endorheic lake (Lake Chilwa) in Malawi. It was observed that pH (max. 9.7), EC (max. 2936 mu S/cm), TDS (max. 2119 mg/L), NO3- (max. 6.6 mg/L) and PO43- (max. 1.3 mg/L) were higher in the dry season than in the rainy season. Pb was not detected in all samples. However, the rest of heavy metals were detected with significant values of Mn and Cu in fish (Mn: 0.015-1.18 mg/kg dry weight, dw; Cu: 0.41-0.92 mg/kg dw) and sediment (Mn: 2.25-10.66 mg/kg dw; Cu: n.d-1.63 mg/kg dw). The concentrations of heavy metals in fish samples were below the maximum limits for edible fish recommended by Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization: Cd (0.1 mg/kg), Cu (3 mg/kg), Fe (43 mg/kg), Pb (0.2 mg/kg), Mn (2-9 mg/kg) and Zn (60 mg/kg). The calculated target hazard quotients (ranged from 0.001 to 1.07) indicated no human risks from fish consumption. Furthermore, dry season values for Mn, Cu and Zn in sediments were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those of the rainy season. Conversely, Fe in sediments was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the rainy season than in the dry season. The use of fertilizer and indiscriminate disposal of metal products contributes to the observed levels. This calls for reinforcement of suitable agricultural and waste management practices in the study area.					; Mapoma, Harold/F-1857-2013	Anifowose, Adebanjo Jacob/0000-0002-2003-6591; Sakugawa, Hiroshi/0000-0002-1903-3078; Kaonga, Chikumbusko/0000-0002-0185-9357; Chitete-Mawenda, Upile/0009-0006-2268-2649													1735-1472	1735-2630				JAN	2020	17	1					253	266		10.1007/s13762-019-02464-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-019-02464-7													WOS:000511892000023

The life aquatic in high relief: shifts in the physical and biological characteristics of alpine lakes along an elevation gradient in the Rocky Mountains, USA	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Rapidly occurring environmental changes in alpine lakes highlight the importance of better understanding the ecological structure and function associated with these systems. Previous research has identified how the physical characteristics of lakes change as a function of landscape position, but comparatively little is known about shifts in the biotic community across mountain regions. In 2016, we sampled 19 lakes across an elevation gradient (2480-3550 m a.s.l.) within the Rocky Mountains, USA, to evaluate how both the abiotic characteristics of lakes and their planktonic biological communities covaried with elevation. Based on generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), increases in elevation were associated with decreases in most nutrient concentrations (with the exception of nitrate), dissolved organic carbon, water temperature and lake stratification. Conversely, elevation increases were positively related to nitrate concentrations and water clarity. Extending this analysis to the biological community, we found that higher-elevation lakes exhibited lower phytoplankton and zooplankton densities, whereas elevation associated positively with average zooplankton size. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that the alpine environment acts as a strong niche filter, limiting the quantity and diversity of taxa to groups capable of tolerating the short growing season, high flushing rate, strong variation in interannual precipitation, intense ultraviolet radiation exposure, and lower resource availability associated with such habitats.

However, how affected zooplankton functional groups in rivers are largely unknown. In the present study zooplankton functional and taxonomic structure were investigated seasonally in relation to environmental parameters between 2013 and 2015 in Kocagay Delta located on the South of the Marmara Region. The environmental parameters (e.g. water temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, pH, chlorophylla and nutrients) were measured at four sampling station covering estuarine and riverine area. A total of 44 taxa of zooplankton were identified and mostly dominated by cosmopolite microphagous rotifers reflecting the proper intervals of environmental parameters for their habitat chokes. Among rotifers Microcodides chlaena and Keratella serrulata were the new records for the study site and Turkish rotifer list. The only selective filter feeder was Bosmina longirostris in Kocacay Delta. The zooplankton functional group, microphagous, showed seasonal variations and affected by chlorophyll-a content. We suggested that trait-based approaches would be a useful tool to assess the degree of environmental disturbance and interaction between trophic levels.					; Tavşanoğlu, Ülkü/AGK-9942-2022	Tavsanoglu, Ulku Nihan/0000-0001-8462-415X; 													1303-2712	2149-181X				JAN	2020	20	1					69	77																WOS:000473127600007

Assessing the role of bed sediments in the persistence of red mud pollution in a shallow lake (Kinghorn Loch, UK)	WATER RESEARCH												Red mud is a by-product of alumina production. Little is known about the long-term fate of red mud constituents in fresh waters or of the processes regulating recovery of fresh waters following pollution control. In 1983, red mud leachate was diverted away from Kinghorn Loch, UK, after many years of polluting this shallow and monomictic lake. We hypothesised that the redox-sensitive constituents of red mud leachate, phosphorus (P), arsenic (As) and vanadium (V), would persist in the Kinghorn Loch for many years following pollution control as a result of cycling between the lake bed sediment and the overlying water column. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a 12-month field campaign in Kinghorn Loch between May 2012 and April 2013 to quantify the seasonal cycling of P, As, and V in relation to environmental conditions (e.g., dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, pH, redox chemistry and temperature) in the lake surface and bottom waters. To confirm the mechanisms for P, As and V release, a sediment core incubation experiment was conducted using lake sediment sampled in July 2012, in which DO concentrations were manipulated to create either oxic or anoxic conditions similar to the bed conditions found in the lake. The effects on P, As, and V concentrations and species in the water column were measured daily over an eight-day incubation period. Phosphate (PO4-P) and dissolved As concentrations were significantly higher in the bottom waters (75.9 +/- 30.2 mu g L-1 and 23.5 +/- 1.83 mu g L-1, respectively) than in the surface waters (12.9 +/- 1.50 mu g L-1 and 14.1 +/- 2.20 mu g L-1, respectively) in Kinghorn Loch. Sediment release of As and P under anoxic conditions was confirmed by the incubation experiment and by the significant negative correlations between DO and P and As concentrations in the bottom waters of the lake. In contrast, the highest dissolved V concentrations occurred in the bottom waters of Kinghorn Loch under oxic conditions (15.0 +/- 3.35 mu g L-1), with the release from the bed sediment apparently being controlled by a combination of competitive ion concentrations, pH and redox conditions.

Interannual active layer variability at the Limnopolar Lake CALM site on Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island, Antarctica	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												In order to monitor the evolution of the active layer in the South Shetland Islands, in February 2009 we established a new Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) site in the Limnopolar Lake basin on Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island. We monitored air, surface and ground (two boreholes of 135 and 80 cm deep) temperatures and Active Layer Thickness (ALT) was measured by mechanical probing in early February 2009, 2010 and 2011. The mean ALT was 44 cm with a range of about 92 cm, but where permafrost existed it was deeper than 1.0 m, as could be inferred from the borehole temperatures. ALT at this site was very dependent on air temperature and snow cover thickness, the ALT spatial distribution presenting the same pattern as soil penetration resistance, and higher values ALT coinciding with sites where patterned ground, ponds, and a near surface ground water saturation were observed. Additionally, ground temperature data provided an excellent tool for understanding the relationship between the ALT measured during the thaw season and the thermal evolution of the ground throughout the year.

Dynamics of dissolved inorganic carbon and aquatic metabolism in the Tana River basin, Kenya	BIOGEOSCIENCES												A basin-wide study was conducted in the Tana River basin (Kenya) in February 2008 (dry season), September-November 2009 (wet season) and June-July 2010 (end of the wet season) to assess the dynamics and sources of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) as well as to quantify CO2 fluxes, community respiration (R), and primary production (P). Samples were collected along the altitudinal gradient (from 3600 to 8 m) in several headwater streams, reservoirs (Kamburu and Masinga), and the Tana River mainstream. DIC concentrations ranged from 0.2 to 4.8 mmol L-1, with exceptionally high values (3.5 +/- 1.6 mmol L-1) in Nyambene Hills tributaries. The wide range of delta C-13(DIC) values (-15.0 to -2.4 %) indicate variable sources of DIC, with headwater streams recording more positive signatures compared to the Tana River mainstream. With with only a few exceptions, the entire riverine network was supersaturated in CO2, implying the system is a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere. pCO(2) values were generally higher in the lower Tana River mainstream compared to headwater tributaries, opposite to the pattern typically observed in other river networks. This was attributed to high suspended sediment in the Tana River mainstream fuelling in-stream community respiration and net heterotrophy. This was particularly evident during the 2009 wet season campaign (median pCO(2) of 1432 ppm) compared to the 2010 end of the wet season (1002 ppm) and 2008 dry season (579 ppm). First-order estimates show that in-stream community respiration was responsible for the bulk of total CO2 evasion (77 to 114 %) in the Tana River mainstream, while in the tributaries, this could only account for 5 to 68% of total CO2 evasion. This suggests that CO2 evasion in the tributaries was to a substantial degree sustained by benthic mineralisation and/or lateral inputs of CO2-oversaturated groundwater. While sediment loads increased downstream and thus light availability decreased in the water column, both chlorophyll a (0.2 to 9.6 mu g L-1) and primary production (0.004 to 7.38 mu mol CL-1 h(-1)) increased consistently downstream. Diurnal fluctuations of biogeochemical processes were examined at three different sites along the river continuum (headwater, reservoir and mainstream), and were found to be substantial only in the headwater stream, moderate in the reservoir and not detectable in the Tana River mainstream. The pronounced diurnal fluctuations observed in the headwater stream were largely regulated by periphyton as deduced from the low chlorophyll a in the water column.					; Borges, Alberto/C-4989-2008; Van den Meersche, Karel/E-6909-2011; Bouillon, Steven/C-5177-2011; Meysman, Filip/C-9585-2009	Tamooh, Fredrick/0000-0001-6240-018X; Borges, Alberto V./0000-0002-5434-2247; Van den Meersche, Karel/0000-0002-0866-7657; Merckx, Roel/0000-0001-6440-5363; Bouillon, Steven/0000-0001-7669-2929; Meysman, Filip/0000-0001-5334-7655													1726-4170	1726-4189					2013	10	11					6911	6928		10.5194/bg-10-6911-2013	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-10-6911-2013													WOS:000327814700011
J	Markensten, H; Moore, K; Persson, I				Markensten, Hampus; Moore, Karen; Persson, Irina			Simulated lake phytoplankton composition shifts toward cyanobacteria dominance in a future warmer climate	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												The climate is expected to become warmer and wetter in many temperate regions and is expected to affect the water quality in lakes and reservoirs. In this paper, we investigate the impacts of a regional climate scenario on lake productivity using three models in sequence and quantify the response in biomass of three phytoplankton groups. We used a watershed model (GWLE), a physical lake model (PROBE), and a phytoplankton model (PROTBAS) for simulations of a large (61 km(2)), shallow (mean depth 3.4 m), wind-exposed lake basin with a short water retention time (1 month) at the western end of Lake Malaren, Sweden. The results suggest that a future scenario with increased warming leads to a longer growing season for phytoplankton, slightly increased levels of total biomass, and a distinct shift in phytoplankton groups to favor nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria at the expense of diatoms in this lake basin. The changes in the timing of nutrient export from the catchment are the primary cause of cyanobacteria dominance over diatoms, and elevated lake temperatures are responsible for the increase in total phytoplankton biomass.

Four restoration patterns were selected, including reed shoaly land (RL), poplar plantation land (PL), abandoned shoaly grassland (GL) and cultivated flower land (FL). The result showed a rapid growth trend at the initial stage of incubation, following the fastest change rate at 72 h in both dormant and growing seasons. The Average Well Color development (AWCD) values of RL pattern was the highest at the detection points of each culture time, while the GL were the lowest. The calculation of diversity indicators also displayed significant lower McIntosh index in dormant season and Shannon-Wiener index in growing season in GL than in the others (P< 0.05). Carbohydrates and carboxylic acids were found to be the main substrates used in dormant season, whereas amino acids, polymers and phenolic acids were increasingly utilized by the microbial communities in growing season. We observed soil total potassium as the key factor that significantly affected the utilization efficiency of different carbon sources in both seasons (P< 0.05).

Analysis of MC-LR and MC-RR in tissue from freshwater fish (Tinca tinca) and crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) in tench ponds (Caceres, Spain) by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)	FOOD AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY												In the present study a new method has been developed and validated for detecting free microcystins (MCs) (MC-RR, MC-LR and MC-YR) by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in the cyprinid Tinca tinca and in the crayfish Procambarus clarkii collected from three ponds in Extremadura (Spain) where the presence of the cyanobacteria species Microcystis aeruginosa and Anabaena spiroides has been confirmed. Once the method had been validated, free MCs were determined in fish (tench, T. tinca) and. crayfish from different ponds in order to understand how they are bioaccumulated through the food web. MCs were not detected in any of the fish samples analyzed. It was confirmed that P. clarkii accumulated MCs in their tissues without losing their organoleptic characteristics, with MC-LR (2.3-18.1 mu g MC-LR/g body weight) being the predominant MC variant detected in all the crayfish samples. MC-RR was measured in 50% of the samples analyzed, ranging between 1.4 and 7.8 mu g MC-RR/g body weight and no MC-YR was detected. The results indicated that crayfish can accumulate free MCs in higher quantities than tench that live in ponds contaminated by toxic cyanobacteria species, and emphasized the need for regular monitoring if the health risks associated with their consumption are to be avoided.

Influence of net ecosystem metabolism in transferring riverine organic carbon to atmospheric CO2 in a tropical coastal lagoon (Chilka Lake, India)	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Studies on biogeochemical cycling of carbon in the Chilka Lake, Asia's largest brackish lagoon on the east coast of India, revealed, for the first time, strong seasonal and spatial variability associated with salinity distribution. The lake was studied twice during May 2005 (premonsoon) and August 2005 (monsoon). It exchanges waters with the sea (Bay of Bengal) and several rivers open into the lake. The lake showed contrasting levels of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and organic carbon (DOC) in different seasons; DIC was higher by similar to 22% and DOC was lower by similar to 36% in premonsoon than in monsoon due to seasonal variations in their supply from rivers and in situ production/ mineralisation. The DIC/ DOC ratios in the lake during monsoon were influenced by physical mixing of end member water masses and by intense respiration of organic carbon. A strong relationship between excess DIC and apparent oxygen utilisation showed significant control of biological processes over CO2 production in the lake. Surface partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)), calculated using pH - DIC couple according to Cai and Wang (Limnol and Oceanogr 43: 657 - 668, 1998), exhibited discernable gradients during monsoon through northern (1,033 - 6,522 mu atm), central (391 - 2,573 mu atm) and southern (102 - 718 mu atm) lake. The distribution pattern of pCO(2) in the lake seems to be governed by pCO2 levels in rivers and their discharge rates, which were several folds higher during monsoon than premonsoon. The net CO2 efflux, based on gas transfer velocity parameterisation of Borges et al. (Limnol and Oceanogr 49(5): 1630 - 1641, 2004), from entire lake during monsoon (141 mmolC m(-2) d(-1) equivalent to 2.64 GgC d(-1) at basin scale) was higher by 44 times than during premonsoon (9.8 mmolC m(-2) d(-1) approximate to 0.06 GgC d(-1)). 15% of CO2 efflux from lake in monsoon was contributed by its supply from rivers and the rest was contributed by in situ heterotrophic activity. Based on oxygen and total carbon mass balance, net ecosystem production (NEP) of lake (- 308 mmolC m(-2) d(-1) approximate to - 3.77 GgC d(-1)) was found to be almost in consistent with the total riverine organic carbon trapped in the lake (229 mmolC m(-2) d(-1) approximate to 2.80 GgC d(-1)) suggesting that the strong heterotrophy in the lake is mainly responsible for elevated fluxes of CO2 during monsoon. Further, the pelagic net community production represented 92% of NEP and benthic compartment plays only a minor role. This suggests that Chilka lake is an important region in biological transformation of organic carbon to inorganic carbon and its export to the atmosphere.

Physical, chemical and biological water column measurements combined with long-term water monitoring data for six closely located crater lakes, in Southeast Asia, were compared to assess the response of lakes along a productivity gradient equating to a transect of increasing aquaculture intensity. Increasing chlorophyll a (phytoplankton biomass) in the upper waters appeared to modify the thermocline depth and light availability causing a shift from a deep chlorophyll maximum at low aquaculture intensity to the emergence of algal dead zones lower in the water column with high aquaculture intensity. High phosphorus loading and light limitation from enhanced algal biomass, associated with high aquaculture intensity, exacerbated nitrogen drawdown, leading to the prevalence of potentially nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. Seasonal overturn during the cooler season resulted in low dissolved oxygen concentrations in the epilimnion, potential harmful algal blooms, a reduction in the habitable depth for fish and ultimately increased mortality amongst farmed fish.					; Papa, Rey Donne/AES-4252-2022; McGowan, Suzanne/GZB-0118-2022; Briddon, Charlotte/AAT-4634-2021; Taylor, David/ISS-5752-2023	Taylor, David/0000-0002-6098-5636; Briddon, Charlotte Louise/0009-0001-3554-461X; Cunanan, Melandro/0000-0002-3933-9568													0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2023	850	2					283	299		10.1007/s10750-022-05065-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-022-05065-7		NOV 2022											WOS:000879126900001

To analyze the water quality in recent years, water quality data in Erhai lake from 2013 to 2017 were first collected from typical nine monitoring stations. Based on the comprehensive water quality index (WQI) method, the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of water quality in Erhai lake were analyzed, and the main factors affecting water quality in Erhai lake were explored. The results indicated that the water quality of Erhai lake was worse than its target water quality, and total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) exceeded the Class II standards (TN: 0.5 mg L-1, TP: 0.025 mg L-1) of China's Environmental Quality Standard for Surface Water (GB3838-2002). In terms of changes across seasons, the overall lake water quality in the dry season was better than that in the wet season, and TN and TP reached the peak value in September. In terms of spatial distribution, water quality of the northern area was better than that of the southern area in the dry season, whereas water quality of the southern area was better than that of the northern area in the wet season. At present, Erhai lake is at a critical turning point of water eutrophication, and its nutrition status is mainly affected by both nitrogen and phosphorus. The pollution load from the land area is the main factor affecting the deterioration of Erhai lake. Our results can provide a scientific basis for the treatment of the water environment of Erhai lake.

J	Moore, JG; Moring, BC				Moore, James G.; Moring, Barry C.			Rangewide glaciation in the Sierra Nevada, California	GEOSPHERE												The 600-km-long Sierra Nevada underwent extensive Pleistocene glaciation except for its southernmost 100 km. Presently, similar to 1700 small glaciers and ice masses near the crest of the range occur above 3250 m in elevation; these covered an area of similar to 50 km(2) in 1972. Fourteen of the largest glaciers decreased by about one half in area during the period from 1900 to 2004. Rock glaciers, generally glacial ice covered by 1-10 m of rockfall debris, occur in about the same span of the range as ice and permanent snowfields. They are, on average, lower by 200-300 m, apparently because of the insulating layer of rocky rubble that protects their internal ice from the sun's heat and from wind. The principal Pleistocene glacial stages are the Sherwin (ca. 820 ka), Tahoe (170-130 and ca. 70 ka), Tioga (14-28 ka), and Recess Peak (13 ka). Some 7040 glacial lakes, produced primarily by quarrying from bedrock, were mostly exposed after recession of the Tioga glacial stage. The lakes largely mark the area of primary snow accumulation. Below the lower limit of the lakes, ice flowed downward into river-cut canyons, forming major trunk glaciers within the zone of ablation. The range is in general a westward-tilted block upfaulted on its east side. Therefore, the main late Pleistocene trunk glaciers (Tahoe/ Tioga) west of the crest extend 25-60 km, whereas those east of the crest extend only 5-20 km. Because of higher precipitation northward, glacial features such as the toes of existing glaciers and rock glaciers, as well as the late season present-day snowline, all decrease in elevation northward. Likewise, the elevation of the lower limit of glacial lakes, an indication of the zone of snow accumulation during the late Pleistocene, decreases about the same degree. This similarity suggests that the overall climate patterns of the late Pleistocene, though cooler, were similar to those of today. The east slope glaciers show a similar northward depression, but they are similar to 500-1000 m higher. The upper part of the glacial system was erosive over a broad highland area as the evenly distributed ice in the accumulation zone moved to lower elevation. The abundant lake basins record this erosive action. The lower part of the glacier system was largely confined to major preexisting river canyons in which melting dominated. The average of rangewide estimates of the equilibrium line altitude (ELA)-the boundary between the upper snow and ice accumulation zone and the lower ablation zone-of many late Pleistocene glaciers parallels, and is only 200-300 m above, the altitude of the lower limit of the lakes. Hence, the lake zone provides a means of estimating the ELA.																			1553-040X					DEC	2013	9	6					1804	1818		10.1130/GES00891.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/GES00891.1													WOS:000328506400018

However, extensive sympatric divergence has taken place in the shallow waters (30m) of Great Bear Lake, with multiple Lake Trout morphs varying in head and fin characteristics. To investigate diet partitioning as a potential explanatory mechanism for this diversification, we assessed trophic characteristics and relationships among four sympatric shallow-water morphs of Lake Trout via analyses of fatty acids and stomach contents. Fatty acids and stomach contents both identified Lake Trout, Cisco and Mysis as key prey items in Lake Trout diets. Interestingly, terrestrial invertebrates were also seasonally important among morphs, reflecting temporal variability of available prey in this arctic lake. Some diet partitioning was observed among morphs; Morph 1 was characterised as a generalist, Morph 3 was more benthic-oriented, and Morphs 2 and 4 were mainly pelagic feeders. Of the latter, Morph 4 was the most specialised, whereas Morph 2 exhibited alternative feeding tactics of benthic cannibalistic and pelagic piscivorous feeding. Our findings demonstrate that complementary dietary methods can elucidate habits of opportunistic feeders, a task that can often be problematic, given their complex and variable diets. Our results add new information and perspectives on the current model of Lake Trout differentiation, demonstrating niche partitioning based on benthic versus pelagic habitat use and generalist versus specialist feeding tactics.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				JAN	2016	25	1					109	124		10.1111/eff.12195	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12195													WOS:000366519600010

An increasing number of studies put forward the use of bioindicators as a tool for environmental monitoring. However, the sensitivity to these environmental parameters is commonly tested separately, even though it is known that interactions are numerous within this complex ecosystem. An integrated methodological study was conducted in Lake Varano (Italy). On the basis of 45 spatially distributed samples throughout the area and selected environmental parameters (trace elements, organic matter, clay mineral assemblages, grain size of sediment, and water characteristics), four factors are identified. The Lake Varano ecosystem is pre-dominantly influenced by terrigenous inputs (first-order factor). The clastic fractions of the sediments supply a ylarge range of trace elements, occasionally in relatively high concentrations. Under such circumstances, despite occasionally exceeding of threshold limits, the trace element pollution can generally be ruled out. The organic content combined with depth is the second key factor. In Lake Varano, the organic content is high and may lead to seasonal eutrophication. As a third- order factor, although only analyzed once, oxygen, ORP, salinity, and pH gradients show that foraminiferal diversity is positively influenced by more saline conditions. The fourth- order factor is the sediment size. To conclude, this paper illustrates the interest in and need to conduct a detailed, integrated, sedimentological study of a site prior to any examination of its ecological status (possible occurrences of sources of pollution).					; BOUT-ROUMAZEILLES, Viviane/AAD-5259-2019; Francescangeli, Fabio/AAS-1693-2020; Margaritelli, Giulia/AAE-3805-2021; Frontalini, Fabrizio/C-4819-2008; Trentesaux, Alain/A-5607-2010; Armynot, Eric/B-6819-2009; Semprucci, Federica/N-5889-2014; Spagnoli, Federico/D-4255-2012; du Châtelet, Eric/B-6819-2009; Alain, Trentesaux/A-5607-2010; Tribovillard, Nicolas/B-6185-2009	Bout-Roumazeilles, Viviane/0000-0001-6917-818X; Francescangeli, Fabio/0000-0002-8309-3315; Tribovillard, Nicolas/0000-0003-3493-5579; COCCIONI, Rodolfo/0000-0003-2333-4030; Armynot, Eric/0000-0003-1599-8689; Semprucci, Federica/0000-0003-1360-7242; Spagnoli, Federico/0000-0002-9735-5339; Margaritelli, Giulia/0000-0003-3289-0557; Alain, Trentesaux/0000-0001-6186-1005; 													1866-6280	1866-6299				JAN	2016	75	2							123	10.1007/s12665-015-4957-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4957-7													WOS:000370240800034

Long-term changes of physicochemical parameters and benthos in Lake Qarun (Egypt): Can we make a correct forecast of ecosystem future?	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												Biotic changes and a salinity increase (from 13 to 40 g. L-1) occurred in Lake Qarun (Egypt) since 1901. Was salinity increasing a cause of observed biotic changes? To answer this question we used benthos as a model group. Benthos and water sampling was conducted in different seasons (2008-2013). Comparing our and literature data, we discuss the long-term trends and possible causes of benthos changes. Salinity reached 3 g. L-1 in middle of 19th century; and biotic changes caused by this were started. From middle 19th century to 1928 a biotic transformation was driven by the salinity increase; after 1928 a regular alien species introduction caused that a marine community formed. In 1970-2000 eutrophication played a main role in species composition changes. In 2014 ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi introduced in the lake; eutrophication, chemical pollution, and a population dynamics of this ctenophore may be main drivers of the ecosystem change now. Benthos biomass gradually decreased during interval 1975-2013 without any correlation with salinity change. A variety of other factors than salinity may be significant in determining the structure and dynamics of communities, and we conclude that we have a small chance to make a correct forecast of possible future ecosystem changes in Lake Qarun.

However, the distribution of methanotrophic community in shallow and eutrophic lake and its influential factors remain essentially unclear. The present study investigated sediment methanotrophic microorganisms at different sites in eutrophic freshwater Dianchi Lake (China) in two different seasons. The abundance, diversity, and structure of sediment methanotrophic community showed a profound spatial and seasonal variation. The pmoA gene copy number in lake sediments ranged from 8.71 +/- 0.49 x 10(4) to 2.09 +/- 0.03 x 10(7) copies per gram of dry sediment. Sediment methanotrophic communities were composed of Methylococcus and Methylobacter (type I methanotrophs) and Methylosinus (type II methanotrophs), while type I MOB usually outnumbered type II MOB. Moreover, ammonia nitrogen was found to be a potential determinant of methanotrophic community structure in Dianchi Lake.

Rats were injected intravenously (i.v.) with extracted MCs at a dose of 80 mu g MC-LRequivalent/kg body weight. MCs concentrations in various tissues were detected at 1, 2. 4, 6, 12 and 24 h post-injection using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The highest concentration of MCs was found in kidney (0.034-0.295 mu g/g dry weight), followed by lung (0.007-0.067 mu g/g dry weight), stomach (0.010-0.058 mu g/g dry weight) and liver (0.003-0.052 mu g/g dry weight). The maximum MCs content in the whole body of rat, 2.9% of the injected dose, was observed at 2 h post-injection. MCs concentration was higher in kidney than in liver during the experiment, and two peaks of MCs concentration (at 2 and 24 h, respectively) were observed in kidney, indicating that MCs can be excreted directly via kidney of rat. Though heart, intestine, spleen, brain, gonad and stomach contained less than 0.2% of injected MCs during the whole experiment stage, the presence of MCs in these tissues represents potential damage to them.

Sediments from different depths in five representative sites of Dianchi Lake China, i.e., Haigeng, Dounan, Luojiacun, Xinjie, and Kunyang, were studied from January to December to evaluate the spatial and temporal dynamics in available-P and soluble-P and their impacts on algal growth. The results showed that the average sediment available-P and soluble-P were 41.2 mg kg(-1) and 0.27 mg kg(-1), respectively. Sediment available-P and soluble-P concentrations varied significantly among seasons, sites, and layers, with the following order: surface (0-5 cm) > middle (5-10 cm) > bottom (10-20 cm). The release and transformation characteristics of available-P and soluble-P at the sediment-water interface varied among sites. The Haigeng site, with the most severe algae blooms, had significantly higher average available-P and soluble-P in sediment than other sites. This indicated that phosphorus release and availability were associated with algal growth, and that the sediment surface (0-5 cm) is an important internal source that supports algal growth in Dianchi Lake.

As a region that is sensitive to anthropogenic warming, tracking lake surface water temperature (LSWT) changes in Mongolian lakes is crucial for understanding the consequences of a warming climate on lake ecosystems. However, the long-term monitoring of LSWT is restricted by the spatiotemporal gaps in the raw imagery of remote sensing-based land surface temperature (LST), e.g., the commonly used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST products. This study applied an improved gap-filling method by utilizing the discrete cosine transform-based penalized least squares (DCT-PLS) strategy in the spatial domain combined with the linear interpolation (LI) algorithm in the temporal domain. The method was applied to fill gaps in the LSWT imagery of 12 representative lakes across MP. The randomly sampled high-quality MODIS LSWT values in the spatial and temporal domains were excavated as false data gaps and considered "virtual true" validation datasets. The spatial validation results showed that the estimated LSWT for all the lake cases were comparable with the "virtual true" LSWT values, with the average values of the coefficient of determination, mean absolute error, mean square error, and root mean square error being 0.98, 0.38 degrees C, 0.45 degrees C, and 0.59 degrees C, respectively. Meanwhile, the error of nighttime LSWT results was relatively lower than that of daytime LSWT. For temporal interpolation validation, the LI algorithm exhibited relatively better performance and could more objectively indicate the variation in LSWT. Benefiting from the spatially and temporally well-constrained data, we analyzed the interannual and intra-annual change characteristics of the LSWTs of the 12 lakes. The long-term variations of annual and seasonal mean LSWTs in the 12 selected lakes exhibited no evident trends in 2000-2020, while presented apparent interannual fluctuations. The slight changes in the average LSWTs of the 12 selected lakes were in excellent synchronization with the surrounding LST derived from the reanalysis datasets, confirming the widely reported phenomenon of "global warming hiatus" that occurred in the early 21st century. This study improves the understanding of the LSWT variations in Mongolian lakes in response to global climate change. It has the potential to provide an effective approach for monitoring LSWT changes in other large-scale studies.					; Liu, Kai/HWQ-3608-2023	Liu, Kai/0000-0002-5500-0644; Cheng, Jian/0009-0004-7428-5528													1569-8432	1872-826X				NOV	2022	114								103073	10.1016/j.jag.2022.103073	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2022.103073													WOS:001126189400004

Effects of land use on thermal enrichment of urban stormwater and potential mitigation of runoff temperature by watershed-scale stormwater control measures	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Stream temperature is critical to the survival and reproduction of fauna in cold-water ecosystems. Urbanization causes abrupt increases in ambient stream temperature via stormwater inputs while concurrently decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow. Relatively little is known about how various urban land uses affect thermal load discharged to streams or whether a network of green infrastructure retrofitted at the watershed scale can ameliorate these impacts. Runoff temperature and hydrology were monitored at 17 urban and two forested watershed outlets to assess 1) how urban land use affects stormwater thermal pollution and 2) if thermal pollution can be mitigated through infiltrating stormwater control measures (SCMs). Significantly and substan-tially larger runoff temperatures (i.e., event mean temperature, event maximum temperature) and thermal loads were observed from every urban land use (without SCMs) in comparison to forested (i.e., surrogate for pre-development) conditions. Event mean temperatures generally followed the land use trend of parking lot > light industrial > commercial > heavy industrial > multi-family residential, single family residential > low density residential > forest. Retrofitted bioretention cells and permeable pavements were not successful in mitigating runoff temperature in residential watersheds compared to (1) watersheds without SCMs or (2) restoring temperature to surrogate pre-development conditions. SCMs were seldomly able to mitigate enough runoff volume to have a significant thermal load reduction compared to watersheds without SCMs. These results suggest stormwater management and cold-water species management have not yet been successfully integrated. More work is needed to optimize green infrastructure SCMs design for sufficient treatment of runoff to protect cold-water ecosystems from urban development. Beyond SCM implementation, wholistic watershed management practices (e.g., riparian buffers, clustered imperviousness, underground storage/conveyance) are needed to stem thermal enrichment of streams and lakes by stormwater.					; Winston, Ryan/K-8973-2012; Simpson, Ian/HJB-3204-2022	Winston, Ryan/0000-0003-4218-877X; Simpson, Ian/0000-0003-0615-1187; 													0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	2022	184								106792	10.1016/j.ecoleng.2022.106792	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2022.106792													WOS:000860264200005

Municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent-induced effects on freshwater mussel populations and the role of mussel refugia in recolonizing an extirpated reach	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Global human population and urbanization continually increase the volume of wastewater entering aquatic environments. Despite efforts to treat these effluents, they contribute a diverse suite of substances that enter watersheds at concentrations that have the potential to elicit adverse effects on aquatic organisms. The relationship between wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent exposure and biological responses within aquatic ecosystems remains poorly understood, especially at the population level. To examine the effect of WWTP effluents on sentinel invertebrates, freshwater mussels were assessed in the Grand River, Ontario, in populations associated with the outfall of a major WWTP. This watershed, within the Laurentian Great Lakes basin, has a diverse community of twenty-five species of mussels, including nine Species at Risk, and is representative of many habitats that receive WWTP effluents regionally as well as globally. Surveys were conducted to assess the presence and species richness of freshwater mussels. In total, 55 sites downstream of the WWTP were examined using timed visual searches with one or 2 h of effort spent searching 100 m segments. Although seven species of mussels were found in moderate abundance (mean of 8 mussels per hour of searching across 2 sites) upstream of the WWTP outfall, no live mussels were observed for 7.0 km downstream of the WWTP. Long-term water quality monitoring data indicate that ammonia and nitrite concentrations along with large seasonal declines in diel dissolved oxygen were associated with the extirpation of mussels downstream of the WWTP. The first live mussels found downstream were below the confluence with a major tributary indicating that in addition to an improvement in water quality to a state that enables mussels (and/or their fish hosts) to survive, a nearby mussel refuge may have facilitated the recolonization of the depauperate WWTP-impacted zone.

J	Yannarell, AC; Triplett, EW				Yannarell, AC; Triplett, EW			Geographic and environmental sources of variation in lake bacterial community composition	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												This study used a genetic fingerprinting technique (automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis [ARISA]) to characterize microbial communities from a culture-independent perspective and to identify those environmental factors that influence the diversity of bacterial assemblages in Wisconsin lakes. The relationships between bacterial community composition and 11 environmental variables for a suite of 30 lakes from northern and southern Wisconsin were explored by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). In addition, the study assessed the influences of ARISA fragment detection threshold (sensitivity) and the quantitative, semiquantitative, and binary (presence-absence) use of ARISA data. It was determined that the sensitivity of ARISA was influential only when presence-absence-transformed data were used. The outcomes of analyses depended somewhat on the data transformation applied to ARISA data, but there were some features common to all of the CCA models. These commonalities indicated that differences in bacterial communities were best explained by regional (i.e., northern versus southern Wisconsin lakes) and landscape level (i.e., seepage lakes versus drainage lakes) factors. ARISA profiles from May samples were consistently different from those collected in other months. In addition, communities varied along gradients of pH and water clarity (Secchi depth) both within and among regions. The results demonstrate that environmental, temporal, regional, and landscape level features interact to determine the makeup of bacterial assemblages in northern temperate lakes.

Alluvial evidence for major climate and flow regime changes during the middle and late Quaternary in eastern central Australia	GEOMORPHOLOGY					39th Annual Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium	OCT 09-11, 2008	Austin, TX					As a low-gradient and region spanning the tropics to the temperate zone, the Lake Eyre basin has undergone gentle late Cenozoic crustal warping leading to substantial alluvial deposition, thereby forming repositories of evidence for palaeoclimatic and palaeohydrological changes from the Late Tertiary to the Holocene. Auger holes and bank exposures at five locations along the lower 500 km of Cooper Creek, a major contributor to Lake Eyre in the eastern part of the basin, yielded 85 luminescence dates (TL and OSL) that, combined wit a further 142 luminescence dates from northeastern Australia, have established a chronology of multiple episodes of enhanced flow regime from about 750 ka to the Holocene. Mean bankfull discharges on Cooper Creek upstream of the Innamincka Dome at 250-230 ka or oxygen isotope stages (OIS) 7-6 are estimated to have been 5 to 7 times larger than those of today, however, substantially less reworking has occurred during and after OIS 5 than before. Lower Cooper Creek appears to have similarly declined. In the Tirari Desert adjacent to Lake Eyre there is evidence of widespread alluvial activity, perhaps during but certainly before the Middle Pleistocene, yet the river became laterally restricted in OIS 7 to 5. While the Quaternary has been characterised by a dramatically oscillating wet-dry climate, since oxygen isotope stage OIS 7 or 6 there has been a general decline in the magnitude of the episodes of wetness to which the eastern part of central Australia has periodically returned. During the last full glacial cycle, Cooper Creek's periods of greatest runoff and sand transport were not during the last interglacial maximum of OIS 5e (132-122 ka) but later in OIS 5 when sea levels and global temperatures were substantially below those of 5e or today. Fluvial activity returned in OIS 4 and 3, but not to the extent of mid and late OIS 5: strongly seasonal but still powerful flows transported sand and fed source-bordering dunes in OIS 5 and 3. This chronology of fluvial activity in the late Quaternary broadly coincides with that for rivers of southeastern Australia and suggests that the wet phases in eastern central Australia have not been governed as much by the northern monsoon as by conditions in the western Pacific close to the east coast both north and south. Flow confinement within the Innamincka Dome has locally amplified Cooper Creek's energy, and here evidence exists for short but high-magnitude episodes of flow during the Last Glacial Maximum and in the early to middle Holocene, conditions that were capable of forming large palaeochannels but that were not long-lived enough to rework the river's extensive floodplains elsewhere along its length.

This work is to reveal that the organic layer (A), leaching-deposit layer (B), saprolite layer (C) and freeze-thaw processes regulate changes in subsurface liquid water storage (CSWS). We performed in situ field surveys, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) along an elevation gradient (4221-3205 m) in the Qinghai Lake Basin Critical Zone Observatory (QLBCZO) on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The results showed that the saprolite layer (thickness of 0.84-41.85 m) and the liquid water storage (SWS) increased along the decreasing elevation. The saprolite layer was the main subsurface liquid water storage reservoir, with average value of 595.49 +/- 729.87 mm, which occupied 76.10 % of the total water storage of layers A, B and C. The SWS of the saprolite layers increased the most, by 39.41 mm and 45.88 mm in the thawing and nonfreezing periods, respectively, and that of layer B decreased maximally by 52.50 mm in the freezing period. The subsurface layer and elevation had the contribution to SWS at 68.07 % during the nonfreezing period. Comparing other climate and environmental factors, the seasonal frozen thickness (SFT) and precipitation contributed most to CSWS during the thawing and freezing period (27.95 % and 19.87 %), respectively. This study contributes to advancing the mechanistic understanding of the interactions between the subsurface CZ structure and water storage processes and provides high-quality data with which coupled ecohydrological models can be developed.

The present study investigated water quality and microcystins (MCs) contamination of four public water supply systems in Zaria, Nigeria. The water bodies were eutrophic in the rainy and dry season and supported high phyto-plankton biomass with chlorophyll a concentrations generally higher than 20.0 mu g/L. The biomass of the predominant species (Microcystis aeruginosa and Anabaena subcylindrica) of cyanobacteria had a significant positive correlation with particulate and dissolved MCs. Dissolved MCs concentrations were higher (> 1.0 mu g/L) than the maximum permissible limits for drinking water in all the water bodies in the dry season and three of them in the rainy season. These results suggest that there is the need to have a regular monitoring program for these water bodies to prevent acute and chronic health hazards associated with MCs contamination of drinking and irrigation water.

It is therefore a good indicator of climate warming, which will likely have dramatic impacts on lake ice phenology in northern latitudes. Beside the climate change aspect, lake ice data are important regarding transport and safety issues. In addition, changes in ice cover affect the ecology of the lake and water quality. A new method for accessing lake ice extent (LIE) using optical satellite data was developed at the Finnish Environment Institute. The resulting ICEmod method is based on multidimensional Gaussian distributions calculated for training data using several reflectance and thermal bands and their-related indices. Three alternative classes are provided for a lake ice pixel: (i) open water, (ii) ice cover, and (iii) cloud. The main advantages of ICEmod are the utilization of several spectral bands, inclusion of simultaneous cloud detection, definition of statistical probability for each pixel, the simplicity of processing and easy transition between different satellite sensors. This novel method is applied in the provision of the Sentinel-3 Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR)-based 0.005 degrees Lake Ice Extent product (LIE-NH) for the Northern Hemisphere under the Global Land Service, a component of the Copernicus Land Service. The 0.005 degrees resolution LIE products based on ICEmod applied to SLSTR (an extensive subset corresponding to LIE-NH) were validated against high-resolution Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument-images covering lakes in the different parts of the Northern Hemisphere, most of them representing both open water and ice pixels. The gained overall classification accuracy is 96%. The resulting omission error for ice is 6% and omission mainly occurs in lakes where the ice is very dark and fragmented. The ICEmod method is not always able to separate dark ice from open water if there is water on the top of the dark ice, while misclassifications do not occur if the water layer is on white ice. The commission error for ice is 2.5% and is mostly related to the ambiguity in the definition of a ice-pixel: i.e. whether a 0.005 degrees LIE pixel should be classified as ice or open water when the area within the pixel is partially ice-covered. When the lake is completely ice-covered or ice-free, the overall accuracy is 100%. According to the tentative qualitative comparison with European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative Lake Ice Cover (LIC) product, LIE-NH may provide more accurate lake ice information, and it also provides lake ice data for more than 13 000 lakes while LIC operates for 250 lakes only.

J	Han, H; Hwang, J; Kim, G				Han, Heejun; Hwang, Jeomshik; Kim, Guebuem			Characterizing the origins of dissolved organic carbon in coastal seawater using stable carbon isotope and light absorption characteristics	BIOGEOSCIENCES												In order to determine the origins of dissolved organic matter (DOM) occurring in the seawater of Sihwa Lake, we measured the stable carbon isotope ratios of dissolved organic carbon (DOC-delta C-13) and the optical properties (absorbance and fluorescence) of DOM in two different seasons (March 2017 and September 2018). Sihwa Lake is enclosed by a dike along the western coast of South Korea, and the water is exchanged with the Yellow Sea twice a day through the sluice gates. The DOC concentrations were generally higher in lower-salinity waters in both periods, and excess of DOC was also observed in 2017 in high-salinity waters. Here, the excess DOC represents any DOC concentrations higher than those in the incoming open-ocean seawater. The excess DOC occurring in the lower-salinity waters originated mainly from marine sediments of tidal flats, based on the DOC-delta C-13 values (-20.7 +/- 1.2 parts per thousand) and good correlations among the DOC, humic-like fluorescent DOM (FDOMH), and NH4+ concentrations. However, the origins of the excess DOC observed in 2017 appear to be from two different sources: one mainly from marine sources such as biological production based on the DOC-delta C-13 values (19.1 parts per thousand to -20.5 parts per thousand) and the other mainly from terrestrial sources by land-seawater interactions based on its depleted DOC-delta C-13 values (-21.5 parts per thousand to -27.8 parts per thousand). This terrestrial DOM source observed in 2017 was likely associated with DOM on the reclaimed land, which experienced extended exposure to light and bacterial degradation as indicated by the higher spectral slope ratio (S-R) of light absorbance and no concurrent increases in the FDOMH and NH4+ concentrations. Our study demonstrates that the combination of these biogeochemical tools can be a powerful tracer of DOM sources and characteristics in coastal environments.					; Han, Heejun/HJP-4744-2023; Kim, Guebuem/B-3636-2014	Kim, Guebuem/0000-0002-5119-0241; 													1726-4170	1726-4189				MAR 16	2021	18	5					1793	1801		10.5194/bg-18-1793-2021	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-1793-2021													WOS:000630284800001

However, Due to its dual characteristics of both rivers and reservoirs, eutrophication patterns in FBZs have not been explored comprehensively. This study focuses on the FBZ formed by the Three Gorges Dam (TGD), the world's largest hydropower plant. By integrating the multi-source monitoring data with Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index (NDCI) inversed by remote sensing data, interpretable machine learning methods (XGBoost and SHAP) were applied to quantify the contributions of key eutrophication drivers. The results showed that as the water storage level rose to 175 m (2010-2016), the total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations in the FBZ increased by 10.4 % and 5.9 % respectively, compared to the natural river period (2004-2005). While TP concentrations have decreased in recent years (2021-2023), the pollution risk from TN has not been mitigated. Eutrophication drivers exhibit notable variability across different temporal scales, with pollutant emissions resulting from intense human activities being the primary drivers of elevated TN and TP concentrations on an annual scale. Seasonal variations in rainfall and temperature result in temporal heterogeneity in nutrient concentrations on a monthly scale. SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) analysis reveals that the TGR's water storage volume and runoff load in the FBZ account for 45.9 % of the total influence on algal blooms. This result highlights that reduced flow velocity, driven by upstream and downstream dam impoundments, is the dominant factor behind algal bloom outbreaks in the FBZ. This study analyses the complex influences that trigger algal blooms in the FBZ which differ from rivers and lakes, and that could provide important references for managing eutrophication in global FBZs.					qi, zixuan/MXJ-7121-2025; Huang, Wei/AAM-7782-2021														1470-160X	1872-7034				FEB	2025	171								113100	10.1016/j.ecolind.2025.113100	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2025.113100		JAN 2025											WOS:001409931900001

However, little is known about the temporal responses of the zooplankton community to abiotic and biotic drivers across lakes at the regional scale. Using a comprehensive 20-year dataset from 20 Danish lakes in recovery from eutrophication, we assessed the seasonal and annual trends in the spatial heterogeneity of zooplankton community across lakes and related it to abiotic and biotic drivers. We found significant seasonality and inter-annual decreases in spatial zooplankton heterogeneity in both shallow and deep lakes, with the decrease in the spatial turnover dominating the temporal dynamics of the beta diversity. For the inter-annual changes, decreased spatial heterogeneity of phytoplankton, macrophytes and fish were important biotic drivers at the regional scale. Using a series of ordinary least squares regressions and model selection with model averaging approaches, we revealed that both local (e.g., total phosphorus, total nitrogen, pH, Secchi depth, alkalinity, Schmidt stability, water temperature) and regional drivers (e.g., air temperature, solar irradiance) were important variables influencing the spatial zooplankton heterogeneity, although the directions depended on the beta diversity measures and water depth. Our results highlight an important role of bottom-up forces through phytoplankton community as well as macrophytes and top-down forces via fishes in driving the temporal changes in zooplankton community composition patterns at the regional scale.

The main aim of this study was a comprehensive description of drift patterns of three invasive gobies living in sympatry, and to compare these results with similar sampling efforts before the occurrence of invasive gobies at the River Rhine. More than 26,500 larvae and juvenile fishes were caught with drift nets in 2000 and 2012-2014. Though some species were missing in 2012-2014 (e.g. bullhead Cottus gobio and gudgeon Gobio gobio), only low differences were found in the drift of autochthones before and after the goby invasion with respect to abundances or sizes. Roach (Rutilus rutilus) and bighead goby (Ponticola kessleri) increased in size over the season, indicating a somewhat different drift strategy than for barbel (Barbus barbus), monkey goby (Neogobius fluviatilis) and round goby (N. melanostomus) that drifted over several months, but remained at a similar size. The drift data give a first indication that the potential impact of gobies in the River Rhine should act on other stages than on the very first larvae within the life-cycle of important members of the local fish communities. The data also clearly reveal that bighead goby is actually at the bust phase within typical boom-and-bust cycles of invasive species, while round and monkey goby have not yet left the boom phase so far at the Lower Rhine.

The ELSA-Flood-Stack: A reconstruction from the laminated sediments of Eifel maar structures during the last 60 000 years	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												This study reconstructs the main flood phases in central Europe from event layers in sediment cores from Holocene Eifel maar lakes and Pleistocene dry maar structures. These reconstructions are combined with recent gauge time-series to cover the entire precipitation extremes of the last 60 000 years. In general, Eifel maar sediments are perfectly suited for the preservation of event layers since the deep water in the maar lakes is seasonal anoxic and therefore, bioturbation is low. However, the preservation of annual lamination is only preserved in Holzmaar and Ulmener Maar; the other cores are dated by C-14, magnetostratigraphy, tephra markers and ice core tuning. The cores were drilled in the Eifel region of central western Germany, which represents a climatic homogenous region from Belgium to Poland and all across Central Europe. A total of 233 flood layers over 7.5 mm were detected in all analysed cores. The stratigraphic classification of the flood events follows the newly defined Landscape Evolution Zones (LEZ). The strongest events in the Holocene have occurred during LEZ 1 (0-6000 b2k) in the years 658, 2800 and 4100 b2k. Flood layers in the LEZ 2 (6000-10 500 b2k) are not as frequent as during the LEZ 1, nevertheless, the floods cluster between 6000 and 6500 b2k. Twenty flood layers are found in the LEZ 3 (10 500-14 700 b2k); 11 in LEZ 4 (14 700-21 000 b2k); 15 in LEZ 5 (21 000-28 500 b2k); 34 in LEZ 6 (28 500-36 500 b2k); 8 in LEZ 7 (36 500-49 000 b2k); zero in LEZ 8 (49 000-55 000 b2k) and LEZ 9 (55 000-60 000 b2k). The maximum flood phases during the Pleistocene are at 11 500-17 500 (late glacial and Younger Dryas), 23 000-24 000 (before Greenland Interstadial (GI) 2), 29 000-35 000 (especially between GI 5 and 4) and 44 000-44 500 b2k (transition from GI 12 to 11). The variations in flood dynamics are climatically driven and mainly associated with climate transitions and colder periods, combined with light vegetation. It turns out that low vegetation coverage related to both Greenland Stadial phases and anthropogenic impacts since late Holocene is the main cause for the development of flood layers in maar sediments. The precipitation itself, plays only a secondary role. This interpretation is based on the current climate understanding of cold phases and several studies of fluvial erosion related to vegetation coverage. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, spatiotemporal distribution, critical risk source identification and potential risks of 14 PPCPs found in water collected from sampling points in Luoma Lake and its inflowing rivers in two seasons in 2019 and 2020 were investigated. The PPCPs concentrations ranged from 27.64 ng<middle dot>L-1 to 613.08 ng<middle dot>L-1 in December 2019, and from 16.67 ng<middle dot>L-1 to 3287.41 ng<middle dot>L-1 in April 2020. Ketoprofen (KPF) dominated the PPCPs with mean concentrations of 125.85 ng<middle dot>L-1 and 640.26 ng<middle dot>L-1, respectively. Analysis of sources showed that the pollution in Luoma Lake mostly originated from sewage treatment plant effluents, inflowing rivers and domestic wastewater. Among them, the inflowing rivers contributed the most (82.95%) to the concentration of total PPCPs. The results of ecological risk assessment showed that there was a moderate risk (0.1 < RQs < 1) from carbamazepine (CBZ) in December 2019 and a high risk (RQs > 1) from naproxen (NPX) in April 2020. The results of human risk assessment found that NPX posed a high risk to infant health, and we found that NPX was associated with 83 diseases according to Comparative Toxicogenomics Database. NPX was identified as a substance requiring major attention. The results provide an understanding of the concentrations and ecological risks of PPCPs in Luoma Lake. We believe the data will support environmental departments to develop management strategies and prevent PPCPs pollution.

Dissimilatory iron reduction contributes to anaerobic mineralization of sediment in a shallow transboundary lake	FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH												Dissimilatory iron reduction (DIR) coupled with carbon cycling is increasingly being recognized as an influential process in freshwater wetland soils and sediments. The role of DIR in organic matter (OM) mineralization, how-ever, is still largely unknown in lake sediment environments. In this study, we clarified rates and pathways of OM mineralization in two shallow lakes with seasonal hydrological connectivity and different eutrophic situations. We found that in comparison with the domination of DIR (55%) for OM mineralization in Lake Xiaoxingkai, the contribution of methanogenesis was much higher (68%) in its connected lake (Lake Xingkai). The differences in rates and pathways of sediment OM mineralization between the two lakes were attributed to higher concentra-tions of carbonate associated iron oxides (Fecarb) in Lake Xiaoxingkai compared to Lake Xingkai ( P = 0.002), due to better deposition mixing, more contributions of terrigenous detrital materials, and higher OM content in Lake Xiaoxingkai. Results of structural equation modeling showed that Fecarb and total iron content (TFe) regulated 25% of DIR in Lake Xiaoxingkai and 76% in Lake Xingkai, accompanied by a negative effect of TFe on methano-genesis in Lake Xingkai. The relative abundance and diversity of Fe-reducing bacteria were significantly different between the two lakes, and showed a weak effect on sediment OM mineralization. Our findings emphasize the role of iron minerals and geochemical characterizations in regulating rates and pathways of OM mineralization, and deepen the understanding of carbon cycling in lake sediments.					; Zhang, Xian/H-6502-2011; Chang, Wei-Yi/AAD-3613-2020; Luo, Min/JAD-1832-2023; Zou, Yuanchun/B-6666-2008; WU, Haitao/AHD-8951-2022	Yang, Liang/0000-0001-5485-988X; Luo, Min/0000-0003-3284-629X; 													2096-9457	2667-3258				NOV	2023	3	6					844	851		10.1016/j.fmre.2022.12.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fmre.2022.12.002								38933009					WOS:001124748900001

However, limited field data availability across wide geo-graphic gradients may hinder the conduction of large scale longitudinal studies. In this study, time series of lake tur-bidity and trophic state index (TSI) between 2002 and 2012 were obtained from the Copernicus Lake Water products to create a large longitudinal dataset of lake variables for 22 European lakes. The dataset was combined with estimates of nutrient concentrations and surface water temperature obtained from the Hydrological Predictions for the Environment (HYPE) and ERA5-Land data repositories, that were used as environmental predictors. Hence, the validity of the lake water quality parameters was tested by a) exploring their spatial and temporal variability and b) identifying associations with the environmental predictors. For this purpose, seasonal Mann-Kendall tests were applied to find significant inter-annual trends of turbidity and TSI for each lake, and generalized additive models (GAMs) were employed to identify the main parameters that shape their temporal dynamics. Although we did not find significant inter-annual changes, our findings highlighted the strong influence of seasonality and surface water temper-ature in defining the temporal variability patterns in most of the lakes. In addition, the importance of nutrients varied among lakes as several lakes exhibited narrow nutrient gradients reflecting relatively stable nutrient conditions during the examined period. Other lake intrinsic factors, such as local climate and biotic interactions, are important drivers of shaping turbidity and nutrient dynamics. This study highlighted the usefulness of combining lake data from large repositories in conducting large scale spatial studies as a valuable asset for future lake research and management purposes.

Plans for their eradication have been implemented worldwide but estimating residual population size and eradication probability to assess removal success is complicated by the imperfect detection of residual individuals. Most methods to assess residual abundance and eradication probability rely on the often unrealistic assumption that a population is closed to mortality and recruitment processes during the implementation of removal actions. We extended existing removal models and developed a novel analytical approach to estimate residual population size and derive eradication probability in open populations while accounting for multiple removal methods. We apply this approach to 20 eradication projects in Europe and the United States that used mechanical methods to return high mountain lakes to their original fishless condition. The new removal model incorporates (a) a mechanistic description of the ecological process underlying survival and recruitment probabilities during the eradication period and (b) the use of multiple, concomitant removal methods (i.e. electrofishing, gillnetting, fyke-netting) at multiple sites simultaneously. We used a subset of 'control' lakes where eradication success was confirmed by more than 5 years of post-removal surveys to validate the model. For these lakes, eradication success, evaluated by whether the 95% Bayesian credible interval for estimated residual population size encompassed values of <2 individuals, was confirmed in 13 out of 15 lake-by-species case studies. In addition, the model correctly assigned an eradication probabilities equal to 0 for the eradications that are still in progress. Synthesis and applications. Our study provides insights into the dynamics of fish populations subject to eradication in high mountain lakes of different countries. In addition, the analytical approach proposed accounts for demographic processes and multiple removal methods in multiple sites and seasons. It can represent an informative tool to estimate residual population size and eradication probability of alien species to optimize eradication efforts and efficacy of conservation actions. The extension to open populations makes the approach useful to evaluate long-term eradication plans.

Phosphorus cycling from a coastal upwelling zone in the Southeastern Arabian Sea	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The present study examined the seasonal cycling of phosphorous (P) along the southwest coast of India (SWCI) based on two cruises during the southwest monsoon (SWM) and northeast monsoon (NEM) of 2018. During SWM, the entire SWCI experienced intense upwelling manifested by the incursion of cold, nutrient-rich, and hypoxic waters. During NEM, the region was transformed into a warm, well-oxygenated and nutrient-deplete environment. Dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) was significantly high in the subsurface during SWM due to its release from sediments. The sediment P was high and showed an increasing trend towards the south, principally dependent on the sediment texture, organic carbon, and Fe concentrations. Bioavailable P, the sum of exchangeable (P-Ex) and reducible (P-Fe) fractions, was almost consistent (5-20%) over seasons, though P-Fe showed a marked reduction during SWM. Authigenic fraction (P-Aut) was the most dominant (46%), Aut, followed by detrital (P-Det 41%) and residual (P-Res 8%) fractions. Principal component analysis (PCA) of geochemical parameters for SWM was indicative of the high dissolution of Fe (oxy)hydroxides under hypoxia releasing P and its complexation with organic matter and Fe. PCA results for the NEM were different, as it indicated increased preservation of P-associated organic matter and Fe, alternately favouring the formation of P-Aut in sediments. The study's significance is the observation that the bottom water oxygen concentration can significantly influence sedimentary P cycling in tropical coastal upwelling zones.

Although ocelot ecology is broadly studied throughout the species range distribution, studies concerning factors that may affect ocelot occupancy in the Atlantic Forest are still scarce. We used camera traps to evaluate factors influencing the probabilities of detection and occupancy of ocelots in a protected area of the Atlantic Forest, the Rio Doce State Park (RDSP), southeastern Brazil. To assess ocelot occupancy and detection probabilities, we measured the distances between sampling stations and rivers, lakes, cities, pasture, and Eucalyptus plantations. In addition, we recorded the mean rainfall levels for each sampling occasion, and native grassland areas within a 500 m-buffer around each sampling station. We found a strong and positive association between ocelot detection and the dry season, which might be due to a higher number of individuals moving through the Park during this season. Moreover, we found a strong and positive association of ocelot detection with native grassland areas around lakes, which may be related to the ocelot behavior of searching for prey in these areas. Conversely, the ocelot occupancy probability was intermediate (psi<<<^>>> = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.36-0.69) and was not strongly associated with the evaluated covariates, which may be explained by the high-quality of forest habitats and water resources that are homogeneously distributed within the Park. Our study indicates that the RDSP still provides a structurally suitable forest habitat for ocelots, but because of the current worrying scenario of over fragmentation, reduction of forest cover, and weakness of the protective legislation of this biome, the long-term persistence of the species in RDSP is uncertain.

BDE-209 and DP were found to be the dominating compounds, both in the atmosphere and in seawater. Sum PBDEs (Sigma(10)PBDEs) ranged from 0.31 to 10.7 pg m(-3) in the atmosphere and from not detected (n.d.) to 10.5 pg L(-1) in seawater, respectively. DP ranged from 0.13 to 22.3 pg m(-3) and from 0.10 to 17.7 pg L(-1) in air and seawater, respectively. Besides, four other BFRs including hexabromobenzene (HBB) and pentabromobenzene (PBBz) were detected. Elevated atmospheric concentrations were observed in continentally influenced air masses while highest seawater concentrations were observed at sampling stations close to the coast influenced by riverine discharge. The ratio of the two DP stereoisomers both in air and water was found to be close to the technical mixture at high concentrations but changed at lower concentrations giving first evidence for the alteration within the aquatic environment. Both dry air-seawater gas exchange and dry deposition are input pathways of BFRs and DP in the North Sea besides riverine discharge. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Khan, MS; Coulibaly, P				Khan, MS; Coulibaly, P			Application of support vector machine in lake water level prediction	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING												This paper examines the potential of the support vector machine (SVM) in long-term prediction of lake water levels. Lake Erie mean monthly water levels from 1918 to 2001 are used to predict future water levels up to 12 months ahead. The results are compared with a widely used neural network model called a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and with a conventional multiplicative seasonal autoregressive model (SAR). Overall, the SVM showed good performance and is proved to be competitive with the MLP and SAR models. For a 3- to 12-month-ahead prediction, the SVM model outperforms the two other models based on root-mean square error and correlation coefficient performance criteria. Furthermore, the SVM exhibits inherent advantages due to its use of the structural risk minimization principle in formulating cost functions and of quadratic programming during model optimization. These advantages lead to a unique optimal and global solution compared to conventional neural network models.																			1084-0699	1943-5584				MAY-JUN	2006	11	3					199	205		10.1061/(ASCE)1084-0699(2006)11:3(199)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)1084-0699(2006)11:3(199)													WOS:000236869100001

E. coli concentrations in the floating villages (3.6 x 103 and 5.7 x 103 CFU/100 mL during the low-and high-water seasons, respectively) were significantly higher than those in other lake sites (4.0 x 101 and 7.0 x 100 CFU/100 mL during the low-and high-water seasons, respectively) and rivers (3.3 x 102 and 8.9 x 102 CFU/ 100 mL during the low-and high-water seasons, respectively), most likely because fecal materials from the boathouses were discharged without treatment. At most of the lake sampling sites remote from the boathouses, the E. coli concentration was lower during the high-water season than that during the low-water season, due to dilution by lake water. E. coli colonies detected during monitoring were isolated for pathotyping, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, beta-lactamase gene detection, and multilocus sequencing typing (MLST). Of the 659 E. coli isolates, 101 (15.3%) were diarrheagenic E. coli (DEC). The prevalence of DEC (52.2%) in the floating villages during the low-water season was higher than that during the high-water season (4.2%) and that in other sites during both seasons (10.6-21.3%). The DEC isolates from the floating villages during the low-water season showed high antimicrobial resistance, including ampicillin (83.4%) and ciprofloxacin (83.4%), and frequently possessed a beta-lactamase gene (blaTEM) (83.4%). MLST analysis indicated that the predominant sequence type (ST) of DEC isolates from the floating villages possibly originated from humans, whereas more diverse STs were detected in isolates from other sites. We revealed the wide presence of diarrheagenic and antimicrobial-resistant E. coli in Tonle Sap Lake and identified a considerable infection risk in floating villages, especially during the low-water season.					; Watanabe, Toru/H-4638-2013	Nishiyama, Masateru/0000-0002-3579-4758; Yoneda, Ichiro/0000-0003-1594-2618; Watanabe, Toru/0000-0002-3333-5443; 													0269-7491	1873-6424				DEC 15	2022	315									10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120406	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120406		OCT 2022						36252883					WOS:000880771700002

However, reliable rainfall measurements are not always available, making it necessary to predict rainfall values for particular locations through time. Predicting rainfall in space and time can be a complex and challenging task, especially where the rain gauge network is sparse and measurements are not recorded consistently for all rain gauges, leading to many missing values. Here, we develop a flexible Bayesian model for predicting rainfall in space and time and apply it to Narok County, situated in southwestern Kenya, using data collected at 23 rain gauges from 1965 to 2015. Narok County encompasses the Maasai Mara ecosystem, the northern-most section of the Mara-Serengeti ecosystem, famous for its diverse and abundant large mammal populations and spectacular migration of enormous herds of wildebeest, zebra and Thomson's gazelle. The model incorporates geographical and meteorological predictor variables, including elevation, distance to Lake Victoria and minimum temperature. Salient features of our model are the use of non-stationary covariance structures and the facility to handle excess zeros and many missing observations. We assess the efficiency of the model by comparing it empirically with the established Gaussian process, Kriging, simple linear and Bayesian linear models. We use the model to predict total monthly rainfall and its standard error for all 5 x 5 km grid cells in Narok County for each year from 1965 to 2015. Using the Monte Carlo integration method, we estimate seasonal and annual rainfall and their standard errors for 29 sub-regions of Narok for each of the 51 years spanning 1965-2015. The non-stationary model can handle data from a sparse network of observations with many missing values and performs at least as well as or better than four established and widely used models on the Narok rainfall data set. The model produces rainfall predictions consistent with expectation and in good agreement with blended station and satellite rainfall values. The predictions are precise enough for most practical purposes. The model is very general and applicable to other variables besides rainfall.

Vegetation differences and diagenetic changes between two Bulgarian lignite deposits - Insights from coal petrology and biomarker composition	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												During the Miocene numerous sedimentary basins formed on the territory of Bulgaria as a result of the extensional tectonic settings related to the post-orogenic development of the late Alpine orogen. In this study, we review the petrographic composition and biomarker assemblage of two adjacent basins in western Bulgaria, i.e. Beli Breg and Staniantsi basins. Both contain lignite formed during late Miocene (c. 6 Ma). Despite similar tectonic settings and depositional environments, the lignite seams possess different petrographic and organic geochemical characteristics, reflecting differences in the peat forming palaeo-communities and fades variations. The peat-forming vegetation in Bell Breg Basin was dominated by decay resistant coniferous plants, as indicated by abundant fossil wood remains, very good tissue preservation and a biomarker assemblage dominated by diterpenoids. In contrast, Staniantsi lignite is poor in fossil wood and contains a significant amount of triterpenoid biomarkers, suggesting the predominance of angiosperm plants in the swamp. The results of the biomarker analyses are consistent with palaeobotanical and palynological data from the literature. The lignite seams in both basins formed under frequently changing Eh conditions, as indicated by the severe degradation of the non-gymnosperm tissues, the low gelification index values and the variations in pristane/phytane ratio, probably as a result of seasonal drying of the swamps and changes of the ground water table. Hopanoid contents in Bell Breg lignite are very low and are consistent with the abundance of decay-resistant vegetation. In contrast, bacterial activity was obviously higher in the Staniantsi swamp, however, resulting only in slightly enhanced gelification of plant tissues. The geochemical data suggest that the diagenetic changes of the organic matter were mainly governed by thermal degradation, rather than bacterial activity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Habeeb			Metal contamination in the Ashtamudi Wetland ecosystem: Source identification, toxicological risk assessment of Ni, Cd, Cr, and Pb and remediation strategies	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												This study examines the presence of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in the surface sediments and water of the Ashtamudi wetland, a Ramsar site on India's southwest coast. The average concentration of PTEs in water(mu g/L) and in sediments (mg/kg) follows the order Fe(147.89) > Zn(107.53) > Cu(5.73) > Pb(4.57) > Mn(4.41) > Ni (3.07) > Cr(2.98) > Cd(0.32) > Co(0.14) and Fe (37,311.91) > Mn (341.59) > Zn (147.97) > Cr (88.07) > Ni (74.24) > Cu (42.23) > Pb (30.84) > Co (15.61) > Cd (1.85) respectively. Contamination and ecological risk indices (e.g., EF, CF, Igeo, mCd, EI, RI, mHQ, TRI, PLI) reveal moderate to considerable ecological hazards and contamination. Health risk assessments identify elevated cancer risks associated with Ni, Cd, Pb, and Cr in high- contamination zones. Statistical tools (PCC, PCA, and HCA) elucidate pollution sources and sediment dynamics, showing that urban runoff and industrial discharge are the major contributors. In contrast to previous studies, this work integrates seasonal variations, advanced risk indices health risk assessments and remediation techniques, which are critical for sustainable management. The findings thus call for targeted remediation strategies to mitigate heavy metal contamination and safeguard the ecological integrity and public health of Ashtamudi Wetland.

Field experiments were conducted at Lake Carl Blackwell (LCB) and Efaw Agronomy Research Station (Efaw) from 2015 to 2018 in Oklahoma, USA. Fourteen site years of data were used from two different trials, namely Regional Corn (Regional) and Optimum N rate (Optimum N). Three algorithms developed by Oklahoma State University (OSU) to predict yield potential were tested on both trials. Furthermore, three new models for predicting potential yield using optical crop sensors and climatological data were developed for maize in rain-fed conditions. The models were trained/built using Regional and were then validated/tested on the Optimum N trial. Out of three models, one model was developed using all of the Regional trial (combined model), and the other two were prepared from each location LCB and Efaw model. Of the three current algorithms; one worked best at predicting final grain yield at LCB location only. The coefficient of determination R-2=0.15 and 0.16 between actual grain yield and predicted grain yield was observed for Regional and Optimum N rate trials, respectively. The results further indicated that the new models were better at predicting final grain yield except for Efaw model (R-2=0.04) when tested on optimum N trial. Grain yield prediction for the combined model had an R-2=0.31. The best yield prediction was obtained at LCB with an R-2=0.52. Including climatological data significantly improved the ability to predict final grain yield along with using mid-season sensor data.					; Raun, William/A-3075-2017; Dhillon, Jagmandeep/AAG-8241-2019; Aula, Lawrence/AAD-1146-2020	Dhillon, Jagmandeep/0000-0002-6260-5174; 													2045-2322					JUL 10	2020	10	1								10.1038/s41598-020-68415-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-68415-2								32651438					WOS:000548308300018
J	Yang, L				Yang, Le			Contrasting methane emissions from upstream and downstream rivers and their associated subtropical reservoir in eastern China	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Subtropical reservoirs are an important source of atmospheric methane (CH4). This study investigated the spatiotempora I variability of bubble and diffusive CH4 emissions from a subtropical reservoir, including its upstream and downstream rivers, in eastern China. There was no obvious seasonal variation in CH4 emissions from the main reservoir, which increased slightly from the first half year to the next half year. In the upstream river, CH4 emissions were low from February to June and fluctuated widely from July to January due to bubble activity. In the downstream river, CH4 emissions were lowest in February, which was possibly influenced by the low streamflow rate from the reservoir (275 m(3) s(-2) ) and a short period of mixing. There was spatial variability in CH4 emissions, where fluxes were highest from the upstream river (3.65 +/- 3.24 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) and lowest from the main reservoir (0.082 +/- 0.061 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)), and emissions from the downstream river were 0.49 +/- 0.20 mg CH(4)m(-2) h(-1). Inflow rivers are hot spots in bubble CH4 emissions that should be examined using field-sampling strategies. This study will improve the accuracy of current and future estimations of CH4 emissions from hydroelectric systems and will help guide mitigation strategies for greenhouse gas emissions.																			2045-2322					MAY 30	2019	9								8072	10.1038/s41598-019-44470-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-44470-2								31147573					WOS:000469418100018

To summarize the patterns of phytoplankton community changes in rivers and to analyze the reasons for these patterns and differences, we sampled the three tributaries of the Dongjiang River at different latitudes in the dry and rainy season for three years. The results showed that the three rivers were mesotrophic, lightly eutrophic and moderately eutrophic respectively. From the south to the north, the water temperature and nutrition showed an increasing trend. In two different seasons, the differences in the water temperature and dissolved oxygen were clear. In the dry season, results of the multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis indicated that the phytoplankton community structures in the Li River and Qiuxiang River were similar. Regardless of the number of species, the cell abundance or the dominance index, Bacillariophyta were found to be dominant. Chlorophyta was dominant in the Danshui River. In the rainy season, Bacillariophyta, Bacillariophyta-Chlorophyta and Chlorophyta-Cyanophyta became the dominant types in the Li River, Qiuxiang River and Danshui River, respectively. These different patterns in phytoplankton community variation were affected by both the water quality and temperature.					; Fu, Lan/N-5580-2015; Jiang, Yuan/JJF-5092-2023; Tian, Yulu/JAN-9757-2023	Tian, Yulu/0000-0003-4673-0191; Zhaojiang, Hou/0000-0001-7744-9066; 														2073-4441				FEB	2018	10	2							152	10.3390/w10020152	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10020152													WOS:000426775500062

The variability in the stable isotope signatures of carbon and nitrogen (delta C-13 and delta N-15) in different phytoplankton taxa was studied in one mesotrophic and three eutrophic lakes in south-west Finland. The lakes were sampled on nine to 16 occasions over 2-4 years and most of the time were dominated by cyanobacteria and diatoms. A total of 151 taxon-specific subsamples covering 18 different phytoplankton taxa could be isolated by filtration through a series of sieves and by flotation/sedimentation, followed by microscopical identification and screening for purity. 2. Substantial and systematic differences between phytoplankton taxa, seasons and lakes were observed for both delta C-13 and delta N-15. The values of delta C-13 ranged from -34.4% to -5.9% and were lowest in chrysophytes (-34.4% to -31.3%) and diatoms (-30.6% to -26.6%). Cyanobacteria were most variable (-32.4% to -5.9%), including particularly high values in the nostocalean cyanobacterium Gloeotrichia echinulata (-14.4% to -5.9%). For delta C-13, the taxon-specific amplitude of temporal changes within a lake was usually < 1-8% (< 1-4% for microalgae alone and < 1-8% for cyanobacteria alone), whereas the amplitude among taxa within a water sample was up to 31%. 3. The values of delta N-15 ranged from -2.1% to 12.8% and were high in chrysophytes, dinophytes and diatoms, but low in the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria Anabaena spp., Aphanizomenon spp. and G. echinulata (-2.1% to 1.6%). Chroococcalean cyanobacteria ranged from -1.4% to 8.9%. For delta N-15, the taxon-specific amplitude of temporal changes within a lake was 2-6%, (2-6% for microalgae alone and 2-4% for cyanobacteria alone) and the amplitude among taxa within a water sample was up to 11%. 4. The isotopic signatures of phytoplankton changed systematically with their physical and chemical environment, most notably with the concentrations of nutrients, but correlations were non-systematic and site-specific. 5. The substantial variability in the isotopic signatures of phytoplankton among taxa, seasons and lakes complicates the interpretation of isotopic signatures in lacustrine food webs. However, taxon-specific values and seasonal patterns showed some consistency among years and may eventually be predictable.

Here, we report the results of an isotopic study of Late Miocene mammalian teeth and freshwater shells from Shuitangba (Yunnan Province, China) - an important refugium for hominoids, and reconstruct paleoenvironmental conditions in the area. delta C-13 values of fossil enamel samples range from -15.5 parts per thousand to -1.0 parts per thousand, with a mean of -11.3 +/- 2.3 parts per thousand, and delta O-18 values vary from -14.2 to -4.6 parts per thousand, averaging -9.7 +/- 2.2 parts per thousand. Reconstructed diet-delta C-13 values for these fossil mammals indicate that although they fed mostly on C-3 plants, many of them consumed some C-4 vegetation. This suggests that the local ecosystem contained C-4 grasses but was dominated by C-3 plants. The intra-tooth delta O-18 variation of fossil herbivores is larger than what is found in modern herbivores. Reconstructed paleo-meteoric water delta O-18(w) values are on average lower than those inferred from modern samples and also lower than the average delta O-18(w) values of modern precipitation in the region. Similarly, delta O-18 values of fossil freshwater shells display a larger seasonal variation and are significantly lower than modern shells from Fuxian Lake in the same region. Thus, the delta O-18 data from both mammalian teeth and freshwater mollusk shells support a wetter climate, possibly with a stronger precipitation seasonality in the Late Miocene than today. Comparison of clumped isotope temperatures from fossil and modern shells suggests a mean annual temperature of similar to 15 to 16 degrees C in the Shuitangba area in the Late Miocene, which is similar to 3 to 4 degrees C higher than that of today. Taken together, our isotope results suggest that C-4 grasses existed in local ecosystems in the area, likely in patches of grasslands or wooded grasslands in a mostly forested environment in the Late Miocene when the local and regional climate was warmer and wetter than today. Comparison of the delta C-13 records from Yunnan and the Siwalik region suggests that C-4 biomass spread earlier in the Indian subcontinent on the southwest side of the Tibetan Plateau than in Yunnan on the southeast side of the Plateau. The transition from a relatively wet habitat to a more open and drier habitat is also more pronounced and begins earlier in the Siwalik region, relative to Yunnan. These regional differences in climate and ecosystem evolution may be linked to the unique growth history of the Himalayan-Tibetan Plateau.

J	Bigio, L; Angert, A				Bigio, Laura; Angert, Alon			Isotopic signature of atmospheric phosphate in airborne tree pollen	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												In non-desert areas primary biological aerosol particles, including pollen, are an important source of phosphorus (P). During the flowering season large quantities of pollen from wind pollinated trees, are observed in boreal and temperate lakes and forest, which contain high P concentrations. However, there are different estimations for the contribution of pollen to the atmospheric P cycle, and there is no accepted method for the identification of phosphate from pollen origin. In this study we measured the P concentrations in pollen from various locations. In addition, the oxygen stable isotopes ratio in phosphate (delta O-18(p)) was measured for the first time for both the bioavailable pool (P extractable by anion-exchange resin), and for the HCI-extractable pool. The resin and HCl-extractable delta O-18(p) values were on average (+/- SE) 25.6 +/- 3.4%o, and 25.8 +/- 2.9%o, which are distinctively higher than mineral dust delta O-18(p) values (average 22.1 +/- 0.7%o). Pollen unique isotopic signature in phosphate can be used as a tool to identify P in aerosols from pollen origin, and hence to better understand the atmospheric P cycle. The high P concentrations found in this study (average ( +/- SE) resin-P and HCl-P values were 0.67 +/- 0.10 and 0.75 +/- 0.9 mg P g(-1)), confirm that pollen is important to the atmospheric P budget, and can help to solve the uncertainties regarding its role in the global P cycle.					bigio, laura/ITT-4780-2023	Bigio, Laura/0000-0002-7154-2523; Angert, Alon/0000-0003-4828-4025													1352-2310	1873-2844				DEC	2018	194						1	6		10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.09.020	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.09.020													WOS:000449140600001

The distribution and transportation of phosphorus is of great significance for aquatic environmental protection and ecological security. The sequential extraction method and molybdenum antimony anti-spectrophotometry were used to measure the concentrations of different forms of phosphorus in the surface sediments from 15 sampling sites along the middle reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River and its tributaries. The results show that the total phosphorus concentration in the surface sediments is 194.0 similar to 540.7 mg/kg, which is mainly composed of inorganic phosphorus. The concentrations of various phosphorus forms ranked as calcium-bound phosphorus (355.6 +/- 86.0 mg/kg) > soluble phosphorus (15.9 +/- 10.0 mg/kg) > iron-bound phosphorus (12.4 +/- 12.3 mg/kg) > organic phosphorus (9.6 +/- 6.1 mg/kg) > occluded phosphorus (9.2 +/- 3.8 mg/kg) > aluminum-bound phosphorus (5.4 +/- 2.3 mg/kg). On the whole, phosphorus concentration is greater in wet season than dry season. Regarding the spatial distribution characteristics, there are great disparities in the different forms of phosphorus in the middle reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River. Comprehensive analysis shows that phosphorus of this area is mainly self-generated, and concentration of bioavailable phosphorus is small, demonstrating there will not be a large release. We also drew a specific triangle of the different forms of phosphorus concentrations in the research area and defined the angle to determine the nutrient status of the overlying water quickly and effectively. Finally, phosphorus flux of the mainstream was estimated. This research may provide information on the phosphorus of Plateau Rivers.

Early Mississippian evaporites of coastal tropical wetlands	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Extensive evaporites in Lower Mississippian successions from palaeoequatorial regions are commonly used as evidence for an arid to semi-arid palaeoclimate. However, in this article, detailed studies of evaporites and their context refute this interpretation. Detailed sedimentological and petrographical analysis of the Lower Mississippian of northern Britain, is combined with archived log data from more than 40 boreholes across southern Scotland, northern England and Northern Ireland, and published literature from Canada. Two key cores from the Tweed Basin and the northern margin of the Northumberland - Solway Basin contain 178 evaporite intervals and reveal twelve distinct forms of gypsum and anhydrite across seven facies that are associated with planar laminated siltstone and intercalated thin beds of ferroan dolostone. Nodular gypsum and anhydrite, typically in intervals <1 to 2m thick, are integral components of the succession. Nodular evaporite occurs within about 1m of a palaeosurface, but most evaporite deposits represent ephemeral brine pans to semi-permanent hypersaline lakes or salinas on a floodplain that was subjected periodically to storm surges introducing marine waters. Formation of evaporites under a strongly seasonal climate in a coastal wetland is supported by palaeosol types and geochemical proxies, and from palaeobotanical evidence published previously. Although 65% of modern equatorial areas experience a strongly seasonal climatic regime, salinas and sabkhas are a minor component today in comparison with the evidence from these Lower Mississippian successions. This implies that the earliest terrestrial environments were complex and dynamic, providing a diverse range of habitats in which the early tetrapods became terrestrialized and represent a setting that is rarely preserved in the geological record.					; Davies, Sarah/ITT-3963-2023	Millward, David/0000-0001-5234-4735; Kearsey, Timothy/0000-0002-3869-7451													0037-0746	1365-3091				DEC	2018	65	7					2278	2311		10.1111/sed.12465	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sed.12465													WOS:000452240300003

Seasonal patterns of thermal stratification and primary production in the northern parts of Lake Tanganyika	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH					African Great Lakes Conference (AGLC) - Conservation and Development in a Changing Climate	MAY, 2017	Entebbe, UGANDA					Thermal stratification in meromictic Lake Tanganyika weakens during the cool, dry and windy season, allowing intrusions of deeper nutrient-rich waters into the upper mixed layer enhancing primary productivity. The current study examined the seasonal influence of thermal structure on the patterns of primary production in Lake Tanganyika. Two sites (Kigoma Bay and Mahale) were sampled on a monthly basis for 1 year. Water temperature and chlorophyll a fluorescence profiles (0-100 m) were measured using a multisonde. Water samples were taken every 20 m (0-100 m) to measure soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), chlorophyll a and primary production. Pulse Amplitude Modulated Fluorometry was used for the measurements of primary production. The results show that the dry season coincided with higher wind speeds, elevated SRP and some peaks of chlorophyll a and primary production at both sites. During the wet season, high levels of chlorophyll a and primary production coincided with an increase in the euphotic depth, a deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) and a contribution from metalimnetic areal production at both sites. Our results suggest that the vertical distribution of primary production in Lake Tanganyika is affected by the lake thermal structure, nutrient availability and the extent of the euphotic zone. In Lake Tanganyika, estimates of areal primary production were significantly affected by DCM and required estimation throughout the entire upper mixed layer and the metalimnion which extended to similar to 89 m.

J	Huang, J; Wu, M; Cui, TW; Yang, FL				Huang, Jue; Wu, Ming; Cui, Tingwei; Yang, Fanlin			Quantifying DOC and Its Controlling Factors in Major Arctic Rivers during Ice-Free Conditions using Sentinel-2 Data	REMOTE SENSING												The six largest Arctic rivers (Yenisey, Lena, Ob', Kolyma, Yukon, and Mackenzie) drain the organic-rich Arctic watersheds and serve as important pools in the global carbon cycle. Satellite remote sensing data are considered to be a necessary supplement to the ground-based monitoring of riverine organic matter circulation, especially for the ice-free periods in high-latitudes. In this study, we propose a remote sensing retrieval algorithm to obtain the chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) levels of the six largest Arctic rivers using Sentinel-2 images from 2016 to 2018. These CDOM results are converted to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations using the strong relationship (R-2 = 0.89) between the field measurements of these two water constituents. The temporal-spatial distributions of the DOC in the six largest Arctic rivers during ice-free conditions are depicted. The performance of the retrieval algorithm verifies the capacity of using Sentinel-2 data to monitor riverine DOC variations due to its improved spatial resolution, better band placement, and increased observation frequency. River discharge, watershed slopes, human activities, and land use/land cover change drove much of the variation in the satellite-derived DOC. The seasonality, geography, and scale would affect the correlation between DOC concentration and these influence factors. Our results could improve the ability to monitor DOC fluxes in Arctic rivers and advance our understanding of the Earth's carbon cycle.

Identifying human health risks from precious metal mining in Sierra Leone	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												Water pollution results in more than two million human deaths every year, with a disproportionate amount of mortality occurring in developing countries. Tracing how and where water-borne pollutants enter the human body during everyday practices, and estimating the potential risks of these interactions, is critical to effective mitigation or adaptive practices to reduce health impacts. To understand these local processes, we worked with human communities along the Pampana River in Sierra Leone, Africa, from its headwaters at Lake Sonfon in the northeast-an area with both active and abandoned gold mining sites-to its confluence with the Jong River in the center of the country. We first measured the concentrations of heavy metals in fish that people eat and in riverbank soils where people congregate. We then estimated the risk people face, distinguishing carcinogenic risks from non-carcinogenic risks, as well as quantifying the risk to different age groups (i.e., adults vs children) at varying distances from the mining areas and operations, and in different seasons (wet vs dry season). We found dangerously high levels of heavy metals in fish and soil and conclude through life practice analysis that people living along the Pampana River face significantly elevated health risks in their everyday lives due to contamination from metals. The mean adult cancer risk was 1.01 x 10(-3), while the mean child cancer risk was 9.42 x 10(-3). Higher risks are associated with the wet season and living either downstream or closest to the mining operations and were particularly acute for children. Mining operations that directly impact riverine human settlements represent an area of concern for developing countries such as Sierra Leone.

J	Klaic, ZB; Babic, K; Orlic, M				Klaic, Zvjezdana B.; Babic, Karmen; Orlic, Mirko			Evolution and dynamics of the vertical temperature profile in an oligotrophic lake	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												In this study, the fine-scale responses of a stratified oligotrophic karstic lake (Kozjak Lake, Plitvice Lakes, Croatia; the lake fetch is 2.3 km, and the maximum depth is 46 m) to atmospheric forcing on the lake surface are investigated. Lake temperatures measured at a resolution of 2 min at 15 depths ranging from 0.2 to 43 m, which were observed during the 6 July-5 November 2018 period, were analyzed. The results show thermocline deepening from 10 m at the beginning of the observation period to 16 m at the end of the observation period, where the latter depth corresponds to approximately one-third of the lake depth. The pycnocline followed the same pattern, except that the deepening occurred throughout the entire period approximately 1 m above the thermocline. On average, thermocline deepening was 3-4 cm d(-1), while the maximum deepening (12.5 cm d(-1)) co-incided with the occurrence of internal seiches. Furthermore, the results indicate three different types of forcings on the lake surface; two of these forcings have diurnal periodicity - (1) continuous heat fluxes and (2) occasional periodic stronger winds - whereas forcing (3) corresponds to occasional nonperiodic stronger winds with steady along-basin directions. Continuous heat fluxes (1) produced forced diurnal oscillations in the lake temperature within the first 5 m of the lake throughout the entire observation period. Non-continuous periodic stronger winds (2) resulted in occasional forced diurnal oscillations in the lake temperatures at depths from approximately 7 to 20 m. Occasional strong and steady along-basin winds (3) triggered both baroclinic internal seiches with a principal period of 8.0 h and barotropic surface seiches with a principal period of 9 min Lake currents produced by the surface seiches under realistic-topography conditions generated baroclinic oscillations of the thermocline region (at depths from 9 to 17 m) with periods corresponding to the period of surface seiches 9 approximate to min), which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been reported in previous lake studies.

This is the first published study to use an isotope facility developed in Malawi for this purpose, instead of relying upon sample analyses from abroad. Results from this new facility are used to evaluate an important Lake Malawi catchment in the Rift Valley. This work successfully established a stable-isotope baseline, hydrochemical signatures, and system conceptualization against which future policy change and management strategies may be measured. Precipitation isotopic composition was consistent with the Global Meteoric Water Line, but varied, confirming different precipitation systems nationally. Groundwater largely followed a Local Meteoric Water Line, with limited isotopic variation indicating predominant areal groundwater recharge, but with dry-season evaporative enrichment of groundwater near Lake Malawi. Surface-water isotopes widely varied with local precipitation, suggesting the latter accounted for wet-season river flows, but upstream dambo (complex wetlands occupying a shallow, seasonal waterlogged depression) helped sustain dry-season flows. Isotope capacity reinforced water-resource conceptualization and provenance in a hydrologically complex, but not atypical, Rift Valley system, exhibiting a noted complexity of groundwater-surface-water interactions. The latter, critical to integrated water resource management, requires more focused study, to which an expanded array of isotopes will contribute to tracking Sustainable Development Goal 6 targets. This study and future catchment studies should help underpin Malawian water-resource policy implementation on several identified fronts.					; Kalin, Robert M/E-8620-2011; Kelly, Laura/JDM-8939-2023; Kalin, Robert/E-8620-2011; Rivett, Michael/W-9249-2019	Chitsundi Banda, Limbikani/0000-0002-0449-5974; Rivett, Michael/0000-0003-4626-7985; Kalin, Robert M/0000-0003-3768-3848; 														2073-4441				DEC	2019	11	12							2600	10.3390/w11122600	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11122600													WOS:000507378600172
J	Bravo, HR; Bootsma, H; Khazaei, B				Bravo, Hector R.; Bootsma, Harvey; Khazaei, Bahram			Fate of phosphorus from a point source in the Lake Michigan nearshore zone	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Nutrient loading into Lake Michigan can produce algal blooms which in turn can lead to hypoxia, beach closures, clogging of water intakes, and reduced water quality. The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement targets for Lake Michigan are 5600 MT annually for total phosphorus (TP) loading, 7 mu g L-1 lake-wide mean TP concentration, and a chlorophyll-a concentration of 1.8 mu g L-1. However, in light of the recent resurgence of nuisance algal (Cladophora sp.) growth in the nearshore zone, the validity of these targets is now uncertain. The occurrence and abundance of Cladophora in the nearshore area depends primarily on the availability of dissolved phosphorus, light, and temperature. The availability of dissolved phosphorus is a potentially useful indicator of nearshore areas susceptible to excessive Cladophora growth and impaired water quality. Regulating agencies are looking for guidance in determining phosphorus loading rates that minimize local exceedance of the lake target concentration. In this study, the lake assimilative capacity was quantified by applying a biophysical model to estimate the area required for mixing and diluting wastewater treatment plant outfall TP loadings to the level of the lake target concentration during the Cladophora growing season. Model results compared well with empirical measurements of particulate and dissolved phosphorus as well as Cladophora biomass and phosphorus content. The model was applied to test scenarios of wastewater treatment plant phosphorus loading in two different years, in order to help establish phosphorus discharge limits for the plant.

Water sampling was carried out during seasonal Belarusian Antarctic expeditions in 2011-2017. Totally 22 water samples from four lakes, three temporal ponds and one water course were collected for major and trace elements determination. The total concentrations of Ag, Al, As, Ba, Be, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Na, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Th, Tl, V, W, Zn in all samples as well as more than 40 additional trace elements in 3 samples from lakes were determined using ICP-MS method. It is shown that increase of heavy metals concentration (Cd, Pb, Zn, Sb, Co, Ni, Se, Mn) and As in the lakes compared to temporary ponds can be explained by anthropogenic impact including previous human activity in the oasis in late 1970th - early 1990th. The maximum concentrations of a number of technophilic elements (Pb, Mo, Mn, V, Sb, Zn) in Lake Nizhneye are possibly connected with the its lowest hypsometric location in catchment and the drainage of the territory impacted by past and present human activity.

Temporal variation of bird assemblages in dynamic fluvial wetlands: seasonality and influence of water level and habitat availability	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												Introduction: Study of temporal variation of bird assemblages may be particularly important in highly dynamic ecosystems as fluvial wetlands to identify the factors that influence and contribute to maintain regional bird diversity. Objective: To study temporal variation in regional bird species composition (i.e. set of species that make up the assemblage) and richness (i.e. species number) and the factors that drive it, and quantify the importance of temporal-beta diversity to sustain bird regional diversity, in the fluvial system of the Middle Parana River in Argentina. Methods: We sampled birds on a regional scale by performing 16 repeated surveys roughly every 45 days across 2 years (2011-2013) at 60 point counts distributed along the fluvial system. Results: We recorded a total of 162 species and 12 738 detections, with a mean of 72.7 +/- 1.9 species and 796.1 +/- 41 individuals per survey. Temporal beta diversity accounted for 57 % of regional bird species richness. Bird composition varied seasonally because of the species turnover (and not nestedness) between non-breeding and breeding periods; migrant species contributed to this issue but did not account for all these differences. Difference in bird composition between years was associated primarily to species turnover within non-breeding periods and was related to changes in water levels. Temporal variation in availability of habitats across the regional extent of the fluvial system accounted for the highest proportion of temporal beta diversity. Species richness neither varies seasonally nor was it related to fluctuations in water level or habitats. Conclusions: The climatic seasonality and environmental dynamics of the fluvial system. as a function of water-level fluctuations and of variations in habitat availability, jointly influence regional composition of birds through temporal species turnover. These variations in regional composition were not related to variations in regional species richness. These results show the importance of the natural dynamic of the fluvial system to preserve the processes that maintain the regional assemblage of birds.

Partitioning between benthic and pelagic nitrate reduction in the Lake Lugano south basin	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We evaluated the seasonal variation of denitrification, anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) rates in the sediments and the integrative N (and O) isotopic signatures of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) compounds in the overlying water column of the monomictic Lake Lugano south basin. Denitrification was the dominant NO3- reduction pathway, whereas the contribution of anammox and DNRA to total benthic NO3- reduction was, 6% and, 12%, respectively. Sedimentary denitrification rates were highest (up to 57.2 6 16.8 mmol N m22 h21) during fully oxic bottom water conditions. With the formation of seasonal bottom water anoxia, NO3- reduction was partitioned between water column and sedimentary processes. Total benthic NO3- reduction rates determined in N-15-label experiments and sediment-water interface N-2 fluxes as calculated from water column N-2 : Ar gradients revealed that sedimentary denitrification still accounted for, 40% of total N-2 production during bottom water anoxia. The partitioning between water column and sedimentary denitrification was further evaluated by the natural abundance stable N isotope composition of dissolved NO3-in the water column. With anaerobic bottom water conditions, water column NO3-concentrations gradually decreased, paralleled by an increase in delta N-15-and delta O-18-NO3-from approximately 7% to 20% and from 2% to 14%, respectively. Using a closed-system (Rayleigh) model, the N and O isotope effects associated with community NO3- consumption were 15e < 13.7% and 18e < 11.3%, respectively. With the assumptions of a relatively low net N isotope effect associated with sedimentary denitrification (i. e., 15esed 5 1.5-3%) vs. a fully expressed biological N isotope fractionation during water column denitrification (i. e., 15ewater 5 20-25%), our results confirm that 36-51% of NO3- reduction occurred within the sediment. The general agreement between the indirect (isotopic) approach and the flux and rate measurements suggests that water column nitrate isotope measurements can be used to distinguish between benthic and pelagic denitrification quantitatively.

At seasonal timescales, the buoyancy associated with freshwater inflows dominates the tidal forcing, yielding a strongly stratified two-layered system, with the surface and the bottom layers flowing in opposite directions (classical estuarine circulation). Wind controls the physical behavior of the bay at shorter (days to weeks) timescales. Three scenarios or states have been defined, depending on the strength of stratification relative to the predominant direction and magnitude of the wind forcing, parameterized through the Wedderburn number, W. For weak winds (scenario 1), with W >> 1, mixing occurs as a consequence of stirring and convective cooling, and the mixed layer deepens slowly. For strong winds, with W << 1/2, mixing is fast and is largely driven by shear at the pycnocline. Two scenarios are further identified for W << 1/2 depending on the directionality of the winds: one for persistent NW winds (scenario 2) and another for diurnal SW winds (scenario 3). In scenario 2, the water is pushed laterally, overturning the stratification and generating transverse density gradients. In scenario 3, the estuarine circulation is weakened and even reversed, yielding strong longitudinal density gradients. The bay waters relax quickly (within 10-18 h) back to the original state, after the wind ceases, as a result of the horizontal density gradients developed under wind forcing. Bay-sea exchange rates are shown to decrease significantly in the low W scenarios, the magnitudes of these changes being largely dependent on wind direction. These scenarios have important implications for the ecology of the bay, including the occurrence of phenomena such as harmful algal blooms. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

F.; Raw, Jacqueline L.; Peer, Nasreen			Biodiversity census of Lake St Lucia, iSimangaliso Wetland Park (South Africa): Gastropod molluscs	ZOOKEYS												The recent dry phase experienced by the St Lucia estuarine system has led to unprecedented desiccation and hypersaline conditions through most of its surface area. This has changed only recently, at the end of 2011, with the onset of a new wet phase that has already caused a major shift to oligo- and mesohaline conditions. The estuary mouth, however, remains closed to the ocean, making the weak connection recently established between the St Lucia and the Mfolozi estuaries the only conveyance for marine recruitment. As a result, only 10 indigenous and two alien aquatic gastropod species are currently found living in the St Lucia estuarine lake. This is out of a total of 37 species recorded within the system since the earliest survey undertaken in 1924, half of which have not been reported in the literature before. The tick shell, Nassarius kraussianus, which was consistently found in large abundance prior to the recent dry phase, appears to have temporarily disappeared from the system, probably as a result of the extinction of Zostera marine grasses inside the lake. Population explosions of the bubble shell Haminoea natalensis, with its distinct egg masses, were recorded seasonally until 2009, but the species has subsequently not been observed again. A molecular DNA analysis of the various populations previously reported as belonging to the same assimineid species, variably referred to as Assiminea capensis, A. ovata, or A. bifasciata, has revealed that the St Lucia assemblage actually comprises two very distinct taxa, A. cf. capensis and a species provisionally referred to here as "A." aff. capensis or simply Assimineidae sp. In the mangroves, the climbing whelk Cerithidea decollata is still found in numbers, while ellobiids such as Cassidula labrella, Melampus semiaratus and M. parvulus are present in low abundances and all previously recorded littorinids have disappeared. A number of alien freshwater species have colonized areas of the system that have remained under low salinity. These include the invasive thiarid Tarebia granifera, which can be found in concentrations exceeding 5000 ind. m(-2), the lymnaeid Pseudosuccinea columella and the physid Aplexa marmorata.

Saline rivers provide arid landscapes with a considerable amount of biochemically valuable production of chironomid (Diptera) larvae	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Saline rivers are supposed to be 'hot spots' of high biological productivity in arid landscapes. To test this, we quantified the production of chironomid larvae, because river production is known to be transferred to arid landscapes primarily by birds fed on these larvae. In addition, we studied the potential biochemical quality of the larvae for birds based on the essential highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA) contents in their biomass. We studied species composition and measured production of chironomid larvae in two saline rivers (Volgograd region, Russia). We also evaluated the fatty acid composition and contents of the dominant taxa and estimated the flux of HUFA from the studied saline rivers to land via chironomid potential emergence. Average monthly production of chironomids measured for only 1 month, August, was quite comparable to annual production in some freshwater rivers. All the dominant chironomid larvae had comparatively high essential eicosapentaenoic acid contents, especially Cricotopus salinophilus, which showed the highest value, reported for Chironomidae. The monthly flux of HUFA from the studied rivers to land due to the chironomid potential emergence was roughly comparable to the global average estimation of annual water-land HUFA export via emerging insects.

Although it is crucial to determine its structure and function for water ecological health, MFW changes during lake melt period have not been well studied. In this study, the MFW was divided into three categories by analyzing its structure and trophic transfer efficiency using hierarchical C/N stable isotopes and eDNA sequencing techniques, including the detrital food web (DFC, 15 %), classical grazing food web (CFC, 60 %), and mixed trophic food web (MFC, 25 %). The trophic structure and type of MFW in ice-melting lakes are always in the process of succession and adaptation, which is in a relatively low trophic transfer efficiency stage under stable conditions (i.e. CFC), whereas the input of exogenous debris and organic pollutants may lead to an increase in MFW trophic transfer efficiency (i.e. MFC, DFC). The trophic transfer efficiency from the previous trophic level to protozoa and micrometazoa was 16.32 % and 20.77 % in DFC and 10.20 % and 29.43 % in MFC, respectively. Both are obviously higher than those of the CFC (11.69 % and 9.45 %, respectively). In terms of trophic structure, the community interaction and trophic cascade effect of DFC and MFC were enhanced but easily changed with environmental factors. In contrast, the core species and cascading effects of the CFC were clearer, and the MFW structure was relatively stable. Overall, this study reveals that the explosive increase in MFW trophic transfer efficiency induced by exogenous input during the lake melt period may subsequently lead to the destabilization of the microbial community structure and cause potential ecological risks. These are manifested in the absence of ecological trophic processes, the decrease in trophic structure complexity and stability, and the weakening of microecology self-adaptive regulation ability.					; Liao, Yinhao/JHU-1126-2023; ji, guodong/KDM-5048-2024	Liao, Yinhao/0009-0005-7142-7831; Wang, Shuo/0000-0002-2072-2962; Ji, Guodong/0000-0002-0195-2367; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				OCT 10	2022	842								156893	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156893	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156893								35753488					WOS:000864154800009
J	Yao, Y; Han, XX; Chen, Y; Li, DJ				Yao, Yu; Han, Xiaoxiang; Chen, Ying; Li, Dujun			The variations of labile arsenic diffusion driven by algal bloom decomposition in eutrophic lake ecosystems	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The vertical labile arsenic (As) concentration and diffusion pattern variations in eutrophic lakes were investigated using in situ techniques of diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) and high-resolution dialysis (HR-Peeper) in the typ-ical eutrophic system of Lake Taihu in China. In addition, simulation experiments were used to reveal labile As distri-butions in sediment profiles under the influence of algae blooms and wind fluctuations. Our results indicated that eutrophication could lead to the migration and transformation of As fractions, including increased As bioavailability, as well as varied diffusion patterns. The sulfate released from algae decomposition reduced to H2S and formed FeS, which weak adsorbability contributed to the increased mobility of the As fractions. Meanwhile, further decomposition released a large quantity of algae-derived organic matter which competed with the adsorbed As, leading to more endogenous As migrating to the overlying water. Accordingly, the H2S production presented a likely explanation for the changed distribution of labile As and contributed to labile As concentrations in the sediment profiles significantly increasing at depths of -20 mm to -60 mm in the early stages of the simulation experiment. Moreover, the areas of enhanced diffusion patterns with high concentrations of As obviously expanded. However, following the complete decomposition of the algae, the organic matter component significantly changed, suggesting an explanation for the var-iations in distribution of labile As. All the diffusion pattern variations showed similar trends. Consequently, variation of labile As diffusion patterns could indicate the decomposition and eutrophication levels of freshwater ecosystems.

However, sequenced genomes and environmental surveys suggest active aquatic N-fixation also by many non-cyanobacterial groups. Here, we revealed the seasonal variation and genomic diversity of potential N-fixers in a humic bog lake using metagenomic data andnifgene clusters analysis. Groups with diazotrophic operons were functionally divergent and includedCholorobi,Geobacter,Desulfobacterales,Methylococcales, andAcidobacteria. In addition tonifH(a gene that encodes the dinitrogenase reductase component of the molybdenum nitrogenase), we also identified sequences corresponding to vanadium and iron-only nitrogenase genes. Within theChlorobipopulation, the nitrogenase (nifH) cluster was included in a well-structured retrotransposon. Furthermore, the presence of light-harvesting photosynthesis genes implies that anoxygenic photosynthesis may fuel nitrogen fixation under the prevailing low-irradiance conditions. The presence ofrnfgenes (related to the expression of H+/Na+-translocating ferredoxin: NAD+ oxidoreductase) inMethylococcalesandDesulfobacteralessuggests that other energy-generating processes may drive the costly N-fixation in the absence of photosynthesis. The highly reducing environment of the anoxic bottom layer of Trout Bog Lake may thus also provide a suitable niche for active N-fixers and primary producers. While future studies on the activity of these potential N-fixers are needed to clarify their role in freshwater nitrogen cycling, the metagenomic data presented here enabled an initial characterization of previously overlooked diazotrophs in freshwater biomes.

J	Decrouy, L; Vennemann, TW; Ariztegui, D				Decrouy, Laurent; Vennemann, Torsten Walter; Ariztegui, Daniel			Controls on ostracod valve geochemistry: Part 2. Carbon and oxygen isotope compositions	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												The stable carbon and oxygen isotope compositions of fossil ostracods are powerful tools to estimate past environmental and climatic conditions. The basis for such interpretations is that the calcite of the valves reflects the isotopic composition of water and its temperature of formation. However, calcite of ostracods is known not to form in isotopic equilibrium with water and different species may have different offsets from inorganic precipitates of calcite formed under the same conditions. To estimate the fractionation during ostracod valve calcification, the oxygen and carbon isotope compositions of 15 species living in Lake Geneva were related to their autoecology and the environmental parameters measured during their growth. The results indicate that: (1) Oxygen isotope fractionation is similar for all species of Candoninae with an enrichment in (18)O of more than 3 parts per thousand relative to equilibrium values for inorganic calcite. Oxygen isotope fractionation for Cytheroidea is less discriminative relative to the heavy oxygen, with enrichments in (18)O for these species of 1.7 to 2.3 parts per thousand. Oxygen isotope fractionations for Cyprididae are in-between those of Candoninae and Cytheroidea. The difference in oxygen isotope fractionation between ostracods and inorganic calcite has been interpreted as resulting from a vital effect. (2) Comparison with previous work suggests that oxygen isotope fractionation may depend on the total and relative ion content of water. (3) Carbon isotope compositions of ostracod valves are generally in equilibrium with DIC. The specimens' delta(13)C values are mainly controlled by seasonal variations in delta(13)C(DIC) of bottom water or variation thereof in sediment pore water. (4) Incomplete valve calcification has an effect on carbon and oxygen isotope compositions of ostracod valves. Preferential incorporation of CO(3)(2-) at the beginning of valve calcification may explain this effect. (5) Results presented here as well as results from synthetic carbonate growth indicate that different growth rates or low pH within the calcification site cannot be the cause of oxygen isotope 'vital effects' in ostracods. Two mechanisms that might enrich the (18)O of ostracod valves are deprotonation of HCO(3)(-) that may also contribute to valve calcification, and effects comparable to salt effects with high concentrations of Ca and/or Mg within the calcification site that may also cause a higher temperature dependency of oxygen isotope fractionation.

Scales that matter: guiding effective monitoring of soil properties in restored riparian zones	GEODERMA												Considerable effort has been directed at restoring riparian zones to ensure they continue to provide ecosystem services and one of the most common aims of these activities is to reduce nutrients (in either water or soil) entering waterways. Vegetation plays a major role in nutrient interception, but nutrients in terrestrial ecosystems are strongly influenced by edaphic factors. Therefore understanding the effectiveness of riparian restoration efforts is dependent on knowledge of the complex and highly dynamic nature of nutrient cycling processes in riparian soils and their adjacent landscapes. Our primary aim was to assess the potential utility of a range of common soil indicators for monitoring responses to riparian restoration, and to use this information to provide guidance for more effective monitoring. A range of soil physiochemical properties in riparian zones and adjacent paddocks as a comparison were measured, incorporating both structural (e.g., bulk density) and functional (e.g., nitrogen) variables likely to differ in terms of both their responsiveness to restoration, and degree of natural spatial and temporal variation. Soil properties across the three spatial scales considered here (among creeks, among sites and within sites) varied considerably, particularly levels of phosphorus, ammonium and nitrate. Total organic carbon and total nitrogen were less variable and more uniform across all scales. Potential explanations for these patterns were explored by examining relationships between soil properties and vegetation measures, and between a subset of the most promising indicators (carbon, total nitrogen and bulk density, based on inherently low spatial variability) and adjacent land-use. Fertiliser inputs appear to be a strong determinant of soil phosphorus but otherwise soil properties were not strongly related to vegetation or adjacent land-use. For mineral N this is likely a reflection of the highly spatiotemporally dynamic nature of nutrient cycling in riparian zone soils. A better understanding of natural variability in soil properties will greatly aid in developing more effective monitoring programmes to assess potential changes in riparian soil properties. Management of riparian systems to recover soil ecosystem services will depend upon identifying effective ecological indicators that can be used as measures of progress towards restoration goals. This study represents a necessary first step towards guiding meaningful monitoring of soil properties at riparian zones subject to restoration efforts. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Trin. ex Steud.) were investigated bimonthly, from January to November, in a shallow hypertrophic lake. Periphytic algae were represented by three genera, cyanobacteria, diatoms and chlorophytes. Cyanobacteria showed the highest relative abundances during the study. The total biomass of periphytic algae showed seasonal variation and reached the lowest values in May and the highest in November. Chironomid assemblage showed very low diversity and constituted mostly of Cricotopus sp. (gr. sylvestris), Endochironomus albipennis, Glyptotendipes sp. Depending the month of the year, larvae of these three taxa amounted 95-98% of total chironomid density. The density of chironomid larvae collected was affected by the season. The larvae fed mostly on diatoms and generally preferred the most abundant algal taxa as a food source. Diet composition of chironomid larvae showed seasonal variability and was specific for chironomid taxon and size class of larvae. The highest (44%) taxonomic (or structural) similarity between periphyton and gut contents was observed in class I larvae of E. albipennis in January. (c) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Depth and basin shape constrain ecosystem metabolism in lakes dominated by benthic primary producers	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Metabolism is one of the most fundamental ecosystem processes, but the drivers of variation in metabolic rates among lakes dominated by benthic primary producers remain poorly constrained. Here, we report the magnitudes and potential drivers of whole-lake metabolism across 43 Swedish arctic-alpine lakes, based on the free-water diel oxygen technique with sondes deployed during the open-water season near the surface and bottom of the lakes. Gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R) were strongly coupled and ranged from 0.06 to 0.45 mg and 0.05 to 0.43 mg L-1 d(-1) among lakes. On average, GPP and R decreased eightfold from relatively shallow to deep lakes (mean depth 0.5-10.9 m) and twofold from concave to convex lakes (mean depth: maximum depth 0.2-0.5). We attribute this to light limitation and shape-specific sensitivity of benthic GPP to disturbance by lake ice. Net ecosystem production (GPP-R) ranged from -0.09 to 0.14 mg L-1 d(-1) and switched, on average, from positive to negative towards deeper lakes and lakes richer in dissolved organic carbon (DOC; 0.5-7.4 mg DOC L-1). Uncertainties in metabolism estimates were high (around one and three times mean R and GPP), especially in deep lakes with low insulation and diurnally variable wind speed. Our results confirm the role of DOC in stimulating net heterotrophy and highlight novel effects of lake shape on productivity in benthic-dominated lake ecosystems and its response to changes in lake ice cover.					; Klaus, Marcus/AAL-1818-2021	Karlsson, Jan/0000-0001-5730-0694; Klaus, Marcus/0000-0003-0747-3524; Verheijen, Hendricus/0000-0002-2858-6299													0024-3590	1939-5590				DEC	2022	67	12					2763	2778		10.1002/lno.12236	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.12236		OCT 2022											WOS:000864192700001

Scott			Laguna Seca sediments reveal environmental and climate change during the latest Pleistocene and Holocene in Sierra Nevada, southern Iberian Peninsula	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Sedimentation in most glacial lakes and wetlands in the Sierra Nevada (southern Iberian Peninsula) began after the last deglaciation and since the Younger Dryas (YD)-Early Holocene (EH) transition. Therefore, until now, studies on older sedimentary records were lacking in this alpine area, which limits the paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic information to the Holocene. In this study, we studied palynomorphs from the alpine record from Laguna Seca (LS), the longest and oldest (similar to 18,000 cal yr BP = 18 kyr) sedimentary record in the Sierra Nevada to investigate the response of forests and lake environments in the western Mediterranean area to climate changes and human impact during the latest Pleistocene and Holocene. The deepest lake conditions occurred during the last deglaciation, indicated by the occurrence of Pediastrum algae, which showed highest abundances during the Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1) and Bolling-Allerod (B-A) transition. Xerophyte herbs such as Artemisia, Ephedra, and Amaranthaceae were highest during the late B-A and YD indicating regional aridity. Poaceae (grasses) were maxima in the B-A and EH, probably indicating expansion in the barren areas after deglaciation. Maximum in temperature and humidity during the EH and cooling and aridification in the Middle (MH) and Late Holocene (LH) are indicated by the changes in the abundance of deciduous Quercus and Pinus forest species. Botryococcus algae increased during the Early Holocene, while the rest of the algae almost vanished, which could indicate that the lake became very productive but shallower until 8.2 kyr. The lake level lowered and became seasonal in the Middle-Late Holocene transition, coinciding with the regional climate aridification. Microcharcoal analysis done on the palynological preparations agrees with the vegetation changes, showing maxima in the EH and MH, related with the maximum in regional forest occurrence, and a decrease in the LH when the Mediterranean vegetation, and thus fuel availability, diminished. This record shows evidence of anthropogenic impact in the last centuries by cultivation, reforestation, cattle grazing, enhanced erosion and eutrophication.

Reports on the dynamics of its iconic floating gardens and on the evolution of the Lake's dimensions in response to land-use change in the watershed are inconsistent and provide a poor basis for policymaking. Here, we (a) present a critical overview of the literature concerning land degradation around Lake Inle; (b) provide an independent and quantitative reexamination of the Lake's size; (c) carry out a methodic assessment of the history of floating gardens based on written sources, interviews, and high-resolution imagery from 1967, 1983, 2002, and 2014; and (d) produce the first comprehensive and biseasonal bathymetric survey of the Lake, thereby providing a baseline water volume estimate fit for future monitoring purposes. Results challenge previous reports and show that floating agriculture boomed in the 1970s (11 km(2) in 1967 and 29 km(2) in 1983), peaked in 2002 (35 km(2)), then declined slightly (33 km(2) in 2014). Our bathymetric survey reveals that the Lake volume at the peak of the 2015 rainy season was 122.6 x 10(6) m(3), with maximum water depths having diminished substantially from 6 m (as reported in 1918) to just 3 m today as a combined result of sediment aggradation and waterlevel decline (-1 m in 25 years). Those dynamics have critical implications for the sustainability of floating agriculture, fishing, and the local tourist economy.					; Mialhe, François/AAD-5184-2020	Michalon, Martin/0000-0002-9314-9669; 													1085-3278	1099-145X				MAY 15	2019	30	8					928	941		10.1002/ldr.3279	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.3279													WOS:000466089200004

Recognizing Allogenic Controls on the Stratigraphic Architecture of Ancient Alluvial Fans in the Western US	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												Alluvial fans are a significant part of the sediment routing system, forming distinctive steep, fan-shaped deposits of coarse-grained detritus where rivers lose flow velocity after exiting confined mountain drainages. Processes on the fan are influenced by both internal (autogenic) feedback cycles like channel avulsion and by external (allogenic) conditions such as climate and tectonics. These conditions in turn influence the stratigraphic architecture (i.e., the pattern of channel stacking and sizes) within the fan. Studying stratigraphic architecture of alluvial fans can, therefore, provide insight into controls on fan deposition. We employ UAV-based photogrammetric models to analyze the stratigraphic architecture of two well-exposed ancient alluvial fans in the western US - the Eocene Richards Mountain Conglomerate and the Cretaceous Echo Canyon Conglomerate. Both fans were deposited under relatively warm, wet climates and compressional tectonic regimes. We use a seven-fold hierarchy of bounding surfaces and associated lithosomes to describe alluvial fan architecture. First- through fourth-order surfaces and lithosomes represent bedform to channel-scale features influenced primarily by autogenic processes on the fan. Controls on fifth-order surfaces/lithosomes have historically been poorly understood, but probably represent fanhead trench migration and lobe construction. Sixth-order surfaces bound individual alluvial fans and seventh-order surfaces correspond to formation boundaries. These are controlled primarily by tectonics. The fifth-order architectural style of the deposits in our two study areas is significantly different and we use this difference to try to isolate a primary control on fifth-order alluvial architecture. Average width:height ratios of fifth-order lithosomes are nearly twice as high for Echo Canyon (112:1) than for Richards Mountain (64:1). This indicates that active channels on the Echo Canyon fan were more mobile than those on the Richards Mountain fan. We attribute this to a more seasonal climate and less vegetation during the deposition of the Echo Canyon Conglomerate (relative to Richards Mountain). This would have increased lateral migration by destabilizing channels through increased sediment flux and flood events. Our results imply that fifth-order stratigraphic architecture of ancient alluvial fans may provide insight into allogenic processes related to paleoclimate. They also indicate risk of increased geologic hazards on alluvial fans where anthropogenic climate change increases future climate variability.																				2296-6463				JUN 24	2020	8								215	10.3389/feart.2020.00215	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2020.00215													WOS:000549110600001

A modeling approach to identify the effective forcing exerted by wind on a prealpine lake surrounded by a complex topography	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The representation of spatial wind distribution is recognized as a serious difficulty when modeling the hydrodynamics of lakes surrounded by a complex topography. To address this issue, we propose to force a 3-D lake model with the wind field simulated by a high-resolution atmospheric model, considering as a case study a 61 km(2) prealpine lake surrounded by mountain ranges that reach 1800 m above the lake's surface, where a comprehensive data set was available in the stratified season. The improved distributed description of the wind stress over the lake surface led to a significant enhancement in the representation of the main basin-scale internal wave motions, and hence provided a reference solution to test the use of simplified approaches. Moreover, the analysis of the power exerted by the computed wind field enabled us to identify measuring stations that provide suitable wind data to be applied uniformly on the lake surface in long-term simulations. Accordingly, the proposed methodology can contribute to reducing the uncertainties associated with the definition of wind forcing for modeling purposes and can provide a rational criterion for installing representative measurement locations in prealpine lakes.

Dispersal and Survival of Captive-Reared Threatened Fishes in a Tonle Sap Lake Reserve	WATER												The Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia supports several species of threatened megafish and contains one of the largest networks of freshwater fish reserves in the world. Despite these traits, this system remains understudied in terms of its utility for endangered fish conservation and restoration. This study was the first of a series of planned fish releases designed to test the effectiveness of conservation supplementation programs in the Tonle Sap Lake. In March 2022 (during the dry season), 1582 captive-reared fishes, including 1538 striped catfish Pangasianodon hypopthalmus, 42 giant barb Catlocarpio siamensis, and two Mekong giant catfish Pangasianodon gigas, were tagged and released into a 986-hectare fish reserve to assess post-release dispersal and survival. Brightly colored external tags with unique identification numbers were used to facilitate tag returns. A high-profile release event was held to raise awareness about the activity, bringing attention to the importance of fish reserves and endangered species conservation, and disseminating information about the research and tag return and reward program. This, in concert with other efforts, served to be an important education and outreach tool and increased tag return rates. We found that mortality from fishing was rapid and very high. Nineteen percent of released fishes were recaptured in the first 2 days after the fish release, and 46% were recaptured by day 83 after the release, indicating intense fishing pressure on the Tonle Sap Lake fisheries. Eighty percent of recaptured fishes were caught in stationary gill nets, most within 10 km of the release site. Fishing mortality rates were independent of fish size or source (pond-reared or cage-reared). Environmental DNA (eDNA) was found to be capable of detecting each of these species' presence in the water at the release site and could prove to be a useful tool for endangered species monitoring and restoration. Future research should explore alternative release timing, release location, and other methods of increasing post-release survival. Ultimately, underlying sources of mortality, especially fishing, will need to be addressed for conservation supplementation programs to succeed in the Tonle Sap Lake. Conservation supplementation should not be viewed as a substitute for more fundamental conservation measures, such as maintenance of environmental flows, preservation of ecological connectivity, and science-based fisheries management.

This study aims in validating citizen science water quality collected data (nitrate, phosphate and turbidity) with those collected and measured by professional scientists in the laboratory. A second objective of the study is to use citizen scientist data to identify the patterns of seasonal and spatial variations in nutrient conditions and forecast potential changes based on expected changes in population and climate (to 2050). The results showed that the concentrations of nitrate and phosphate measured by citizen scientists nearly matched those established by professional scientists, with overall accuracy of 91% and 74%, respectively. For total suspended solids measured by professional and turbidity measured by citizen scientists, results show that, using 14 NTU as a cut-off, citizen scientist measurements of Sec-chi tube depth to identify lake TSS below 7.0 mg/L showed an accuracy of 88%. In both laboratory and citizen scientist-based studies, all measured water quality variables were significantly higher during the wet season compared to the dry season. Climate factors were discovered to have a major impact on the likelihood of exceeding water quality restrictions in the next decades (2050), which could deteriorate lake conditions. Upscaling citizen science to more communities on the lake and other African Great Lakes would raise environmental awareness, inform management and mitigation activities, and aid long-term decision-making.

J	Zhang, Y; Zhao, C; Yu, AX; Zhao, WL; Ren, FY; Liu, YC				Zhang, Yan; Zhao, Chen; Yu, Aixin; Zhao, Wanli; Ren, Fangyun; Liu, Yucan			The Migration Pattern of Atrazine during the Processes of Water Freezing and Thawing	TOXICS												Atrazine, one of the most commonly used herbicides in the world, is of concern because of its frequent occurrence in various water bodies and the potential threat it constitutes to ecosystems. The transport of contaminants in seasonally ice-covered lakes is an important factor affecting the under-ice water environment, and changes in phase during ice growth and melting cause redistribution of atrazine between ice and water phases. To explore the migration pattern of atrazine during freezing and thawing, laboratory simulation experiments involving freezing and thawing were carried out. The effects of ice thickness, freezing temperature, and initial concentration on the migration ability of atrazine during freezing were investigated. The results showed that the relationship between the concentration of atrazine in ice and water during freezing was ice layer < water before freezing < water layer under the ice. Atrazine tended to migrate to under-ice water during the freezing process, and the intensity of migration was positively correlated with the ice thickness, freezing temperature, and initial concentration. During the thawing phase, atrazine trapped in the ice was released into the water in large quantities in the early stages. The first 20% of meltwater concentration was significantly higher than the average concentration in ice, with the highest case being 2.75 times the average concentration in ice. The results reported in this study are a useful reference for planning possible pollution control measures on such lakes during their freeze-thaw process.					; Zhao, Wanli/LEM-5822-2024	Liu, Yucan/0000-0001-5475-9897; Zhang, Yan/0000-0003-1786-8335														2305-6304				OCT	2022	10	10							603	10.3390/toxics10100603	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/toxics10100603								36287883					WOS:000875013600001
J	Wang, DQ; White, JR; Delaune, RD; Yu, ZJ; Hu, YJ				Wang, Dongqi; White, John R.; Delaune, Ronald D.; Yu, Zhongjie; Hu, Yujie			Peripheral freshwater deltaic wetlands are hotspots of methane flux in the coastal zone	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Methane (CH4) emissions are low in the coastal zone due to a higher redox poise, related to sulfate reduction. However, river deltas are a potential source of CH4 flux in coastal zones globally, due to fresh condition and high primary production. The goal of this studywas to seasonally measure CH(4)flux at three different geomorphic settings (newly forming island, river channel bottom and established freshwater marsh) within the Wax Lake Delta, Louisiana, USA. CH4 flux rates were 386 +/- 327 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in March and 2859 +/- 1286 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in June at the freshwater marsh site. At the island site, CH4 flux was significantly smaller at 7.94 +/- 3.57 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in March and 215 +/- 153 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in June while at adjacent river channel bottom site, CH4 flux was lowest at 2.49 +/- 3.38 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in March and 19.5 +/- 1.12 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in June at the air-water interface. CH4 emission rates show significant spatial heterogeneity with rates up to two orders of magnitude greater at themarsh site at the periphery of the delta, related to greater soil total C. Therefore regions within the active delta do not provide a significant source of methane, due to a lack of soil C, despite freshwater conditions. However, marshes at the periphery within the halo of fresh water, populated with established plant communities can be significant hotspots of CH4 emissions, despite their location within the coastal zone.

Its growth dynamics and toxin distribution in field remain largely undocumented. Chrysosporum ovalisporum was reported in 2009 in Karaoun Reservoir, Lebanon. We investigated the factors controlling the occurrence of this cyanobacterium and vertical distribution of cylindrospermopsin in Karaoun Reservoir. We conducted bi-weekly sampling campaigns between May 2012 and August 2013. Results showed that Chrysosporum ovalisporum is an ecologically plastic species that was observed in all seasons. Unlike the high temperatures, above 26 degrees C, which is associated with blooms of Chrysosporum ovalisporum in Lakes Kinneret (Israel), Lisimachia and Trichonis (Greece) and Arcos Reservoir (Spain), Chrysosporum ovalisporum in Karaoun Reservoir bloomed in October 2012 at a water temperature of 22 degrees C during weak stratification. Cylindrospermopsin was detected in almost all water samples even when Chrysosporum ovalisporum was not detected. Chrysosporum ovalisporum biovolumes and cylindrospermopsin concentrations were not correlated (n = 31, r(2) = -0.05). Cylindrospermopsin reached a maximum concentration of 1.7 mu g L-1. The vertical profiles of toxin concentrations suggested its possible degradation or sedimentation resulting in its disappearance from the water column. The field growth conditions of Chrysosporum ovalisporum in this study revealed that it can bloom at the subsurface water temperature of 22 degrees C increasing the risk of its development and expansion in lakes located in temperate climate regions.

In all the considered water bodies, P. rubescens was the dominant cyanobacterium. All the lakes were characterized by significant relationships between MCs and B-Pr, with limited variability in the MC quota (the content of MCs per unit of biovolume) within each water body compared with the variability between sites. The results were consistent with the development of specific MC-genotypes, with moderate seasonal and spatial changes in the proportion between toxic and non-toxic strains. The MC cell quota obtained in our work (ECQ Environmental Cell Quota) were in the same range of values computed on the basis of analyses made on environmental samples dominated by P. rubescens or Planktothrix agardhii, and on isolates of the same two species (<1 to over 10 mu g mm(-3)). Besides the usual ordinary least square regressions, models have been evaluated by using quantile regression, a method that allows estimating the conditional median or other quantiles of the response variable. We showed that the use of quantile regressions has different advantages, which included the computation of MC quota based on the whole range of available data, the robustness against outliers, and the ability to estimate models also in cases where there is no or only weak relationships. The highest ECQ values estimated from 95% quantile regressions in specific water bodies might be used to estimate the worst-case MC concentrations from algal abundances. Nevertheless, it was stressed that a realistic assessment of toxicity and potential adverse health effects necessarily should take into account the toxicity potential of the more abundant MC-congeners produced by specific cyanobacteria populations.

The lake is reportedly under anthropogenic pressure and suffers from eutrophication. The floating villagers suffer from waterborne diseases. However, the shift in bacterial community due to human activities in this great lake has not yet been reported. We aimed to determine the dynamics of the bacterial community and their concentration in the lake using 67 surface waters, 53 sub-layer waters and 59 sediment samples by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). The bacterial communities in the surface water and sub-layer water were similar but they differed from the sediment; however, their abundance showed spatiotemporal variations. The bacterial diversity reached the highest value in the dry season but lowest value in the rainy season in the surface water and sediment. Their diversity in the sub-layer water was highest in the transition from dry to rainy season. The total 16S rRNA gene copy number in the sediment were >100 times higher than that measured in the water. The Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria concentrations in the lake water increased in the dry season and reached a peak in the transition from dry to rainy season. The concentrations of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes elevated in the lake water and sediment, respectively, in the floating villages which were >10 times higher than the places with non-point sources. The bacterial concentration and its diversity in the Tonle Sap Lake changed based on the lake water volume between rainy and dry season. The bacterial concentration in the Tonle Sap Lake diluted with the water inflow from Mekong River and its tributaries in the rainy season. As influenced by the fecal waste, the bacterial community in the floating villages differed from the places with non-point source. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zieba, FW; Yengoh, GT; Tom, A				Zieba, Felix Watang; Yengoh, Genesis Tambang; Tom, Abdouraman			Seasonal Migration and Settlement around Lake Chad: Strategies for Control of Resources in an Increasingly Drying Lake	RESOURCES-BASEL												The Lake Chad Basin has for a very long period supported the livelihoods of millions of peoples from the different countries that share this transboundary water resource. Its shrinking over the decades has meant that many of those who depend on it for livelihoods would have to adjust to the changing resource environment of this lake basin. This study sets out to examine the seasonal migration of people in search of water, pasture, fuelwood and cultivable land, and how this movement affects access and use of basin resources. The study made use of survey data obtained from 220 household heads on the Cameroon side of the Lake Chad basin, and secondary data from Cameroon ministries in charge of agriculture, the environment, and that of livestock. Our findings show that while fishing and livestock rearing continue to feature among the oldest determinants of population movements in the Lake Chad basin, increasingly the search for new farming opportunities made available by a shrinking lake and the political instability emanating from Nigeria are also becoming an important determinant. The increasing population in the lake region is compounding pressures created by a shrinking lake on access to water, fuelwood, pasture, and farmland. While there is potential to develop and benefit from the agricultural possibilities emerging from a shrinking lake, the impacts of poor agricultural resource management (especially land degradation, loss of agricultural biodiversity, and poor water management) may hamper the sustainable practice of agriculture if proper efforts are not made to address them. This study contributes to the scientific understanding of the changing nature of environmental resources in Africa. It specifically contributes to understanding the exacerbating threats to the sustainability of natural resources (water, agricultural and grazing land) caused by environmental changes, diversification of rural actors (fishers, farmers, breeders), weak resource management, and since 2013, by an armed conflict.																				2079-9276				SEP	2017	6	3							41	10.3390/resources6030041	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/resources6030041													WOS:000412505500019

Changes in biomass burning, wetland extent, or agriculture drive atmospheric NH3 trends in select African regions	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Atmospheric ammonia (NH3) is a precursor to fine particulate matter and a source of nitrogen (N) deposition that can adversely affect ecosystem health. The main sources of NH3 - agriculture and biomass burning - are undergoing are or expected to undergo substantial changes in Africa. Although evidence of increasing NH3 over parts of Africa has been observed, the mechanisms behind these trends are not well understood. Here we use observations of atmospheric NH3 vertical column densities (VCDs) from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) along with other satellite observations of the land surface and atmosphere to evaluate how NH3 concentrations have changed over Africa from 2008 through 2018, and what has caused those changes. In West Africa NH3 VCDs are observed to increase during the late dry season, with increases of over 6% yr(-1) in Nigeria during February and March ( p<0 :01). These positive trends are associated with increasing burned area and CO trends during these months, likely related to agricultural preparation. Increases are also observed in the Lake Victoria basin region, where they are associated with expanding agricultural area. In contrast, NH3 VCDs declined over the Sudd wetlands in South Sudan by over 1.5% yr(-1), though not significantly (p D 0:28). Annual maxima in NH3 VCDs in South Sudan occur during February through May and are associated with the drying of temporarily flooded wetland soils, which favor emissions of NH3. The change in mean NH3 VCDs over the Sudd is strongly correlated with variation in wetland extent in the Sudd: in years when more area remained flooded during the dry season, NH3 VCDs were lower (r D 0:64, p<0:05). Relationships between biomass burning and NH3 may be observed when evaluating nationalscale statistics: countries with the highest rates of increasing NH3 VCDs also had high rates of growth in CO VCDs; burned area displayed a similar pattern, though not significantly. Livestock numbers were also higher in countries with intermediate or high rates of NH3 VCD growth. Fertilizer use in Africa is currently low but growing; implementing practices that can limit NH3 losses from fertilizer as agriculture is intensified may help mitigate impacts on health and ecosystems.					; Andela, N./H-7485-2014; Clarisse, Lieven/GQQ-4657-2022; Hickman, Jonathan/HGV-0916-2022; Tsigaridis, Kostas/K-8292-2012; Bauer, Susanne/P-3082-2014; Ossohou, Money/AAM-7073-2021; Van Damme, Martin/K-8884-2017	Ossohou, Money/0000-0001-5891-2182; Tsigaridis, Kostas/0000-0001-5328-819X; Hickman, Jonathan/0000-0002-7246-642X; Van Damme, Martin/0000-0003-1752-0558; Di Vittorio, Courtney/0000-0001-8623-1982; Dammers, Enrico/0000-0003-0128-8205													1680-7316	1680-7324				NOV 16	2021	21	21					16277	16291		10.5194/acp-21-16277-2021	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-16277-2021													WOS:000720369700001

Temporal Study of the Microbial Diversity of the North Arm of Great Salt Lake, Utah, US	MICROORGANISMS												We employed a temporal sampling approach to understand how the microbial diversity may shift in the north arm of Great Salt Lake, Utah, U.S. To determine how variations in seasonal environmental factors affect microbial communities, length heterogeneity PCR fingerprinting was performed using consensus primers for the domain Bacteria, and the haloarchaea. The archaeal fingerprints showed similarities during 2003 and 2004, but this diversity changed during the remaining two years of the study, 2005 and 2006. We also performed molecular phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA genes of the whole microbial community to characterize the taxa in the samples. Our results indicated that in the domain, Bacteria, the Salinibacter group dominated the populations in all samplings. However, in the case of Archaea, as noted by LIBSHUFF for phylogenetic relatedness analysis, many of the temporal communities were distinct from each other, and changes in community composition did not track with environmental parameters. Around 20-23 different phylotypes, as revealed by rarefaction, predominated at different periods of the year. Some phylotypes, such as Haloquadradum, were present year-round although they changed in their abundance in different samplings, which may indicate that these species are affected by biotic factors, such as nutrients or viruses, that are independent of seasonal temperature dynamics.																				2076-2607				SEP	2015	3	3					310	326		10.3390/microorganisms3030310	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms3030310								27682091					WOS:000890385400001
J	Mehner, T; Kasprzak, P				Mehner, Thomas; Kasprzak, Peter			Partial diel vertical migrations in pelagic fish	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												P>1. Field studies on diel vertical migration (DVM) usually report uniform behaviour with population-wide ascents and descents during crepuscular periods. This contrasts partial seasonal migrations of many animal populations, where individuals choose either the resident or the migrant strategy depending on population density, feeding opportunity and predation risk in the resident and migrant habitats. 2. We tested whether DVM of freshwater zooplanktivorous fish (Coregonus spp.) resembles partial migrations. Twenty-eight hydroacoustic surveys were performed in the deep Lake Stechlin (Germany) between 2000 and 2010, with samplings encompassing all months between March and December. Zooplankton samples were simultaneously taken in epilimnetic and hypolimnetic layers. Fish obtained from depth-stratified samplings by a midwater trawl were used to test for individual differences between residents and migrants. 3. We show for the first time that DVMs of freshwater fish resemble patterns of partial migrations often found in seasonal environments. Across all samplings, 7-33% of fish did not ascend at dusk, but exhibited the resident strategy. The proportion or residents increased at low zooplankton feeding rates in the daytime habitat and during months when the temperature difference between daytime and night-time habitats was minor. 4. Slightly larger size and higher caloric density of migrants over residents in one of the coexisting Coregonus species suggested that individual differences contributed to the migration strategy performed. However, these results were based on one sample only, and extrapolation to the entire data set is not possible. 5. Our results are indirect evidence that the balance between migrants and residents may primarily depend on the trade-off between feeding gains and metabolic and predation costs of migration. However, the results also suggest that the global fitness consequences for the resident and migrant strategies may not be identical, rendering the importance of individual traits in the 'decision to migrate' likely.

From precipitation to runoff: stable isotopic fractionation effect of glacier melting on a catchment scale	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Stable isotope variability and fractionation associated with transformation of precipitation/accumulation to firn to glacial river water is critical in a variety of climatic, hydrological and paleoenvironmental studies. This paper documents the modification of stable isotopes in water from precipitation to glacier runoff in an alpine catchment located in the central Tibetan Plateau. Isotopic changes are observed by sampling firnpack profiles, glacier surface snow/ice, meltwater on the glacier surface and catchment river water at different times during a melt season. Results show the isotopic fractionation effects associated with glacier melt processes. The slope of the D-O-18 regression line and the deuterium excess values decreased from the initial precipitation to the melt-impacted firnpack (slope from 9.3 to 8.5 and average d-excess from 13.4 parts per thousand to 7.4 parts per thousand). The slope of the D-O-18 line further decreased to 7.6 for the glacier runoff water. The glacier surface snow/ice from different locations, which produces the main runoff, had the same D-O-18 line slope but lower deuterium excess (by 3.9 parts per thousand) compared to values observed in the firnpack profile during the melt season. The D-O-18 regression line for the river water exhibited a lower slope compared to the surface snow/ice samples, although they were closely located on the D-O-18 plot. Isotope values for the river and glacier surface meltwater showed little scatter around the D-O-18 regression line, although the samples were from different glaciers and were collected on different days. Results indicate a high consistency of isotopic fractionation in the D-O-18 relationships, as well as a general consistency and temporal covariation of meltwater isotope values at the catchment scale.

Hydrogeology and Landform Morphology Affect Plant Communities in a Great Lakes Ridge-and-Swale Wetland Complex	WETLANDS												Trajectories of vegetative change in wetlands can be influenced strongly by shifts in water-table elevation driven by evapotranspiration and spatial-temporal variability in groundwater. The specific dynamics of such interactions are difficult to quantify because of spatial complexities associated with local climate, geomorphology, and underlying geology. Nonetheless, a better understanding of the effects of groundwater and landform pattern on plant communities in wetlands can help with future predictions of change. Over two successive growing seasons, we investigated water-balance dynamics in 15 wetlands in a forested Great Lakes coastal wetland complex consisting of relict beach ridges and intervening swales. Our goal was to explore how variation in hydrogeology and landform morphology affected plant community composition. Water-balance analyses from water-level fluctuation methods, along with interpretation of underlying stratigraphy and slope, were used to explain plant-community ordination results. Our findings showed that phreatophytic plant communities developed in locations where hydrogeology or greater slopes allowed for supplemental groundwater flow to the swales. Conversely, shallow water-table slopes maintained standing water in swales, leading to obligate wetland plant communities. This study provides a clearer representation of hydrogeologic and ecohydrologic interactions to help inform our understanding of the relationship between groundwater hydrology and plant communities in wetlands.

Documenting Its Present Research Status from 1999 to 2022	SAGE OPEN												This study aims to present a comprehensive knowledge mapping of plastic pollution on coastal/marine tourism research. To achieve this objective, the present study employed a two-tier analysis, including a systematic review of literature and bibliometric analysis of 164 scholarly articles spanning 1999 to 2022. The results underline the multidisciplinary nature of this research domain, characterized by a significant upswing in publications. The dominant countries in this field are identified as Brazil, Australia, and the USA. A noteworthy collaboration dynamic between the Chinese Academy of Sciences, East China Normal University, and the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences has emerged, signaling opportunities for enhanced cross-border cooperation. Jambeck, who provided data support for this research field, is found as the most cited author. Marine Pollution Bulletin, Environmental Pollution, and Science of the Total Environment are the most prolific journals discussing such topics. The primary research clusters in this field include seasonal comparison, Qinghai Lake, and small plastic debris. Additionally, scholars have recently focused on new topics such as seasonal comparison, case study, spatial pattern, and the Southern Baltic Sea in the last 3 years. This research also reports 10 articles with the highest citations and 10 highly cited papers. Not only this, the present study presents the inaugural bibliometric analysis on plastic pollution in coastal and marine tourism.

Santa Maria del Oro Lake is a sub-tropical crater-lake (60 m maximum depth) almost confined by surrounding mountains, which only receives seasonal fresh water input. In order to evaluate lake thermal variations, we measured water temperatures at bottom, 4 m, 10 m, 25 m, and 32 m depth. To study lake vertical mixing process, we implemented a 3D high-resolution model forced with atmospheric variables. Field data analysis indicate an hypolimnetic warming rate of 0.1136 +/- 0.0001 degrees C y(-1), about ten times larger than the mean global warming rate, and model results indicated that this was mainly caused by thermal diffusion between surface and bottom water layers. The lake presents a stable temperature stratification, which can reach 40 m depth during the windiest and coolest nights, indicating that the lake is oligomictic (i.e. mixes only occasionally). Inter-annual climate variability and global warming can alter the frequency of full vertical water mixing and, therefore, deep water warming. The used methodology can be useful to evaluate bottom trend temperature of subtropical lakes worldwide, and results may contribute to the use of deep lake waters as sentinels of multi-annual climate variability. As deep water mixing affects water quality, this may also be useful to better manage lake environmental services. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

B.; Jones, Mica; Brandt, Steven; Bunn, Henry; Marshall, Fiona			Oxygen isotope analyses of ungulate tooth enamel confirm low seasonality of rainfall contributed to the African Humid Period in Somalia	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												During the African Humid Period (AHP), between similar to 14 and 5 ka, north and eastern Africa were much wetter and greener than they are today. Although the AHP has long been attributed to an increase in rainfall driven by orbital forcing, many details regarding the timing, pacing, and contributing moisture sources remain to be determined, especially for eastern Africa. Recent research suggests that both Atlantic and Indian Ocean moisture contributed to the AHP in eastern Africa. Large mammalian faunas from two Late Pleistocene/Holocene rock-shelter sites in southern Somalia, Gogoshiis Qabe and Guli Waabayo, provide an unusual opportunity to investigate the AHP in an area of eastern Africa that is orographically isolated from Atlantic Ocean moisture. To track changes in aridity at these sites, we used the oxygen isotope aridity index, which exploits the difference in tooth enamel oxygen isotope (delta O-18) values between evaporation insensitive obligate drinkers and evaporation sensitive non-obligate drinkers to calculate a water deficit value. Water deficit values calculated from dik-dik (Madoqua spp.; non-obligate drinkers) and warthog (Phacochoerus spp.; obligate drinkers) tooth enamel delta O-18 values at Gogoshiis Qabe and Guli Waabayo are in agreement and progressively increase toward the present. Additionally, two of three direct dated serially-sampled warthog teeth (ID 4032 and 4033) from Guli Waabayo demonstrate low seasonality of rainfall during much of the AHP (range in delta O-18 <= 1.8 parts per thousand). One tooth (ID 4035) with high amplitude variability in delta O-18 values (3.1 parts per thousand) dates to 8470 +/- 66 cal yr B.P., a period identified as a lowstand in several lake level records. Our results suggest that regions isolated from Atlantic Ocean moisture likely experienced a less-pronounced AHP than those receiving moisture from multiple sources but indicate less seasonal variability than present. Our findings also support the presence of climate variability within the AHP.						Reid, Rachel E.

Here we use a rotifer species complex inhabiting highly unpredictable and fluctuating salt lakes to gain insights into the mechanisms involved in stable coexistence in cryptic species. We combined molecular barcoding surveys of planktonic populations and paleogenetic analysis of diapausing eggs to reconstruct the current and historical coexistence dynamics of two highly morphologically similar rotifer species, B. plicatilis and B. manjavacas. In addition, we carried out laboratory experiments using clones isolated from eight lakes where both species coexist to explore their clonal growth responses to salinity, a challenging, highly variable and unpredictable condition in Mediterranean salt lakes. We show that both species have co-occurred in a stable way in one lake, with population fluctuations in which no species was permanently excluded. The seasonal occurrence patterns of the plankton in two lakes agree with laboratory experiments showing that both species differ in their optimal salinity. These results suggest that stable species coexistence is mediated by differential responses to salinity and its fluctuating regime. We discuss the role of fluctuating salinity and a persistent diapausing egg banks as a mechanism for species coexistence in accordance with the 'storage effect'.

While it has often proven to be effective, the method also sets challenges: it is about balancing between effective P removal and maintenance of the thermal stratification of the lake. The success of different HW projects has been reviewed in some studies retrospectively, but scientific literature still lacks studies that use detailed data on the lake biogeochemistry to scale and optimize the method in advance, and to predict the outcomes of the restoration measure. In the current study, we investigated the seasonal biogeochemistry, P stocks and thermal stratification of a eutrophic lake (Lake Kymijarvi/Myllypohja basin, southern Finland) to determine an optimal withdrawal rate, to assess its effects on stratification, and to evaluate the expected success of HW. We found that by adjusting HW with P diffusive fluxes from the sediment (diffusion-adjusted HW), it is possible to remove a notable part of the cycling P without causing major disturbances to the thermal stratification even in a relatively shallow lake. Our results show that HW can have great potential in lake restoration: diffusion-adjusted HW in our study lake could increase the annual P output by 35-46%, shifting the P budget of the lake to negative. We thus propose a novel approach to optimize HW on the basis of the diffusive flux of P from the sediment, with the goal of extracting P continuously at an equivalent rate to the diffusive flux. We finally discuss how this can be achieved more effectively with HW based on a closed-circuit system. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Using the stable isotopes delta C-13 and delta N-15, six trophic chains were identified during a previous study. Four are based on only one source: seston, organic matter from the bottom sediment, periphyton and macrophytes. Two are based on mixed sources (seston and periphyton in one case, periphyton and macrophytes in the other). During sampling, we found only one taxon that had surface sediment organic matter as food source and very few taxa whose trophic source was constituted by macrophytes. The periphyton was the most important source during all seasons; it produced the longest chain, with three trophic positions. Whatever the season and trophic source, all collected macroinvertebrates contained methyl mercury and the latter was biomagnified in all trophic chains that we identified. The biomagnification of methylmercury through invertebrate trophic chains accurately reflected the existence and length of these chains. Biomagnification was virtually non-existent in the sediment-based chain, low and restricted to the dry season in the macrophyte-based chain. It was significant in the seston-based chain, but limited by the existence of only two trophic levels and restricted to the wet season. Finally, it was very effective in the periphyton-based chain, which offers the highest rate of contamination of the source but, above all, the largest number of trophic levels. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Lateral migration of Arapaima gigas in floodplains of the Amazon	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												This study deduced in detail the lateral migration -those between river channels and floodplain habitats - of the pirarucu (Arapaima gigas), a giant, obligate air-breathing species of the Amazon Basin. Over a thousand samples of the pirarucu were taken through counts of the individuals performed at the moment of aerial breathing; these samples were taken in eight habitats of a floodplain near the Amazon River every week throughout an entire flood cycle. The lateral migration of the pirarucu accompanied water level fluctuations closely. As water levels rose, the pirarucu migrated to increasingly higher habitats in flooded forests and remained there during high water levels. As water levels declined, the pirarucu migrated first back to lower habitats of flooded forests, then to communicating channels, and, eventually, to the lakes, where they remained during low water levels. These results allow for a conceptual model of lateral migration of floodplain fishes.

Diverse responses of vegetation and fire after pleistocene megaherbivore extinction across the eastern US	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Megaherbivores are keystone species whose removal from landscapes can cause cascading ecosystem changes, yet the consequences of Late Quaternary megaherbivore extinctions remain uncertain. This paper tests the Megaherbivory Release Hypothesis (MRH), which posits that the decline and extinction of megaherbivores (body size >1000 kg) during the last deglaciation in eastern North America contributed to the expansion of more palatable hardwood tree taxa, the development of vegetation assemblages with no modern analogue, and increased fuel load and fire activity. Coprophilous fungal spores in lake sediment records are used as proxies for megaherbivore abundance and are essential to testing the MRH through analyses of lead/lag relationships among vegetation composition, megaherbivore abundance, fire, and climate. Although some prior analyses of coprophilous fungal spores from individual sites have supported the MRH, these interpretations have been complicated by 1) discrepancies in the timing of coprophilous spore declines versus megaherbivore extinction timing based on dated vertebrate remains, 2) reliance on a single fungal taxon (Sporormiella) rather than a full suite of coprophilous fungi taxa, and 3) uncertainties in the taphonomic processes that influence fungal spore abundances. To examine the spatiotemporal relationships among megaherbivory, vegetation, and fire, we developed five new multi -taxon coprophilous fungal spore records for comparison with existing pollen, spore, and charcoal records from 14 sites across eastern North America. The MRH was well supported in the northeast and central US, with most sites showing a coprophilous spore decline by-14.6 ka followed by a rise of hardwood taxa (-14.4 ka). However, changes in fire regime varied widely among northeast and central US sites and may have preceded spore declines. The MRH was not well supported in the southeastern US, where a smaller rise in hardwood taxa (-16.1-13.1 ka) generally preceded the decline in coprophilous spores at indi-vidual sites (-15.8-12.7 ka). These site-level and regional differences suggest spatial variations in the strength of couplings among late-Quaternary megaherbivore extinctions, vegetation composition and structure, and fire regime. Possible explanations for the differences between the northern and south-eastern US include (1) differences in landscape heterogeneity of canopy openness and palatability, (2) net primary productivity and sensitivity to top-down trophic effects, (3) megaherbivore density, and (4) climate trends and seasonality at orbital to millennial timescales.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.					; Williams, John/KBC-5275-2024; Gill, Jacquelyn/HCH-8486-2022	Gill, Jacquelyn/0000-0003-0003-6620; Kiahtipes, Christopher/0000-0002-8758-4605; Perrotti, Angelina/0000-0001-6003-0082; Jackson, Stephen/0000-0002-1487-4652													0277-3791	1873-457X				OCT 15	2022	294								107696	10.1016/j.quascirev.2022.107696	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2022.107696		SEP 2022											WOS:000862399500007

Effects of the drastic seasonal change of water salinity on interaction of DOM with Ca2+ in the arid inland waters were completely unknown. In the present study, complexation of DOM with Ca2+ in the freshwater (0.5 parts per thousand salinity) and hypersaline water (70 parts per thousand salinity) were comparatively examined by excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence quenching titration and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The complexation of DOM with Ca2+ was significantly influenced by the drastic change of salinity. The ITC complexation is exothermic at 0.5 parts per thousand salinity but turns to an endothermic process at 70 parts per thousand salinity. More energy is needed for the complex reaction between DOM and Ca2+ under the hypersaline condition than in the fresh water. Fluorescence quenching titration indicates that DOM has stronger binding ability toward Ca2+ in the freshwater than in the saline water, and more fractions of DOM in the freshwater are accessible to Ca2+ than in the saline water. Ca2+ complexation in the DOM is dominated by the tryptophan-like components at both salinities and the complexation of Ca2+ with fulvic acid-like components is ignorable. The findings is important for understanding the aquatic geochemical processes in some lakes that seriously affected by irrigation water use in the arid zone. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Spatial and temporal variation of the aeolian sediment transport in the ephemeral Baringak Lake (Sistan Plain, Iran) using field measurements and geostatistical analyses	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR GEOMORPHOLOGIE												Wind erosion is one of the most serious problems in the Sistan region, located in the East of Iran and near the border of Afghanistan. During the dry and hot seasons, strong winds locally called the "Sadobist Roozeh", which means "120 windy days" blow from Northern and Northwestern directions to the Southeast. This wind entrains and transports dust and sand from the dry beds of ephemeral lakes, affecting the Sistan region in Iran, southern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan. In order to investigate the land surface sensitivity to aeolian transport, 74 graduated pins were embedded randomly in the ephemeral Baringak Lake bed and the aeolian transport rates were measured for three events in 2013 individually as well as for the total study period. The spatial and temporal variation of the aeolian transport was also mapped using GIS and geostatistical methods for these events and for the total duration of 103 days. The resulting variograms revealed a high spatial dependence of the different events and showed that geostatistical techniques are a valid tool for the mapping of aeolian sediment transport. The average transport rate in terms of the detected drift height on the dry lake bed was 1.93 cm or 31 kg/m(2) between the 5th of August and the 17th of November in 2013.					; khosroshahi, mohammad/ABC-2300-2021; abbasi, hamidreza/U-7566-2017	Abbasi, Hamidreza/0000-0002-9976-8364; khosroshahi, Mohammad/0000-0002-8210-5177													0372-8854					JUN	2018	61	4					315	326		10.1127/zfg/2018/0451	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/zfg/2018/0451													WOS:000437255700003

The influence of habitat heterogeneity on freshwater bacterial community composition and dynamics	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Multiple forces structure natural microbial communities, but the relative roles and interactions of these drivers are poorly understood. Gradients of physical and chemical parameters can be especially influential. In traditional ecological theory, variability in environmental conditions across space and time represents habitat heterogeneity, which may shape communities. Here we used aquatic microbial communities as a model to investigate the relationship between habitat heterogeneity and community composition and dynamics. We defined spatial habitat heterogeneity as vertical temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) gradients in the water column, and temporal habitat heterogeneity as variation throughout the open-water season in these environmental parameters. Seasonal lake mixing events contribute to temporal habitat heterogeneity by destroying and re-creating these gradients. Because of this, we selected three lakes along a range of annual mixing frequency (polymictic, dimictic, meromictic) for our study. We found that bacterial community composition (BCC) was distinct between the epilimnion and hypolimnion within stratified lakes, and also more variable within the epilimnia through time. We found stark differences in patterns of epilimnion and hypolimnion dynamics over time and across lakes, suggesting that specific drivers have distinct relative importance for each community.

J	Axelsen, JB; Manrubia, S				Axelsen, Jacob Bock; Manrubia, Susanna			River density and landscape roughness are universal determinants of linguistic diversity	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Global linguistic diversity (LD) displays highly heterogeneous distribution patterns. Though the origin of the latter is not yet fully understood, remarkable parallelisms with biodiversity distribution suggest that environmental variables should play an essential role in their emergence. In an effort to construct a broad framework to explain world LD and to systematize the available data, we have investigated the significance of 14 variables: landscape roughness, altitude, river density, distance to lakes, seasonal maximum, average and minimum temperature, precipitation and vegetation, and population density. Landscape roughness and river density are the only two variables that universally affect LD. Overall, the considered set accounts for up to 80% of African LD, a figure that decreases for the joint Asia, Australia and the Pacific (69%), Europe (56%) and the Americas (53%). Differences among those regions can be traced down to a few variables that permit an interpretation of their current states of LD. Our processed datasets can be applied to the analysis of correlations in other similar heterogeneous patterns with a broad spatial distribution, the clearest example being biological diversity. The statistical method we have used can be understood as a tool for cross-comparison among geographical regions, including the prediction of spatial diversity in alternative scenarios or in changing environments.

Decadal rainfall variability modes in observed rainfall records over East Africa and their relations to historical sea surface temperature changes	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Detailed knowledge about the long-term interface of climate and rainfall variability is essential for managing agricultural activities in Eastern African countries. To this end, the space-time patterns of decadal rainfall variability modes over East Africa and their predictability potentials using Sea Surface Temperature (SST) are investigated. The analysis includes observed rainfall data from 1920 to 2004 and global SSTs for the period 1950-2004. Simple correlation, trend and cyclical analyses, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with VARIMAX rotation and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) are employed. The results show decadal signals in filtered observed rainfall record with 10 years period during March-May (MAM) and October-December (OND) seasons. During June-August (JJA), however, cycles with 20 years period are common. Too much/little rainfall received in one or two years determines the general trend of the decadal mean rainfall. CCA results for MAM showed significant positive correlations between the VARIMAX-PCA of SST and the canonical component time series over the central equatorial Indian Ocean. Positive loadings were spread over the coastal and Lake Victoria regions while negative loading over the rest of the region with significant canonical correlation skills. For the JJA seasons, Atlantic SSTs had negative loadings centred on the tropical western Atlantic Ocean associated with the wet/dry regimes over western/eastern sectors. The highest canonical correlation skill between OND rainfall and the Pacific SSTs showed that El Nino/La Nina phases are associated with wet/dry decades over the region. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Salt-Fingering in Seasonally Ice-Covered Lakes	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												When ice forms on lakes, dissolved salts are rejected, which can lead to under-ice salt finger formation. We performed a series of laboratory experiments to visualize these fingers. While we detected salt fingers in our camera recordings, the signal of these fingers is nearly absent in the temperature record. We quantify the velocity of the salt-plumes and measure the bottom salinity increase from these fingers. Further, we estimate that the salinity is often distributed evenly with depth. Comparing the salt fluxes in our experiments with a typical salt flux in lakes, we suggest that conditions are favorable for salt fingering in most seasonally ice-covered lakes.

Water samples were collected from the river at seven sites every month for 1year (March 2016 to February 2017). Pesticide residues were extracted from the samples by a solid phase extraction using Sep Pack C-18 cartridges. Once extracted, the samples were analyzed for cyanazine, simetryn, fenarimol, isoprothiolane, and diazinon using a reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography ultraviolet visible (HPLC-UV Vis) system. The limits of detection were 3.60, 4.10, 2.80, 6.50, and 7.30ng L-1 for cyanazine, simetryn, fenarimol, isoprothiolane, and diazinon, respectively. Good recovery rates (88%-102%), and mean percent relative standard deviation range (1.00%-5.70%) (n = 6) were obtained with a spiking at 0.20 mu g L-1. The maximum concentrations of 282, 391, 60, 1086, and 1194ng L-1 were obtained for cyanazine, simetryn, isoprothiolane, fenarimol, and diazinon, respectively. Cyanazine was the most frequently detected pesticide (64% of the samples, n = 84), followed by simetryn (58%), and then diazinon (57%). The highest and lowest pesticide concentrations were measured during the periods May-June, and January-February, respectively. Principal component analysis revealed three principal components in which the pesticides were linked to dissolved organic matter and total suspended solids. The major water quality parameters (electrical conductivity, pH, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, NH4+, NO3-, Cl-, SO42-, NO2-, and temperature) showed no clear trends for these pesticides. The presence of simetryn and isoprothiolane was largely attributed to rice paddy farms, whereas diazinon was associated mostly with vegetable farms and orchards. The diazinon and isoprothiolane patterns were consistent with their use of controlling insects and fungi in the prefecture. The maximum diazinon concentration detected was higher than the human safe level specified by the European Union (100ng L-1) in Council Directive 98/83/EC. This is of concern because of the bioconcentration potential of these residues in fish and other marine animals consumed by humans.					; Takeda, Kazuhiko/A-6167-2019	Sakugawa, Hiroshi/0000-0002-1903-3078; Takeda, Kazuhiko/0000-0003-0251-290X													0360-1234	1532-4109					2018	53	9					602	614		10.1080/03601234.2018.1473972	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2018.1473972								30036130					WOS:000457096300006

The livelihood of several millions of people within the basin and outside the basin is governed by the precipitation conditions within this basin. Large spatial and temporal variabilities of precipitation can increase the incidence of extreme events such as floods and droughts. It is important to identify the characteristics of these variations, and this study aims at investigating the characteristics of the seasonal and annual cycles of precipitation within the Lake Tana Basin using harmonic analysis. Precipitation data of 31 years from four weather stations were used in the analysis. We then applied harmonic analysis to calculate the amplitude, phase shift, and variance of observation. Detailed characteristics of the first five harmonics are presented and discussed. We found the amplitude of the first harmonic to be 173.42, 177.93, 127.77, and 188.78 mm for Debre Tabor, Bahir Dar, Gondar, and Dangila, respectively. This shows that Dangila areas got more rainfall during this fundamental period than others increasing from Gondar to Dangila direction. Also, the variance in the first harmonic is smaller than the variances of other harmonics, and this means that the large variations of the precipitation originate from higher harmonics (short time periods). This shows that precipitation variations are governed mainly by monthly, seasonal, and semiannual variations. The analysis has shown that maximum precipitation for all stations occurred in July and August.

There was not significant (p > 0.05) seasonal differences (dry and rainy season) in delta N-15 and delta C-13 values in none marsh, suggesting that these fish species keep a similar feed pattern within each marsh along the year. However, there were significant differences (p < 0.05) between marshes in delta N-15, delta C-13, and T-Hg, as well as significant seasonal differences (p < 0.05) in T-Hg values for some species, suggesting the possible influence of factors, such as differences in length of food chains between marshes and different degree of anthropogenic impact in relation to human settlements, farmland, livestock (higher in Ayapel marsh), and gold mining activity (higher in La Raya marsh). Correlations analysis showed significant (p < 0.05) relationships between T-Hg concentrations and delta N-15 values, as well as trophic level, evidencing a T-Hg biomagnification process in the fish food chain from both marshes and consequently a potential health risk for human riverside inhabitants who eat these fish.

Dagu, eastern of Tibet Plateau	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												There is little available information on hydrochemistry of waters from glacial source to downstream of glacierized catchments. Here we examine the water chemistry of the snowpacks, lakes and streams at eight sampling sites within glacial basin in Mt. Dagu, east Tibetan Plateau. An air mass trajectory model, correlation analysis, Gibbs model, Piper diagram and hydrograph separation analysis were utilized to investigate the characteristics and solutes sources of these waters. Generally, the TDS (Total dissolved solids; 7.54, 13.95 and 18.70 mg/L for snowpacks, lakes and streams respectively) and concentrations of main chemicals in all samples exhibited downstream trend from snowpacks to streams. Of the cations, Ca2+ appeared with the highest concentration followed by K+ and Na+. Of the anions, HCO3- was most abundant, followed by Cl-, SO42- and NO3-. For snowpack samples, the air masses arriving at the sampling sites were typically prevailing from the western Tibet Plateau, central Asia and the northern Mongolia plateau. The fine particulate matter in the Mt. Dagu snowpacks was most likely transported long range from three arid regions above-mentioned. High concentrations of SO42- and NH4+ in snowpacks, with twice as much NH4+ as SO42-, implying that the soluble part of the finer particles was transported as a form of ammonium sulfate. Rock weathering determined the ion components of the meltwater and the water could be classified as calcium and bicarbonate type based on the Piper diagram. The chemical contributions from glacier-snow meltwater were 20%-131% for lake and 5%-79% for stream, while the runoff contribution to lake varied from 65.4% to 84.9%, and 66.1% to 81.6% for stream. This study suggested that glacier-snow meltwater was the mainly runoff contributor to lake and stream water and that snowpack solutes derived from eolian additions exert a significant influence on lake and stream chemistry.

Combining the results of meteorological records, water temperature monitoring and water chemistry sampling, we draw the following conclusions: water temperature monitoring indicated that the entire upper 7m of the water column was mixed throughout the year, reflecting the lake's strong mixing characteristics; this ensured the year-round growth of planktonic species and the high abundance of benthic species. In addition, the diatoms exhibited a pronounced biannual warm-cold seasonal pattern, which may be related to water temperature, Si nutrient concentration and thermal stratification. During the warm season (May-November) when the lake was almost stratified, with overall higher water temperature and Si concentration, the representative species were Aulacoseira granulata var. angustissima and Achnanthidium catenatum. During the cold season (December-April), the water temperature and Si nutrient concentration were lower, but stronger lake mixing occurred, and the blooming species included Aulacoseira ambigua, Discostella asterocostata and Lindavia balatonis. After a detailed analysis, we conclude that the seasonal diatom succession was primarily driven by water temperature, and comparison with other lake records indicates that the strong mixing mechanism and Si were not the determinants of the lake diatom seasonal succession. Our data also show that during the first cold season, diatoms bloomed in the following sequence: A. ambigua - D. asterocostata - Discostella stelligera - L. balatonis - Discostella pseudostelligera, as Si decreased over the season, indicating that smaller species were more competitive in obtaining limited nutrients. Finally, there were interannual differences between diatom assemblages in the second year, especially in the abundance of L. balatonis and the occurrence of Asterionella formosa, which were probably related to the significantly increased lake trophic status.

A detrended correspondence analysis and a path analysis demonstrated that temperature and chlorophyll a were important factors influencing zooplankton. The path diagram showed that Daphnia was negatively affected directly by chlorophyll a and indirectly by temperature, whereas Bosmina was directly and positively affected by temperature. Daphnia spp. decreased in both absolute and relative biomass during warm seasons, whereas Bosmina spp. showed the opposite trend. Moreover, the lowest Daphnia spp. biomass was observed in the southern region, which was the most eutrophic. Our results indicate that increasing temperatures will continue to shift the dominant genus from Daphnia to Bosmina, and this change will be exacerbated by eutrophication. In addition, the zooplankton of Lake Erhai have shifted to smaller species over time as temperature and eutrophication have increased, which implies that zooplankton succession to small cladocerans may be markedly accelerated under further climate change and the increased eutrophication that has been observed in recent decades.

In this paper, SAV life history information was used to identify and analyze the spatial distribution of dominant SAV species in Baiyangdian Lake from 2017 to 2021 with Sentinel-2 image data, during the implementation of an ecological restoration project. The results show that: (1) The SWIR1_NIR index can achieve significantly accurate identification of SAV, with an accuracy of more than 88%. Combining life history features enabled researchers to distinguish the dominant SAV species with a classification accuracy of 68.75% and Kappa coefficient of 0.64. (2) The ecological restoration project did not significantly affect the spatial distribution of SAV; the SAV was still distributed in the northern, northwestern, southwestern, and shallow coastal areas of the lake. (3) Annually, dominant SAV species area in Baiyangdian Lake varied with the season. (4) Inter-annually, the overall distribution area of SAV in Baiyangdian Lake initially decreased and then increased. The results of this study are useful for the dredging and pollution control project of Baiyangdian Lake, and provide a scientific basis for the subsequent comprehensive treatment of SAV in the lake through multiple measures.

A deeper understanding of the physical and chemical functioning of tropical reservoirs is essential to mitigate dam-related impacts. However, the development of predictive tools is hampered by a lack of consistent data on physical mixing and biogeochemistry of tropical reservoirs. In this study, we focus on Lake Kariba (Southern Africa), the largest artificial lake in the world by volume. Kariba Dam forms a transboundary reservoir between Zambia and Zimbabwe, and therefore its management represents a socio-politically sensitive issue because the Kariba Dam operation completely changed the downstream hydrological regime. Although Lake Kariba represents a unique and scientifically interesting case study, there is no consistent dataset documenting its physical and chemical behaviour over time. This limits the scope for quantitative studies of this reservoir and its downstream impacts. To address this research gap, we aggregated a consistent database of in situ measurements of temperature and oxygen depth profiles for the entire 60 years of Lake Kariba's lifetime and performed a detailed statistical analysis of the thermal and oxygen regime of the artificial lake to classify the different behaviours of the lake's sub-basins. We demonstrate that the seasonal stratification strongly depends on the depth of the water column and on the distance from the lake inflow. Satellite data confirm these spatiotemporal variations in surface temperature, and reveal a consistent longitudinal warming trend of the lake surface water temperature of about 1.5 degrees C from the inflow to the dam. Finally, our results suggest that the stratification dynamics of the lacustrine sub-basins have the potential to alter the downstream Zambezi water quality. Future research should focus on assessing such alterations and developing strategies to mitigate them.

However, how unregulated WLFs affect macroinvertebrates in lake-floodplain systems experiencing considerable annual fluctuations remains unclear. We explored spatial and temporal variability in taxonomic alpha and beta diversity in the largest fluctuating lake in China, Poyang Lake, during two hydrological seasons. We hypothesized that taxa richness (alpha diversity) is greater in the floodplain than in the lake channel due to greater availability of trophic resources, and that variability in assemblage composition (beta diversity) in the channel is greater during the high-water season (HWS) than the low-water season (LWS) due to increased habitat heterogeneity. Benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages were sampled, water physicochemical and hydrological variables were measured, and geographical coordinates were determined at 34 sites during the HWS (October 2017) and LWS (January and April 2018). A total of 74 taxa were recorded. Macroinvertebrate alpha diversity was comparable in the floodplain and the lake channel. Beta diversity in the channel was greater during HWS than LWS. Hydrological variables influenced beta diversity during LWS and geographical distance between sites increased beta diversity during HWS, whereas physicochemical variables did not influence beta diversity in either hydrological season. Our results suggest that extensive WLFs altered macroinvertebrate biodiversity among hydrological seasons by extending water into floodplains during HWS and reducing substrate heterogeneity in the lake channel during LWS. We thus highlight the importance of WLFs that maintain such environmental seasonality in supporting the biodiversity of benthic macroinvertebrates in naturally dynamic freshwater ecosystems.

Edwardsiella strains were isolated from liver/kidney on TSA-1 plates in 31.9% of total diseased specimens, and the edwardsiellosis prevalence in the fishery was of 11.8%. The use of double-strength Salmonella-Shigella (DSSS) broth and SS agar yielded Edwardsiella isolation from intestine in 100% of those edwardsiellosis-diseased eels, but also in 40.4% of other sick fish with vibriosis or aeromonosis and in 28.8% of healthy eels, as well as from freshwater in 8.3% of samples. Pure cultures were isolated on SS agar from the former, but motile Aeromonas, Plesiomonas shigelloides and Hafnia alvei were recovered along with Edwardsiella in the other samples. Edwardsiella isolates identification at species level revealed that E.piscicida was distributed between wild eels and freshwater but E.tarda only did in freshwater. All E.piscicida strains were virulent for eels (LD <= 1.0x10(6) CFU/fish) but that of E.tarda was not. This is the first report of E.piscicida in wild eel intestines and natural freshwater, highlighting its role as potential reservoirs for the bacterium. A seasonal recovery was found for E.piscicida at water temperature above 20 degrees C.

J	Klobucar, SL; Gaeta, JW; Budy, P				Klobucar, Stephen L.; Gaeta, Jereme W.; Budy, Phaedra			A changing menu in a changing climate: Using experimental and long-term data to predict invertebrate prey biomass and availability in lakes of arctic Alaska	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Changes in seasonality associated with climate warming (e.g. temperature, growing season duration) are likely to alter invertebrate prey biomass and availability in aquatic ecosystems through direct and indirect influences on physiology and phenology, particularly in arctic lakes. However, despite warmer thermal regimes, photoperiod will remain unchanged such that potential shifts resulting from longer and warmer growing seasons could be limited by availability of sunlight, especially at lower trophic levels. Thus, a better understanding of warming effects on invertebrate prey throughout the growing season (e.g. early, peak, late) is important to understand arctic lake food-web dynamics in a changing climate. 2. Here, we use a multifaceted approach to evaluate prey availability to predators in lakes of arctic Alaska. In a laboratory mesocosm experiment, we measured different metrics of abundance for snails (Lymnaea elodes) and zooplankton (Daphnia middendorffiana) across three time periods (early, mid- and late growing season) and across three temperature and photoperiod treatments (control, increased temperature and increased temperature x photoperiod). Additionally, we used generalised additive models and generalised additive mixed-effects models to relate long-term empirical observations of zooplankton biomass (1983-2015) to observed temperature regimes in an arctic lake. We then simulated zooplankton biomass for the warmest temperature observations across the growing season to inform likely zooplankton biomass regimes under future change. 3. We observed variable responses by snails and zooplankton across experiments and treatments. Early in the growing season, snail development was accelerated at multiple life stages (e.g. egg and juvenile). In mid-season, in accordance with warmer temperatures, we observed significantly increased Daphnia abundances. However, in the late season, Daphnia appeared to be limited by photoperiod. Confirming our experimental results, our models of zooplankton biomass showed an increase of nearly 20% in warmer years. Further, these model estimates could be conservative as the consumptive demand of fishes may increase in warmer years as well. 4. Overall, our results highlight the importance of interactive effects of temperature and seasonality. Based primarily on temperature, we can readily predict the response of fish metabolism in warmer temperatures. However, in this context, we generally require a better understanding of climate-driven responses of important invertebrate prey resources. Our results suggest invertebrate prey biomass and availability are likely to respond positively with climate change based on temperature and seasonality, as well as proportionally to the metabolic requirements of fish predators. While further research is necessary to understand how other food-web components will respond climate change, our findings suggest that the fish community at the top of arctic lake food webs will have adequate prey base in a warming climate.

Use of carbon dioxide in zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) control and safety to a native freshwater mussel (Fatmucket, Lampsilis siliquoidea)	MANAGEMENT OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS					20th International Conference on Aquatic Invasive Species (ICAIS)	OCT 22-26, 2017	Univ Florida, Inst Food & Agr Sci, Invas Species Ctr, Fort Lauderdale, FL		Univ Florida, Inst Food & Agr Sci, Invas Species Ctr			Control technology for dreissenid mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and D. bugensis) currently relies heavily on chemical molluscicides that can be both costly and ecologically harmful. There is a need for more environmentally neutral tools to manage dreissenid mussels, particularly in cooler water. Carbon dioxide (CO2) has been shown to be lethal to several species of invasive bivalves, including zebra mussels and Asian clams (Corbicula fluminea). We evaluated the effectiveness of unpressurized infusion of CO2 for 24 to 96 h (100 000-300 000 mu atm PCO2) at a water temperature of 12 degrees C on mortality, byssal thread formation, and attachment of zebra mussels. The safety of elevated CO2 to a nontarget native freshwater mussel (Fatmucket, Lampsilis siliquoidea) was also determined. Elevated PCO2 exposure induced narcotization and reduced attachment of zebra mussels within 24 h. Mortality increased with exposure duration and PCO2. An estimated LT50 (lethal time to produce 50% mortality) for fixed PCO2 ranged from 24 h at 275 000 mu atm to similar to 96 h at 100 000 mu atm. Exposure of zebra mussels to CO2 for 96 h caused 80-100% mortality at all treatment levels. Fatmucket juveniles survived all PCO2 treatments but burial and byssal thread production were adversely affected during exposure. Our results demonstrate that CO2 is a viable option for management of zebra mussels in cool water and may have less adverse effect for native lampsiline mussels than current-use molluscicides.																			1989-8649					NOV	2018	9	4			SI		439	450		10.3391/mbi.2018.9.4.07	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/mbi.2018.9.4.07													WOS:000451271800007

With an ever-growing human demand for water and increasing climate uncertainty, there is pressing need for improved understanding of the underlying patterns of natural variability of water resources and consideration of their implications for water resource management and conservation. Here we use Bayesian harmonic regression models to characterise water level dynamics and study the influence of cyclic components in confounding estimation of long-term directional trends in water levels in natural Irish lakes. We found that the lakes were characterised by a common and well-defined annual seasonality and several inter-annual and inter-decadal cycles with strong transient behaviour over time. Importantly, failing to account for the longer-term cyclic components produced a significant overall underestimation of the trend effect. Our findings demonstrate the importance of contextualising lake water resource management to the specific physical setting of lakes.

Biogenic methane as an alternative carbon and energy source for freshwater organisms has been receiving increasing attention, but the phenomenon is still poorly understood for shallow lakes. We measured the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signatures (C-13, N-15) for key groups of pelagic and benthic organisms, including crustacean zooplankton, chironomid larvae, young-of-the-year and adult fish, to assess whether biogenic methane contributes to pelagic and benthic food webs in a large, shallow lake, Lake Vortsjarv, Estonia. 2. In the southern part of the lake, covered by macrophytes, crustacean zooplankton showed strong seasonal variation of C-13, with the lowest values occurring in the period of oxygen depletion. Chironomid (Chironomus plumosus) larvae showed high isotopic variability within the lake, with strongly C-13-depleted and N-15-depleted signatures (down to C-13 -64.0 and N-15 -2.6) in the macrophyte-covered area. 3. Our results indicate that carbon derived from biogenic methane can contribute seasonally to the benthic food web and, to some extent, also to the pelagic food web, where the lake is covered by macrophytes. Moreover, C-13 values for roach (Rutilus rutilus), perch (Perca fluviatilis) and pike (Esox lucius) from the macrophyte-dominated area were on average 3.5 parts per thousand lower than those for the same fish from the plankton-dominated lake area, suggesting some carbon derived from methane is transferred up through the food web. 4. Although no direct evidence is available, our results, together with previous studies of the lake, suggest that protozoans could be a potentially important link from methane-oxidising bacteria to animals higher in the web.

Hence, for a better understanding of the effects of thermal stratification on nitrogen transformation, we investigated the nitrogen species and isotopes in the sediment of a deep reservoir in Southwest China. Our results confirmed a significant difference in nitrogen species and isotopic composition in sediment between those in the thermal stratification period and non-thermal stratification period and indicated that the sediment biogeochemical process and transportation were clearly linked to the variations in water temperature and dissolved oxygen dominated by the process of thermal stratification. Significant seasonal differences in NH4+-N and NO3--N in pore water of the upper layer (0-19 cm) revealed that nitrification exhausted NH4+ in the non-stratified period (NSP), and a potential low mineralization rate appeared when compared with those in the stratified period (SP). Seasonal differences in nitrogen species and isotope fractionation of delta N-15-PON (about 2.3 & PTSTHOUSND; in SP) in the upper layer sediment indicated a higher anaerobic mineralization rate of organic matter in SP than that in NSP. The diffusion fluxes of NH4+-N at SWI were 9.48 and 15.66 mg & BULL;m(-2)& BULL;d(-1) in NSP and SP, respectively, and annual NH4+-N diffusion accounted for 21.8% of total storage in the reservoir. This study demonstrated that the nitrogen cycling processes, especially nitrification, denitrification, and mineralization, have been largely altered along with the changes in dissolved oxygen and that the diffusion of nitrogen species varied with the presence of the oxygen. The results contribute to the future study of watershed nitrogen budget evaluation and suggest that the endogenous nitrogen released from the sediment-water interface should be emphasized when aiming to fulfil water management policies in deep reservoirs.

Winds, divergence, vertical motion, specific humidity, convective available potential energy (CAPE), and convective inhibition (CIN) were examined. The local wind regime and associated divergence/convergence are the major factors determining the diurnal cycle of rainfall over the lake and catchment. The major contrast between overlake rainfall in the wet- and dry-season months is the vertical profile of omega. This appears to be a result of seasonal contrasts in CAPE, CIN, and specific humidity, parameters that play a critical role in vertical motion and convective development.																			1525-755X	1525-7541				NOV	2021	22	11					3049	3064		10.1175/JHM-D-21-0085.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-21-0085.1													WOS:000755188200013

The authors also investigate the trends of precipitation change by means of Mann-Kendall test and rescaled range analysis. The results show that the amount of precipitation increased with the level of urbanization at spatial and temporal scales. The maximum daily precipitation and the number of rainstorms in urban areas also increased. With further development of urbanization, the increase would continue in the future. The two urban agglomerations with similar level of urbanization and climatic conditions are consistent in terms of all research indicators applied in this paper. The results are basically consistent with many previous studies, while the study area has its own characteristics in that the maximum rainfall generally happened after the plum rains, and that rainstorms often occurred later than they did in other regions. The results above suggest that urbanization has an effect on precipitation, and this is a matter of concern for the cities located in the East Asian Monsoon Region with its heavy rainfall.																			1084-0699	1943-5584				APR 1	2014	19	4					739	746		10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0000852	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0000852													WOS:000332770400009

Late Quaternary aeolian and fluvial interactions on the Cooper Creek Fan and the association between linear and source-bordering dunes, Strzelecki Desert, Australia	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Innamincka Dome and associated low-gradient fan in the Strzelecki Desert is the product of Cenozoic crustal warping that has aided formation of an extensive array of palaeochannels, source-bordering transverse dunes and superimposed linear dunes. These dunes have impeded the course of Cooper Creek and provided a repository of evidence for Quaternary climate change as well as the interactive processes between transverse and linear dune formation. At Turra, Gidgealpa and sites nearby are extensive fluvial and aeolian sand bodies that date from marine isotope stages (MIS) 8-3 and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and are now surrounded or buried by overbank mud. The sandy alluvium was deposited on the downstream slope of the dome by large channels transporting abundant bedload, subsequently blown northward to form transverse dunes from what were probably seasonally-exposed bars in a palaeo-Cooper system. Thermoluminescence (TL) and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages demonstrate that the base of the dune complex is at least MIS 7 in age (similar to 250 ka) but that it has been subsequently reworked by wind with additional sand blown from the river. Source-bordering dunes formed during a period of enhanced river flow and sand supply from similar to 120 to 100 ka, with another short episode of the same at similar to 85-80 ka and from similar to 68 to 53. The LGM was associated with enhanced flows and the supply of dune sediment, from 28 to 18 ka. Pronounced river flow and dune activity occurred in the early to mid Holocene, but there is no evidence of dunes being supplied from Cooper Creek since the LGM. The dunes forming the oldest basal sand units appear to be largely transverse in form and are aligned roughly parallel to adjacent east-west trending palaeochannels. Linear dunes have formed from and over these, and yield basal ages ranging from MIS 5 or MIS 4 but continuing to accrete and rework through to the Holocene. The study results in one of the few detailed chronological investigations of the interaction between transverse and linear dunes. It is apparent that long-distance sand transport has played no significant role in dune formation here for the linear dunes show no significant downwind decline in ages. Linear dunes appear to have accreted vertically from underlying transverse dunes. A wind-rift vertical accretion model with only minor lengthwise extension is the dominant mode of linear dune formation in this section of the Strzelecki Desert, the bulk of dune sediment being sourced from adjacent swales since the LGM.

Three volcanic lakes located in the Lazio area (Central Italy) and characterized by a different anthropical impact were selected. Analysis of lake water samples showed that in closed ecosystems (hydrogeological systems), such as small volcanic lakes, OP contamination may occur even in the absence of industries and treated or untreated waste discharges. The selected substances were found at ng/L concentrations in all lakes. In the two more anthropized lakes tributyl phosphate and tripropyl phosphate were the most abundant OPs, with peaks of respectively 784 and 951 ng/L. Maximum pollution levels were reached in October-November, and concentrations decreased to a minimum value in March-April. Chlorinated OPs showed the same trend, but their concentrations were I order of magnitude lower and the level decreasing was shifted with respect to alkyl OPs. On the contrary, tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate concentrations were quite similar among all water samples analyzed, indicating that their sources were different in nature. One of the three lakes is an important source of drinkable water, so nine wells situated in its neighborhood were also examined. No correlation between lake water and groundwater contamination could be found.

Paleosols and host rocks from the Middle-Upper Permian reference section of the Kazan Volga region, Russia: A case study	PALAEOWORLD												The Urzhumian (Wordian) and Severodvinian (Capitanian) reference section of the Monastery Ravine (Kazan Volga region, Russia), contains two siltstone lithofacies: (a) laminated and (b) massive. Depositional settings of the laminated siltstones can be interpreted as perennial to ephemeral lakes; depositional settings of the massive siltstones are interpreted as floodplains with soil cover and periodical silt influx in wet seasons. The bulk geochemistry of siliciclastics has revealed a high degree of weathering of both types of siltstone. The similar chemical composition, mineralogy, and grain size suggest the same provenance of silt material. Geochemical data indicate eastern source rocks, which are the Permian red beds of the Cis-Ural plains. The main genetic types of paleosols hosted in the massive siltstones in the studied section, include moderately developed Vertisols and Calcisols with drab-colored root traces, calcareous nodules, low chroma mottles, angular blocky peds and slickensides. These pedofeatures indicate in general a semi-arid climate with clear seasonality of rainfall. Major oxides of the paleosol matrix were used to estimate paleoprecipitation through the bases to alumina (EBases/Al) ratio and chemical index of alteration minus potassium (CIA-K) proxies. Estimates from Urzhumian paleosols indicate relatively low mean annual precipitation (MAP) of 390 mm/yr. The transition to the Severodvinian paleosols is marked by a noticeable MAP increase up to 777 mm/yr. This climate moistening coincides with changes in the morphology of paleosols from dolomitic with low redoximorphy to calcitic with gley horizons. The pedogenic carbonate nodules consisting of dolomicrite (5-10 pm) are very common in the Urzhumian paleosols and their morphology, micromorhology and isotopic features indicate the pedogenic origin of dolomite. Sedimentological and paleopedological features of the studied siltstones, as well as the location of the Volga-Ural basin in a mid-latitude position (25-32 degrees N) indicate a monsoonal character of precipitation during the Middle Permian.

For this reason, territories with sufficient expanses of water increasingly strive to create tourist products which allow them to enjoy the benefits associated with this type of tourism. The case of the region of Extremadura in Spain deserves special attention due to the abundant presence of lake resources which allows it to find an opportunity to stand out in inland water tourism and promote economic development. The initial objective of this research is the generation of knowledge of the demand currently existing in the territory. In order to do so, a logit regression model is used based on 4625 surveys collected in 2017. This model is later verified by means of a Chow test so as to analyze which factors influence the probability of practicing inland water tourism, paying attention to certain control variables such as the season or the tourist market. The results obtained have important implications for tourism managers and the establishment of a suitable development policy strategy.

A positive correlation between mercury and oxidative stress-related gene expression (GPX3 and GSTM3) is measured in female Double-crested Cormorant blood	ECOTOXICOLOGY												Mercury (Hg) is a widespread contaminant that has been shown to induce a wide range of adverse health effects in birds including reproductive, physiological and neurological impairments. Here we explored the relationship between blood total Hg concentrations ([THg]) and oxidative stress gene induction in the aquatic piscivorous Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) using a non-lethal technique, i.e., blood gene expression analysis. P. auritus blood was sampled at five sites across the Great Lakes basin, Ontario, Canada and was analyzed for [THg]. To assess cellular stress, the expression of glutathione peroxidases 1 and 3 (GPX1, GPX3), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), heat-shock protein 70 kd-8 (HSP70-8) and glutathione S-transferase A mu 3 (GSTM3) were measured in whole blood samples using real-time RT-PCR. Results showed a significantly positive correlation between female blood [THg] and both GPX3 and GSTM3 expression. Different levels of oxidative stress experienced by males and females during the breeding season may be influencing the differential oxidative stress responses to blood [THg] observed in this study. Overall, these results suggest that Hg may lead to oxidative stress as some of the cellular stress-related genes were altered in the blood of female P. auritus and that blood gene expression analysis is a successful approach to assess bird health condition.

J	Romero-Viana, L; Kienel, U; Sachse, D				Romero-Viana, Lidia; Kienel, Ulrike; Sachse, Dirk			Lipid biomarker signatures in a hypersaline lake on Isabel Island (Eastern Pacific) as a proxy for past rainfall anomaly (1942-2006 AD)	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Isabel Lake is a hypersaline crater-lake on Isabel Island, Mexico, situated in the eastern tropical Pacific, an area highly sensitive to hydrological changes. Today, annual rainfall mostly occurs during the wet season, from June to October, when the northern edge of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) extends over the island. In order to evaluate the potential of sedimentary lipid biomarker signatures as a proxy of past hydro-climatic variability we have performed a calibration analysis comparing changes in biomarker distribution in the upper 16 cm of the sediment core with a regional instrumental data set. Annual laminations present in the sediment sequence allow for precise chronological control (1942-2006), More than 80 different lipid compounds were identified in the sediment and could be assigned to three major groups of source organisms: (1) algal populations; (2) a mixed community of ciliates, bacteria and cyanobacteria; and (3) photosynthetic sulfur bacteria. We found that the observed changes in the. relative contribution of the different lipid biomarkers to the sediment record were determined by the regional rainfall variability over the last 65 years. The planktonic community of Isabel Lake was highly sensitive to salinity fluctuations related to rainfall variability; seasonal precipitation results in freshwater input into the lake, driving an annual algal bloom and a relative decrease in the abundance of the more halotolerant populations of (cyano) bacteria and ciliates. Consequently, the concentration ratio between the two most abundant biomarkers in the Isabel Lake sediments, n-alkyl diols and tetrahymanol (which we define as the DiTe index), representing algal and ciliate planktonic populations, respectively, was significantly correlated with the seasonal rainfall anomaly (r = 0.68, p < 0.01). We propose that the DiTe index is a proxy of changes in the aquatic ecosystem of Isabel Lake and, by extension, regional hydrological changes in a sensitive climatic area of the eastern tropical Pacific.

ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE												The late Miocene is marked by pronounced environmental changes and the appearance of strong temperature and precipitation seasonality. Although environmental heterogeneity is to be expected during this time, it is challenging to reconstruct palaeoenvironments using plant fossils. We investigated leaves and dispersed spores/pollen from 6.4 to 6 Ma strata in the intermontane Florina-Ptolemais-Servia Basin (FPS) of northwestern Greece. To assess how well plant fossils reflect the actual vegetation of the FPS, we assigned fossil taxa to biomes providing a measure for environmental heterogeneity. Additionally, the palynological assemblage was compared with pollen spectra from modern lake sediments to assess biases in spore/pollen representation in the pollen record. We found a close match of the Vegora assemblage with modern Fagus-Abies forests of Turkey. Using taxonomic affinities of leaf fossils, we further established close similarities of the Vegora assemblage with modern laurophyllous oak forests of Afghanistan. Finally, using information from sedimentary environment and taphonomy, we distinguished local and distantly growing vegetation types. We then subjected the plant assemblage of Vegora to different methods of climate reconstruction and discussed their potentials and limitations. Leaf and spore/pollen records allow accurate reconstructions of palaeoenvironments in the FPS, whereas extra-regional vegetation from coastal lowlands is probably not captured.

Effects of seasonal seston and temperature changes on lake zooplankton fatty acids	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We investigated how seston fatty acids (FA) and water temperature explained seasonal variation in cladoceran and copepod FA over three years in pre-alpine, oligotrophic Lake Lunz, Austria. Using the mostly algal-derived polyunsaturated FA (PUFA: arachidonic, ARA; eicosapentaenoic, EPA; docosahexaenoic acid, DHA), terrestrial FA (TFA, 22 : 0, 24 : 0), and bacterial FA (BAFA, 15 : 0, 17 : 0 and their branched homologues) as source-specific biomarkers, we show that cladocerans consistently contained more ARA and EPA and copepods more DHA than the available food (seston). None of these physiologically important PUFA were significantly related between zooplankton and seston across the entire study period but copepod DHA increased with seston DHA during the coldest months (< 8 degrees C, based on a significant seston FA*temperature interaction). EPA, conversely, increased with decreasing water temperature in both zooplankton groups. For the nonessential FA, TFA were lower in zooplankton than in seston and not related to dietary supply or water temperature. However, cladoceran and copepod BAFA increased significantly with increasing seston BAFA and decreasing water temperature. These findings suggest that physiological regulation in response to changing water temperature had a significant impact on cladoceran and copepod EPA and the extent of dietary tracking for copepod DHA. TFA available in the seston may not have been consumed or were poorly incorporated by zooplankton, but BAFA were good indicators of available resources throughout multiple seasonal cycles. Based on our study, both FA type and water temperature impact the extent that dietary vs. nondietary processes govern cladoceran and copepod FA in oligotrophic lakes.					; Koussoroplis, Apostolos‐Manuel/AAP-5235-2021; Kainz, Martin/AAG-6268-2021	Koussoroplis, Apostolos-Manuel/0000-0002-5218-5604; Kainz, Martin/0000-0002-2388-1504													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2015	60	2					573	583		10.1002/lno.10041	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10041													WOS:000351126500017

We identify changes during the late-twentieth century based on observations and characterise potential impacts of climatic changes on river response by the end of the century. Different scenarios of the latest generation of IPCC AR5 CMIP5 and hydrological modelling were used and included two scenarios for future outlet discharge of Lake Geneva (Switzerland). We show that discharges in the Rhone basin are likely to decrease significantly by the end of the century and that the seasonality of run-off will change substantially as well. In addition, projections point to smaller discharge during low flows, but higher low flows in its sub-basins. Regarding floods, high flows exhibit a general tendency to decrease, whereas potential upwards can be observed for the more extreme floods (less frequent). The approach reported in this paper will help to reflect on the governance modalities of a transboundary river such as the Rhone, especially when water management depends on concession contracts, which are usually granted for several decades and typically last between 60 and 90 years.

Evaluation of public health risks at recreational beaches in Lake Michigan via detection of enteric viruses and a human-specific bacteriological marker	WATER RESEARCH												Each year the National Resource Defense Council addresses the quality of US beaches by routine bacterial indicators. In the Great Lakes region the indicator used is Escherichia coli and for 2007 more beaches were closed and impacted than ever before. in this study, water quality was addressed at two Lake Michigan Beaches over the 2004 swimming season by monitoring infectious enteric viruses by cell culture and integrated PCR and for a human sewage marker based on the Enterococcal Surface Protein (esp). Our goals for this study were to 1) examine the occurrence and variety of human enteric viruses present during peak usage of the beaches 2) determine key variables for development of predictive models for viruses; and 3) use quantitative risk assessment to estimate the potential health impact. Our results demonstrate that for both beaches predictive models of virus pollution were best described utilizing physical parameters like wind speed, wind direction and water temperature. The esp marker was not predictive of human viruses. The daily risk of acquiring a viral infection at either of the beaches ranged from 0.2 to 2.4/1000 swimmers using a quantitative microbial risk assessment model, with three swims during a day at the beach for children and over the season, the risk was 9-15/1000 swimmers using adenovirus as the model. Conclusions: Lake Michigan recreational beaches are being adversely impacted by human fecal pollution. Monitoring for the traditional indicators of water quality does not address viral risks and models can be developed and potentially used as real-time water quality forecasting tools.
