Geological records, like speleothems and lake sediments, show precession drives orbital-scale temperature and precipitation variations in this region but lack seasonal detail. By reconstructing a full precession cycle using Alfred Wegener Institute Earth System Model, here, we examine how precession impacts the timing and duration of the East Asian summer and rainy season. The results reveal that in a precession cycle with high eccentricity, summer duration varies by up to 57 days, with onset and termination shifting by up to 48 and 52 days, respectively. The rainy season duration varies by up to 21 days, with onset and termination shifting by up to 31 and 35 days. These changes stem from precession-modulated perihelion timing, affecting surface temperature and the meridional shift in subtropical high system. These findings may refine the interpretations of the complex paleoclimate proxies and offer insights into precession-driven climate dynamics in subtropical regions, supporting future climate projections. Plain Language Summary East Asia is home to hundreds of millions of people and plays a vital role in the world's food production and economy, which relies on suitable seasonality of temperature and precipitation. Therefore, understanding how the seasonality changes is important for mitigating and adapting climate change. Geologic records, such as speleothem and lake sediments show long-term variations in regional climate are affected by precession. However, they can't capture the seasonal details. To fill this gap, a simulation recovering a full precession cycle is used to study how precession affects East Asia's summer and rainy season. Our results indicate that the timing and duration of the summer and rainy season are strongly affected by precession. Under high eccentricity, the changes in time can up to 57 days. These shifts occur because precession changes the timing of strongest solar radiation receiving by the Earth, which alters the pattern of temperature and atmospheric circulation. These findings extend our understanding of past climates changes on seasonal timescale and providing scientific insights on the evolution of changing seasonality, which are critical for local agriculture and food security.																			0094-8276	1944-8007				OCT 13	2025	52	20							e2025GL116963	10.1029/2025GL116963	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2025GL116963													WOS:001593754200001

During spring and autumn, six representative points were investigated. Reflecting a substantial zonation of pollution within this aquatic ecosystem, concentrations were found to vary from site to site. OCPs, particularly DDT and its metabolites DDE and DDD, were detected at varying frequencies and concentrations from 0.301 to 8.185 ng/g d.w., whilst total PCBs (& sigma;50 congeners) were from 0.570 to 10.206 ng/g d.w. Although both PCB congener-specific and homolog patterns suggest a prevalent presence of Aroclors 1254 and 1260, a more limited likely contribution of 1248 technical mixture is not to be excluded. In the western area of the lake, affected daily by continuous basin water remixing for hydroelectricity production, major seasonal differences in OCP concentrations were found. Conversely, the eastern area was typified by low seasonal fluctuation and small variation among sites. Regardless of either collection site or seasonality, polychlorinated-p-dioxin and furan (PCDD/Fs) contamination were below 8.3 pg WHO-TEQ/g. In contrast to the present study, POP pollution from PCBs, PCDD/Fs and some DDT-derived pollutants has not been investigated so far. Nevertheless, the concentrations are typical of low-polluted or pristine area lakes and are consistently lower than those of other Italian lakes of greater size and depth (e.g., Como, Garda and Maggiore). The physical and chemical properties of investigated analytes are more consistent with probable diffuse point source contamination originating from the catchment area, rather than from atmospheric depositions by regional or long-range transports. Finally, according to the international sediment quality guidelines (SQGs), Piediluco sediments pose a low risk to sediment-dwelling organisms and, more generally, to the wildlife of such aquatic ecosystems.

Macroinvertebrate Response and Internal Phosphorus Loading in a Michigan Lake after Alum Treatment	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Alum treatment is a lake restoration technique that is used to address internal phosphorus (P) loading. We evaluated the macroinvertebrate density and P release rates from sediment cores in Spring Lake, Michigan, 5 yr aft er an alum treatment and compared the findings with conditions before and 1 yr aft er application. Total macroinvertebrate density recovered to the near pre-alum level aft er the decline that was measured in 2006. Community structure also shifted, with the dominant group changing from oligochaetes before alum treatment to chaoborids in 2010. Chironomid density in 2010 was similar to pre-alum density, but this represented a decline from an elevated density measured in 2006. Ceratopogonid density increased in 2010 compared with the prior samplings, but absolute densities were very low compared with other macroinvertebrate groups. Maximum P release rates from sediment cores in 2010 averaged from 1.68 to 2.81 mg P m(-2) d(-1) under anoxic conditions. These rates are an order of magnitude lower than before alum was applied, indicating the alum application was still effectively reducing P release rates from sediments in Spring Lake. However, the release rates have increased since 2006, suggesting that alum efficacy may be declining. The NaOH-extractable soluble reactive P fraction has increased since 2006, suggesting that the aluminum hydroxide floc is successfully binding P in the sediments. Despite the low release rates of P from the sediment, water column P and chlorophyll concentrations remain elevated in Spring Lake. This points to the continued need for reductions in external P loads to Spring Lake.					; Steinman, Alan/B-8723-2014	Steinman, Alan/0000-0002-4886-4305; 													0047-2425					SEP	2012	41	5					1540	1548		10.2134/jeq2011.0476	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2011.0476								23099946					WOS:000308931700021

The main cause of the lake's eutrophication and deteriorating water quality was supply up to mid 1984 of water from the River Vecht. This supply was replaced by dephosphorized water from the Amsterdam-Rhine Canal in 1984. The effects of this and other restoration measures on the lake's ecosystem were studied. Despite a reduction in the external P-load from ca. 1.0 g P m-2 y-1 to ca. 0.35 g M-2 y-1 now, the filamentous prokaryotes, including cyanobacteria and Prochlorothrix, continue to dominate the phytoplankton. Among the crustacean plankton Bosmina spp, Chydorus sp. and three species of cyclopoid copepods and their nauplii are quite common. Though there was no major change in the composition of abundant species, Daphnia cucullata, which is the only daphnid in these lakes, became virtually extinct since 1989. Among about 20 genera and 40 species of rotifers the important ones are: Anuraeopsis fissa, Keratella cochlearis, Filinia longiseta and Polyarthra. The rotifers usually peak in mid-summer following the crustacean peak in spring. The mean annual densities of crustaceans decreased during 1988-1991. Whereas seston (< 150-mu-m) mean mass in the lake increased since 1983 by 20-60 %, zooplankton (> 150-mu-m) mass decreased by 15-35 %. The grazing by crustacean community, which was attributable mainly to Bosmina, had mean rates between 10 and 25 % d-1. Between 42 and 47 % of the food ingested was assimilated. In spring and early summer when both rotifers and crustaceans have their maximal densities the clearance rates of the rotifers were much higher. Based on C/P ratios, the zooplankton (> 150-mu-m) mass contained 2.5 times more phosphorus than seston (< 150-mu-m) mass so that the zooplankton comprised 12.5 % of the total-P in total particulate matter in the open water, compared with only 4.5 % of the total particulate C. The mean excretion rates of P by zooplankton varied narrowly between 1.5 and 1.8-mu-g P l-1 d-1, which equalled between 14 and 28 % d-1 of the P needed for phytoplankton production. The lack of response to restoration measures cannot be ascribed to one single factor. Apparently, the external P-loading is still not low enough and internal P-loading, though low, may be still high enough to sustain high seston levels. Intensive predation by bream is perhaps more important than food quality (high concentrations of filamentous cyanobacteria) in depressing the development of large-bodied zooplankton grazers, e.g. Daphnia. This may also contribute to resistance of the lake's ecosystem to respond to rehabilitation measures.

It is unclear whether current concentrations are driven by ongoing primary emissions from their original uses, or whether ambient PCBs are dominated by their environmental cycling. Freely dissolved PCBs in air and water were measured using polyethylene passive samplers across Lakes Erie and Ontario during summer and fall, 2011, to investigate their spatial distribution, determine and apportion their sources and to asses their air water exchange gradients. Average gaseous and freely dissolved Sigma(29) PCB concentrations ranged from 5.0 to 160 pg/m(3) and 2.0 to 55 pg/L respectively. Gaseous concentrations were significantly correlated (R-2 = 0.80) with the urban area within a 3-20 km radius. Fugacity ratios indicated that the majority of PCBs are volatilizing from the water thus acting as a secondary source for the atmosphere. Dissolved PCBs were probably linked to PCB emissions from contaminated sites and areas of concern. Positive matrix factorization indicated that although volatilized Arodors (gaseous PCBs) and unaltered Arodors (dissolved PCBs) dominate in some samples, ongoing non-Arodor sources such as paints/pigments (PCB 11) and coal/wood combustion showed significant contributions across the lower Great Lakes. Accordingly, control strategies should give further attention to PCBs emitted from current use sources.					; Muir, Derek/F-6183-2011; Lohmann, Rainer/B-1511-2008	Lohmann, Rainer/0000-0001-8796-3229; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				DEC 1	2015	49	23					13787	13797		10.1021/acs.est.5b00186	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.5b00186								25915412					WOS:000365930500009

Spatiotemporal Patterns of Chlorophyll-a Concentration in a Hypersaline Lake Using High Temporal Resolution Remotely Sensed Imagery	REMOTE SENSING												The Great Salt Lake (GSL) is the largest saline lake in the Western Hemisphere. It supports billion-dollar industries and recreational activities, and is a vital stopping point for migratory birds. However, little is known about the spatiotemporal variation of phytoplankton biomass in the lake that supports these resources. Spectral reflectance provided by three remote sensing products was compared relative to their relationship with field measurements of chlorophyll a (Chl a). The MODIS product MCD43A4 with a 500 m spatial resolution provided the best overall ability to map the daily distribution of Chl a. The imagery indicated significant spatial variation in Chl a, with low concentrations in littoral areas and high concentrations in a nutrient-rich plume coming out of polluted embayment. Seasonal differences in Chl a showed higher concentrations in winter but lower in summer due to heavy brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana) grazing pressure. Twenty years of imagery revealed a 68% increase in Chl a, coinciding with a period of declining lake levels and increasing local human populations, with potentially major implications for the food web and biogeochemical cycling dynamics in the lake. The MCD43A4 daily cloud-free images produced by 16-day temporal composites of MODIS imagery provide a cost-effective and temporally dense means to monitor phytoplankton in the southern (47% surface area) portion of the GSL, but its remaining bays could not be effectively monitored due to shallow depths, and/or plankton with different pigments given extreme hypersaline conditions.

J	Landl, B; Björnsson, H; Kuhn, M				Landl, B; Björnsson, H; Kuhn, M			The energy balance of calved ice in Lake Jokulsarlon, Iceland	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												We describe energy fluxes involved in melting ice in the proglacial lake Jokulsarlon and the transport of thermal energy into the lake from the atmosphere and the sea. Data from earlier fieldwork and campaigns have been used to estimate the net radiation balance, the turbulent fluxes, the heat provided by inflowing seawater, and the glacial meltwater flux, From aerial photographs, DGPS measurements, and mass balance measurements, we calculated a calving flux of 260 x 10(6) m(3) yr(-1) for the present. The total energy required to melt all the ice in the lake is approximately 160 W m(-2) assuming that all the calved ice is melted during 1 yr. The most important contribution is heat from seawater. Radiation provides approximately 70 W m(-2). The albedo depends on the ice-covered fraction of the lake and ranges from 22% in summer to 41% in winter. The turbulent fluxes are around 10 W m(-2). Difficulties occurred in finding an appropriate range for the roughness parameter z(o), but the most likely values are in the range of a few centimeters. We considered different future scenarios with respect to inflow of seawater and air temperature, albedo, and even inhibition of seawater intrusion, which would have a significant impact on ice cover in the lake.																			1523-0430					NOV	2003	35	4					475	481		10.1657/1523-0430(2003)035[0475:TEBOCI]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1657/1523-0430(2003)035[0475:TEBOCI]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000189380400010

Under ice plankton and lipid dynamics in a subarctic lake	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Climate warming causes shorter winters and changes in ice and snow cover in subarctic lakes, highlighting the need to better understand under-ice ecosystem functioning. The plankton community in a subarctic, oligotrophic lake was studied throughout the ice-covered season, focusing on lipid dynamics and life history traits in two actively overwintering copepods, Cyclops scutifer and Eudiaptomus graciloides. Whereas C. scutifer was overwintering in C-IV to C-V stage, E. graciloides reproduced under ice cover. Both species had accumulated lipids prior to ice-on and showed a substantial decrease in total lipid content throughout the ice-covered period: E. graciloides (60%-38% dw) and C. scutifer (73%-33% dw). Polyunsaturated fatty acids of algal origin were highest in E. graciloides and declined strongly in both species. Stearidonic acid (18:4n-3) content in E. graciloides was particularly high and decreased rapidly during the study period by 50%, probably due to reproduction. The copepods differed in feeding behavior, with the omnivore C. scutifer continuing to accumulate lipids until January, whereas the herbivorous E. graciloides accumulated lipids from under-ice primary production during the last months of ice-cover. Our findings emphasize the importance of lipid accumulation and utilization for actively overwintering copepods irrespective of the timing of their reproduction.					; Poste, Amanda/KZP-2398-2024; Kainz, Martin/AAG-6268-2021	Leu, Eva/0000-0002-5328-3396; Poste, Amanda/0000-0001-5255-5356; Amundsen, Per-Arne/0000-0002-2203-8216; Kainz, Martin/0000-0002-2388-1504; Kers, Erwin/0000-0001-5468-3423; 													0142-7873	1464-3774				MAY 31	2024	46	3					323	337		10.1093/plankt/fbae018	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbae018		MAY 2024						38826846					WOS:001217224000001

The AN is a typical boiling system, with Na-Cl waters (TDS 1 g/I), low gas content (CO2-N-2), with deep calculated temperatures of similar to 200 degrees C. In contrast, springs of the K system have lower temperatures (up to 42 degrees C), strong gas bubbling, TDS similar to 2.5 VI, and are enriched in HCO3- and SO42-, with Mg2+ as the main cation. There are two intriguing characteristics of the K field: (i) their CO2-rich gas (>97 mol%) has the highest He-3/He-4 ratios ever measured for hydrothermal systems in Kamchatka of similar to 8 Ra (where Ra = 1.4 x 10(-6)) and (ii) their thermal waters have an unusual cation composition (Mg > Na > Ca). After the 1996 sublimnic eruption within AN caldera, new hot springs appeared close to the eruption site. In this paper we synthesize all published and new geochemical data sets. The Karymsky Lake and post similar to 1996 new thermal springs demonstrate exponential decreases in their main dissolved species, with a characteristic time of 5 to 8 years. The chemistry of AN and K springs did not change after the eruption. However, the concentration of chloride in the lake water approached similar to 35 mg/l, compared with a background of 8-11 mg/l revealing a possible new source of hot water within the Karymsky Lake. All thermal fields of the KVC are drained by the Karymsky River with an outflow rate at the source of similar to 2 m(3)/s (flowing out from Karymsky Lake) and at the exit from the Karymsky caldera of similar to 4.5 m(3)/s. Using the measured solute fluxes at the source (AN springs) and at the exit (AN + K springs) the natural heat flux from the two systems can be estimated as similar to 67 MW and similar to 120 MW, respectively, and 20 t/d for the chloride output from both systems.

Since 1985, Catahoula Lake, located in central Louisiana, has attracted more wintering canvasbacks than any other site in North America. Canvasbacks are attracted to Catahoula Lake because of its consistent flooding regime and abundant below-ground plant foods, but are at risk of lead (Pb) toxicosis because of the high density of spent Pb shot contained in sediments. To estimate survival rates and determine sources and timing of mortality, we radiomarked 172 immature canvasbacks during winters 1991-94. Half of our sample had blood Pb concentrations greater-than-or-equal-to 0.2 parts per million (ppm) at time of capture and were considered Pb exposed. Blood Pb concentrations of others (unexposed) were initially at background levels (i.e., Pb < 0.2 ppm). Year had no effect on canvasback survival (P = 0.357), but survival was positively related to body mass (P = 0.014) and negatively related to the interaction of blood Pb concentration and body mass (P < 0.001). Winter survival estimates for Pb-exposed immatures were lower (P less-than-or-equal-to 0.045) than those for unexposed immatures in 1992-93 (0.569 vs. 0.815, respectively) and 1993-94 (0.578 vs. 0.923, respectively) but did not differ (P = 0.34) in 1991-92 (0.747 vs. 0.857, respectively) when Pb-exposed canvasbacks had greater body mass and lower blood Pb concentration. Causes of mortality were gunshot (31%), Pb toxicosis (16%), drowning in commercial fishing nets (6%), and unknown (47%). Survival estimates for Catahoula Lake canvasbacks, especially Pb-exposed individuals, were lower than those previously reported for immature females wintering in coastal Louisiana or Chesapeake Bay. Most immatures that were initially exposed to Pb apparently survived the winter; however, subsequent survival and performance of annual cycle events may have been affected because exposed birds weighed less than unexposed birds. We recommend that Pb exposure in waterfowl be periodically monitored and managers give priority to reducing Pb shot availability at concentration areas.

Nitrate content and potential microbial signature of rock glacier outflow, Colorado front range	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Here we characterize the nutrient content in the outflow of the Green Lake 5 rock glacier, located in the Green Lakes Valley of the Colorado Front Range. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was present in all samples with a mean concentration of 0-85 mg L-1. A one-way analysis of variance test shows no statistical difference in DOC amounts among surface waters (p = 0(.)42). Average nitrate concentrations were 69 mu moles L-1 in the outflow of the rock glacier, compared to 7 mu moles L-1 in snow and 25 mu moles L-1 in rain. Nitrate concentrations from the rock glacier generally increased with time, with maximum concentrations of 135 mu moles L-1 in October, among the highest nitrate concentrations reported for highelevation surface waters. These high nitrate concentrations appear to be characteristic of rock glacier outflow in the Rocky Mountains, as a paired-difference t-test shows that nitrate concentrations from the outflow of 7 additional rock glaciers were significantly greater compared to their reference streams (p = 0-003). End-member mixing analysis suggest that snow was the dominant source of nitrate in June, 'soil' solution was the dominant nitrate source in July, and base flow was the dominant source in September. Fluoresence index values and PARAFAC analyses of dissolved organic matter (DOM) are also consistent with a switch from terrestrial DOM in the summer time period to an increasing aquatic-like microbial source during the autumn months.

A total of 68 species were recorded. Bean goose (Anser fabalis), Tundra swan (Cygnus columbianus), and Swan. goose (Anser cygnoides) were dominant in Poyang Lake during this study. Dominant species differed in the five regions, although bean goose was the common dominant species in four regions. Most dominant or common species had no significant differences among the five regions. Bird composition was similar among Poyang Baishazhou Natural Reserve (BSZ), Nanjishan Wetland Nature Reserve (NJS) and Duchang Migratory Bird Reserve (DC), and many species had similar preferences for these three regions. The number of species in DC was high for most times. Bird diversity was higher in mid-winter than in early or late winter with the exception of NJS. PWC and PHF had steady and high evenness index. Podicipediformes was very common in early or late winter in all study regions because shallow areas dominated in our study area during midwinter. The proportion of Gruiformes increased gradually in PWC, PHF, and BSZ from November. Charadriiformes had lower proportions in NJS and BSZ. The Anseriformes proportion rapidly increased in most regions in November and stayed high: until March, then decreased gradually. Ciconiiformes had high proportion in PWC and PHF in October and January, indicating that this species migrated to breeding sites earlier; this may be related to its long hatching and incubation period. A repeatable and robust sampling protocol should be developed to monitor the birds studied here, and to report annually.																			0030-9923					APR	2014	46	2					451	462																WOS:000335719100020
J	MULLER, U				MULLER, U			VERTICAL ZONATION AND PRODUCTION-RATES OF EPIPHYTIC ALGAE ON PHRAGMITES-AUSTRALIS	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The vertical distribution of chlorophyll in epiphyton on Phragmites australis showed a peak in the middle sections of the submerged parts. Just below the water surface and above the sediment, chlorophyll concentrations were much less. 2. During winter and early spring, loosely attached diatoms were predominant just below the water surface and on the middle sections of the Phragmites plants. Near the bottom, adnate diatoms, parenchymatous thalli of chlorophytes and cyanobacteria were abundant. 3. At high photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) during May, filamentous species of Ulothricophyceae and Zygophyceae developed dense populations on the middle sections of the stems. 4. Primary production rate was proportional to chlorophyll concentration although production maxima were recorded above the biomass maxima. 5. Where illumination was low, the chlorophyll-specific rate of photosynthesis (PB rate) decreased proportionally with the vertical decrease of PAR in the littoral zone, independent of the chlorophyll concentration on the stems. 6. When illumination was high, the PB late decreased as biomass increased, and was independent of surface radiation. 7. The dependence of primary production rate on chlorophyll concentration produced a saturation curve with a maximum production at 4.6 mu gC cm(-2) h(-1).																			0046-5070					AUG	1995	34	1					69	80		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1995.tb00424.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1995.tb00424.x													WOS:A1995RP65400008

Zulal; Sivri, Nuket			Temporal changes in water quality index of polluted lagoon ecosystems: a case study on the Kucukcekmece Lagoon	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												For lagoon ecosystems, it is crucial to conduct long-term monitoring of the water quality parameters and predict their potential effects. This study aimed to analyse the changes in the water quality index (WQI) profile of the Kucukcekmece Lagoon in Istanbul, Turkey, which has been facing ecological problems, and determine the increased stress in aquatic biota due to different pollutants. To begin, the sampling data were obtained from the Kucukcekmece Lagoon throughout a 13-month period in 2018-2019. The estimated WQI values were compared to studies conducted in the same study area within the last 20 years. Then, the relationship between the acute toxicity of surface waters, which is the recommended parameter for analyses in this field, and the WQI was determined. Although the water class has generally been defined as 'good quality' (WQI = 86), the study found it to be 'very poor quality' (WQI = 112 and 97, respectively) with bloom events and toxicity effects in spring and autumn. When compared with the WQIs calculated from the last 20 years, a significant improvement in water quality at station L1 (decreased from WQI = 288 to WQI = 161) and a deterioration at station L2 (increased from WQI = 71 to WQI = 100) were observed. The acute toxicity and water quality classes were highly positively correlated (r = 0.773; p < 0.01). The method, used for the first time in this area, was able to interpret the acute toxicity of lagoon surface waters and WQI data. Furthermore, the use of this method was recommended for rapid analysis of the increased stress in aquatic biota.					Sonmez, V.

Spatial and Temporal Hypoxia Dynamics in Dense Emergent Macrophytes in a Florida Lake	WETLANDS												Many aquatic systems worldwide have experienced significant changes in littoral macrophyte communities from altered hydrology in the form of water controls structures (e.g., dams). Water level stabilization for flood control can cause persistent occurrence of dense stands of emergent macrophytes, which can affect the physicochemical environment for fishes. We evaluated dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in five emergent macrophyte species (cattail Typha spp., pickerelweed Pontedaria cordata, smartweed Polygonum spp., torpedograss Panicum repens, and water primrose Ludwigia spp.) at three levels of macrophyte coverage (i.e., 50-64, 65-79, and 80-95%) at Lake Istokpoga, Florida during July-August (summer) and October-November (fall) 2007. Dissolved oxygen exhibited substantial spatial and temporal variability at small scales (i.e., meters and hours), with the lowest DO and highest probability of hypoxia occurring in smartweed and water primrose habitats relative to other macrophyte types. The probability of hypoxia increased with macrophyte coverage for all macrophyte species tested. Dissolved oxygen was influenced by the structural differences (e.g., stem density and size) and spatial orientation (e.g., proximity to open water) associated with the individual macrophyte habitats. Restoration efforts that create open water pathways and maximize edge areas might improve DO concentrations and habitat quality and quantity for freshwater fishes.

Changes in HTO and OBT activity concentrations in the Perch Lake aquatic ecosystem	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY												Perch Lake, a small shallow shield lake located on the Chalk River Laboratories (CRL) site, contains elevated levels of tritium due to inputs from a nearby nuclear waste management area. The releases have been going on for many years but tritium levels in Perch Lake have been gradually decreasing since about year 2000. Lake water, sediments, aquatic plants, clams and fish were collected during the summer and fall of 2003 and 2013 at three locations in the lake. HTO activity concentrations were measured in all samples and OBT activity concentrations were measured in sediments, plants, clams and fish. In 2003, 2013, HTO activity concentrations in lake water were roughly uniform in time and space, except close to the shoreline where concentrations were fluctuating according to stream water and groundwater tritium levels in streams entering the lake. HTO activity concentrations of biota were similar to concentrations in lake water at the site where they were collected. OBT activity concentrations in biota were not always correlating with the lake water HTO levels. OBT to HTO ratios were found to be less than 1 for aquatic plants, around 1 for clams and fish and above 1 for birds reared on the shore of the lake.

Its watershed drains some 630 km(2), of which 99 km(2) are located in Vermont. The objective of this study is to adapt agrienvironmental indicators to the landscape scale to provide an holistic perspective of phosphorus sources and transfer in the Pike River watershed. The development of agrienvironmental indicators of non-point P pollution was supported by remote sensing, spatial integration of data and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). These indicators were evaluated on subwatersheds of about 5 km(2). The validation of the indicators at the subwatershed scale was supported by water quality records from the monitoring of 18 tributaries and sections of the Pike River. The agricultural land use, topographic attributes, the runoff SCS curve number, the mass balance of P and the P soil saturation were significantly correlated with P concentrations measured under peak streamflow conditions, in response to spring and fall long-duration precipitations, snowmelt and saturated or frozen soil conditions. It was found that 73 % of the variation for bioavailable P sampled within the hydrological network is explained by the P mass balance and subwatershed agricultural land use.																					0-306-48469-2				2004							271	290																WOS:000224236900015

We compared water quality among limnetic (always without macrophytes) and littoral zones with and without hyacinths in randomly selected sites and along a transect from inflow to outflow of the lake. In addition, water hyacinth uptake rates of ammonium, nitrate and phosphate were measured with a short-term experiment. Along the lake transect, the average ammonium and phosphate concentrations as well as transparency of the water were significantly lower in the vegetated than in the unvegetated zones. The randomly selected sites with hyacinth were also more turbid and had higher levels of chlorophyll-a, lower oxygen, pH and nitrate values and higher levels of COD than at sampling sites in the unvegetated pelagic and littoral zones. The unvegetated sites could be discriminated by the increased levels of nutrients in the pelagic in comparison with the littoral sites. The uptake rate of ammonium (2.6 mg N h(-1) kg fresh weight(-1)) was higher than that of nitrate (1.3 mg N h(-1) kg fresh weight(-1)). Combining uptake rates and total hyacinth standing crop, it follows that under the prevailing winter and nutrient conditions, the current hyacinth standing crop had a maximum daily removal capacity of 1.5% of the ammonium load. This value may be higher in periods of intensive biomass increase under favourable summer conditions. Similarly, maximum values of 0.1% and 0.025% were taken up daily by water hyacinth from the total nitrate and phosphate stocks, respectively. Our results indicated a strong local influence of water hyacinth on nutrient concentrations in the vegetated parts of the lake but due to the limited hyacinth cover (3.2% or 83 ha) of the lake and the prevailing winter conditions, the over-all effects on nutrient levels in the lake were likely to be low.					; Nhiwatiwa, Tamuka/AAR-2624-2021; Maes, Joachim/ABG-8549-2020	Brendonck, Luc/0000-0001-5383-1420; Maes, Joachim/0000-0002-8272-1607; 													0003-9136					NOV	2003	158	3					373	388		10.1127/0003-9136/2003/0158-0373	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2003/0158-0373													WOS:000187416300006
J	TITUS, JE; STEPHENS, MD				TITUS, JE; STEPHENS, MD			NEIGHBOR INFLUENCES AND SEASONAL GROWTH-PATTERNS FOR VALLISNERIA-AMERICANA IN A MESOTROPHIC LAKE	OECOLOGIA												Biomass of the submersed macrophyte V. americana rose steadily from early June to 50 g dry wt .cntdot. m-2 in early August [in Chenango Lake, Broome County, New York, USA]. Leaves dominated the biomass of this perennial from mid-June through August, after which plants senesced to leave only winter buds as perennating organs. Only 24% of plants sampled flowered during the 1978 growing season, yielding a population mean of less than 0.6% of dry weight allocated to sexual reproduction, with a maximum value of 7.8% for one plant. In contrast, allocation to winter buds accounted for 11% of total dry weight at the close of the growing season. Total dry weight, leaf length, stolon length, rosette number, and winter bud production of V. americana at the close of the growing season had significantly higher mean values for individual plants in a monospecific stand of Vallisneria than at sites dominated by Potamogeton amplifolius or Chara vulgaris. The basis of site differences in growth by V. americana is unknown, although significantly higher interstitial soluble reactive phosphorus concentration and organic content of sediment at a Vallisneria site were demonstrated. Removal of neighbors of some Vallisneria plants at the Vallisneria, Potamogeton, and Chara sites resulted in longer leaves, but fewer rosettes for plants with neighbors than plants without neighbors. Apparently, this changing growth pattern permitted Valisneria plants to compensate for the presence of neighbors, and thereby attain similar biomass and sustain similar winter bud production in the presence and absence of neighbors.																			0029-8549	1432-1939					1983	56	1					23	29		10.1007/BF00378213	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00378213								28310765					WOS:A1983PX10500004

Data on various fish present in a cold and dark hypolimnion of a large, deep, dimictic lake within the upper temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere are rare. While predominant species such as A. charr (Salvelinus alpinus) and E. smelt (Osmerus eperlanus) were continuously present in this habitat, whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) occupied this habitat primarily during wintertime, while other common species like brown trout (Salmo trutta), perch (Perca fluviatilis) and northern pike (Esox lucius) were almost absent. Besides stomach analyses (diet) and biometry, stable isotope analyses (delta N-15 and delta C-13) and total mercury (Tot-Hg) analyses were carried out on the caught fish. The delta C-13 signature and stomach analyses revealed a combined profundal-pelagic diet for all three species, A. charr with the most profundal-based diet. Length was the strongest predictor for Hg in whitefish and A. charr, while age was the strongest explanatory variable for Hg in E. smelt. A. charr was the only species exhibiting seasonal variation in Hg, highest during winter and spring.

Electro-fishing catch per unit effort sampling revealed significantly higher relative densities at night than during the day. Gobiids occupied all the available habitats encountered during sampling. Habitat-abundance relationships from night-time samples revealed that the two most abundant species, round goby Neogobius melanostomus and bighead goby Neogobius kessleri, were found in highest relative density along gravel beach and artificial rip-rap habitats; these species were in relatively low density in sandy areas. Monkey goby Neogobius fluviatilis was more abundant in natural shorelines than in rip-rap habitats and dispersed more consistently between sandy and gravel beaches. Tubenose goby Proterorhinus marmoratus demonstrated great plasticity in meso-habitat use. In conclusion, Ponto-Caspian gobies occurred rather consistently along the Hungarian section of the Danube, occupying all available habitats examined. Abundance-habitat relations suggest plasticity in meso-habitat use but partial segregation between species. Further studies are required at multiple spatial scales to assess how micro- and meso-habitat use varies with fluctuating population densities.

J	Bi, SL; Zhou, LZ				Bi, Shilong; Zhou, Lizhi			The influence of the abundance and availability of alternative food on the foraging behavior of wintering Siberian Cranes (Leucogeranus leucogeranus)	AVIAN RESEARCH												Food abundance and availability constitute fundamental determinants of foraging habitat quality for waterbirds, with high-quality foraging habitats playing a crucial role in supporting the survival and annual life cycle of wintering populations. The ongoing degradation and loss of optimal habitats have forced wintering waterbirds to increasingly rely on alternative foraging sites and modify their behavioral adaptation strategies to cope with food scarcity. The Siberian Crane (Leucogeranus leucogeranus), a large-bodied endangered waterbird species characterized by specialized dietary preferences, demonstrates particular sensitivity to environmental alterations. Faced with diminishing suitable habitats and declining natural food resources, this species has progressively adapted to utilizing artificial habitats, including agricultural landscapes such as paddy fields and lotus ponds, as supplementary wintering foraging grounds to fulfill their energetic requirements. This study examines the hypothesis that Siberian Cranes adapt their foraging behavior through plastic behavioral strategies in artificial habitats under conditions of limited food availability, thereby enhancing population fitness. A comparative analysis of crane foraging behaviors was conducted between mudflats and lotus ponds throughout the 2023-2024 wintering period. This investigation focused on three critical environmental factors: food abundance, food burial depth, and sediment penetrability, examining their influence on foraging patterns across these distinct habitats. The results revealed significant inter-habitat differences: foraging success rates were substantially higher (p < 0.05) and food handling times markedly longer in lotus ponds compared to mudflats, whereas foraging effort and attempt frequency were significantly elevated in mudflat habitats. The superior food availability in lotus ponds facilitated enhanced foraging success rates, enabling cranes to accumulate essential energy reserves for winter survival. However, the deeper burial depth of lotus roots in these habitats required more intensive processing behaviors, including prolonged digging, breaking, and swallowing activities, which consequently increased handling time by approximately 40% and reduced foraging attempts by 25-30% compared to mudflat conditions. These behavioral trade-offs suggest that while lotus ponds provide adequate food resources, their structural characteristics may impose physiological constraints that limit their effectiveness as optimal foraging grounds for Siberian Cranes. These findings offer valuable insights into the behavioral plasticity of wintering Siberian Cranes response to spatial variations in food resource distribution, while contributing to our understanding of the ecological value of lotus roots as alternative winter food sources in artificial wetland ecosystems.

J	Youn, H; Kang, CW; Gil, K				Youn, Hyeonjong; Kang, Chaewon; Gil, Kyungik			Water quality management strategy based on organic matter characteristics of streams and lakes in the Namhan River Watershed	MEMBRANE AND WATER TREATMENT												This study developed an efficient management plan to improve the water quality by analyzing fluctuations in the ratio and amount of various organic substances in streams considering watershed characteristics and rainfall patterns. Monitoring was conducted on three streams and one lake over seven sessions during wet and dry seasons. Water quality indicators including total organic (TOC), refractory dissolved organic (RDOC), and particulate organic (POC) carbons were analyzed using high-temperature combustion oxidation. The three streams (Cheongmi, Yanghwa, and Bokha) displayed high TOC concentrations during the rainy season because the accumulated organic substances from the dry season were washed away by rainfall. By contrast, Paldang Lake exhibited a substantial decrease in TOC concentration due to dilution, which was influenced by watershed and rainfall characteristics. Across all streams and lakes, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) accounted for the highest proportion, at 77.5% of TOC, with RDOC making up 91% of DOC and 71% of TOC. Although POC contributed a small annual proportion to annual TOC, the concentration rapidly increased during late spring and early summer, with increases of 40.403%, 25.99%, and 27.388% in Cheongmi, Yanghwa, and Bokha, respectively. Continuous monitoring of RDOC is essential to identify seasonal fluctuations and changes due to rainfall events. Furthermore, intensive POC management during the rainy season, particularly in May and June, is potentially economical and efficient for water quality management.																			2005-8624	2092-7037				JUL	2024	15	3					99	106		10.12989/mwt.2024.15.3.099	http://dx.doi.org/10.12989/mwt.2024.15.3.099													WOS:001309310100001

Several large ice-dammed lakes, with a combined area twice that of the Caspian Sea, were formed in northern Eurasia about 90,000 years ago, during the last glacial period when an ice sheet centred over the Barents and Kara seas(2) blocked the large northbound Russian rivers(3). Here we present high-resolution simulations with an atmospheric general circulation model that explicitly simulates the surface mass balance of the ice sheet. We show that the main influence of the Eurasian proglacial lakes was a significant reduction of ice sheet melting at the southern margin of the Barents - Kara ice sheet through strong regional summer cooling over large parts of Russia. In our simulations, the summer melt reduction clearly outweighs lake-induced decreases in moisture and hence snowfall, such as has been reported earlier for Lake Agassiz1. We conclude that the summer cooling mechanism from proglacial lakes accelerated ice sheet growth and delayed ice sheet decay in Eurasia and probably also in North America.

This paper presents the first geological evidence for springs associated with archaeological sites in this semiarid rift basin. The springs appear to be limited to a small area within the basin and were likely connected to faults that acted as conduits for groundwater. Tufas associated with ten archaeological sites have stable- isotope signatures occurring in a cluster bounded by delta O-18 ratios from -6% to +1%, and the delta C-13 ratios from -5% to +2%. The delta O-18 values cluster around -4%, that of precipitation in the region, indicating a meteoric source. The longevity of the spring record reflects a hydrologic system that apparently persisted for hundreds of thousands of years. Previous landscape reconstructions depicted the archaeological sites on the lake margin of paleo Lake Olduvai, as an alkaline playa. The discovery of springs at or near the archaeological sites provides fresh insights for interpreting hominin behavior during this key time in evolution with respect to procuring food, water, and materials for stone tools, as well as hominin adaptation to climate change and paleoenvironmental change. The idea that spring deposits may be in proximity to archaeological sites could lead to discovery of new sites at other hominin fossil localities in the East African Rift System (EARS).					; Mabulla, Audax/ABE-2455-2020; Baquedano, Enrique/ABE-9997-2020	Baquedano Perez, Enrique/0000-0002-6079-9390; 													1527-1404	1938-3681				JUL-AUG	2010	80	7-8					703	709		10.2110/jsr.2010.066	http://dx.doi.org/10.2110/jsr.2010.066													WOS:000280725900007

The genes examined were the ammonia-oxidizing bacteria gene (AOB amoA), ammonia-oxidizing archaea gene (AOA amoA), anammox gene (anammox 16S rRNA), denitrification genes (narG, nirS, nosZ), and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium gene (nrfA). The sequencing results revealed that the strain types of nosZ and nrfA were more abundant than amoA, anammox 16S rRNA, narG, and nirS. The nitrogen-related genes' abundances were much lower in summer than in winter. In the vertical zones of the sediments, the abundances of the seven genes mainly decreased as the sediment depth increased. The abundances of ammonium-oxidizing microorganisms had no significant difference in the vertical direction (P > 0.05), but there were significant differences in the vertical direction for the abundances of narG, nirS, nosZ, and nrfA (P < 0.05). Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) illustrated that the main environmental factors affecting the gene abundances were NH4+-N in the interstitial water, dissolved oxygen (DO) and electrical conductivity (EC) in the overlying water, and total nitrogen (TN) in the sediment. The anammox 16S rRNA abundances were significantly correlated with the nrfA abundances, while the narG abundances were also significantly correlated with nirS abundances. The results extend the knowledge of spatiotemporal variations of nitrogen-cycle microorganisms' characteristics in urban eutrophic lakes.

These two sources are closely linked, forming a coupled exogenous Li mineralization system involving hot springs, rivers and salt lakes. However, the geochemical behavior of lithium during its migration within this system remains inadequately detailed. This study systematically collected water samples from the Xiakangjian hot spring, the Suomei Zangbo river and the Laguo Co salt lake, and analyzed their hydrochemical, trace elemental and Li isotopic compositions. The results show that the dissolved Li in the upper reaches of the Suomei Zangbo primarily originates from silicate weathering, characterized by low Li concentration (7.84 mu g/L) and high delta Li-7 values (+8.21 parts per thousand). Following the discharge from Xiakangjian spring with high Li concentrations (8071.73 mu g/L) and low delta Li-7 (+0.19 parts per thousand), the river exhibits an extraordinary Li enrichment and a negative shift in Li isotopes, with Li concentration increasing by over 200 times reaching 1777.02 mu g/L, and delta Li-7 values decreasing by 8.07 parts per thousand to 0.14 parts per thousand. After passing through the hot spring area, the river's Li concentration stabilizes (1105.49 similar to 1452.33 mu g/L) with a slight increase in Li isotopes (0.12 parts per thousand similar to 0.72 parts per thousand), indicating limited influence from silicate weathering and secondary mineral adsorption on the geochemistry of the Li-rich river water. Consequently, sufficient Li can be stably supplied to the salt lakes via the river, displaying evolutionary characteristics distinct from those of low-Li rivers. The Xiakangjian geothermal spring, Suomei Zangbo and Laguo Co together constitute a continuously operating coupled mineralization system from geological history to the present. The Li-rich hot springs act as the primary endogenous source, the river as the transport pathway, and the terminal lake as the deposition site, with evaporation and concentration driven by the cold, arid climate facilitating the ongoing formation of Li brine in salt lakes. This process completes the migration and enrichment of Li from source to sink, from deep to shallow, achieving a transition from endogenous to exogenous mineralization, and represents a crucial component of the lithium cycle.

Combination of Acoustic Telemetry and Side-Scan Sonar Advances Suppression Efforts for Invasive Lake Trout in a Submontane Lake	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Expansion of an invasive Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush population in Swan Lake, Montana, threatens a core area population of Bull Trout S. confluentus. Given the recent development of novel suppression methods, such as use of carcass analog pellets to cause high mortality of embryos, there was a need to quantify spawning season aggregation sites, site use, and spawning habitat for Lake Trout in Swan Lake. Acoustic tags were implanted in 85 Lake Trout during the summer in 2018 and 2019. Nightly tracking efforts during autumn in both years resulted in 1,744 relocations for 49 individual Lake Trout. Kernel density analysis was used to evaluate Lake Trout aggregation sites, identifying 10 distinct sites. All spawning sites were located in the littoral zone along areas of steep bathymetric relief, and these sites composed 48% of total relocations during both spawning seasons. In 2019, side-scan sonar imaging was used to classify and quantify the total area of spawning substrate, which constituted 12.8% of the total surface area estimated for spawning sites 1, 6, and 9 and 11.4% of the total surface area for aggregation sites 2-5, 7, 8, and 10. Simultaneous treatment of all spawning sites would require 205,709 +/- 86 kg of carcass analog pellet material, resulting in 370.4 +/- 0.2 kg of phosphorus inputs and 7,487.9 +/- 3.1 kg of nitrogen inputs to Swan Lake. Thus, pellet treatment would increase the Carlson's trophic state index (TSI) values from 20.8 to 27.7 for total phosphorus and from 22.1 to 26.2 for total nitrogen. Based on a TSI threshold of less than 40 for an oligotrophic lake, the use of carcass analog pellets could be feasible for supplementing the gill-netting suppression of Lake Trout in Swan Lake.					; Tronstad, Lusha/JXN-4507-2024	Koel, Todd/0000-0001-6919-5828; 													0275-5947	1548-8675				DEC	2022	42	6					1609	1622		10.1002/nafm.10855	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10855		DEC 2022											WOS:000898393300001

Nevertheless, knowledge of past floods of the Loire River and its tributaries is still very limited. This study aimed to carry out an unprecedented census of floods in the Loire River, during the Little Ice Age (LIA), from the 14th century to the mid-19th century, in order to detect periods of high and low hydrological activity. The abundant historical archives in the cities of Nevers and Decize, as well as other archives consulted, enabled us to record 303 flood events, including 220 in the study area between Digoin and Nevers in Burgundy. This census is heterogeneous over the centuries, with the majority of newly recorded flood events taking place during the 14th and 15th centuries, first half of the 16th century, and 18th and 19th centuries. The use of two types of flood indexes enabled this study to overcome the documentary bias, and detect several decadal periods of high or low hydrological activity during the LIA in the Loire River. Almost all these periods can be found on other rivers in both France and Europe, the Loire River being exposed to the confluence of several climatic influences, as confirmed by comparisons with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Grand Solar minima and temperature fluctuations. Nevertheless, the coldest periods of the LIA, coupled with negative NAO positions, correspond to periods of high hydrological activity in the Loire River. The study of flood seasonality also reveals a high degree of variability during the LIA, with a higher proportion of flood events occurring in summer and autumn compared with the current seasonal pattern.

In the Rhine growth of small zebra mussels correlated positively with temperatures and seasonal average chlorophyll-a concentrations. In the lakes seasonal growth correlated positively with seasonal average temperatures. Seasonal growth in the Rhine generally exceeded that in the lakes, in spite of lower chlorophyll-a concentrations. It is argued that in the investigated water bodies the presence of water currents seems to influence growth more than the trophic status. Water current enhances water mixing, continuously refreshes the water in the mussels' direct environment and prevents the mussels from smothering with silt. Seasonal growth was compared with data from other water bodies in Europe. Growth rates of small mussels showed a clear positive relation with temperature during spring (R2 = 0.82, p < 0.0001), starting at a minimum temperature of 3-degrees-C. The sum of two gauss shaped functions best fitted the growth rates of small mussels during the season. On the basis of temperature data alone these functions were able to predict the growth rates well. Maximum growth rates occurred at the end of May. The subsequent depression in early summer was attributed to reproduction activities. An increase in growth rate during August and September was frequently observed. The subsequent decline was correlated with a temperature decline (p < 0.01, R2 = 0.56).																			0003-9136					MAY	1992	124	3					257	280																WOS:A1992HV44500001

The water temperature, thickness of the snow and ice, as well as incident, reflected and penetrating through the ice fluxes of solar radiation were registered. The lake surface albedo in spring varied widely from 0.95 (fresh snow, sunny weather) to 0.1 (water on the ice surface). The heat balance of the lake surface (solar and effective long-wave radiation, evaporation and condensation, turbulent heat transfer) was estimated for the period of melting. The amount of heat accumulated in the sub-ice layer during the spring convection was assessed. Estimates of the proportion of solar radiation on the melting of ice and water heating in the under-ice layer during the spring thaw were carried out.					; Palshin, Nikolay/L-8634-2013; Zdorovennova, Galina/L-8214-2013; Zdorovennov, Roman/L-8294-2013; Terzhevik, Arkady/L-7911-2013; Efremova, Tatiana/M-1943-2013	Palshin, Nikolay/0000-0003-1540-3788; Zdorovennova, Galina/0000-0003-2726-0104; Zdorovennov, Roman/0000-0003-1695-4872; Terzhevik, Arkady/0000-0002-0837-9065; Efremova, Tatiana/0000-0003-0313-6731													1736-4728	1736-7557				MAR	2013	62	1					26	32		10.3176/earth.2013.03	http://dx.doi.org/10.3176/earth.2013.03													WOS:000316712700004

By combining the strengths of satellite-based observation and modeling, we have produced an integrated daily LSWT for 160 lakes across the Tibetan Plateau where in situ observation is limited. The MODIS-based lake-wide mean LSWT in the integrated dataset includes the daytime, nighttime, and daily mean for the period 2000-2017. The MODIS-based daily mean LSWT is used to calibrate a simplified physically based model (i.e., modified air2water model), upon which a complete and consistent daily LSWT dataset is reconstructed for the period 1978-2017. The reconstructed LSWT dataset is validated by comparing it with both the satellite-based and in situ observations. The validation shows that the reconstructed LSWT is in good agreement with the observations. According to the reconstructed LSWT dataset, the annual LSWT of lakes in the Tibetan Plateau has increased significantly in the period 1978-2017 with an increase rate ranging from 0.01 to 0.47 degrees C per 10 years. The warming rate is higher in winter than in summer. The integrated dataset is unique for its relatively large temporospatial span (1978-2017) and high temporal resolution. The dataset together with the methods developed can contribute to research in exploring water and heat balance changes and the consequent ecological effects at the Tibetan Plateau.

The salinity-gradient solar pond (SGSP) technology is used to extract the lithium carbonate from Zabuye salt lake brine in the Tibet Plateau of China. Years of production practice proved that due to the unsatisfactory quality and insufficient amount of lithium-rich brine used to make the SGSP, the yield and grade of lithium concentrate in the solar pond has been seriously affected. In this paper, it has been investigated that the change rule of brine composition with different brine mixing ratios through the same/cross-year brine mixing laboratory experiments and the cross-year brine mixing production test. The optimal brine mixing ratio of winter concentrated brine and summer brine, the relevant operation parameters and the yield increase effect of lithium concentrate in the solar pond are obtained. The results show that the cross-year brine mixing method can not only significantly improve the yield and grade of lithium carbonate, but also alleviate the pressure of brine production in salt field. It is suggested that the SGSP technology coupled with the cross-year brine mixing method should be given priority in the production of lithium carbonate in Zabuye mining area.

J	Cohen, S; Koshida, G; Mortsch, L				Cohen, Stewart; Koshida, Grace; Mortsch, Linda			Climate and water availability indicators in Canada: Challenges and a way forward. Part III - Future scenarios	CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL												Following from Parts I and II of this series (this issue), some common approaches for developing and assessing future scenarios of water availability are reviewed, along with recent case studies of Canadian watersheds. The results of future changes in drought related to climate change are influenced by the choice of indicators. For the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), small changes in drought frequency and severity are projected over southern Canada, reflecting the influence of increases in future annual precipitation only. However, assessments using the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) reveal dramatic increases in the potential for future droughts since this indicator incorporates the combined influences of higher temperatures, soil moisture capacity and precipitation to estimate evapotranspiration. Regarding projected changes in runoff, watersheds in British Columbia tend to show increases in annual and winter runoff. Some watersheds show projected decreases in summer runoff. In the southern Prairies, most watersheds show projected decreases in annual and summer runoff. In Ontario and Quebec, results are mixed. Lake levels in the Great Lakes are projected to decline under most scenarios, but results differ between regional and global climate model-based scenarios due to differences in how lake evaporation is calculated. In New Brunswick, Labrador and northern Quebec, streamflow is projected to increase. Uncertainties in future projections emerge due to differences between climate scenario generating methods, and between hydrologic models used for the assessments. This paper concludes with some thoughts on addressing important research questions related to future scenarios of water availability in Canada. For scenario-based assessments, hydrologic model inter-comparisons might yield some useful insights into uncertainties in model structure that affect evaporation, evapotranspiration and snowmelt calculations. Scenarios developed for assessments should include both future climate and projected land use/cover changes and, where necessary, integration of potential reduction in glacier volume. Finally, as scenarios from regional climate models become more readily available, there may be more opportunity to explore how runoff projections could be applied to basin-scale routing models.																			0701-1784	1918-1817				APR 3	2015	40	2					160	172		10.1080/07011784.2015.1006021	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07011784.2015.1006021													WOS:000354448100003

Although the lake can reach a surface area of 25 km(2) in spring completely dry in summer. The dominant species of vegetation cover the plants belonging to Mediterranean Phytogeography. Hygrophytes of grassy species are dense at the base of the lake, whereas xerophytes are dominant in the east and south of the basin. With this study; fossil pollen analysis of the bottom sediments of the lake is aimed to reveal the vegetation changes occurring in the last 6000 years around the lake. The fossil pollen analysis was carried out according to the "classical method" 10 at a resolution of 10 cm on the core taken from the depth of 5 m of the lake. In addition, the radiocarbon dating of the two sediment samples was performed and the wet depth curve was formed. Thus, the dates of occurrence of vegetation changes were determined. As a result of pollen analysis; at a depth of 5 m, fossil pollen from the plants of the genus Pinus, Cedrus and Quercus is predominant.

Average survival from parr to smolt in three consecutive annual releases was 12.9% and we conclude that the quality of fall-fingerling salmon, produced from our semi-natural rearing techniques, was satisfactory. Year-class survival decreased progressively with consecutive releases. Rate of increase in juvenile salmon biomass remained stable over the duration of the study, suggesting that the average annual biomass of 1.6 kg ha-1 of juvenile salmon released did not exceed habitat carrying capacity. Precocity did not appear to represent a significant deterrent to fall-fingerling survival.

Warm-season temperatures generally followed summer insolation in the early Holocene. However, these deviated from summer insolation trends in the mid- and late-Holocene, likely due to intensified greenhouse gas forcing at that time. We identify 17 cold events that lasted from similar to 1 to 6 centuries that are associated with solar activity. Severe cold events that occurred during the early and late Holocene appear to be related to strengthened westerlies.

For this study, we investigated the impact of lake processes on local and regional climate using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, which includes a one-dimensional physically based lake model. The first simulation with the WRF model was performed for the TP over the 2000-2010 period, and the second was carried out during the same period but with the lakes filled with nearby land-use types. Results with the lake simulation show that the model captures the spatial and temporal patterns of annual mean precipitation and temperature well over the TP. Through comparison of the two simulations, we found that the TP lakes mainly cool the near-surface air, inducing a decreasing sensible heat flux for the entire year. Meanwhile, stronger evaporation produced by the lakes is found in the fall. During the summer, the cooling effect of the lakes decreases precipitation in the surrounding area and generates anomalous circulation patterns. In conclusion, the TP lakes cool the near-surface atmosphere most of the time, weaken the sensible heat flux, and strengthen the latent heat flux, resulting in changes in mesoscale precipitation and regional-scale circulation.					; Jin, Jiming/A-9678-2011; tian, lei/HGU-7245-2022	Jin, Jiming/0000-0002-0075-7738; Tian, Lei/0000-0001-9117-437X; 													0705-5900	1480-9214					2018	56	4			SI		230	239		10.1080/07055900.2017.1401524	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07055900.2017.1401524													WOS:000449550700004
J	Améziane, T; Dauta, A; Le Cohu, R				Améziane, T; Dauta, A; Le Cohu, R			Origin and transport of phytoplankton in a large river:: the Garonne, France	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Patterns in chlorophyll-a concentration, discharge and composition of suspended algae were used to examine the origin and transport of phytoplankton in a 291 km stretch of the River Garonne, south-west France during the summer-autumn of 1996. The importance of tributary inputs was also investigated. At higher altitudes, algal biomass (mean of 4.4 mug l(-1) chlorophyll-a) consisted essentially of the drift of benthic diatoms derived from reservoirs. The hydraulic conditions (high turbulence, short residence time) were not favourable for the development of a true phytoplankton in the river, except in segments of greater retentiveness (e.g. Malause reservoir, mean of 23 mug l(-1) chlorophyll-a). Some tributaries were occasionally eutrophic (e.g. Tolzac, 70 mug l(-1) chlorophyll-a), but dilution of these waters was too great for these tributaries to act as significant sources of algal biomass. However, they did contribute to diversity of planktonic algal assemblages. Spatial patterns in algal biomass (chlorophyll-a) were consistent with the drift of predominantly benthic algae followed by an input of the phytoplankton of the large tributaries (the Ariege and the Tarn) and with the euplanktonic species of Mancies and Malause reservoirs. Light intensity, sediments, nutrients and grazing do not seem to be limiting for algal development. The river hydrodynamics would not favour a high development of suspended algae, except maybe in lateral retention zones. Therefore, manifestations of eutrophication in the river Garonne are low.																			0003-9136					FEB	2003	156	3					385	404		10.1127/0003-9136/2003/0156-0385	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2003/0156-0385													WOS:000181859400005

A maximum in excess of 5.0 m/yr occurred where the ice surface had been submerged by lake water before 1994. The lake level fell from 5,022 m a.s.l. in 1984 to about 5,017 m in 1989, and to about 5,007 m in 1994. This decrease is attributed to melt of dead ice along the outflow; thus there is less danger of collapse of the lateral moraines. Instead, the rapid melting is expected to cause the lake to expand westward, that is towards the terminal moraine. ''Imja Glacial Lake'' was 0.69 km(2), with maximum dimensions of 1,450 X 600 m by the winter of 1992. This rapid expansion in area is due to melting of the glacier at the east (upper) end of the lake, Nevertheless, if the melt rate is sustained the western shoreline could migrate to the edge of the terminal moraine in little more than 7 years. Immediate action to lower the lake level below the level of the spillway is needed.																			0276-4741					NOV	1995	15	4					293	300		10.2307/3673805	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3673805													WOS:A1995TC89400001

This is why explaining the spatial patchiness of phytoplankton abundance has been a recurrent ecological issue and is an essential prerequisite for objectively assessing, protecting and restoring freshwater ecosystems. The drivers of these heterogeneities can be identified by modeling their dynamics. This approach is useful for theoretical and applied limnology. In this study, a 3D hydrodynamic model of Lake Geneva (France/Switzerland) was created. It is based on the Delft3D suite software and includes the main tributary (Rhone River) and two-dimensional high-resolution meteorological forcing. It provides 3D maps of water temperature and current velocities with a 1 h time step on a 1 km horizontal grid size and with a vertical resolution of 1 m near the surface to 7 m at the bottom of the lake. The dynamics and the drivers of phytoplankton heterogeneities were assessed by combining the outputs of the model and chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) data from MERIS satellite images between 2008 and 2012. Results highlight physical mechanisms responsible for the occurrence of seasonal hot-spots in phytoplankton abundance in the lake. At the beginning of spring, Chl-a heterogeneities are usually caused by an earlier onset of phytoplankton growth in the shallowest and more sheltered areas; spatial differences in the timing of phytoplankton growth can be explained by spatial variability in thermal stratification dynamics. In summer, transient and locally higher phytoplankton abundances are observed in relation to the impact of basin-scale upwelling. (C) 2018 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Temporal trends and spatial patterns in the temperature and oxygen regimes in the Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario, 1972-2008	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The temperature and oxygen regimes of the Bay of Quinte have been monitored, weekly or biweekly, in the open water season at a series of offshore index sites since 1972. Since 2001, temperature has been monitored in situ using loggers at both offshore and nearshore sites. This study was undertaken to assess the potential role of morphometry, climate, nutrient loading, and invasion by dreissenids in temporal trends and spatial patterns of temperature and oxygen regimes. The thermal regime was assessed using summer surface temperatures, Schmidt's vertical stability values, and vertical stratification characteristics. When the Quinte studies began taking measurements in the hypolimnion, deeper stations were attaining low oxygen levels by the end of summer, raising concerns that the cumulative impacts of eutrophication might lead to anoxia. The bottom oxygen regime at sites that stratified was assessed using the hypolimnetic warming rates and the apparent oxygen depletion rates one meter off the bottom. Quinte's maximum summer surface waters have warmed almost 1 degrees C from 1972 to 2008 in line with climate warming. Nearshore sites in the shallow upper Bay have similar temperatures to offshore index sites while those in the lower Bay are warmer. The warming of surface waters has increased the maximum Schmidt's stability values at the deeper sites but thermocline depth or bottom temperatures have not changed. Hypolimnetic warming rates showed no temporal change but were inversely correlated with mean summer flow from the main river draining into the Bay. Oxygen depletion was variable but exhibited a downward trend in response to reduced phosphorus loading with neither climate warming nor the driessenid invasion having a detectable effect. Projected 21st C climate warming poses a threat to the Bay of Quinte ecosystem.

The physico-chemical and biological parameters, as well as nutrient variabilities, both temporal and vertical (in the water column), were studied in the largest czna-Wodawa lake. The study was conducted during two consecutive water years, from November 2015 to September 2017. The non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, test H was used to detect variability between years, and among seasons and lake depths in water temperature, electrical conductivity, pH, ORP, concentration of dissolved oxygen as well as concentration of NO3-, PO43-, TP and chlorophyll a. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to detect any differences in Secchi depth (SD) and concentration of NH4+, NO2-, and TN. Ordination techniques: Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), and Principal Components Analysis (PCA) were used to describe the relationships among 13 environmental variables and distribution of samples. Results showed significant differences (P < 0.05) between two years of the study for most variables except of water temperature, visibility, concentration of PO43-, TN and TP, which corresponded with highly different weather conditions in both years. All of the tested variables, except for nutrients, differed significantly among seasons. Most parameters showed fluctuation in depth, especially in summer and in winter, despite the fact that no hypolimnion or long-lasting thermocline was observed in the study period. However, variability of Chl-a was statistically significant only. The results emphasized complex and multi-directional relations between tested variables, dependent on both external (catchment) and internal (in-lake) processes.

J	ROMANOWICZ, EA; SIEGEL, DI; GLASER, PH				ROMANOWICZ, EA; SIEGEL, DI; GLASER, PH			HYDRAULIC REVERSALS AND EPISODIC METHANE EMISSIONS DURING DROUGHT CYCLES IN MIRES	GEOLOGY												Reversals in hydraulic head and extensive methane losses were identified during a drought cycle from changes in hydraulic-head and dissolved-methane profiles in peat, Glacial Lake Agassiz Peatlands, northern Minnesota, United States. During the summer 1990 drought, regional ground water discharged from the mineral soil underlying the peat to raised bogs. Concentrations of dissolved CH4 in pore water showed that much of the peat column was supersaturated with respect to a reference standard of 1 atm partial pressure CH4. By the summer of 1991, the severity of the drought lessened, and the upper peat column was resaturated with precipitation-derived water. Ground-water flow was then controlled by local, precipitation-driven, recharge flow systems, and the regional ground water that was discharged affected only the peat immediately above the mineral soil-peat interface. In contrast, during the summer of 1991, concentrations of dissolved CH4 in pore water were all undersaturated with respect to 1 atm partial pressure CH4. The decrease in the amount of dissolved CH4 in the pore water from the summer of 1990 to the summer of 1991 probably was caused by changes in the CH4 flux and degassing to the unsaturated zone and to a lesser extent by changes in the partial pressure of gaseous CH4 in the peat as the peat volume increased with expansion as it resaturated.																			0091-7613					MAR	1993	21	3					231	234		10.1130/0091-7613(1993)021<0231:HRAEME>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0091-7613(1993)021<0231:HRAEME>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1993KQ02300010

Denitrification, anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) are critical dissimilatory nitrate reduction pathways that determine N removal and N recycling in aquatic environments. A mechanistic understanding of the influence of algal accumulations on partitioning among these pathways is currently lacking. In the present study, a manipulative experiment in aquarium tanks was conducted to determine the response of dissimilatory nitrate reduction pathways to changes in algal biomass, and the interactive effects of OC and nitrate. Potential dinitrogen (N-2) production and DNRA rates, and related functional gene abundances were determined during incubation of 3-4 weeks. The results indicated that high algal biomass promoted DNRA but not N-2 production. The concentrations of dissolved organic carbon were the primary factor affecting DNRA rates. Low nitrate availability limited N-2 production rates in treatments with algal pellets and without nitrate addition. Meanwhile, the AOAamoA gene abundance was significantly correlated with the nrfA and nirS gene abundances, suggesting that coupled nitrification-denitrification/DNRA was prevalent. Partitioning between N-2 production and DNRA was positively correlated with the ratios of dissolved organic carbon to nitrate. Correspondingly, in Lake Taihu during summer to fall, the relatively high organic carbon/nitrate might favorably facilitate DNRA over denitrification, subsequently sustaining cyanobacterial blooms.

Four caches were selected to represent each of four habitat types: river, lake, farmland, and oligotrophic small reservoir called 'suchar'. Altogether, 92 509 twigs and branches of 15 woody species were identified and measured. Individual caches, with one exception, included branches of only 4 or 5 species. Willows Salix sp., birches Betula sp., alder Alnus glutinosa, trembling aspen Populus tremula, and mountain ash Sorbus aucuparia occurred in caches from all four habitats studied. Willows alone constituted 62.5% of the total number of branches cached, Willows, together with birch, hazel Corylus avellana, alder, and trembling aspen, amounted to 97% of all branches in caches. The remaining 10 species provided only 3% of the branches cached. Most branches were 0.5-1 m long and < 3 cm thick at their base. Contents of food caches provided a good indication of winter diet and possibly food preference of beavers.																			0001-7051					DEC	2002	47	4					471	478		10.1007/BF03192471	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03192471													WOS:000180049800009

Impact of western Siberia heat wave 2012 on greenhouse gases and trace metal concentration in thaw lakes of discontinuous permafrost zone	BIOGEOSCIENCES												During the anomalously hot summer in 2012, surface air temperatures in Western Siberia were 5 to 15 degrees C higher than those observed during the previous period of > 30 yr. This unusual climate phenomenon provided an opportunity to examine the effects of short-term natural heating of water in thermokarst ponds and lakes in discontinuous permafrost zones and compare these observations to previous field results obtained when the temperature was normal during the summer of 2010 in the same region. In 2012, thermokarst bodies of water shrank significantly, water levels dropped approximately 50 cm in large lakes and small (< 10-100 m(2)) ponds, and shallow soil depressions disappeared. Based on samples from similar to 40 bodies of water collected previously and in 2012, first-order features of changes in chemical composition in response to increased water temperatures (from 14.1 +/- 2.2 to 23.8 +/- 2.3 degrees C in 2010 and 2012, respectively) were established. In these thermokarst bodies of water that covered a full range of surface areas, the average conductivity and pH were almost unchanged, whereas dissolved organic carbon (DOC), Cl- and SO42- concentrations were higher by a factor of similar to 2 during summer 2012 compared to periods with normal temperatures. Similarly, most divalent metals and insoluble trivalent and tetravalent elements were more concentrated by a factor of 1.7-2.4 in the summer of 2012 than normal periods. The average concentrations of dissolved CO2 and CH4 during the hot summer of 2012 increased by factors of 1.4 and 4.9, respectively. For most of the trace elements bound to colloids, the degree of colloidal binding decreased by a factor of 1.44 +/- 0.33 (for an average of 40 elements) during the hot summer of 2012 compared to normal periods. Increases in CO2 and CH4 concentrations with the decreasing size of the body of water were well-pronounced during the hot summer of 2012. The concentrations of CO2 and CH4 rose by factors of 5 and 150, respectively, in small (<= 10(2) m(2)) compared to large (>= 10(4) m(2)) thermokarst (thaw) lakes. Taken together, these trends suggest that, for a conservative scenario of lake size distribution, lake water warming at high latitudes will produce (1) a significant increase in methane emission capacity from thaw lake surfaces; (2) decreased molecular sizes of trace element complexes and potential bioavailability of metal micronutrients in water columns; and (3) relatively conservative responses by CO2, DOC and trace element concentrations.

Study focus: Karakoram is a region in High Mountain Asia with many surge-type glaciers. This study employed over 200 high-temporal-resolution remote sensing images and investigated the variations in elevation and velocity of the Ghujerab River Head Glacier (GRHG) from 2019 to 2023. Furthermore, we elucidated the potential controlling mechanisms. New hydrological insights for the region: Our findings revealed that the GRHG, akin to typical surgetype glaciers in Karakoram, started to surge in the spring and finished surging in the summer, with a duration of less than two years. Throughout the surging process, the glacier transferred a mass of 0.11 +/- 0.003 km3 from the reservoir area to the receiving area, resulting in a thickening of 91.59 +/- 1.04 m at the glacier terminus and thinning of 11.78 +/- 1.04 m in the upper glacier. By analysing the mass balance and glacier surface albedo during surging, we proposed that climatic disturbances in the glacier region provided essential material inputs for the surge. Additionally, based on the seasonal evolution pattern of glacier flow velocity, we inferred a close correlation between surging and variations in subglacial hydrology. The duration of acceleration and deceleration during glacier surging, as well as a comparison with existing studies, further support our conclusion. Future research integrating multi-source remote sensing and onsite observations can support numerical simulations to quantitatively reveal the key processes occurring beneath and within glaciers during surge events.					pengbin, liang/ABW-2360-2022; 高, 永鹏/IST-6791-2023	Mu, Jianxin/0009-0004-1491-0280; 														2214-5818				JUN	2024	53								101768	10.1016/j.ejrh.2024.101768	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2024.101768		APR 2024											WOS:001215117300001

These physical processes bring about seasonal variations in nutrients and organic matter fluxes, affecting the biogeochemical processes that occur in the water column. Physical and chemical dynamics are generally reflected in seasonal structural changes in the phytoplankton and bacterio-plankton community. In this study, we analyzed, using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, the structure of the bacterial community associated with large particles (> 20 mu m) in Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee, Israel), and its associations to phytoplankton populations. The study was carried out during late winter and early spring, a highly dynamic period in terms of thermal mixing, nutrient availability, and shifts in phytoplankton composition. Structural changes in the bacterioplankton population corresponded with limnological variations in the lake. In terms of the entire heterotrophic community, the structural patterns of particle-associated bacteria were mainly correlated with abiotic factors such as pH, ammonia, water temperature and nitrate. However, analysis of microbial taxon-specific correlations with phytoplankton species revealed a strong potential link between specific bacterial populations and the presence of different phytoplankton species, such as the cyanobacterium Microcystis, as well as the dinoflagellates Peridinium and Peridiniopsis. We found that Brevundimonas, a common freshwater genus, and Bdellovibrio, a well-known Gram-negative bacteria predator, were positively associated to Microcystis, suggesting a potentially important role of these three taxa in the microbial ecology of the lake. Our results show that the dynamics of environmental abiotic conditions, rather than specific phytoplankton assemblages, are the main factors positively correlated with changes in the community structure as a whole. Nevertheless, some specific bacteria may interact and be linked with specific phytoplankton, which may potentially control the dynamic patterns of the microbial community.

Rivers Sitnica and Drenica are among the most affected ones and water samples drawn from these rivers show the presence of various toxic substances. Genotoxic effects are seen in fish living in these rivers indicating a cytotoxic and mutagenic potential of the river water. Aiming at substantiating these observations, we assessed the cyto- and genotoxic effects of water samples collected at different locations from the Drenica and Sitnica rivers. Samples drawn from Lake Badovc served for comparison. To address seasonal effects, samples were collected at different seasons/time points during the period of summer 2016-spring 2018. The water samples were analyzed employing primary rat hepatocytes as a reliable in vitro cell model for the assessment of cytotoxic effects (mitotic arrest and cell death) and DNA damage/genotoxicity (micronucleus assay and Comet assay). The results do not account for significant effects associated with specific locations but demonstrate seasonal differences of the genotoxic potential of the water samples collected along both rivers, which are accompanied by a limited cytotoxic potential. Our data provide substantial support to earlier observations and strongly warrant the need for continuous chemical as well as biological monitoring of the river water in Kosovo, focusing on improved toxicant profiling of the river water and investigations addressing the observed seasonal variations.

J	MILLER, BB				MILLER, BB			ADDITIONAL MOLLUSKS FROM THE LATE PLIOCENE BENDER LOCAL FAUNA, MEADE COUNTY, KANSAS	JOURNAL OF PALEONTOLOGY												Mollusks from a new locality of the Bender local fauna, Meade County, Kansas, are reported herein. This faunule contains 19 genera of mollusks, distributed among 34 species, of which 14 are aquatic, 17 terrestrial, and 3 sphaeriids. The geologic range of Anisus pattersoni, Helicodiscus parallelus, Ferrissia meekiana, Fossaria obrussa, Stagnicola caperata, and Sphaerium sulcatum, are now known to extend to at least the late Pliocene, in the southern Great Plains. The presence of Gastrocopta franzenae and Vertigo hibbardi, hitherto known only from the Saw Rock Canyon and Rexroad local faunas, is interpreted as additional evidence in support of a late Pliocene age for the Bender local fauna. The mollusks indicate a permanent water situation, probably a small perennial stream; a temporary body of water; and a terrestrial habitat, composed of shrubs, tall grass, and scattered trees, growing along the stream margin. The occurrence of species which are presently found in the general area of New England and Great Lakes, are interpreted as indicating that summers were not as hot or dry as those which now characterize this area. Three species with southern distribution suggest that the winters were no more extreme than at present.																			0022-3360	1937-2337					1964	38	1					113	117																WOS:A1964XG14600012
J	Camacho, A; Vicente, E; Miracle, MR				Camacho, A; Vicente, E; Miracle, MR			Ecology of a deep-living Oscillatoria (=Planktothrix) population in the sulphide-rich waters of a Spanish karstic lake	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												In a three-year field survey which included some ecophysiological studies, the ecology of a deep living Oscillatoria (= Planktothrix) cf. ornata population at the chemocline and in the hypolimnion of the sulphate-rich karstic Lake Areas was studied. This cyanobacterium, together with the phototrophic sulphur bacterium, Chromatium weissei, develops dense populations in the anoxic waters of the lake during the summer stratification (maximal cyanobacterial population densities were around 1,300 filaments/ml), both being absent from the water column during the mixing period. O. cf. ornata from Lake Areas shows several adaptative features which help to explain the development of these dense populations. Phycoerythrin, the main light-harvesting accessory pigment, allows this cyanobacterium to collect efficiently the yellow-green light reaching the chemocline, which can only be used via photosystem II. Oxygen-evolving photosynthesis in this species is sulphide-resistant, it can be sustained at the sulphide concentrations found at the chemocline of the lake. In addition, buoyancy regulation mediated by gas-vesicle formation and carbohydrate accumulation substantially overcomes sinking losses in the population.					; Camacho, Antonio/I-3417-2015	Vicente-Pedros, Eduardo/0000-0002-8814-9912; Camacho, Antonio/0000-0003-0841-2010													0003-9136					JUN	2000	148	3					333	355																WOS:000087780800002

Multi-Year Controls on Groundwater Storage in Seasonally Snow-Covered Headwater Catchments	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Seasonally snow-covered catchments in the western United States supply water to growing populations as both annual snowmelt-driven streamflow and multi-year groundwater recharge. Although interannual variability in streamflow is driven largely by precipitation, runoff efficiency (the ratio of streamflow to precipitation) in individual catchments varies by 50% or more. Recent work suggests that interannual variability in groundwater storage, inferred from winter baseflow, is a primary control on runoff efficiency, highlighting a need to quantify both the time scales on which groundwater storage varies and the hydro-climatic drivers of storage. Using over a century of daily stream discharge data from 10 seasonally snow-covered catchments in northern Utah, we find that temporal variability in winter baseflow, an index of groundwater storage, measured from mean daily January discharge, exhibits a 2-5- and 12-15-year periodicity, driven by regional precipitation patterns and snowmelt dynamics. Specifically, multiple linear regression (MLR) modeling using antecedent hydro-climatic variables demonstrates that winter baseflow (groundwater storage) was positively related to 3-4 years of antecedent annual precipitation, negatively related to the previous year's mean annual temperature, and positively related to 1-4 antecedent years of snowmelt rate and duration. Because antecedent baseflow (groundwater storage) is strongly related to runoff efficiency, these results suggest that more frequent and longer droughts in a future climate will reduce surface water supplies faster than otherwise expected. More broadly, these results highlight the importance of including the influence of antecedent climate on groundwater storage when modeling and managing water supplies from seasonally snow-covered catchments.					; Solomon, Douglas/C-7951-2016	WOLF, MARGARET/0000-0003-4710-490X; Brooks, Paul/0000-0001-9201-1062; Strong, Courtenay/0000-0001-5866-4377													0043-1397	1944-7973				JUN	2023	59	6							e2022WR033394	10.1029/2022WR033394	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022WR033394													WOS:001000279900001

Round Goby Captured in a North American Estuary: Status and Implications in the Hudson River	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Round Goby Neogobius melanostomus, a nonnative fish species to North America, has been rapidly expanding through the connected waterways of the Laurentian Great Lakes. Herein, we document the eastward and southern expansion of Round Goby into the Hudson River, New York, an iconic coastal estuary that drains to Long Island Sound and the Atlantic seaboard. In summer and early fall 2021, routine fish monitoring conducted by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation documented a population of Round Goby in the tidal portion of the Hudson River. Over the course of monitoring in 2021, personnel collected 112 Round Goby between Albany, New York, and Poughkeepsie, New York, with the southernmost collection occurring approximately 140 km downstream of invasion front as reported in 2020 within the New York State Canal System. Although Round Goby previously colonized large rivers and streams in the Great Lakes watershed, there is little information about the invasion success and ecological impacts of Round Goby in estuarine environments in North America. We discuss the distribution and biological characteristics of the Hudson River Round Goby population as well as the potential ecological implications and areas of future research and monitoring for this range expansion.																			1944-687X					DEC	2022	13	2					524	533		10.3996/JFWM-22-012	http://dx.doi.org/10.3996/JFWM-22-012													WOS:000914399800002

Climate and environment in southwest Sweden 15.5-11.3 cal. ka BP	BOREAS												Lake sedimentary records that allow documentation of the distinct climatic and environmental shifts during the early part of the Last Termination are scarce for northern Europe. This multi-proxy study of the sediments of Attekopsmosse, southwest Sweden, therefore fills an important gap and provides detailed information regarding past hydroclimatic conditions and local environmental responses to climatic shifts. Lake infilling started c. 15.5 cal. ka BP, but low aquatic productivity, cold summer lake water temperatures, unstable catchments, and scarce herb and shrub vegetation prevailed until c. 14.7-14.5 cal. ka BP. Inflow of warmer air masses and higher July air temperatures favoured a rise in aquatic productivity and lake water summer temperatures, and the establishment of a diverse herb, shrub and dwarf shrub vegetation, which also included tree birch c. 14.5 cal. ka BP. Freshening of the moisture source region c. 13.7-13.6 cal. ka BP does not seem to have had a large impact on the ancient lake and its catchment, as lake aquatic productivity increased further and lake water summer temperatures and minimum mean July air temperatures remained around 12-14 degrees C. In contrast, further freshening of the moisture source region c. 13 cal. ka BP triggered a decrease in lake productivity, drier conditions and lower lake water summer temperatures. Macroscopic finds of tree Betula and Pinus sylvestris at 13-12.8 cal. ka BP demonstrate the presence of these trees in the lake's catchment. The transition into the Holocene (11.6-11.5 cal. ka BP) is marked by a change in chironomid assemblages and by a rise in lake water summer temperatures and aquatic productivity. These changes were followed by the re-establishment of a diverse aquatic and terrestrial vegetation, including tree birch and Pinus sylvestris at 11.4 cal. ka BP.					; Smittenberg, Rienk/A-3296-2008; Reimer, Paula/I-5915-2015; Davies, Siwan/E-6915-2011	Wohlfarth, Barbara/0000-0003-0374-1368; Ljung, Karl/0000-0002-4290-7933; Reimer, Paula/0000-0001-9238-2146; Luoto, Tomi/0000-0001-6925-3688; Smittenberg, Rienk/0000-0001-5578-9916													0300-9483	1502-3885				JUL	2018	47	3					687	710		10.1111/bor.12310	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bor.12310													WOS:000436108500001

'Boundary': mapping and visualizing climatically changed landscapes at Kaskawulsh Glacier and Kluane Lake, Yukon	JOURNAL OF MAPS												This paper describes a collaboration between a visual artist and geoscientists, who together viewed the same rugged, high mountain landscape through different, yet complementary, lenses. We pair scientific mapping and historic comparative photography with a series of site-specific sculptural installations to interpret the dramatic geological changes that occurred at Kaskawulsh Glacier, Yukon, in the spring of 2016. In the summer of that year, artist K.A. Colorado accompanied geoscientists D.H. Shugar, J.J. Clague, and J.L. Best to the terminus of Kaskawulsh Glacier, as well as Kluane Lake downstream of the glacier, to document the landscape changes that occurred earlier in the year. The Boundary images were created as on-site, three-dimensional, artistic interpretations of the markedly changed boundaries that occurred as a result of climate-induced glacier retreat and the sudden subcontinental-scale reorganization of drainage. Both the scientific study conducted by the geomorphologists and the art installations created by the artist were performed simultaneously.

Alex; Maberly, Stephen C.; Ryves, David B.; Anderson, Nicholas John			The impacts of changing nutrient load and climate on a deep, eutrophic, monomictic lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Nutrient availability and climate have substantial effects on the structure and function of lakes. Predicted changes to climate (particularly temperature) over the 21st century are expected to adjust physical lake functions, changing thermal and nutrient use processes. Both increasing anthropogenic nutrient inputs and net reductions following remediation will also drive ecological change. Therefore, there is an increasing necessity to disentangle the effects of nutrient and temperature change on lakes to understand how they might act in additive and antagonistic ways. This study quantified internal and external nutrient loads at Rostherne Mere, U.K., a deep (z(max)=30m), monomictic eutrophic lake (average annual total phosphorus >100 mu g/L) that has a long, stable period of stratification (c. 8.5months). A lake biophysical model (PROTECH) was used to assess the effect of changes in these loads and climate change on lake productivity in a factorial modelling experiment. During the summer, phosphorus released from the sediment is largely restricted to the hypolimnion and phytoplankton production is supported by the external load. On overturn, phosphorus at depth is distributed throughout the water column with the elevated concentration persisting to support algal productivity in the following spring. Consequently, the model showed that internal nutrient loading was the main driver of current and future changes in the concentration of phosphorus (responsible for up to 86% P reduction), phytoplankton chlorophyll a and cyanobacterial blooms. However, although the external phosphorus load had a relatively small influence on annual mean phosphorus concentration, it had a statistically significant effect on chlorophyll a concentration, because it supported algal production during summer stratification. Climate had minimal direct impact, but a substantial indirect impact by altering the timing, depth and length of lake stratification (c. 14days longer by 2100), and therefore altered nutrient cycling and phosphorus availability. In summary, the recovery trajectory at Rostherne Mere is limited by the annual internal soluble reactive phosphorus load replenishment that realistically is unlikely to change greatly on a shorter time-scale. Therefore, the external soluble reactive phosphorus load has the potential to play an important role as it can be managed further, but is complicated by the indirect impact of climate changing stratification and flushing patterns.

However, compared to seasonal fluctuations in resource abundance, the influences of interannual variation in resource abundance on the dietary niches of consumers remain poorly understood. Poyang Lake, China, is a very important wintering ground for the globally endangered Siberian Crane (Leucogeranus leucogeranus), White-naped Crane (Grus vipio), and Hooded Crane (G. monacha), as well as the non-endangered Eurasian Crane (G. grus). Tubers of Vallisneria spp., the dominant submerged macrophytes at Poyang Lake, is an important food for cranes. Nevertheless, submerged macrophytes have experienced serious degradation recently. In this study, we used metabarcoding technology to explore the consequences of Vallisneria tuber collapse on the diet compositions, breadths, and overlaps of the four crane species based on fecal samples collected in winter 2017 (a year with tuber collapse) and winter 2018 (a year with high tuber abundance). Results Compared to previous studies, our study elucidates crane diets in an unprecedented level of detail. Vallisneria tubers was confirmed as an important food source of cranes. Surprisingly, the grassland plant Polygonum criopolitanum was also found to be an important food source in the feces of cranes. Agricultural fields were important foraging sites for Siberian Cranes, White-naped Cranes, and Hooded Cranes, providing foods that allowed them to survive in winters with natural food shortages. However, the three crane species preferred natural wetlands to agricultural fields when the abundance of natural foods was high. The abundance of Vallisneria tubers, and probably P. criopolitanum, greatly influenced the dietary compositions, breadths and overlap of cranes. During periods of preferred resource shortage, White-naped Cranes and Hooded Cranes widened their dietary niches, while Siberian Cranes maintained a stable niche width. The dietary niche overlap among crane species increased substantially under conditions of plentiful preferred food resources. Conclusions Our study emphasizes the superior quality of natural wetlands compared to agricultural fields as foraging habitats for cranes. To provide safer and better foraging areas for cranes, it is urgent to restore the submerged plants at Poyang Lake. While high dietary niche overlap is often interpreted as intense interspecific competition, our study highlights the importance of taking food abundance into account.																			1742-9994					MAY 17	2021	18	1							24	10.1186/s12983-021-00411-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12983-021-00411-2								34001190					WOS:000656209500002

In this study, we detected water column indicates the microbial community composition of nine sampling sites over two seasons using Illumina TruSeq sequencing in Songtao Reservoir, Hainan Province, Southmost China. The study indicated that the dominant phylum was Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Cyanobacteria. The diversity parameters showed that the microbial community composition had significant spatiotemporal variations, including the significantly higher Shannon index and Simpson index upstream than those midstream and downstream. Besides, there were significantly higher Chao1 index, Shannon index, and Simpson index in winter than in summer. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) showed the microbial structural composition had significant seasonal differences. The results of microbial community composition further revealed that the eutrophication level upstream was higher than that of midstream and downstream. The redundancy analysis (RDA) diagram indicated that the abundance of microbiology species significantly correlated with temperature, total phosphorus, Se, and Ni. Furthermore, the mantel's test showed that the temperature and total phosphorus significantly affected the community composition of archaea and bacteria. Overall, our finding here partially validated our hypothesis that the spatiotemporal variations of microbial community composition are significantly related to nutrients, physicochemical factors and metals, which has been unknown previously in tropical drinking waterbodies. This study substantially contributed to understanding of the composition of microbial community in tropical drinking water reservoirs and the main environmental driving factors in tropical zones. It also provided a reference for the management of reservoir operation to ensure drinking water safe.

We tested the hypothesis that hydrology, river landscape, and local environment would explain variations in macroinvertebrates. The 66 taxa collected lake-wide comprised a few abundant but widespread groups (Malacostraca, Oligochaeta, Chironomidae, and Mollusca). Between 2004 and 2006, total abundance at 5 sites monitored annually fell by one order of magnitude, and taxa richness decreased from 19 to 12 taxa. Proportion of amphipods (Gammaridae) dropped sixfold whereas proportion of annelids (Oligochaetes) rose ninefold. The impoverishment of macroinvertebrates coincided with low summer water levels in 2005 and 2006, resulting in the periodic emersion of up-slope sites. Spatial differences in macroinvertebrate communities were less important than inter-annual differences, owing to large variability among sites. Patterns in macroinvertebrate communities were related to water depth, vegetation, and local changes in sediments (31% of variance explained). Gammaridae (Malacostraca) were strongly associated with down-slope sites, whereas Oligochaeta (Annelida) dominated in up-slope sites. Inter-annual changes in water level had major effects on macroinvertebrate communities in Lake Saint-Pierre, above and beyond other environmental variables.					; Pinel-Alloul, Bernadette/U-9107-2019	Hudon, Christiane/0000-0003-4629-0683; Pinel-Alloul, Bernadette/0000-0002-1070-2968													0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2016	778	1					221	241		10.1007/s10750-015-2531-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-015-2531-7													WOS:000379645500017

The three lakes studied were: Moss Lake (low nutrient, with typical nutrient concentrations of 80 mu g l(-1) nitrate and 10 mu g l(-1) dissolved reactive phosphate), Sombre Lake (low nutrient, but becoming progressively enriched, with typical nutrient concentrations of 185 mu g l(-1) nitrate and 7 mu g l(-1) dissolved reactive phosphate) and Heywood Lake (enriched, with typical nutrient concentrations of 1180 mu g l(-1) nitrate and 124 mu g l(-1) dissolved reactive phosphate). Bacterio plankton community structure was determined using a combination of PCR amplification of 16S rRNA gene fragments and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Results indicated marked changes in this bacterioplankton community structure, which were particularly associated with the transition period. However, significant changes also occurred during the period of holomixis. Comparison of the results from lakes of different nutrient status suggest that increased levels of nutrient input, and in the timing and duration of ice cover will lead to marked changes in the structure and stability of the bacterioplankton community at existing levels of environmental change.

According to the expected performances and specifications, the vehicle has to maintain a good autonomy and efficiency, typical features of an AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle), also maintaining high manoeuvrability and hovering capabilities, which are instead more common on ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles).Cooperative exploration and surveillance tasks involve the use of swarms of vehicles; the control, the mutual localization and communications among vehicles are fundamental tasks to be optimized. In particular, the optimization of costs with respect to benefits plays a critical role, considering that within the Thesaurus project a first fleet of three vehicles has to be developed. This work mainly deals with the different design phases of the vehicle and with the results of preliminary simulations and tests performed in the MDM laboratories, before the next lake (Roffia basin, between Pisa and Florence, Italy) and sea testing activities (Elba Island, Italy) that will be performed in spring and summer 2013.					; pugi, luca/AAK-7314-2020	Allotta, Benedetto/0000-0001-8511-1110; pugi, luca/0000-0001-7385-9471; Ridolfi, Alessandro/0000-0001-8493-7594; Costanzi, Riccardo/0000-0001-8600-1976															978-84-941407-4-7				2013							760	771																WOS:000346074700066

The mean and variance of P-I parameters and photosynthetic end-products were similar in both lakes. Mean PMB (maximum light saturated rate) and .alpha. (initial linear slope) values were 2.3 mg C .cntdot. mg Chl-1 .cntdot. h-1 and 5.5 mg C .cntdot. mg Chl-1 .cntdot.

The mean percent incorporation of 14CO2 into proteins, lipids polysaccharides, and LMW metabolites from short-term experiments (2-4 h) were 32.4, 21.3, 28.0, and 18.9, respectively, for Lake Huron communities and 34.8, 24.7, 24.5, and 15.8, respectively, for Lake Michigan communities. Over longer incubations the activity in each endproduct increased linearly during the day; during the night the activity in the LMW and polysaccharide fractions decreased and the activity in the protein fraction increased. There were significant seasonal variation in P-I parameters and the photosynthetic end-products. In both lakes, phytoplankton communities from the late winter-spring isothermal period were characterized by lower PMB values, higher .alpha. values, significant susceptibility to photoinhibition, and less incorporation into protein, as compared to communities from periods when the lakes were thermally stratified.

Empirical evaluation of observation scale effects in community time series	OIKOS												Natural communities are highly complex and dynamic over time, with populations structured by numerous abiotic and biotic forces acting through direct and indirect pathways. Multispecies Autoregressive (MAR) modeling can be used to partition effects of variables that are interrelated and temporally autocorrelated in time series from natural systems. Here we address two main questions in applying MAR models to community time series. First, what is the effect of observation scale on interpretation of community dynamics? We used a 10-year weekly planktonic time series from Lake Washington to construct multiple "biweekly" and "monthly" data sets, and compared resulting community interaction models. Direct abiotic effects and intraspecific autocorrelation were apparent using all data sets. Biotic interactions were more apparent using biweekly and monthly data, indicating that time lags longer than one week were necessary to detect numerical response to interspecific interactions. Second, we examined effects of dropping the winter months from our analyses to simulate the common practice of sampling only during the "growing season" in long-term ecological studies. We found that biotic interactions remained similarly characterized in models using only non-winter months, but that the importance of seasonal physical factors nearly disappeared in non-winter models. Exclusion of winter data in sampling designs may therefore allow us to characterize biotic interactions, although it may not help us understand populations' relationships to seasonal abiotic variables. The models supported many previous findings from experimental and qualitative investigations of Lake Washington community interactions, implying that MARs provided plausible characterizations of community dynamics, but some previously unconsidered relationships did emerge, such as the importance of cryptomonads and picoplankton for zooplankton growth. We conclude that explicit consideration of time lags in biotic response is necessary to understand relative importance of abiotic and biotic factors, and that sampling regime can therefore strongly influence our interpretations of community dynamics.

Access to safe drinking water is a basic human right and is a United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6. Globally, waterborne diseases such as cholera are responsible for over two million deaths annually. Cholera is a major cause of ill-health in Africa and Uganda. This study aimed to determine the physicochemical characteristics of the surface and spring water in cholera endemic communities of Uganda in order to promote access to safe drinking water.MethodsA longitudinal study was carried out between February 2015 and January 2016 in cholera prone communities of Uganda. Surface and spring water used for domestic purposes including drinking from 27 sites (lakes, rivers, irrigation canal, springs and ponds) were tested monthly to determine the vital physicochemical parameters, namely pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity and turbidity.ResultsOverall, 318 water samples were tested. Twenty-six percent (36/135) of the tested samples had mean test results that were outside the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended drinking water range. All sites (100%, 27/27) had mean water turbidity values greater than the WHO drinking water recommended standards and the temperature of above 17 degrees C. In addition, 27% (3/11) of the lake sites and 2/5 of the ponds had pH and dissolved oxygen respectively outside the WHO recommended range of 6.5-8.5 for pH and less than 5mg/L for dissolved oxygen. These physicochemical conditions were ideal for survival of Vibrio. cholerae.ConclusionsThis study showed that surface water and springs in the study area were unsafe for drinking and had favourable physicochemical parameters for propagation of waterborne diseases including cholera. Therefore, for Uganda to attain the SDG 6 targets and to eliminate cholera by 2030, more efforts are needed to promote access to safe drinking water. Also, since this study only established the vital water physicochemical parameters, further studies are recommended to determine the other water physicochemical parameters such as the nitrates and copper. Studies are also needed to establish the causal-effect relationship between V. cholerae and the physicochemical parameters.					; Sack, David/Y-4267-2019; George, Chandramohan/J-3979-2014; Bwire, Godfrey/J-7715-2019; Komakech, Henry/MVX-0983-2025	George, Christine Marie/0000-0001-9219-0953; Bwire, Godfrey/0000-0002-8376-2857; 														1471-2458				JUL 17	2020	20	1							1128	10.1186/s12889-020-09186-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-09186-3								32680495					WOS:000552355100005

Thermal effect of climate change on groundwater-fed ecosystems	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Groundwater temperature changes will lag surface temperature changes from a changing climate. Steady state solutions of the heat-transport equations are used to identify key processes that control the long-term thermal response of springs and other groundwater discharge to climate change, in particular changes in (1) groundwater recharge rate and temperature and (2) land-surface temperature transmitted through the vadose zone. Transient solutions are developed to estimate the time required for new thermal signals to arrive at ecosystems. The solution is applied to the volcanic Medicine Lake highlands, California, USA, and associated springs complexes that host groundwater-dependent ecosystems. In this system, upper basin groundwater temperatures are strongly affected only by recharge conditions. However, as the vadose zone thins away from the highlands, changes in the average annual land-surface temperature also influence groundwater temperatures. Transient response to temperature change depends on both the conductive time scale and the rate at which recharge delivers heat. Most of the thermal response of groundwater at high elevations will occur within 20 years of a shift in recharge temperatures, but the large lower elevation springs will respond more slowly, with about half of the conductive response occurring within the first 20 years and about half of the advective response to higher recharge temperatures occurring in approximately 60 years. Plain Language Summary Tools are developed (and demonstrated) that allow prediction of the effect of climate change on groundwater temperature at springs and seeps that support critical habitat.					; Zhan, Hongbin/B-3464-2008; Manga, Michael/D-3847-2013; Zhu, Yonghui/C-6714-2017	Ingebritsen, Steven/0000-0001-6917-9369; Williams, Colin/0000-0003-2196-5496; Zhan, Hongbin/0000-0003-2060-4904; Manga, Michael/0000-0003-3286-4682; Burns, Erick/0000-0002-1747-0506; Dunham, Jason/0000-0002-6268-0633; Zhu, Yonghui/0000-0002-6608-5188													0043-1397	1944-7973				APR	2017	53	4					3341	3351		10.1002/2016WR020007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016WR020007													WOS:000403682600045

Endogenous freshwater sources - e.g.: seasonal streams and lakes, subsurface reservoirs, surface snow/ice patches - are available, though they are highly sensitive to climatic changes. The near surface hydrological network is highly modified by the distribution and seasonal evolution of perennial frozen ground, i.e. permafrost, which is also expected to change in the future. The interplay between permafrost and hydrology, especially in relation to future climate change, is poorly explored. To address this issue, we carry out long-term ground temperature measurement and modelling, snow coverage survey, tritium- and stable isotope analysis of surface waters on the Ojos del Salado Massif, which is representative of high altitude mountains on the Atacama Plateau. According to our results, a highly transient surface hydrological network - lakes, springs and streams - forms during each summer where permafrost is widespread and ground thawing (i.e. active layer) is present (similar to 4900-6500 m a.s.l.). In this system, the water is of meteoric origin and relatively young (<10 years). The development of the network is strongly influenced by the active layer, which plays a crucial role in storing, seeping, and discharging groundwater. However, future permafrost degradation is expected to reduce the seasonal presence of shallow water, and hence, modify groundwater recharge patterns.

Arctic Deltaic Lake Sediments As Recorders of Fluvial Organic Matter Deposition	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												Arctic deltas are dynamic and vulnerable regions that play a key role in land-ocean interactions and the global carbon cycle. Delta lakes may provide valuable historical records of the quality and quantity of fluvial fluxes, parameters that are challenging to investigate in these remote regions. Here we study lakes from across the Mackenzie Delta, Arctic Canada, that receive fluvial sediments from the Mackenzie River when spring flood water levels rise above natural levees. We compare downcore lake sediments with suspended sediments collected during the spring flood, using bulk (% organic carbon, % total nitrogen, delta C-13, Delta C-14) and molecular organic geochemistry (lignin, leaf waxes). High-resolution age models (Cs-137, Pb-210) of downcore lake sediment records (n = 11) along with lamina counting on high-resolution radiographs show sediment deposition frequencies ranging between annually to every 15 years. Down-core geochemical variability in a representative delta lake sediment core is consistent with historical variability in spring flood hydrology (variability in peak discharge, ice jamming, peak water levels). Comparison with earlier published Mackenzie River depth profiles shows that (i) lake sediments reflect the riverine surface suspended load, and (ii) hydrodynamic sorting patterns related to spring flood characteristics are reflected in the lake sediments. Bulk and molecular geochemistry of suspended particulate matter from the spring flood peak and lake sediments are relatively similar showing a mixture of modern higher-plant derived material, older terrestrial permafrost material, and old rock-derived material. This suggests that deltaic lake sedimentary records hold great promise as recorders of past (century-scale) riverine fluxes and may prove instrumental in shedding light on past behavior of arctic rivers, as well as how they respond to a changing climate.

J	DUFOUR, KW; ANKNEY, CD; WEATHERHEAD, PJ				DUFOUR, KW; ANKNEY, CD; WEATHERHEAD, PJ			NONREPRESENTATIVE SAMPLING DURING WATERFOWL BANDING - EMPHASIS ON BODY CONDITION	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												We trapped mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) at 3 sites on the eastern shore of Lake St. Clair, Ontario, during August and September of 1989 and 1990 to investigate the potential for nonrepresentative sampling in typical autumn (i.e., pre-hunting season) duck-banding operations. Intersite comparisons showed that the local population was spatially segregated with respect to sex, age, molt chronology, and body condition, indicating a potential danger when the spatial distribution of the banding effort is limited. Sex composition of trapped samples varied according to size of the daily catch; smaller catches contained proportionally more females. However, size of the catch had no apparent influence on age ratios. Analyses conducted separately by sex and age provided little evidence for a relationship between size of the catch and condition of captured individuals. These results are generally inconsistent with the hypothesis that food-stressed individuals are among the first to respond to baited areas and enter traps. Thus, condition-related trap selectivity is unlikely to vary with size of the trapped sample, as some authors have suggested. Additional research is needed to determine whether bait-trapped samples of ducks are generally skewed toward individuals in poor condition.																			0022-541X					OCT	1993	57	4					741	751		10.2307/3809074	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3809074													WOS:A1993MB57100011

Both the pollen concentrations and other proxy indices, including sediment grain size, total organic carbon contents (TOC), and elemental contents (e.g., Fe, Al), clearly indicate a long term decreasing trend in ISM intensity over the late Holocene. During the period from approximately AD 750 to AD 1200, pollen concentrations of conifer and broadleaf trees, and herbs reached the lowest levels over the past 3500 yr; while the pollen percentages of both herbs and broadleaf trees increased, suggesting a significant medieval drought. The grain size, TOC, and elemental contents also support an arid climate during the medieval period. The Little Ice Age (LIA) at Lake Erhai was characterized as cold and wet. The medieval and LIA climatic patterns at Lake Erhai were similar to those over most of the ISM areas, but anti-phase with those over East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) areas. We suspect that sea surface temperature variations in the Indo-Pacific oceans and the related land-sea thermal contrasts may be responsible for such hydroclimatic differences between EASM and ISM areas.

Antarctica. Lake Fryxell has perennial gradients of salinity, dissolved oxygen and nutrients. We found that algal species diversity was low (56 taxa were collected), confirming the results of previous short-term studies. The phytoplankton consisted primarily of cryptophyte and chlorophyte flagellates and filamentous cyanobacteria. The presence of filamentous cyanobacteria, which have not been reported as abundant in this lake by previous workers, may represent a significant ecological change. Each austral summer, one dominant species contributed >70% of the total biovolume; Chroomonas lacustris was dominant in 1987-88. while Cryptomonas sp. dominated the phytoplankton in the remaining 4 years. No species succession occurred during the austral summer. Some common taxa were vertically stratified (Oscillatoria limnetica, Phormidium angustissimum Pyramimonas sp., Oscillatoria sp.), while others showed no distinct vertical stratification (Chlamydomonas subcaudata, Cryptomonas sp.). The stratification of the phytoplankton reflects the gradients of nutrients and light, and the stability of the water column.

To constrain the causes that drove displacement and deurbanization of the Indus Valley civilization, we present a 4500 yr old proxy record from the Tso Moriri Lake, northwestern (NW) Himalaya. The record indicates an interval of warm and wet climatic conditions from 4500 to 4350 calibrated years before Present (cal. yr BP) with a trend toward deteriorating climate, culminating in a pronounced, long cold and arid phase from similar to 4350 to 3450 cal. yr BP in the region. The Indian summer monsoon (ISM) weakened during this long arid phase depleting the water resources in the area of the Indus Valley settlements that likely have triggered the gradual abandonment of the Harappan cities. This long interval of ISM weakening and thus aridity in South Asia was driven by enhanced El Nino intensity and frequency.					; Dutt, Som/ABA-9093-2020	Gupta, Anil/0000-0003-0536-3911; Wunnemann, Bernd/0000-0002-7172-735X; Dutt, Som/0000-0002-2894-5861													1040-6182	1873-4553				JUL 20	2018	482						83	92		10.1016/j.quaint.2018.04.005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2018.04.005													WOS:000434685000007

They are highly enriched with nutrients and considered hotspots of carbon turnover. However, data on their primary productivity remain rare. We analysed two kettle holes typical to Germany with common aquatic plant communities during one year. We hypothesised that gross primary production (GPP) rates would be high compared to other temperate freshwater ecosystems, leading to high sediment deposition. Summer GPP rates (4.5-5.1 g C m(-2) day(-1)) were higher than those of most temperate freshwater systems, but GPP rates were reduced by 90% in winter. Macrophytes dominated GPP from May to September with emergent macrophytes accounting for half of the GPP. Periphyton contributed to most of the system GPP throughout the rest of the year. Sediment deposition rates were high and correlated with GPP in one kettle hole. In contrast, due to prolonged periods of anoxia, aerobic sediment mineralisation was low while sediment phosphorus release was significant. Our results suggest that kettle holes have a high potential for carbon burial, provided they do not fully dry up during warm years. Due to their unique features, they should not be automatically grouped with ponds and shallow lakes in global carbon budget estimates.					; Kazanjian, Garabet/B-3557-2018; Köhler, Jan/C-2633-2014; Hilt, Sabine/IUQ-1586-2023; Flury, Sabine/LFV-6961-2024	Premke, Katrin/0000-0001-6216-5386; Kazanjian, Garabet/0000-0002-6507-0806; Attermeyer, Katrin/0000-0002-6503-9497; Kohler, Jan/0000-0003-1894-2912													0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2018	806	1					77	93		10.1007/s10750-017-3337-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-017-3337-6													WOS:000416804200006

Surveys of charophyte distribution and abundance were conducted over the subsequent 30 mo. Charophyte biomass declined progressively from 1994 through 1996; regardless of year, charophyte presence was observed only during the mid to late summer and fall months. Ash free dry mass (AFDM) levels ranged from non-existent to >20 g/m(2). Abiotic factors influencing charophyte populations were investigated. Regression analysis showed that charophyte biomass was inversely related to water depth and positively related to Secchi depth suggesting that irradiance strongly influences charophyte distribution in this lake. Data from photosynthetic measurements and photosynthesis-irradiance curves confirmed this hypothesis, as I-k (irradiance at which photosynthesis is initially saturated) was an order of magnitude greater than the ambient light reaching the charophyte populations. In addition, autotrophic respiration exceeded net photosynthesis under ambient light conditions. Inorganic phosphorus concentration was not significantly related to charophyte biomass. Nutrient kinetics favored phytoplankton growth over Chara, assuming phosphorus limited conditions. Although nutrient concentration may influence Chara phenology and abundance, light appears to be a stronger regulator in this subtropical lentic ecosystem.

Radio-tracking of 20 adults was conducted for a period ranging from 5 to 343 d. We observed anadromous and potamodromous migrations by fish that were morphologically indistinguishable and spanned a similar size range (mean fork length = 364 mm). Within these migratory groups, fish exhibited variation in movement patterns including the timing of entry to spawning streams and postspawning movements. Anadromous and potamedromous fish entered study streams either during fall to overwinter and then spawn or during the spring. ust before spawning. Spawning was most concentrated in the upper portions of the study streams and occurred upstream to the highest available areas. Postspawning movements of potamodromous fish consisted of small-scale (< 2 km) movement within the spawning stream or longer movements to larger rivers or lakes. Anadromous fish migrated to estuarine or marine habitat after spawning. Both anadromous and potamodromous fish moved to lentic freshwater habitat to overwinter. Our results provide empirical evidence for an array of life histories displayed by coastal cutthroat trout in south-central Alaska. We attribute the variety of movement patterns, at least in part, to the diverse assemblage of available habitat and seasonally abundant food resources provided by Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. Future management should maintain the quality of and connectivity between reproductive, trophic, and refuge habitats distributed throughout the western Copper River delta.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				AUG	2007	27	3					1029	1040		10.1577/M06-037.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M06-037.1													WOS:000249158900036

Carbon Behavior and Formation of Water Chemical Composition in the Drainage System of the Drained Eutrophic Peatland	GEOCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL												Peatlands are recognized as one of the most critical ecosystems for long-term carbon sequestration, although they cover approximately 3% of the Earth's surface. However, the drainage and peat extraction significantly disrupt the carbon balance of peatlands. Specifically, the drainage network, an integral component of drained peatlands, contributes substantially to greenhouse gas emissions and lateral carbon transport. In eutrophic peatlands, the drainage system also serves as a source of nutrients for receiving water bodies. To predict changes in the carbon balance, to develop effective reclamation efforts, and to implement climate-related projects, it is essential to understand the processes governing the chemical composition of drainage waters. In this study, we examined the chemical composition of drainage water in the eutrophic Tarmanskoe Peatland (West Siberia) using historical and contemporary data. Seasonal dynamics of dissolved carbon and fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) to the atmosphere were analyzed for 2024. Obtained results have revealed an increasing role of evaporation in the formation of water composition since launching the drainage system. This trend is expressed in an increase in chloride and sodium ion ratios, along with shifts in the water-rock equilibrium from kaolinite towards montmorillonite and carbonates. The equilibria in the carbonate system and the ratios of major ions indicate that carbon redistribution occurs through the dissolution and precipitation of carbonates during the drainage system's operation. Seasonal dynamics of dissolved carbon and carbon-bearing greenhouse gas fluxes revealed distinct patterns. In summer, CO2 and CH4 fluxes from water surface of the drainage ditches increased, while CO2 emissions from the pond decreased due to the activity of photosynthetic organisms. Notably, a dry drainage ditch exhibited unique dynamics: summer CO2 fluxes from its oversaturated bottom sediments decreased more than fivefold, and CH4 fluxes remained near zero, comparable to spring levels. Meanwhile, both CH4 and CO2 are accumulated in the pore waters in dissolved forms. The results emphasize the importance of studying the carbon biogeochemistry in waterlogged soils and bottom sediments and the factors driving CO2 and CH4 accumulation in pore waters. These findings provide critical insights for developing novel approaches to the reclamation and implementation of climate-related projects for drained peatlands.

These hot springs harbour unique Arctic microbial ecosystems that have never been studied in detail before. Specific oligonucleotide primers for cyanobacteria, purple sulfur bacteria, green sulfur bacteria and Choroflexus/Roseiflexus-like green non-sulfur bacteria were used for the selective amplification of 16S rRNA gene fragments. Amplification products were separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequenced. In addition, several cyanobacteria were isolated from the mat samples, and classified morphologically and by 16S rRNA-based methods. The cyanobacterial 16S rRNA sequences obtained from DGGE represented a diverse, polyphyletic collection of cyanobacteria. The microbial mat communities were dominated by heterocystous and non-heterocystous filamentous cyanobacteria. Our results indicate that the cyanobacterial community composition in the samples were different for each sampling site. Different layers of the same heterogeneous mat often contained distinct and different communities of cyanobacteria. We observed a relationship between the cyanobacterial community composition and the in situ temperatures of different mat parts. The Greenland mats exhibited a low diversity of anoxygenic phototrophs as compared with other hot spring mats which is possibly related to the photochemical conditions within the mats resulting from the Arctic light regime.					; Kühl, Michael/A-1977-2009; Kuhl, Michael/A-1977-2009; Rysgaard, Søren/K-6689-2013; Roeselers, Guus/J-2971-2012; Muyzer, Gerard/A-3161-2013	Roeselers, Guus/0000-0002-4725-6105; Glud, Ronnie N./0000-0002-7069-893X; Kuhl, Michael/0000-0002-1792-4790; Muyzer, Gerard/0000-0002-2422-0732; Rysgaard, Soren/0000-0003-1726-2958													1462-2912	1462-2920				JAN	2007	9	1					26	38		10.1111/j.1462-2920.2006.01103.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2006.01103.x								17227409					WOS:000243294900012

Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the effects of parasitic infections on the amphipod Hyalella patagonica. Specimens were collected from Lake Mascardi, Argentina, between spring 2018 and summer 2019. We focused on three parasites: the acanthocephalans Pseudocorynosoma enrietti and Acanthocephalus tumescens and the nematode Hedruris suttonae. Morphological alterations in sexual traits, pairing success, and survival rates were analyzed. Significant morphological alterations were induced by P. enrietti, including castration and mixed sexual characteristics. Hedruris suttonae was the parasite most frequently found in amphipods in precopula, indicating that this parasite does not affect pairing success. Reduced survival rates were found in amphipods infected with H. suttonae or co-infected with P. enrietti and A. tumescens. These findings underscore the varying pathogenic effects of parasites on amphipod hosts and highlight the importance of considering multiple factors when evaluating host-parasite interactions and their ecological consequences in aquatic ecosystems.

Only 19.5% of the frustules observed were living cells, belonging to 19 diatom tare. Four taxa, belonging to the genera Caloneis, Diploneis and Sellaphora were dominant; the other taxa occurred at frequencies less than 2%. The two abundant Caloneis taxa, C. bacillum var. fontinalis and C, ventricosa f. peisonis have not previously been reported from Lake Tanganyika, nor from the other East African Great Lakes. Morphological descriptions and light and electron micrographs are presented of the four dominant taxa living in the hot spring: Caloneis silicula f. peisonis, Caloneis bacillum var. fontinalis, Diploneis subovalis and Sellaphora pupula.

J	Michaletz, PH				Michaletz, PH			Influence of abundance and size of age-0 gizzard shad on predator diets, diet overlap, and growth	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Relationships among age-0 gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum and their predators were examined over 5 years (1987-1991) in Pomme de Terre and Stockton lakes, Missouri, to determine the influence of gizzard shad abundance and size on diets, diet overlap, and growth of predators. Within years, temporal changes in age-0 gizzard shad size affected predator diets and diet overlap of predators more than abundance. Age-0 gizzard shad were not important as prey until they grew larger than 25 mm total length, even though larval densities were much higher. They were the most common prey for most predators during June through October and diet overlap among predators was usually highest during that period. Lengths of age-0 gizzard shad ingested by predators resembled those available in the reservoirs throughout much of the season except in early summer, when predators ingested larger-than-average individuals, and in the fall, when smaller predators ingested smaller-than-average individuals. Among years, variations in summer production (kg/ha) and mean weight (g) of age-0 gizzard shad were significantly correlated with their importance in most predator diets and with diet overlap among predator species in Stockton Lake but not in Pomme de Terre Lake, possibly because age-0 gizzard shad were always abundant in Pomme de Terre Lake and annual variation in gizzard shad variables was less in Pomme de Terre than in Stockton Lake. One or both of these gizzard shad variables were usually significant in regression models explaining variation in growth increments of predators. When significant, production of age-0 gizzard shad was positively related to the species' importance in predator diets, to diet overlap among predators, and to predator growth, but mean weight of age-0 gizzard shad was negatively related to those variables. Because mean weight and mean density of age-0 gizzard shad were strongly negatively correlated, predators may have been responding more strongly to prey density than to prey size. Size of age-0 gizzard shad appeared to most strongly influence growth of smaller predators, whereas age-0 gizzard shad production most strongly influenced growth of larger predators. I conclude that changes in age-0 gizzard shad abundance and size can significantly influence predator diets, diet overlap among predators, and predator growth.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				JAN	1997	126	1					101	111		10.1577/1548-8659(1997)126<0101:IOAASO>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1997)126<0101:IOAASO>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1997WK86900008

Data from monthly monitoring of pelagic whitefish (Coregonus wartmanni Bloch, 1784) were used to compare weight-at-age and abundance of pelagic whitefish for years before (1997-2012) and after the invasion (2013-2015). Growth and abundance of pelagic whitefish is shown to be heavily influenced by stickleback presence. Mean autumn weight-at-age of whitefish decreased by 33.3% after the invasion took place and a significant decline in autumn CPUE in otherwise unfished cohorts of the population was also recorded. The results imply direct effects of stickleback presence on pelagic whitefish, including interspecific competition for food leading to reduced growth and survival, and predation of eggs and larvae, hampering recruitment. These observations coincide with a sharp decline in whitefish yield. In conclusion, this study shows that the invasion of stickleback has substantially altered the pelagic fish community of ULC, with severe consequences for commercial fisheries.

Isotherms were then obtained after synchronization of these measured data. The results show that the heat island center of Chongqing in summer primarily locates in the streets, railway stations, overpasses and commercial districts, both in daytime and nighttime. The urban heat island intensity in July in the daytime and nighttime of ordinary summer are about 2.0 similar to 3.4 degrees C and 1.5 similar to 2.8 degrees C, respectively. The water body and lakes in the city has an unapparent effect on lowering the temperature in the daytime, however, it aggravates the heat island effect at night as the water body and lakes release the heat stored during the daytime.					jun, lu/ISS-3806-2023	Wang, Zhihao/0000-0002-4176-1397; Lu, Jun/0000-0001-6085-0902															978-962-85138-0-2				2011							588	593																WOS:000394721200094

It covers an area of 1,700 ha with an atypical orientation that has been formed tectonically. In order to identify the main factors influencing the bacterial profile at the Etoliko basin, 48 samples were collected, representing seasonal variation at four sampling stations. Physico-chemical analysis of the samples indicates the presence of three layers in the Etoliko basin: (1) low-density surface layer, (2) a layer with a steep density gradient, and (3) dense water below a depth of 20 m. A permanent halocline, whose thickness is varying seasonally, has been identified in the Etoliko basin water column, while the spatiotemporal salinity distribution was highly affected by the basin's interaction with the nearby Messolonghi lagoon. The anoxic zone extends from 20 m below the surface to the bottom of the Etoliko basin in summer, while the bottom layer was hypoxic during winter. Bacterial populations were analyzed by Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (ARISA). Bacterial richness and diversity were calculated and compared across samples. Hierarchical analysis showed that ARISA clustered the surface water samples according to seasonal variation, while sediment and near-to-bottom water samples appear to be stable and to cluster together. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) indicates that bacterial composition depends on dissolved oxygen and salinity. Increase in salinity of the ecosystem leads to a significant reduction of the microbial diversity.

In this study, we analyzed the stable carbon isotopes of pyrogenic carbon (delta C-13(PC)) in a 556-cm long sediment core retrieved from Lake Chenghai in the Yunnan Plateau, China. The results provide a continuous 7660-year precipitation record of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM). They indicate that from similar to 7600 cal yr BP precipitation in the Lake Chenghai catchment gradually increased until 5030 cal yr BP, and then subsequently decreased in the second half of the Holocene. In addition, at least six centennial-scale droughts occurred at about 7300, 6300, 5500, 3400, 2500 and 500 cal yr BP. Our findings suggest that ISM intensity is primary controlled by variations in solar irradiance on a centennial time scale. This external forcing may be amplified by North Atlantic cooling events and El Nino-Southern Oscillation activity in the eastern tropical Pacific, which shift the intertropical convergence zone further southwards.

J	Nagashima, K; Tada, R; Toyoda, S				Nagashima, Kana; Tada, Ryuji; Toyoda, Shin			Westerly jet-East Asian summer monsoon connection during the Holocene	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS												The causes of spatial and temporal changes in East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) precipitation on millennial to multimillennial time scales during the Holocene have not yet been resolved. Here, we examine the relationship between spatial variations in EASM precipitation and the westerly jet (WJ) path over East Asia during the Holocene using the provenance of eolian dust in Japan Sea sediments, which we interpret to reflect changes of the WJ path over East Asia and/or surface conditions of desert areas. The contribution of dust from the Mongolian Gobi Desert relative to that from the Taklimakan Desert shows millennial-scale to multimillennial-scale minima at 11.5-10, 7-5, and 3.5-1.5 kyr B.P., which we attribute to earlier seasonal northward progression of the WJ. These dates correlate with precipitation maxima along the present northwestern EASM margin and minima in eastern Northeast China and the Yangtze River Basin, suggesting that the WJ shifted northward earlier in the year, allowing earlier northward migration of the EASM rainband and generating abundant precipitation in the northwestern EASM margin. Therefore, during the Holocene, changes of the WJ path probably contributed to the millennial-scale to multimillennial-scale EASM precipitation changes and its northwest-southeast contrast within China. Our findings suggest that WJ path changes are critical to understand the dynamics of EASM in the past, present, and future.

Remote sensing introduces new technologies for effective, accurate and more efficient water quality measurements. This paper utilizes MERIS and in-situ data to assess the water quality on Lake Simcoe, Canada, by specifically looking at Secchi Disk depth. A Linear Mixed Effect model was used as the regression method. There was a significant positive correlation between measured and predicted Log(10)(SDD) (R-2=0.78). Quality of water in Lake Simcoe has significantly deteriorated over the course of the past decade, with severe environmental and social impacts. Temporally, the highest and lowest average values for SDD were found in summer (1.13 m - 20.03 m) and fall (0.78 m - 28.67 m). Spatially, the SDD average value in the time period of study (2002-2011) was high in the northern east region, and low in the southern part (0.94 m- 21.64 m).					; Duguay, Claude/G-5682-2011	Zolfaghari, Kiana/0000-0002-4392-7143; Duguay, Claude/0000-0002-1044-5850; 													2153-6996		978-1-4799-5775-0				2014							3882	3885		10.1109/IGARSS.2014.6947332	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2014.6947332													WOS:000349688105113

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ECOLOGICAL STATUS ASSESSMENT OF LAKE BALATON (LARGEST SHALLOW LAKE OF CENTRAL EUROPE), BASED ON BENTHIC DIATOM COMMUNITIES	VIE ET MILIEU-LIFE AND ENVIRONMENT												Diatom communities of Lake Balaton, the largest shallow lake of Central Europe, were studied between 2006 and 2008, with the purpose of establishing an initial database for a monitoring system for the lake in accordance with the EU Water Framework Directives. Four basins of the lake were investigated at several sampling sites; diatoms were sampled from four different substrates (reed, stone, sediment, and artificial substrates) in summer and in autumn. The goals of the investigation were to choose sampling sites, to select the most suitable substrate, and to identify an adequate index for monitoring studies of Lake Balaton in the future. 101 samples were collected and 289 diatom species were identified. The most abundant species were Achnanthidium minutissimum, Amphora pediculus, Cymbella exigua, Encyonopsis minuta, Staurosira grigorszkyi, Navicula cryptotenella and Nitzschia dissipata. Data sets were analyzed with multivariate statistical methods. Cluster analysis, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Self Organizing Map method indicated a clear separation between the northern and southern shore of the lake. Taking diatom samples at several sites from each shore of the lake is suggested in the future. It was shown that reed is the most suitable substrate for studying diatoms of Lake Balaton. Our results have indicated that artificial substrate is an adequate alternative, since its epiphytic diatom biota is quite similar to reed. The water quality of the lake was generally good. The Keszthely basin is the most impacted area of the lake (caused by the nutrient load of River Zala), where diatoms indicate a moderate water quality. Using IBD along with TDIL seems to be the best method of assessing the water quality of Lake Balaton.

Low-Frequency Atmospheric Variability Patterns and Synoptic Types Linked to Large Floods in the Lower Ebro River Basin	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												This study analyzes the atmospheric variability that caused the largest floods affecting the town of Tortosa, Spain, in the mouth of the Ebro River (northeast Iberian Peninsula). The Tortosa flood database and flood marks in the nearby town of Xerta are used to define the more relevant flooding episodes (discharges.2900 m(3) s(-1)) of the 1600-2005 period. We explore the atmospheric variability based on low-frequency patterns and synoptic types applying a multivariable analysis to grids at sea level pressure and geopotential at 500 hPa provided by the twentieth-century V3 Reanalysis Project for the instrumental period (since 1836). Output from the Last Millennium Ensemble Project was used to analyze the sea level pressure over the pre-instrumental period (before 1836). Our analysis includes 33 flood episodes. Four synoptic types are related to floods in Tortosa since 1836, characterized by low pressure systems that interact with the Mediterranean warm air mass and promote atmospheric destabilization. Flooding in Tortosa is related to relative high values of solar activity, positive Northern Hemisphere temperature anomalies, and NAO in positive phase. This result indicates that the major floods are related to zonal atmospheric circulations (west-to-east cyclone transfer). During winter, the main impact of the floods is located at the western part of the basin, and the Pyrenean subbasins are affected during autumn. The major finding is that similar flood behavior is detected since 1600, improving our understanding of past climates, enhancing the knowledge base for some aspects and impacts of climate change, and reducing uncertainty about future outcomes.

Seven Dactylogyrus species were recorded which differed widely in their susceptibility to the effluent. The experiment coincided with a natural spring peak in dactylogyrid infections on roach. BMKE exposure did not prevent parasite reproduction but post-larval abundance was significantly higher on control than effluent-exposed hosts. There was no evidence of a BKME-induced shift in microhabitat distribution of dactylogyrids. Elevated levels of infection with Dactylogyrus spp, have been recorded on roach from a Finnish lake containing relatively low concentrations of BMKE. The high exposure concentration in this experiment produced a similar reduction in dactylogyrid infections to that reported in separate studies in close proximity to Swedish pulp and paper mills. The discrepancy between the results of the Finnish and Swedish field investigations is therefore considered to be due to differences in BE;ME concentration between the study areas.

In this study, spatiotemporal distributions of PAHs and BC, and the correlations between BC and PAHs were investigated in the intertidal sediments of China coastal zones. BC in sediments was measured through dichromate oxidation (BCCr) and thermal oxidation (BCCTO). The concentrations of BCCr in the intertidal sediments ranged between 0.61 and 6.32 mg g(-1), while BCCTO ranged between 0.57 and 4.76 mg g(-1). Spatial variations of delta C-13 signatures in TOC and BC were observed, varying from -21.13% to -24.87% and from -23.53% to -16.78%, respectively. PAH contents of sediments ranged from 195.9 to 4610.2 ng g(-1) in winter and 98.2 to 2796.5 ng g(-1) in summer, and significantly seasonal variations were observed at most sampling sites. However, the results of potential toxicity assessment indicated low ecological risk in the intertidal sediments of China coastal zones. Greater concentrations of PAHs measured in the sediments of estuarine environments indicated that rivers runoff may have been responsible for the higher PAH pollution levels in the intertidal sediments of China coastal zones. Pearson's correlation analysis suggested that pyrogenic compounds of PAH were significantly related to BC, due to that both BC and these compounds derived mainly from the combustion process of fossil fuels and biomass. Overall, increasing energy consumptions caused by anthropogenic activities can contribute more emissions of BC as well as PAHs and thus improve the importance of BC in indicating pyrogenic compounds of PAHs in the intertidal sediments of China coastal zones.

Parasite rearing and infection temperatures jointly influence disease transmission and shape seasonality of epidemics	ECOLOGY												Seasonal epidemics erupt commonly in nature and are driven by numerous mechanisms. Here, we suggest a new mechanism that could determine the size and timing of seasonal epidemics: rearing environment changes the performance of parasites. This mechanism arises when the environmental conditions in which a parasite is produced impact its performance independently from the current environment. To illustrate the potential for "rearing effects", we show how temperature influences infection risk (transmission rate) in a Daphnia-fungus disease system through both parasite rearing temperature and infection temperature. During autumnal epidemics, zooplankton hosts contact (eat) fungal parasites (spores) reared in a gradually cooling environment. To delineate the effect of rearing temperature from temperature at exposure and infection, we used lab experiments to parameterize a mechanistic model of transmission rate. We also evaluated the rearing effect using spores collected from epidemics in cooling lakes. We found that fungal spores were more infectious when reared at warmer temperatures (in the lab and in two of three lakes). Additionally, the exposure (foraging) rate of hosts increased with warmer infection temperatures. Thus, both mechanisms cause transmission rate to drop as temperature decreases over the autumnal epidemic season (from summer to winter). Simulations show how these temperature-driven changes in transmission rate can induce waning of epidemics as lakes cool. Furthermore, via thermally dependent transmission, variation in environmental cooling patterns can alter the size and shape of epidemics. Thus, the thermal environment drives seasonal epidemics through effects on hosts (exposure rate) and the infectivity of parasites (a rearing effect). Presently, the generality of parasite rearing effects remains unknown. Our results suggest that they may provide an important but underappreciated mechanism linking temperature to the seasonality of epidemics.					; Duffy, Meghan/AFN-5376-2022; Walsman, Jason/AAG-8597-2021; Shocket, Marta/ACV-5058-2022	Duffy, Meghan/0000-0002-8142-0802; Shocket, Marta/0000-0002-8995-4446; Strauss, Alexander/0000-0003-0633-8443													0012-9658	1939-9170				SEP	2018	99	9					1975	1987		10.1002/ecy.2430	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.2430								29920661					WOS:000443558200007
J	Paul, L				Paul, L			Nutrient elimination in pre-dams: results of long term studies	HYDROBIOLOGIA					4th International Conference on Reservoir Limnology and Water Quality	AUG, 2002	CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZECH REPUBLIC					The results of inflow-outflow investigations carried out at the pre-dams of Saidenbach Reservoir (southeast Germany) show that the nutrient elimination in pre-dams is largely controlled by biological processes, mainly by the phytoplankton growth, and strongly depends on the retention time. Average SRP-elimination rates of up to 80% in summer and 60% in the whole year were observed in a pre-dam of 'optimum size', which confirms the theory well. However, the mean total P reduction was much lower and did not even exceed 25% in the largest pre-dam in summer, since settling of particulate P (fine disperse suspended matter, phytoplankton) was restricted by the short retention time. The highest average summer nitrate elimination rate of 16% was found in a very shallow pre-dam and was mainly the result of extremely high denitrification at the sediment. Dissolved Si removal was low as well and reached average summer rates of up to 15%. In was correlated to the SRP-elimination in two basins. Fast siltation reduced the retention time and nutrient elimination capacity of the pre-dams. Thus, sediments have to be removed regularly from pre-dams.																			0018-8158					SEP 1	2003	504	1-3					289	295		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008528.34920.b2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008528.34920.b2													WOS:000188316100029

Notwithstanding their widespread diffusion in temperate to subtropical shallow lakes, little effort has been performed so far in extensively mapping macrophyte communities at regional to continental scale. A rule-based classification scheme was implemented for mapping four macrophyte community types (helophyte, emergent rhizophyte, floating, and submerged-floating association). Input features were selected among multi-spectral reflectance and multi-temporal vegetation indices, based on Landsat data acquired over four test sites: Lake Taihu (China), Kis-Balaton wetland (Hungary), Lake Trasimeno and Mantua Lakes system (Italy). The best performing features were derived from Water Adjusted Vegetation Index (WAVI) computed at: early spring, maximum growth, and late autumn conditions. Overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient (k) of macrophyte maps produced with our approach over the ensemble of four sites were 90.1% and 0.865, respectively, with best performance in European temperate areas (OA = 93.6-94.2%, k = 0.887-0.916), and lower scores for subtropical Lake Taihu (OA = 82.8%, k = 0.762). Per-class accuracies were higher than 80% for all target classes, except for the submerged-floating association, with misclassifications concentrated in Taihu site. The robustness of the approach was tested over two independent validation cases: a different site (i.e. Lake Varese, Italy), and a different input dataset (i.e. AVNIR-2 data, for Mantua Lakes system). Consistent accuracy results were achieved: OA = 94.3% (k = 0.922) and OA = 85.6% (k = 0.766), with some misclassification due to spatial resolution of AVNIR-2 data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

J	Glamuzina, L; Dobroslavic, T				Glamuzina, Luka; Dobroslavic, Tatjana			Summer Fish Migrations in the River Neretva (South-Eastern Adriatic Coast, Croatia) as a Consequence of Salinization	NASE MORE												River Neretva Estuary, located in the middle South-Eastern Adriatic coast, is a very important traditional fishery ground and biodiversity-rich ichthyologic area. Historically, the estuary situated in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina was composed of wetlands, lakes, and lagoons, but in the 20th century, it was changed into a large agriculture area, settlements and port facilities. The major flow was channelled with large banks to prevent floods. All these activities enabled significant intrusion of seawater 20 km into the inland area. This led to the marinization of major flow freshwater ecosystems. This article presents data on summer fish migrations along with the major flow of River Neretva, during the May-September period. The temperature and salinity showed that seawater started to enter inland major flow from middle May up to the end of September. In total, the 1,429 fish individuals were caught. The numerically dominant species were Atherina boyeri (23.58%), Sardina pilchardus (21.62%), Sparus aurata (11.20%), Chelon ramada (8.19%) and Solea solea (7.63%). Dominant species in the total mass were: Chelonramada(43.45%), Solea solea (14.27%), Sparus aurata (10.14%), Chelon aurata (7.66%) and Anguilla anguilla (3.75%). The major result of this study points to the fact that major Neretva flow of 20 km in length from the river mouth is under seasonal summer impact of seawater, which leads to salinization and complete marinization of this ecosystem during the warm period of the year. The marinization of the large Neretva flow area creates new nursery and feeding grounds for marine estuarine opportunist fish species, such as small pelagics European pilchard and anchovy, and also enlarge these grounds for the marine estuarine dependent species, such as grey mullets, sea breams, and flatfishes.

The life history characteristics, growth and density of Mysis diluviana in Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho, USA	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Application of management plans for lakes and fisheries, such as the addition of nutrients to increase lake productivity or the removal of non-natives, requires that we understand the biology and ecology of the biota present in those ecosystems. To understand the biology of a non-native freshwater shrimp, Mysis diluviana, and provide information for management of it in Lake Pend Oreille, a large (382 km(2)) and deep (351 m max depth) lake in northern Idaho, USA, we determined its life history characteristics, estimated growth rates, quantified seasonal density and calculated its production at two widely separated sites. M. diluviana required 2 years to reach maturity; reproduction took place from September to October, and young were released between May and June. However, some gravid females and newly released young were observed year-round. Growth rates were higher in summer (0.037 +/- 0.004 mm/day) compared to winter (0.023 +/- 0.003 mm/day). Density varied from 56 to 2471 individuals/m(2), while production ranged between 2.18 and 3.12 g dry mass/m(2)/yr. These data can be used by managers of the Lake Pend Oreille ecosystem to optimize management strategies that increase kokanee production such as timing the potential application of nutrients, and/or the removal of mysids. Furthermore, we expand the knowledge of M. diluviana in large and deep lakes outside its native range. (C) 2011 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

OCHRONA SRODOWISKA												The results of analyses show that Lake Goczalkowicikie (impounding reservoir) has been contaminated with heavy metal ions. In the case of lead and zinc, and temporarily also in the case of copper, their concentrations are many times as high as the relevant geochemical background values. The occurrence of elevated metal concentrations in the water is attributable primarily to the anthropogenic sources located in the drainage area of the lake, such as industrial effluents, agricultural runoffs or fish farming. Exceptions are the concentrations of iron and manganese; their presence in the lake water is due not only to industrial pollution, but also the enrichment of surface waters by pit elution and contact with the artesian water that feeds the impounding reservoir. Analysis of the variations in the average annual metal ion content in Lake Goczalkowickie over the period of 1994-2007 has revealed an upward trend for iron and manganese, and seasonal variations in manganese ion content, which were the smallest in winter and the greatest in summer. The changes in the quantity of manganese ions can be linked with the changes in the oxygenation of the lake water (negative correlation). An average correlation was established between iron ions and manganese ions in the water. The results of calculations have made it clear that no statistically significant trends can be assigned to the average annual concentrations of copper, lead or zinc. As for the copper content, a temporary rise was observed in the early 1990s, after the reservoir had been treated with copper sulfate for algal control.

J	PATERSON, RA				PATERSON, RA			INFESTATION OF CHYTRIDIACEOUS FUNGI ON PHYTOPLANKTON IN RELATION TO CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS	ECOLOGY												The relationships between the chytridiaceous parasite Rhizosiphon anabaenae its algal host Anabaena planktonica, and certain physical-chemical factors were studied in Frains Lake, Michigan, from June, 1955, to June, 1956 An investigation of the saprophytism of Ceratium hirundinella theca by Amphicypellus elegans in relation to physical-chemical factors was also conducted. The percentage of parasitism of Anabaena planktonica by Rhizosiphon anabaenae occurred in 2 maxima which took place during the decline of the Anabaena spring and autumn blooms. The decline in Anabaena cells is probably caused by environmental factors, not by parasitism. The senility of the declining population is more likely to permit parasitism than for the parasite to initiate or hasten the decline of the algal population. Oxygen may be a limiting factor for parasitism; the parasite appears to require an optimum dissolved oxygen concentration between 6.4 to 8.0 parts per million. The pH during the time of parasitism ranged from 8.59 to 8.67 indicating that an optimum pH exists. A decrease in carbonate alkalinity and an increase in carbon dioxide occurred during the Rhizosiphon maxima. There was no correlation between saprophyte, host, pH, or alkalinity. The temperature range at the time of saprophytism was 19[degree] C to 21.5[degree]C. Oxygen is not a limiting factor in the saprophytism of Ceratia theca, however, a lowering of the dissolved oxygen during each saprophyte maxima may have influenced the increase in number of saprophytes.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1960	41	3					416	424		10.2307/1933316	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1933316													WOS:A1960WR63800002

Radiation hazards and extremophiles bioaccumulation of radionuclides from hypersaline lakes and hot springs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Radioactivity measurements for water, sediment, microbial films and the bioaccumulation of radionuclides by extremophiles from hypersaline lakes and hot springs were carried out as scarcity studies in the Siwa Oasis, Egypt. Natural and man-made radionuclides were measured using high-resolution & gamma;-spectrometry. Different radionuclides behaved differently in different environmental samples, while radionuclides were higher in microbial films compared to sediment, but all radionuclide levels except Ra-226 in water were generally low. Microbial films from hypersaline lakes had higher concentrations of K-40, while microbial films from freshwater hot springs had the highest concentrations of Ra-226, Th-232 and Cs-137. The calculated radiological hazard index parameters of radium equivalent activity (Ra-eq), absorbed dose rate (D), annual effective dose (AED) and external hazard (H-ex) in the sediment were within acceptable limits, but were higher in the microbial film samples. Otherwise, the potential cancer risk of the three freshwater springs was 0.00244 & PLUSMN; 0.000293, 0.00135.6 & PLUSMN; 0.000172 and 0.00155.2 & PLUSMN; 0.000198. In addition, the bioaccumulation factor for microbial films indicated that they are good accumulators of radionuclides, especially for Ra-226 and Th-232, which may contribute to their effectiveness in removing radionuclides from ecosystems.					; Imam, Noha/AAC-4161-2022	imam, noha/0000-0001-5807-7009; 													1735-1472	1735-2630				FEB	2024	21	3					3021	3036		10.1007/s13762-023-05154-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-023-05154-7		AUG 2023											WOS:001050723800001

Dynamics of sediment disturbance by periodic artificial discharges from the world's largest tidal power plant	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												To investigate the dynamics of sediment disturbance near the world's largest Sihwa tidal power plant (TPP), two mooring observations have been conducted. The mooring results show that current velocity and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) were significantly disturbed over various time scales. On the short-term (flood ebb) time scale, resuspension of bottom sediment is mainly controlled by the strong jet-flow (>2 m s(-1)) and resulting anticlockwise rotating vortex associated with the artificial discharge. During ebb phase, the strong flow resulted in suspension of high-concentration near-bed sediment and seaward transport of the suspended sediment. After turning to flood phase, the vortex produced secondary SSC peaks, transporting the suspended sediment toward the Sihwa TPP. The most active suspension of bed sediment predominantly occurred during 1-2 h immediately after the start of artificial discharge. For the fortnightly (spring neap) time scale, SSC during spring tide was approximately 2-5 times higher than that during neap tide. During the combined period of ebb and spring tides, in particular, the periodic artificial discharge can enhance the responses of SSC in the vicinity of Sihwa TPP. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Seasonal mean values based on a single summer misclassified 15-17% of Missouri reservoirs with respect to the status of their long-term averages (8 or more seasons). Given this level of temporal variation, numeric criteria determined from average conditions in reference lakes should be applied only to long-term averages in target lakes.

Heat fluxes from sediments and heat fluxes from water to ice are determined from temperature profiles. The contribution of solar radiation is estimated from heat-budget calculations. It is found that the heat content of most of the lakes changes very little when they are ice covered, but that the lake-water temperature slightly increases. All heat fluxes are small. The heat flux from the sediments is the highest flux in early winter, but is later in the winter balanced by the heat loss from the water to the underside of the ice. Solar radiation is an important heat source in late winter, when the snow cover is thin.																			0029-1277						1996	27	1-2					39	56																WOS:A1996UD62800003

Lough Corrib and Lough Mask, Western Ireland, have recorded the majority of Irish specimen ferox trout since angling records began. Little was known regarding the spawning location of ferox trout relative to sympatric brown trout, and a radio telemetry study was initiated in both catchments in 2005. Over the period 2005-2009, 79 ferox were captured by angling and radio tagged in Lough Corrib, while 55 ferox were tagged in Lough Mask. Manual and helicopter tracking were carried out on all spawning streams entering both lakes over the autumn/winter period to detect tagged fish. Overall, 37 radio-tagged trout (46.8%) were detected in Lough Corrib streams and 21 tagged trout (38.2%) were recorded from Lough Mask streams. Results from radio tracking indicate that the majority (92%) of ferox trout tagged in Lough Corrib spawned in a single spawning stream, the Cong river, while the majority (76%) of ferox trout tagged in Lough Mask spawned in the Cong canal and Cong river. These results suggest that these streams are most likely the principle spawning locations of ferox trout in both lakes. The occurrence of ferox trout predominantly in single spawning rivers in both catchments highlights the vulnerability of the study ferox populations.

Here, we revisit 12 southern Australian plant megafossil sites from the early to middle Eocene to generate temperature, precipitation, and seasonality paleoclimate estimates, net primary productivity (NPP), and vegetation type, based on paleobotanical proxies and compare them to early Eocene global climate models. Temperature reconstructions are uniformly subtropical (mean annual, summer, and winter mean temperatures 19-21 degrees C, 25-27 degrees C, and 14-16 degrees C, respectively), indicating that southern Australia was similar to 5 degrees C warmer than today, despite a >20 degrees poleward shift from its modern geographic location. Precipitation was less homogeneous than temperature, with mean annual precipitation of similar to 60 cm over inland sites and >100 cm over coastal sites. Precipitation may have been seasonal with the driest month receiving 2-7x less than the mean monthly precipitation. Proxy-model comparison is favorable with a 1,680 ppm CO2 concentration. However, individual proxy reconstructions can disagree with models as well as with each other. In particular, seasonality reconstructions have systemic offsets. NPP estimates were higher than modern, implying a more homogenously "green" southern Australia in the early to middle Eocene when this part of Australia was at 48-64 degrees S and larger carbon fluxes to and from the Australian biosphere. The most similar modern vegetation type is modern-day eastern Australian subtropical forest, although the distance from coast and latitude may have led to vegetation heterogeneity.

Bromine species fluxes from Lake Constance's catchment, and a preliminary lake mass balance	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Bromine was historically termed a cyclic salt in terrestrial freshwater environments due to its perceived conservative cycling between the oceans and the continents. This basic assumption has been challenged recently, with evidence that bromine is involved in dynamic chemical cycles in soils and freshwaters. We present here a study on dissolved bromine species (bromide, organically bound bromine, DOBr) concentrations and fluxes as well as sediment trap bromine levels and fluxes in Lake Constance, a large lake in southern Germany. Water samples were obtained from all major and some minor inflows and outflows over one year, where-after dissolved bromine species were measured by a combination of ICP-MS and ion chromatography coupled to an ICP-MS (IC-ICP-MS). Sediment traps were deployed at two locations for two years with Br, Ti and Zr levels being measured by mu-XRF. 190 t yr(-1) of total dissolved bromine (TDBr) was delivered to the lake via 14 rivers and precipitation, with the rivers Alpenrhein (84 t TDBr yr(-1)) and the Schussen (50 t TDBr yr(-1)) providing the largest sources. The estimated particulate bromine flux contributed an extra 24-26 t Br yr(-1). In comparison, only 40 t TDBr yr(-1) was deposited to the lake's catchment by precipitation, and thus similar to 80% of the riverine TDBr flux came from soils and rocks. Bromide was the dominant species accounting for, on average, 78% of TDBr concentrations and 93% of TDBr flux to the lake. Despite some high concentrations in the smaller lowland rivers, DOBr was only a minor component of the total riverine bromine flux (similar to 12 t yr(-1), 7%), most of which came from the rivers Schussen, Bregenzer Ach and Argen. In contrast, most of the bromine in the sediment traps was bound to organic matter, and showed a clear seasonal pattern in concentrations, with a maximum in winter and minimum in summer. The summer minimum is thought to be due to dilution of a high Br autochthonous component by low bromine mineral and organic material from the catchment, which is supported by Ti, Zr and Br/C(org) data. In the lake bromine was irreversibly lost to the sediments, with best flux estimates based on mass-balance and sediment trap data of + 50-90 mu g Br m(-2) d(-1). Overall, it appears that bromine is not simply a cyclic salt in the case of Lake Constance, with a clear geological component and dynamic lacustrine biogeochemistry. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Jansen, W; Hesslein, RH				Jansen, W; Hesslein, RH			Potential effects of climate warming on fish habitats in temperate zone lakes with special reference to Lake 239 of the experimental lakes area (ELA), north-western Ontario	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												We used simple statistics (e.g. mean temperature, degree days, cumulative volume days) to describe present thermal habitats for cool water ( yellow perch, Perca flavescens) and cold water ( lake trout, Salvelinus namaycush) fish of a small boreal lake. We then modelled changes in the vertical and temporal extent of these habitats under various scenarios of climatic change that included increases in air temperature of 2degreesC, 4degreesC, and 9degreesC, and positive and negative deviations from present levels of 10% in solar radiation and relative humidity, and 20% in wind speed and the lake water extinction coefficient. Model simulations indicated pronounced changes in the temporal and vertical availability of fish thermal niche space. These changes were mainly driven by the large increases in mean mixed layer temperatures that corresponded to similar to 85% of the increases in air temperature, but, in particular, changes in light attenuation also resulted in some non-linear, unexpected effects in the distribution and seasonal availability of thermal niche space. As expected, 'classical' lake trout thermal habitat (5 - 15degreesC) was progressively reduced and almost disappeared in littoral areas in spring and early summer. Perch thermal niche space expanded for air temperature increases of up to 4degreesC, but largely disappeared for the 9degreesC increase. We discuss changes in thermal habitat with regard to the life history of lake trout and yellow perch, and include other determinants of fish habitat to evaluate the potential of these species for long-term ecological success under climatic warming.																			0378-1909					MAY	2004	70	1					1	22		10.1023/B:EBFI.0000023035.06554.c7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:EBFI.0000023035.06554.c7													WOS:000220671900001

The temporal dynamics and spatial distribution of soil microbial communities are central topics in ecology. While numerous studies have focused on wetland microbial community structures at low altitudes, microbial diversity across seasons and depths and their environmental determinants remain poorly understudied. To test the seasonal variation in microbial communities with contrasting seasonal fluxes of greenhouse gases, a total of 36 soil samples were collected from different depths in the Namco wetland on the Tibetan Plateau across four seasons. We found significant seasonal variation in bacterial community composition, most pronounced in the Winter, but not in archaea. In particular, Proteobacteria decreased by 11.5% in Winter compared with other seasons (p < 0.05). The bacterial alpha diversity showed hump-shaped seasonal patterns with lower diversity in Winter, whereas archaea showed no significant patterns across depths. A PERMANOVA further revealed significant differences in the bacterial community structure between Winter and the other three seasons (p < 0.05). In addition, bacterial and archaeal community structures differed between surface (0-5 cm) and deeper (5-30 cm) soils (p < 0.01). Redundancy analysis showed that soil total nitrogen, soil total phosphorus, and total soil organic carbon significantly influenced bacteria and archaea (p < 0.05). Furthermore, soil moisture content and temperature strongly affected the bacterial community structure (p < 0.001). Our findings highlighted the seasonal variation in the microbial community and the profound influence of soil moisture and temperature on microbial structure in alpine wetlands on the Tibetan Plateau.

These populations appeared during spring, reached high concentrations and remained in the metalimnion until winter mixing. We had previously postulated that these metalimnetic populations could persist in such high numbers because they were free of efficient predation, since the oxygen-sulfide interface provided a refuge from predation. In September 1992, an abundant Daphnia pulex population developed in the lake which resulted in drastic changes in the formerly stable community. The presence of D.pulex induced an extreme clear-water phase in the epilimnion and the metalimnetic populations were severely reduced. Feeding experiments with Cryptomonas and heterotrophic and phototrophic bacteria as food for D.pulex resulted in clearance rates around 0.7 ml individual(-1) h(-1). The impact was very high on the microaerophilic populations, whereas the anaerobic populations were least affected, since sulfide limited the vertical distribution of D.pulex. We conclude from this evidence that the metalimnetic populations in previous years were mostly food limited (bottom-up control) and that their high abundances were in great part due to a lack of efficient predation.

Origins of carbon sustaining the growth of whitefish Coregonus lavaretus early larval stages in Lake Annecy: insights from fatty-acid biomarkers	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The hypothesis that diatom carbon (C) produced during the spring peak supported spring zooplankton production and, ultimately, the growth of Coregonus lavaretus early larval stages from March to May 2006 in Lake Annecy, France, was tested using gut content analyses and fatty acid biomarkers. Gut content results showed that C. lavaretus larvae from stages 1 to 4 preferentially fed on copepods with Daphnia sp. only a minor proportion of larval diet. The levels of diatom-marker fatty acids (C16:1n-7 and C20:5n-3) were high in Daphnia sp., but lower in both copepods and C. lavaretus larvae from stages 0 to 4. These results indicated that the spring diatom biomass was actually grazed by Daphnia sp., but, contrary to what was expected, the spring bloom was not the only C source supporting copepods secondary production and, consequently, the growth of C. lavaretus early larval stages. In contrast, levels of terrestrial fatty acid marker (C24:0) were low in Daphnia sp. but high in copepods and C. lavaretus larvae, indicating a significant contribution of terrestrial carbon to copepods and, ultimately, to the growth of C. lavaretus early larval stages.

Belt transects, 20 m by 1.75 m and paralleling depth contours, were run at 6 stations at each meter depth, usually to 6 m. Four species, in order of decreasing abundance, were found in the lake: Anodonta grandis Say, Lampsilis radiata (Gmelin), Amblema plicata (Say) and Lasmigona complanata (Barnes). Eight species are known in the river above the lake and 11 species below the lake. Lake individuals of A. grandis were conspicuously smaller than those in the river; most (82.7%) had about 2 or 3 winter rings, and the largest had about 5. Individuals of L. radiata, however, were of a size about normal for those in the river, the largest individual had about 7 winter rings. Most mussel individuals occurred at 3 m (46.9%) and 2 m (25.0%), fewest (3.1%) occurred at 6 m, and none was found at 5 m. The maximum density was 0.43 individuals/m2 for A. grandis at 3 m. Individuals of A. grandis (collectively from all depths) decreased in numbers down the reservoir toward the dam. The average density (from 2 and 3 m) of A. grandis in the lake (0.27 individuals/m2) was significantly (P = 0.10) greater than that in the river below the lake (0.05 individuals/m2) and about the same as that above the lake (0.32 individuals/m2). The average density of L. radiata in the lake (0.05 individuals/m2) was significantly (P = 0.10) less than that above the lake (0.24 individuals/m2) and about the same as that below the lake (0.07 individuals/m2). Possible causes for fewer mussel species in Lake Ashtabula are alteration of normal mussel reproductive processes and periodic low levels of oxygen content.																			0028-1344						1978	92	1					1	9																WOS:A1978EK17100001
J	de Figueiredo, DR; Pereira, MJ; Correia, A				de Figueiredo, Daniela R.; Pereira, Mario J.; Correia, Antonio			Seasonal modulation of bacterioplankton community at a temperate eutrophic shallow lake	WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY												At the present time, there is still a lack of information about environmental parameters modulating variations on bacterial diversity in temperate lakes, particularly from Portugal. Fermentelos Lake (Central Portugal) is a shallow water body that sustains an important wetland area. The strong nutrient inputs from agriculture and industrial runoffs have led to its current eutrophic status. The present work aimed to understand which factors modulate the seasonal bacterioplankton diversity at this lake using 16S rRNA PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and multivariate analysis. Environmental data demonstrated eutrophic features throughout all samples with nitrate concentrations reaching 12.0 mg N (NO3 (-)) l(-1) in March 2006, while the highest conductivity (609 mu S cm(-1)), soluble reactive phosphorus (0.37 mg l(-1)), total suspended solids (87.2 mg l(-1)) and chlorophyll a (286.6 mu g l(-1)) levels were recorded in August 2007. Over the past two decades there was a general increase in nitrate, pH and conductivity levels at this lake, suggesting the eutrophication process is still in progress. Multivariate analysis showed that summer versus winter DGGE patterns could be established for bacterial assemblages and were mainly defined by water temperature and chlorophyll a. Actinobacteria were dominant throughout the study period although a general preference for higher temperature, pH, total suspended solids, conductivity, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and chlorophyll a levels was observed. The highest concentrations of nitrogen sources were related to Bacteroidetes and phototrophic eukaryote (cryptophycean) dominance. The expansion of Betaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Cyanobacteria phylotypes was generally associated to high temperature, pH, conductivity and SRP values.

J	Harrison, SSC; Hildrew, AG				Harrison, SSC; Hildrew, AG			Distribution dynamics of epilithic insects in a lake littoral	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The freshwater epilithic insect community in the littoral of Crose Mere, a eutrophic lake in the English Midlands, was investigated monthly from February 1993-February 1994. Larvae were collected from patches of stones either shaded by bankside trees or well away from trees and from either shallow water at the edge or from deeper water. The invertebrate community was dominated by gallery-building larvae of the psychomyiid caddis, Tinodes waeneri, and four species of chironomids with tube-dwelling larvae, Cricotopus sylvestris, Microtendipes pedellus, Glyptotendipes pallens and Endochironomus albipennis. The early instars of Tinodes, Cricotopus and Microtendipes showed peaks of density in shaded habitats in spring and summer, suggesting that adults had oviposited beneath trees. Adult Tinodes and chironomids were also found to be associated with trees and other vegetation along the shore, avoiding areas of closely-grazed grass. The subsequent distribution of later larval instars demonstrated that larvae had dispersed to open and deep habitats. Despite the apparently more favourable conditions for gazers in unshaded habitats, adult Tinodes, Cricotopus and Microtendipes did not oviposit in the open. Oviposition behaviour may have evolved in these species that minimises the risk to the gravid female, rather than maximises the survival of larvae.																			0003-9136					OCT	1998	143	3					275	293																WOS:000077260800002

Here we use carbonate delta C-13 and delta O-18, clumped (Delta 47), and C-14 compositions to better understand the carbonate isotope system in closed-basin lakes and trace the paleohydrologic and temperature evolution in the Chewaucan closed-basin lake system, northern Great Basin, USA, over the Last Glacial/Holocene transition. We focus on shorezone tufas to establish that they form in isotopic equilibrium with lake water and DIC, they can be dated reliably using C-14, and their clumped isotope composition can be used to reconstruct past lake temperature. Calculations of the DIC budget and reservoir age for the lake indicate residence time is short, and dominated by exchange with atmospheric CO2 at all past lake levels. Modern lake DIC and shorezone tufas yield delta C-13 and C-14 values consistent with isotopic equilibrium with recent fossil fuel and bomb-influenced atmospheric CO2, supporting these calculations. delta C-13 values of fossil tufas are also consistent with isotopic equilibrium with pre-industrial atmospheric CO2 at all shoreline elevations. This indicates that the C-14 reservoir effect for this material is negligible. Clumped isotope (Delta 47) results indicate shorezone tufas record mean annual lake temperature. Modern (average 13 +/- 2 degrees C) and 18 ka BP-age tufas (average 6 +/- 2 degrees C) have significantly different temperatures consistent with mean annual temperature lowering of 7 +/- 3 degrees C (1 SE) under full glacial conditions. For shorezone tufas and other lake carbonates, including spring mounds, mollusk shells, and ostracod tests, overall delta C-13 and delta O-18 values co-vary according to the relative contribution of spring and lacustrine end member DIC and water compositions in the drainage system, but specific isotope values depend strongly upon sample context and are not well correlated with past lake depth. This contrasts with the interpretation that carbonate isotopes in closed-basin lake systems reflect changes in DIC and water budgets connected to higher or lower lake volumes. Instead, a small overlapping range of isotope compositions characterize multiple lake levels, so that none can be identified uniquely by isotope composition alone. Relative to other lake carbonates, delta C-13 and delta O-18 values for ostracods in Ana River Canyon deposits are very strongly influenced by Ana River water, suggesting low lake level and volume characterized Summer Lake for most of the past 100,000 years. Coupled with sedimentologic observations, the Ana River deposits thus suggest dry conditions like today are close to the mean climate state in the northern Great Basin. By contrast, basin-integrating highstands such as that dating to similar to 14 ka BP, during the last glacial termination, are hydrologically unique and short-lived. Overall, our results indicate carbonate isotope records must account for the specific geochemical and hydrologic characteristics of lake system in order to provide robust paleoenvironmental reconstructions.

J	SORRIE, BA				SORRIE, BA			COASTAL-PLAIN PONDS IN NEW-ENGLAND	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												New England's coastal plain ponds occupy areas of glacially deposited outwash, till, or former glacial lake beds. Generally, these ponds lie in gently sloping basins with no inlet or outlet and are intimately linked with the underlying groundwater or aquifer. Water levels rise and fall naturally with the seasons, depending on rainfall/evaporation cycles. There are hundreds of ponds, distributed in three main areas. New England's coastal plain ponds vary significantly in physical, chemical, and biological characteristics, but are united by several dominant features. (1) With rare exceptions they are permanent bodies of water and do not dry out annually as do southern US ponds. (2) They are highly acidic and nutrient-poor. (3) Their basins are sloping, creating concentric bands of vegetation as waters recede. (4) The dominant emergent, when present, is Juncus militaris, not Panicum hemitomon as in southern US ponds. (5) Dominant plants in the drawdown zone are graminoid and herbaceous species; woody plants are absent. Forty-one Atlantic coastal plain pond plant taxa are considered rare in one or more New England states, the great majority occurring only in southeastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island. One taxon is endemic to the region: Eupatorium leucolepis var. novae-angliae; five others are nearly so. Because they hold water during the summer, New England's coastal plain ponds are attractive to recreation and housing development. During 1970-1990 large-scale impacts resulted from these activities and from recreational vehicle use and water extraction, so that few pristine ponds are left.																			0006-3207						1994	68	3					225	233		10.1016/0006-3207(94)90410-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0006-3207(94)90410-3													WOS:A1994NF94100004

High abundances and negligible grazing during winter by the mixotrophic chrysophyte Dinobryon	FOTTEA												Grazing on bacteria by planktonic organisms is a channel for the biological transfer of organic matter through the aquatic food web. Much attention has been given to the importance of heterotrophic nanoflagellates and ciliates as primary grazers of bacteria. However, the prevalence of phagotrophy by phytoplankton across many environments emphasizes a need to include mixotrophy in studies of the protistan food web. Few studies have addressed the seasonal dynamics nor grazing activity of mixotrophs in freshwater environments, especially those that extend below surface waters. The goal of this work was to examine temporal patterns in mixotroph abundance and taxon-specific bacterivory, with a focus on Dinobryon. Results shown here support our general predictions of increased bacterivory by Dinobryon where a low light and nutrient environment may promote grazing. Dinobryon spp. were numerically dominant members of the community under-ice in winter, possibly as a result of their ability to supplement photosynthesis with phagotrophy of bacteria in conditions of reduced irradiance and day length. However, daily grazing rate and associated impact on the bacterial community during winter were not substantial. These results highlight the importance of including winter sampling when an active community of phagotrophic phytoflagellates may play a major role in ecosystem functioning. Results underscore the importance of including measurements of grazing activity with mixotroph occurrences, as high abundance of Dinobryon did not align with high rates of bacterivory.

Fuji above 2000 m level was clarified. The fallen precipitation is largely absorbed into porous strata of volcanic ejecta of andesite nature and runs down along the old lava flow layers and discharged at about the 1000 m level, loaded with major elements from the rocky material on its passage while trace elements were removed considerably. Fuji Five Lakes water is fed from 2 different areas, the southeastern side of Mt. Fuji where the fallen precipitation is largely absorbed into the ground with no remarkable surface discharge, while the northwestern mountainside consisting of Tertiary impervious rocks where the fallen water is discharged into the lakes as surface-runoff with no remarkable change from meteoric water. Of the total supply to the lakes, about 70-80% is supplied by subsurface discharge of groundwater from the northeastern side.																			0003-9136						1982	94	3					269	285																WOS:A1982PS07100001

Agreement between the stalagmite delta O-18 from Lianhua and other caves from central-southern China indicates that regional climate changes after the Last Glacial were concurrent across mainland China, indicating that insolation was the primary factor controlling the evolution of the Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM). The stalagmite O-18 enrichment of 2.5 parts per thousand in the Younger Dryas and 1.7 parts per thousand. during the 82-ka BP event in Lianhua were larger than those in caves from central and southern China. The evidence suggests that different meridional responses of weak precipitation conditions in the ASM realm occurred during these two abrupt events, driven by high-latitude forcing in the Northern Hemisphere. The heterogeneous hydroclimate sequences in northern China inferred from different natural archives are most likely attributable to the complexity of the formations and/or some chronological uncertainty.

These dynamic habitats provide a novel chance to explore the effects of metacommunity dynamics on community structure in relation to environmental, spatial, and temporal processes. We investigated the spatial distribution of spring zooplankton communities in a large reservoir in southern China. We intensively sampled along a longitudinal gradient during early and full spring. We compared the relationship of environmental and spatial variables to the community structure of three zooplankton groups: rotifers, cladocerans, and copepods. The overall composition and abundance of zooplankton groups across longitudinal zones became more heterogeneous with increasing environmental heterogeneity across sampling periods. Multi-level ANOVA and PERMANOVA results showed that rather than homogenize the environment, water flow in late spring increased spatial heterogeneity in the environment and increased the importance of species sorting in shaping the zooplankton community. However, variation partitioning analysis showed that the influence of environmental and spatial variables also varied across the three zooplankton groups likely due to their differences in both physiological and morphological adaptation. Our study shows that metacommunity processes are important in structuring zooplankton communities in reservoir waterscapes that are influenced by flow.

Radon concentration in groundwater sources of the Baikal region (East Siberia, Russia)	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												In this study, we conduct a systematic study of groundwater radioactivity in the territories around Lake Baikal in Siberia, including Pribaikalie and Transbaikalia. The database includes more than 200 measurements of Rn-222 from monitored water sources in the study region. We classify the groundwater sources in the Baikal region into seven groups (I-VII) that differ in radon concentration in space and time. The spatial distribution of water sources belonging to certain groups depend on geochemical and structural factors. In Transbaikalia, intrusive rocks with elevated contents of uranium are abundant. In Pribaikalie, many water sources are classified into Groups I and II (Q < 100 Bq/L). Group I includes groundwater with background concentrations, and Group II includes groundwater with anomalous concentrations of radon. Water sources belonging to elevated radon concentration Groups III to VI are considered as anomalies. Faulting is one of the main causes of radon anomalies as groundwater in the fault zones is enriched with Rn-222 due to the increased permeability of rocks and rock crushing resulting from displacements of the fault walls. Monitoring of water sources in Pribaikalie shows that Rn-222 concentrations vary also in time mainly within the range of values corresponding to a particular group. The oscillatory pattern of the temporal variations is clearly revealed by radon measurements conducted every two weeks and depends mainly on meteorological factors. Seasonal variations in air temperature and atmospheric pressure lead to changes in groundwater temperature, dilution of groundwater due to precipitation, freezing the top layer of soil, and other phenomena. As a result, the concentration regularly increases in winter and decreases in summer. In this study, seismic activity has not been revealed as significant factor of impact on the concentration of radon in groundwater, since strong earthquakes did not occur during the monitoring period.

Over the whole 90-year period we found generally a strong correlation between spring/summer precipitation and annual varve thickness. However, there are clear indications that precipitation during the months of January and March-May was more important for the formation of varves in the early part of the twentieth century, while January, March, April and June seem to have been more significant during the later part of the nineteenth century. Monthly temperatures and annual varve thickness, on the other hand, did not show any significant correlations over the whole 90-year period, but, when split into 30-year periods, a dependence of varve thickness on October (1862-90) and March (1919-50) temperatures could be observed. Our results show that it is important to test each specific varve record against instrumental data sets before any conclusions can be drawn in terms of precipitation and/or temperature dependence. They also emphasize the necessity to correlate varve-thickness records against long instrumental series in order to detect any changing forcing mechanisms.

Common in residential communities across the region, such ponds may be routinely visited by humans, domestic and wild animals, and often contain a variety of aquatic life. To begin examining correlations between environmental factors and mat characteristics, we investigated the temporal heterogeneity of these networks with regards to presence of potentially toxic cyanobacteria, associated toxins, and other putative cyanobacterial compounds throughout the fall at several sites within the networks. Multiple toxin classes were detected in whole water and passive SPATT samples using targeted analysis including levels of cylindrospermopsin that exceeded national recreational guidelines. Nontargeted analysis also revealed a collection of potential cyanobacteria-associated compounds. Our results suggest that the benthic proliferations may be, at least in part, correlated with the intended functions of the stormwater treatment networks, which are nutrient and sediment removal. Furthermore, these retention ponds may serve as an episodic source of cyanotoxins to estuarine waters.

Last interglacial plant macrofossils and climates from Ziegler Reservoir, Snowmass Village, Colorado, USA	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Ninety plant macrofossil taxa from the Ziegler Reservoir fossil site near Snowmass Village, Colorado, record environmental changes at high elevation (2705 m asp in the Rocky Mountains during the Last Interglacial Period. Present-day vegetation is aspen forest (Populus tremuloides) intermixed with species of higher (Picea, Abies) and lower (Artemisia, Quercus) elevations. Stratigraphic units 4-13 contain montane forest taxa found near the site today and several species that today generally live at lower elevations within (Abies concolor, Lycopus americanus) and outside Colorado (Najas flexilis). These data suggest near-modern climatic conditions, with slightly warmer summer and winter temperatures. This montane forest period was succeeded by a shorter treeless interval (Unit 14) representing colder and/or drier conditions. In units 15-16, conifer trees reoccur but deciduous and herb taxa are lacking, suggesting a return to warmer conditions, although cooler than during the earlier forest period. Comparison of these inferred paleoclimatic changes with the site's geochronologic framework indicates that the lower interval of sustained warmth correlates with late MIS 6-early 5b (similar to 138-94 ka), the cold interval with MIS 5b (similar to 94-87 ka), and the uppermost cool assemblages with MIS 5a (similar to 87-77 ka).

Results indicate that 75-90% of bioassay response is due to nutrients in the < 0.45-mu m range. Lake Tahoe phytoplankton are primarily P limited, although N colimitation has been observed during summer. Bioassay response did not correlate well with particulate P > 0.45 mu m but was highly correlated with dissolved inorganic P. Dissolved organic P may also be stimulatory to Lake Tahoe phytoplankton. Bioassay response was relatively constant for each treatment during the study, due in part to a consistent diatom dominance of the phytoplankton community. The bioassay technique utilized is not sensitive enough to detect changes in land use along a single stream. Dissolved inorganic P was determined to best represent Lake Tahoe short-term (several days) stream bioavailable P at the present time. Physical bioavailability factors such as lake thermal dynamics and biological factors such as lake microbial dynamics should be addressed in addition to the chemical factors when considering lake biologically available P.																			0706-652X					DEC	1999	56	12					2331	2339		10.1139/cjfas-56-12-2331	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-56-12-2331													WOS:000084267600012

Multiple prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms within biofilms interact with each other to shape the community structure and their functional attributes. However, there is no clear understanding of varied patterns of biofilm prokaryotic versus eukaryotic microbial abundances, diversities and communities, which limit our understanding of how biofilm communities and functions in hypereutrophic urban river ecosystems are changing. To elucidate the properties of biofilm communities and controls on biofilm communities in a hypereutrophic urban river, we conducted a one-year study to investigate the seasonal and water-depth variations on the abundance/biomass, diversity and structure of biofilm prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities. The structure and dynamics of biofilm prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities were determined by high-throughput sequencing based on the 16S and 18S rRNA gene. Sequencing revealed that Proteobacteria, Bacteroidota and Cyanobacteria were the three dominant phyla in biofilm prokaryotic communities, and Rotifera, Chlorophyta, Annelida and Bacillariophyta were the four dominant phyla in biofilm eukaryotic communities. Biofilm bacterial abundance depended mainly on the water temperature, whereas biofilm algal biomass correlated with rotifer grazing and light levels. Prokaryotic communities had higher species richness and diversity than eukaryotic communities. Species richness and diversity displayed significant seasonal variations with minima for prokaryotic communities in winter and eukaryotic communities in summer, which were linked to water temperature and rotifer grazing, respectively. Variations in biofilm prokaryotic and eukaryotic community composition were mainly related to ammonia concentration and water temperature, respectively. The co-occurrence network analysis suggested that rotifer grazing could considerably decrease the complexity of the biofilm network in summer, and the algal groups, especially for Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta, were the key to the formation of stable biofilm networks. There were significant differences in seasonal and water-depth heterogeneity of biofilm prokaryotic and eukaryotic community composition. Our findings indicate that variations in water temperature, light level, rotifer grazing and nutrients (especially ammonia) appreciably contribute to changes in the abundance, diversity and composition of biofilm prokaryotic versus eukaryotic communities in the hypereutrophic urban river. These findings increase our understanding of biofilm community characteristics in hypereutrophic urban rivers and provide insights for water pollution remediation strategies.					yang, xu/HOH-1995-2023; Lv, YiYun/NWH-9875-2025														0046-5070	1365-2427				JAN	2025	70	1								10.1111/fwb.14365	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.14365		DEC 2024											WOS:001369611800001

P. The seasonal change in relative abundance of the dominant diatom taxa, Aulacoseira and Cyclotella species, can be used as a proxy of the strength of winter monsoon winds (WMW), which is supported by the results of a sediment trap experiment in HML and by an extensive review of the literature on the autoecologies of these species. In the sediment, high C. stelligera abundance and high-diatom concentration, which indicate warm conditions and low wind-driven turbulence of the water column, characterize an interval equivalent to the Greenland Interstadial 1. This is followed by an interval with low-diatom concentration and with assemblages dominated by Aulacoseira species, which suggests high wind-driven turbulence and therefore strong WMW. This interval corresponds with the Greenland Stadial 1. During the early and middle Holocene, another two episodes with strong WMW are evident from the data between 10,000 and 8500 and between 7000 and 6000 cal years B. P. The diatom record implies that strong winter monsoon episodes not only occurred during the last glacial-Holocene transition but also during the Holocene "thermal maximum.''

Earlier work identified the earthy/musty compounds geosmin and particularly, 2-methylisoborneol (GM-MIB), and ruled out Lake Ontario as a major source, but did not identify the biological origins. In 2000, we investigated the source(s) and underlying causes. We sampled littoral sites in the SLR near Cornwall, ON, and found that macrophytes (or associated biofilms) may be primary GM sources. Zebra mussel homogenate yielded low GM-MIB levels, but several associated actinomycetes generated high in vitro amounts. Periphyton from rocks showed significant yields, with cell-bound GM-MIB up to one hundred times the levels in overlying water. In 2001, we followed seasonal changes at some of these sites. Periphyton GM-MIB showed intriguing spatial and temporal patterns. Several cyanobacteria in these biofilms were identified as potential odour sources, notably Oscillatoriales. We conclude: i) periphyton is a major odour source in the SLR; ii) other biota such as macrophytes and mussels may also contribute; iii) seasonality in GM-MIB production and ratios indicate changes in cell production and/or taxa in response to environment. These results may account for the recent onset of the problematic odour events, which represent chemical signals of the increased water transparency and littoral surface area following the widespread dreissenid mussel invasion to the Great Lakes. Our data raise key questions about the processes that trigger the tremendous variability in biota and GM-MIB production in the SLR, the subject of our continued research.																			0273-1223	1996-9732					2004	49	9					33	39		10.2166/wst.2004.0527	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2004.0527								15237604					WOS:000222401500006

Connecting the blooms: tracking and establishing the origin of the record-breaking Lake Erie Microcystis bloom of 2011 using DGGE	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Summer blooms of Microcystis now occur every year in Lake Erie with varying concentration, duration, and spatial extent. The recording-breaking bloom of 2011 began in the western corner of the lake during early summer, and reached its peak in late summer covering 2968 km(2). Start and peak blooms were offset by 3 mo and separated by 120 km, raising the question: Is Microcystis transported across the lake or do separate blooms arise from separate source populations? This study addressed this question by measuring the genetic diversity of Microcystis across the lake and throughout the summer. Seven sites separated by about 100 km were sampled monthly during the summer of 2011 for genetic analysis of the Microcystis population. Furthermore, 2 major rivers (Maumee and Sandusky) and lake sediments were sampled and collected prior to bloom formation to investigate source populations. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to generate Microcystis-specific molecular fingerprints of the 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer region. Dendrograms and principal component analysis were used to investigate similarity among samples. Fingerprints of lake water samples were more similar to the sediments than tributaries, indicating the sediments were a more likely bloom source. All lakes samples collected were >50% similar with several universal bands, indicating Microcystis was transported west to east by water currents and that the beginning and peak blooms were not isolated. This information characterizes the origin and movement of this massive and problematic bloom, and can be used to inform management practices aimed at preventing blooms in Lake Erie.

The ecological impacts of eutrophication on zooplankton composition in freshwater lakes have recently gained wide interest. Geographic location and water-body size influence zooplankton diversity in freshwaters; meanwhile, less is known about the composition and dynamic of the zooplankton community and their relationship with the trophic status in artificial water in semi-arid areas. The present study aimed to assess the physical-chemical parameters and to document the seasonal distribution of zooplankton species and their relationship with environmental factors and trophic state in the artificial freshwater lake JUST, in a semi-arid area. The high concentrations of nutrients and the trophic level index (TLI) classified the lake as eutrophic-hypertrophic. The zooplankton in the JUST lake were composed of twenty-six species, with eleven Rotifera, ten Copepoda, and five Cladocera. Copepoda was numerically the most abundant taxon, accounting for 64% of the total zooplankton abundance, in both seasons. However, the second most abundant taxon in summer was Rotifera (28.26%) while in winter it was Cladocera (25.88%). The community structure seemed to be influenced, most likely, by trophic state, phytoplankton abundance, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and nutrient loading. The zooplankton were largely dominated by bioindicator species of high trophic levels. Zooplankton could be used as a tool to monitor the trophic state of the lake. For sustainable development, the introduction of phytoplanktivorous, aquaculture species, such as carp and koi, will strengthen the top-down control of the phytoplankton concentration, leading to a reduced trophic state.					; GUERMAZI, Wassim/KIB-8808-2024; Annabi-Trabelsi, Neila/JVN-2930-2024; BELMONTE, GENUARIO/AAG-4029-2020; AbuDalo, Muna/KHY-7270-2024	AbuDalo, Muna/0000-0002-3800-4715; GUERMAZI, Wassim/0000-0003-4309-744X; Annabi-Trabelsi, Neila/0000-0002-2920-4555; El-khateeb, Mohammad/0000-0002-5201-2287; belmonte, genuario/0000-0002-7473-116X														2073-4441				AUG	2023	15	15							2796	10.3390/w15152796	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15152796													WOS:001046371800001

Monthly sampling (from sediments, stones and aquatic plants in littoral zone of the lake) taken in three consecutive years revealed 57 diatom taxa with Gomphonema and Pinnularia being the most abundant species while other genera are represented with three or fewer species. Lindavia ocellata was the most dominant taxon in the samplings examined throughout the whole study. The values of diversity and evenness indices are high during the spring and early summer. Based on cluster analysis for monthly samples of epipelic diatom, there are two different groups at the lowest similarity level. The associations between August 2010 and September 2010 months are the most significant with 86.02%. The organism number of epipelic diatoms showed positive correlation (P<0.01) with dissolved oxygen, while negative correlation (P<0.05) with temperature. Detailed floristic and ecological examination of the benthic diatom communities has not been carried out before this study in this lake. Therefore, this study is the first to our knowledge towards revealing aquatic benthic diatom biodiversity of Karagol-Sahara National Park and provides basis for future investigations.

J	Plissner, JH; Haig, SM				Plissner, JH; Haig, SM			Status of a broadly distributed endangered species: results and implications of the second International Piping Plover Census	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE												Methods for monitoring progress toward recovery goals are highly variable and may be problematic for endangered species that are mobile and widely distributed. Recovery objectives for Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) include attainment of minimum population sizes within specified recovery units, as determined by two U.S. and two Canadian recovery teams. To assess progress toward these goals, complete surveys of the species' winter and breeding ranges in Canada, the United States, Mexico, the Bahamas, and the Greater Antilles are conducted every 5 years. In 1996, 1200 biologists and volunteers participated in the second International Piping Plover Census, tallying 2515 wintering birds and 5913 adults (2668 breeding pairs) during the breeding census. Winter numbers were 27% lower than those of the first international census conducted in 1991, with substantially fewer wintering birds along the Gulf of Mexico and an overall increase in numbers along the Atlantic Coast. Large numbers of wintering plovers remain undetected. In 1996, the total number of breeding adults was 7.7% higher than in 1991. Regionally, breeding numbers were 31% higher along the Atlantic Coast and 20% higher in the small Great Lakes population, but declined by 5% in the U.S. Great Plains and the Canadian Prairie. Target recovery numbers were met only for Saskatchewan but were approached in Alberta and New England. The results suggest that Piping Plover distribution and habitat use in the U.S. Great Plains/Canadian Prairie region may shift dramatically with water conditions.																			0008-4301					JAN	2000	78	1					128	139		10.1139/cjz-78-1-128	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-78-1-128													WOS:000085686400012
J	Schubert, M; Osenbrück, K; Knöller, K				Schubert, Michael; Osenbrueck, Karsten; Knoeller, Kay			Using stable and radioactive isotopes for the investigation of contaminant metal mobilization in a metal mining district	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY					6th International Symposium on Applied Isotope Geochemistry	NOV 11-16, 2005	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC					Naturally occurring stable and radioactive isotopes were used as environmental tracers to investigate contaminant metal mobilization processes in a metal smelter dump mainly consisting of slag. Water emerging from the dump at a spring is heavily contaminated by metals. The smelter dump contains minor amounts of flue dust, a material which shows a high potential for metal mobilization. Nearby dumps mainly consist of low-grade ore. Concentration patterns of U-238. Ra-226 and Pb-210 determined in sediment deposited close to the contaminated spring reveal the flue dust to be the major local metal source rather than the slag or the low-grade ore. Contamination pathways inside the dump were investigated using hydrological, chemical and isotopic data. Strong negative correlation between water discharge and metal concentration in the spring water suggests, besides short-term dilution of the metal concentration by direct rainwater runoff, distinct long-term dilution of the spring water by groundwater being discharged at a significantly increased rate as a result of heavy rains. delta O-18 and delta D signatures of rain, local groundwater and spring water confirm the importance of groundwater derived from the local aquifer. Another hydrological component with importance for metal mobilization was found to be water that is recharged in the dump itself. Tritium analysis allowed an assessment of the probable residence time of that water component in the smelter dump. Since that water component seems to represent a major local contamination pathway the findings of the study are of substantial importance for site remediation planning. As a primary result it could be stated that covering the dump would not result in any noteworthy short-term improvement of the spring water quality. First significant effects would only be visible after 2-3 decades at the earliest. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The birds were housed under ambient outdoor temperatures to permit normal fluctuations in body weight during the study. Whole body PCB clearance, plasma/fat distribution coefficients, and plasma PCB clearance constants were determined for individual PCBs to calibrate a two-compartment rate constant model in order to describe PCB elimination in the birds. Plasma/fat partition coefficients (K-PF) averaged 0.0060 +/- 0.0001 for all congeners of study, were not dependent on chemical hydrophobicity, and did not change in summer versus winter sacrificed animals. Plasma clearance constants (k(pc)) for PCBs were observed to be dependent on both chlorine substitution patterns and congener hydrophobicity. Polychlorinated biphenyl congeners categorized as readily cleared congeners contained vicinal meta-para hydrogen substituents on at least one phenyl ring, while slowly cleared congeners were chlorine hindered at these positions. A general equation was derived to predict plasma clearance constants for all tri- to octachlorobiphenyls based on the presence of an open meta-para site on one of the phenyl rings and from the n-octanol-water partition coefficient of the chemical. The equation was validated by comparing predicted versus measured relative biomagnification factors of PCBs determined in birds at the end of the dosing period. The two-compartment model calibrated for PCB elimination in American kestrels may be used to describe PCB toxicokinetics in wild birds provided that seasonal fluctuations in the fat content of the modeled population is known.

Effect of prolonged summer on two ox-bow lakes	BIOLOGICAL RHYTHM RESEARCH												Physicochemical as well hydrobiological investigations were made in two large tropical ox-bow lakes at monthly intervals during the period of two annual cycles of which the second one experienced an unusual drought. The monthly mean concentrations of total alkalinity, hardness, chloride, phosphate and nitrate of water were greatly increased during the drought-affected second year compared with the first year. Prolonged summer in the region caused about 5-25-fold increases in chlorophyll a concentration of nanoplankton and net plankton, respectively. Phytoplankton peaks were less developed during the first year, whereas the summer peak was greatly enlarged during the drought affected second year. There was about a twofold rise in the numbers of zooplankton during the second year as compared with the first year. Benthic invertebrates, on the other hand, were reduced in numbers. Fish production was relatively less during the drought affected second year than during the first year.																			0929-1016	1744-4179				JUN	2006	37	3					191	212		10.1080/09291010600688913	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09291010600688913													WOS:000238192900002

How are the chlorides from these two sources distributed between surface and ground waters; how subsequently ends up in Lake Ontario, which tributary Etobicoke Creek is? Can surface water monitoring results be interpreted this way? Is it possible to assess daily dynamics of surface and groundwater chlorides based on the available monitoring database? An attempt to quantitatively estimate daily contamination of direct, inter- and baseflow of a highly urbanized watershed (209 km(2)) was done using the only source of quality data - the monitoring database of Environment Canada (similar to1 sample/month). Average daily load of chloride by Etobicoke Creek into Lake Ontario was 71.9, highest - almost 1500 tons. Shares of the base, inter- and direct flow in the monthly loads fluctuated in 18-64, 23-53 and 2-40% ranges, respectively. The overall year average of chloride loads of the total flow for examined period was 26990 tons breaking into mentioned above components in amounts of 7899, 11252 and 7840 tons, respectively. The result has revealed the predominant contamination of the interflow pathway for Etobicoke Creek.																			1368-1435		1-85312-917-8				2002	14						631	640																WOS:000179249200061

Field sampling methods for Asiatic garden beetle (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) adult movement and flight in the Great Lakes region	FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST												The Asiatic garden beetle, Maladera formosae (Brenske) (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), was introduced into the US in 1921 and recently has become a significant early-season pest of field corn in Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan, USA. Adults emerge from the soil in mid-summer, feed, mate, and lay eggs in the crop soil. Although adult feeding causes no apparent damage in field crops, these beetles are responsible for laying eggs that hatch into the grubs that overwinter and feed on corn the following spring. The objective of this study was to evaluate sampling methods used for other annual white grub species for their efficacy with M. formosae adults in a corn-soybean production system. We performed 2 experiments to first evaluate pitfall traps and sticky cards for sampling beetle emergence, then evaluate antifreeze milkjug traps and blacklight traps for sampling beetle flight. Pitfall traps were effective at capturing beetles, but not sticky cards. Peak abundance was observed between 28 Jun and 5 Jul. Flying adults were predominately attracted to the blacklight trap and nearly 100 times more adults were trapped in the blacklight compared to the milkjug traps. Flying beetles were more attracted to milkjug traps containing propylene glycol antifreeze than water or ethylene glycol antifreeze. These findings may provide economical tools for monitoring adult flight movement and flight.																			0015-4040	1938-5102				JUN	2023	106	2					117	121																WOS:001027103000008

Alpine lacustrine varved record reveals summer temperature as main control of glacier fluctuations over the past 2250 years	HOLOCENE												Glacier fluctuations are a key indicator of changing climate. Their reconstruction beyond historical times unravels glacier variability and its forcing factors on long time scales, which can considerably improve our understanding of the climate-glacier relationship. Here, we present a 2250-year-long reconstruction of particle-mass accumulation rates recorded in the lacustrine sediments of Lake Truebsee (Central Swiss Alps) that are directly related to glacier extent, thus reflecting a continuous record of fluctuations of the upstream-located Titlis Glacier. Mass accumulation rate values show strong centennial to multi-centennial fluctuations and reveal 12 well-pronounced periods of enhanced values corresponding to times of maximum extent of the neighboring Lower Grindelwald Glacier. This result supports previous studies of proglacial lake sediments that documented high mass accumulation rate values during glacier advances. The strong variability in the Lake Truebsee mass accumulation rate record thus represents a highly sensitive paleoclimatic archive, which mirrors rapid and pronounced feedbacks of Titlis Glacier to climatic changes over the past 2250years. The comparison of our data with independent paleo-temperature reconstructions from tree rings suggests that variations in mean summer temperature were the primary driving factor of fluctuations of Titlis Glacier. Also, advances of Titlis Glacier occurred during the grand solar minima (Dalton, Maunder, Sporer, Wolf) of the last millennium. This relation of glacier extent with summer temperature reveals strong evidence that the mass balance of this Alpine glacier is primarily controlled by the intensity of glacier melting during summer.					; Gilli, Adrian/B-5238-2014	Anselmetti, Flavio/0000-0002-8785-3641; Gilli, Adrian/0000-0003-4193-2157; Wirth, Stefanie B./0000-0002-1276-8506													0959-6836	1477-0911				FEB	2015	25	2					280	287		10.1177/0959683614557572	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683614557572													WOS:000346780500004

Soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and mineral N leaching under varied annual precipitation were simulated with the DayCent model in a mixed landscape (tea garden, bamboo forest and coniferous and broadleaved mixed forests). Their HSHMs were further quantified using the 3rd quartile value of all data as the baseline. Results showed that the hot moments of soil N2O emissions were the dry year, summer, and months with high air temperature (July to September) and months after fertilization (April or May) at inter-annual, seasonal and monthly time scales, respectively. The hot moments of mineral N leaching at these time scales were the normal year or the wet year, spring or rainy seasons after drought, and rainy months after fertilization or drought, respectively. The main factors controlling the formation of hot moments on N losses were temperature, precipitation and fertilization. In addition, the hot spots of N2O emissions and mineral N leaching in the mixed landscape were both distributed in the tea garden (TG). When the entire study area was assumed to be under the same land-use type (i.e., TG), the hot spots of these two kinds of N losses were mainly distributed in the areas with rock fragment content < 0.16 cm3 cm-3, field capacity > 0.24 cm3 cm-3, bulk density > 1.29 g cm-3, soil carbon (C)/N ratio < 13.26, and slope < 12 degrees. These results indicated that fertilizer management, climate factors, soil properties and topography need to be comprehensively considered to alleviate the formation of HSHMs of N losses in mixed landscape mountainous areas.

The WT model includes (i) variations in the eddy diffusion coefficient based on the degree of thermal stratification and the velocity of wind, and (ii) a sub-model for simulating the freezing and thawing processes of surface water, water temperatures, and the mixing rates between two adjacent layers of water. The ECO model then uses these results to calculate the resultant effect on a lake's ecological dynamics, e.g., composition of phytoplankton species, their respective concentrations, and nutrient concentrations, When the model was benchmarked against Lake Yunoko, a dimictic lake, fairly good agreement was obtained over a 4-yr period; thereby indicating it is suitably calibrated. In addition, to assess the effects of global warming on a lake ecosystem, changes in Lake Yunoko's water temperature/quality were simulated in response to an increase in air temperature of 2-4 degrees C. Results indicate that such an increase will (i) increase thermal stratification in summer, which increases the nutrient concentrations in bottom water due to nutrient release from bottom sediment, (ii) increase the concentration of phytoplankton at the beginning of the autumn circulation period, and (iii) change the composition of phytoplankton species.

This habitation developed during the 20th century on the shores of Lake Roine, in southwestern Finland, My aim is to identify spatial and temporal scales constituted by the process, as well as its ecological influences in connection with socio-economic changes and ecohistorical layers of the area. The results indicate that the emergence of summer cottage culture is breaking the dichotomies between urban and rural and also merges different time horizons. Remarkable context dependence was found when the ecological influences were evaluated in relation to traditional peasant culture and modem silviculture. The present summer cottage occupants of the lake are often tightly engaged with their site by managing it and reusing artefacts innovatively. As managers they reflect both peasant and urban mentalities, and having great variation in management practices they create potentials for further changes in the ecosocial system.

It is also the largest renewable energy source offering significant potential for reduction in carbon emissions. In Norway, hydropower accounts for nearly 99% of the total electricity production. To meet winter demand, storage schemes are implemented in tandem with run-of-river schemes to a large extent in cold region hydropower systems. In these systems, ice creates operational constraints during winter that can lead to reductions in power production. The problems occur in the various phases of the ice regime, mainly due to frazil ice, ice runs, and ice jams. Counteracting these ice problems is usually a difficult task that involves expensive measures and possibly lost production. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the effects of freshwater ice on hydropower systems. It has been shown that ice in freshwater systems poses a number of operational constraints on the various components of a hydropower system at a time when energy demand is at its peak. The literature review presents a useful baseline for operators of power plants as well as showing problem areas for future research. The trends in the northern areas toward warmer and unstable winters could both alleviate and exacerbate the current challenges for cold climate hydropower operation and the findings of this paper should provide useful background for assessments of future ice impacts.																			0887-381X	1943-5495				DEC 1	2013	27	4					196	222		10.1061/(ASCE)CR.1943-5495.0000059	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)CR.1943-5495.0000059													WOS:000329912300002
J	Wurster, CM; Patterson, WP				Wurster, CM; Patterson, WP			Metabolic rate of late Holocene freshwater fish: evidence from δ13C values of otoliths	PALEOBIOLOGY												We examine patterns of intra-otolith variation in delta(13)C values of fossil Aplodinotus grunniens (freshwater drum) otoliths recovered from an archeological site in northeast Tennessee. We find three repeatable patterns: an initial increase early in ontogeny followed by relatively stable delta(13)C values as the fish ages, an initial strong covariation between seasonal delta(18)O and delta(13)C values, and a decrease with age in the magnitude of seasonal change in delta(13)C values. These last two observations are illustrated by seasonal least-squares linear regressions between delta(13)C and delta(18)O values that tend to progressively decrease in r(2) value and slope with fish age. These patterns are evaluated by using a mass balance model in which otolith delta(13)C values are derived from dissolved inorganic carbon of ambient water mixing with carbon derived from metabolic processes. The proportion of metabolically derived carbon is found to be the dominant factor controlling intra-otolith variation in delta(13)C values. Thus, the difference between maximum and minimum delta(13)C values from a single otolith (delta(13)C(max-min)) is postulated to reflect the total change in metabolic rate over the lifetime of a fish. delta(13)C(max-min) values significantly and negatively covary with average delta(18)O((CaCO3)) values, suggesting either a higher total change in metabolic rate over the lifetime of a fish in cooler climates characterized by shorter growing seasons, or a decrease in summer/winter precipitation ratio. A proxy for metabolic rate preserved in otoliths would facilitate the understanding of evolutionary history in physiological traits of fishes and improve our understanding of bioenergetics.

The lamination consists of light- and brown-colored laminate couplets in the thin sections. The brown-colored layer is composed mainly of dinoflagellate cysts. The grey-colored layer consists of other organic and siliceous matter (plant detritus, diatoms, chrysophyte cysts) and clastics. Preliminary sediment trap results show that a distinct peak of dinocyst flux occurred in November. The dinocyst flux maximum also corresponds to the peaks of diatom flux and chrysophyte stomatocyst flux. These suggest that "red tide blooms" occur in this freshwater lake. We speculate that the dinocyst flux maximum could be related to autumn overturn due to increased nutrients, and the availability of cysts for germination from the lake bottom. Additionally, it may also reflect increasing dissolved organic matter after leaf fall. An independent chronology derived from Cs-137 and (210) Pb shows a good agreement with counted laminations. From the sediment trap data and the independent chronology data, the dinocyst microlaminae appear to be annually laminated, and probably could be called dinocyst varves. Although vegetative (thecate stage) cells of Peridinium volzii and Ceratium furcoides are found in the water samples, it is not possible to relate the dinocysts to these two dinoflagellate species. Based on morphological and ecological analyses, we suggested that they have affinities with species of Peridinium (sensu lato), most probably to P. inconspicuum. Detailed investigations should be carried out to understand the red tide history in this freshwater lake. Annually laminated dinocyst microlayers in freshwater and marine sediments not only provide an uncommon archive for understanding the history of red tides and harmful algal blooms, and why and how certain species periodically bloom over several thousands years, but also provide important records of paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic changes at seasonal to annual resolution.

Dynamic changes in dissolved organic matter composition in a Mountain Lake under ice cover and relationships to changes in nutrient cycling and phytoplankton community composition	AQUATIC SCIENCES												We studied Bear Lake, a subalpine oligotrophic lake in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado USA, during the winter ice cover period of 2018. Our goal was to understand relationships between biogeochemical and biotic processes and the chemical quality of the dissolved organic matter (DOM), a major pool of organic carbon in all lakes. The lake was stratified with limited light availability and had a consistent oxycline at 7 m. Nutrient concentrations were low and the depletion of nitrogen species was related to increased phytoplankton abundance. The phytoplankton community became progressively dominated by a potentially mixotrophic dinoflagellate species, Gymnodinium sp., and a deep chlorophyll maximum developed above the hypolimnion. Changes in the chemical quality of DOM, as measured through high-resolution mass spectrometry, were associated with these shifts in nutrient and phytoplankton composition. The spectrometry data revealed a pool of organic compounds many of which contained phosphorus, nitrogen, and sulfur. This pool evolved through the winter, with phosphorus-containing compounds becoming more predominant in the upper oxic zone and sulfur-containing compounds becoming more predominant in the anoxic bottom waters. Reduced chemo diversity of the DOM pool in the surface waters developed through the winter. In the bottom waters, more unique compounds were produced through the winter, and the favorability of the DOM to support microbial respiration also increased. These observed differences in DOM molecular composition were not reflected in the spectroscopic signature of the DOM pool. Overall, our results show chemical changes in the DOM pool correlate to dynamic redox conditions, biogeochemical cycling, and biotic response to ice cover.

We present a well-dated high -resolution X-ray fluorescence (XRF) scanning record from a sediment core from Lake Qionghai on the south-eastern Tibetan Plateau, which reveals the impact of ENSO activity on ISM variability. The results indicate a gradual drying of the regional climate on the sub-orbital timescale, which is in broad agreement with ISM changes controlled by Northern Hemisphere summer insolation. Additionally, centennial-scale drought events occurred at around 6230-5740, 4620-4250, 3820-3540, 3210-2440, 2180-1320, and 1000-615 cal yr B.P. and are consistent with enhanced ENSO activity, documenting the occurrence of ENSO-related drought events in the Holocene. Both ISM oscillations and ENSO variability show significant 350-yr, 500-yr, and 800-yr cyclicities, and there is a highly significant negative relationship between the ISM and ENSO at these cyclicities, indicating that a weak ISM was related to increased ENSO intensity, and vice versa. Our findings provide evidence for the modulation of ISM intensity by ENSO variability on the centennial timescale during the Holocene.

In the cold light of day: the potential importance of under-ice convective mixed layers to primary producers	INLAND WATERS												Temperate lakes are ice covered for much of the year; however, winter lake conditions have not been well studied and are undergoing rapid change. Using data collected during ice-on periods from 4 north-temperate water bodies, we report observations of stable surface layers, solar-induced convective mixed layers, and their potential impacts on phytoplankton. The convective mixed layer is defined as the region where the convective Richardson number (Ri) is <= 1. In the absence of a convective mixed layer, peaks in chlorophyll a were near the ice-water interface. Light conditions here seemed sufficient to support phytoplankton biomass accrual in the short-term in 50% of our measurements, although snow depths > 13.5 cm may lead to light limitation. When a convective mixed layer was present, light conditions were sufficient for biomass accrual in 37.5% of cases. The frictional timescale for damping averaged 15 minutes, indicative of a lack of mixing at night. Convective mixing depths and velocity increased as snow declined, and results demonstrated the potential for rapid convective mixed layer deepening (up to 6.6 m h(-1)), underscoring the highly dynamic physical environment under ice. Although declining periods of ice cover have been subject to much attention, changes in snow cover may have equally important implications for primary producers and the potential for under-ice blooms. This link between physics and biology must be further explored to better understand how changing winters will affect water bodies.					; Baulch, Helen/I-9529-2012	North, Rebecca/0000-0003-3762-5939; Baulch, Helen/0000-0001-9018-4998; 													2044-2041	2044-205X					2017	7	2					138	150		10.1080/20442041.2017.1296627	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2017.1296627													WOS:000408584600002
J	Vogel, N; Baur, H; Bischoff, A; Wieler, R				Vogel, Nadia; Baur, Heinrich; Bischoff, Addi; Wieler, Rainer			Cosmic ray exposure ages of Rumuruti chondrites from North Africa	CHEMIE DER ERDE-GEOCHEMISTRY												We analyzed noble gases and determined (3)He, (21)Ne, and (38)Ar cosmic ray exposure ages (CREAs) of Rumuruti chondrites from North West Africa (NWA) to rule on potential pairings and/or source pairings of North Africa R chondrite samples. The 21Ne exposure ages range between 10 and 74 Ma, with NWA 2897 and 1668 having the highest known exposure ages among R chondrites. We also include other R chondrites from North Africa (Schultz et al., 2005) and, based on their noble gas characteristics and their (21)Ne CREAs, propose pairings of the following samples: NWA 2198, 5069, 755, 4615, 845, 851, 978, 1471, and possibly DaG 013 belonging to one fall with a CREA of similar to 10 Ma, and NWA 753, 4360, 4419, 5606, 1472, 1476, 1477, 1478, and 1566 representing one fall with a CREA of similar to 14 Ma. NWA 2821, 2503, 2289, 3364, 3146, 4619, 4392, 3098, and 2446 seem to belong to one single fall with a CREA of 20 Ma, and NWA 2897 and 1668 seem to be paired and show a common CREA of similar to 66 Ma. Overall, all R chondrite samples from North Africa analyzed for noble gases so far represent similar to 16 individual falls. Comparing falls from North Africa to literature CREAs of R chondrites worldwide, it seems possible that a significant number of all R chondrite falls studied for noble gases were ejected from the R chondrite parent body during one large collisional event between 15 and 25 Ma ago. However, the database is still too small to draw definitive conclusions. The large portion of brecciated R chondrites in collections suggests severe impact brecciation of the R chondrite parent body.

J	Alonso, C; Rocco, V; Barriga, JP; Battini, MA; Zagarese, H				Alonso, C; Rocco, V; Barriga, JP; Battini, MA; Zagarese, H			Surface avoidance by freshwater zooplankton: Field evidence on the role of ultraviolet radiation	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The avoidance of surface waters by crustacean zooplankton is a common phenomenon both in marine and freshwaters. The contemporary paradigm interprets such behavior as an antipredator strategy. However, the phenomenon has also been reported in predator-free environments, which suggests that other variables may contribute to this depth-selection behavior. We investigated the possibility that ultraviolet radiation (UVR) could influence the avoidance of surface waters in three interconnected lakes differing in their transparency. Each lake was sampled 17 or 18 times. In the two most transparent lakes, the percentage of the population occurring in the surface layer decreased during spring and summer, but this pattern was not observed in the less transparent lake. Such differences in the patterns of surface-water avoidance were unrelated to the abundance and vertical distribution of the dominant planktivores (early stages of galaxiid fishes) as well as to temperature and food availability. They were inversely related, however, to the average UVR levels within the surface layer. A UV avoidance strategy was predicted for the copepod Boeckella gracilipes, on account of its low UV tolerance and lack of photoprotective compounds. Our results support this prediction and strongly suggest that surface avoidance by freshwater Patagonian zooplankton is not just a byproduct benefit of an antipredator behavior but is a direct response to high UVR levels.

Nutrient limitation and seasonality associated with phytoplankton communities and cyanotoxin production in a large, hypereutrophic lake	HARMFUL ALGAE												Though freshwater harmful algal blooms have been described and studied for decades, several important dynamics remain uncertain, including the relationships among nutrient concentrations, phytoplankton growth, and cyanotoxin production. To identify when and where nutrients limit phytoplankton, cyanobacteria, and cyanotoxins, we conducted in situ bioassay studies. We added nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), or N + P across various seasons in water collected from three locations across Utah Lake, one of the largest freshwater lakes in the western U.S. This shallow, hypereutrophic lake provides a powerful testbed for quantifying nutrient-growth- toxin interactions. We assessed a range of parameters over time, including photopigment concentrations, phytoplankton abundance (cell counts), cyanotoxins, and nutrient concentrations. Despite high background nutrient concentrations in lake water, phytoplankton abundance and composition were strongly affected by nutrient addition. Phosphorus limitation was more common in the spring, with N limitation and N + P limitation becoming more common in the fall. Nutrient additions were positively associated with cyanobacteria (Micro- cystis, Aphanocapsa, Dolichospermum, Merismopedia, Aphanizomenon spp.), eukaryotes (Aulacoseira, Desmodesmus spp.), and two taxonomical categories of phytoplankton (i.e., unicellular and colonial green algae). When detected, anatoxin-a was positively associated with Aphanizomenon and negatively associated with Microcystis spp. However, overall cyanotoxin concentrations were not associated with cyanobacterial cell density but varied seasonally. These findings highlight the importance of considering seasonal nutrient availability dynamics and provide insights into specific nutrient targets, species, and cyanotoxins that play a significant role in the health and management of similar eutrophic lake environments around the world.

Constraining the sources and cycling of dissolved organic carbon in a large oligotrophic lake using radiocarbon analyses	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												We measured the concentrations and isotopic compositions of solid phase extracted (SPE) dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and high molecular weight (HMW) DOC and their constituent organic components in order to better constrain the sources and cycling of DOC in a large oligotrophic lacustrine system (Lake Superior, North America). SPE DOC constituted a significant proportion (41-71%) of the lake DOC relative to HMW DOC (10-13%). Substantial contribution of C-14-depleted components to both SPE DOC (Delta C-14 = 25-43%) and HMW DOC (Delta C-14 = 22-32 parts per thousand) was evident during spring mixing, and depressed their radiocarbon values relative to the lake dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC; Delta C-14 similar to 59 parts per thousand). There was preferential removal of C-14-depleted (older) and thermally recalcitrant components from HMW DOC and SPE DOC in the summer. Contemporary photoautotrophic addition to HMW DOC was observed during summer stratification in contrast to SPE DOC, which decreased in concentration during stratification. Serial thermal oxidation radiocarbon analysis revealed a diversity of sources (both contemporary and older) within the SPE DOC, and also showed distinct components within the HMW DOC. The thermally labile components of HMW DOC were C-14-enriched and are attributed to heteropolysaccharides (HPS), peptides/amide and amino sugars (AMS) relative to the thermally recalcitrant components reflecting the presence of older material, perhaps carboxylic-rich alicyclic molecules (CRAM). The solvent extractable lipid-like fraction of HMW DOC was very C-14-depleted (as old as 1270-2320 C-14 years) relative to the carbohydrate-like and protein-like substances isolated by acid hydrolysis of HMW DOC. Our data constrain relative influences of contemporary DOC and old DOC, and DOC cycling in a modern freshwater ecosystem. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kattan, Z				Kattan, Zuhair			Chemical and isotopic characteristics of the Euphrates River water, Syria: factors controlling its geochemistry	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Hydrochemical parameters and stable isotope (O-18 and H-2) ratios were monitored at 10 stations along the Euphrates River (ER) within the Syrian reach during 2004-2006. The average concentrations of major ions in the ER were comparable to those of semi-arid and arid zone rivers. Temporal variations of major ion concentrations were small at the first two upper sites and more pronounced at the lower downstream stations. Temporal fluctuations of stable isotope ratios at the first two upper sites were identical and have a distinct opposite evolution trend to those of the remaining downstream stations, with depleted values during summer-autumn and enriched values during February-May. Salinity and stable isotope values of the ER systemically increase with the distance downstream, with sharp enrichments in stable isotope values at Al-Assad Lake, primarily because of evaporation from the lake. The chemical and isotopic properties of the ER water suggest negligible role of precipitation and local runoff compared with evaporation. Cluster analysis in Q-mode resulted in classifying the major ions into: the most predominant species (SO4 (2-), HCO3 (-), Cl-, Ca2+ and Na+), liberated as a result of rock-water interactions or dissolution of soluble evaporate salts, and the less abundant ions (Mg2+, K+, NO3 (-) and SiO2), partially imported from different sources (rainfall, silicate weathering and anthropogenic pollution). Factor analysis suggests that the geochemistry of the ER water is mainly controlled by four factors: rock weathering or salt dissolution, dissolved CO2 partial pressure, water temperature (T) and evaporation. These factors explain more than 80 % of the total variance in the data matrix.																			1866-6280	1866-6299				APR	2015	73	8					4763	4778		10.1007/s12665-014-3762-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-014-3762-z													WOS:000351453600066

P.; Jayamali, Sanjeewani Disna			Seasonal and tidal influence for water quality changes in coastal Bolgoda Lake system, Sri Lanka	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												The variation in physicochemical properties is a notable feature to identify hydrodynamic and biogeochemical processes in coastal aquatic systems. In this study, the spatial and temporal changes of water quality parameters were measured with respect to spring and neap tides, covering both single and different monsoon periods. Bulk organic geochemical proxies such as total organic carbon to total nitrogen (C/N ratio) and total organic carbon to total sulfur (C/S ratio) were also considered to evaluate organic sources and depositional environments, respectively. The conductivity was decreased with distance from the sea-mouth to stream during the neap tide under the influence of weak precipitation. No significant variation in conductivity can be observed during the spring tide under the influence of strong precipitation. In addition, the conductivity values in North Bolgoda Lake show homogeneous distribution during spring and neap tides within single monsoon period. Therefore, the reduction of freshwater supply (precipitation) had played a significant role in developing salinity stratification along this coastal water body. The seasonal stratification can control organic matter preservation, as oxygen dissolution is decreased with increasing salinity. In contrast, tidal variation and precipitation had no direct connection to change salinity in surrounding groundwater aquifers. Organic geochemical proxies indicate possible oligotrophic to mesotrophic levels of productivity in Bolgoda Lake system. The prominent fluvial process during rainy periods and seawater invasion during dry periods can diminish the accumulation of nutrients and anthropogenic deteriorations in Bolgoda Lake system under sea-mouth open nature.

Both pollen taxa percentages and plant functional type affinity scores were used in the reconstruction of six climate variables. The reconstructed values were compared with the estimated modern climate at each surface pollen site in order to evaluate the accuracy of the pollen-based reconstruction. The reconstruction of thermal parameters is very reliable (correlation coefficient R between 0.86 and 0.89). The reconstruction of annual precipitation is less accurate (R = 0.7). We also proposed a new technique to calibrate reconstructed values into both probability distribution and/ or confidence regions of observed values. The specialized programs for this calibration (PolCalib and Poll-list) are available at QSR website (http://www.elsevier.nl/iocate/quascirev). The reconstruction of the Late Quaternary climate changes around Lake Mikata shows that the summer and winter temperatures were 5degreesC lower than present around 40 uncal. kyr BP, reached a minimum around 20 uncal. kyr BP (10degreesC lower than present), and became similar to present-day at 8 uncal. kyr BP. The estimates for annual precipitation show that it was driest around 20 uncal. kyr BP. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Red pine seedlings artificially inoculated with the North American serotype, exposed to natural field conditions and artificially manipulated field conditions, developed symptoms of Scleroderris shoot blight when exposed to 44 or more days in which the temperature remained between -6 and +5 C or snow completely covered the seedling or tree parts-a conducive day. Thus, an extended period of relatively mild canopy temperature during the winter appears to favor disease development. The conductive period-a period in which 44 or more conducive days occurred-could either occur in the winter after inoculation, or over the two winters after inoculation. The apparent latent period in the disease cycle may result from the need for winter conditions before symptom development can occur. The occurrence of symptoms primarily on lower branches, and the restriction of the disease to latitudes that receive sustained snow cover in the Lake States are consistent with this observation. Comparison of literature descriptions of outbreaks of the disease to weather records revealed a strong association between conductive periods, usually single conducive winters, and the occurrence of symptoms. The natural range of the disease may be restricted by the need for recurrence of conducive periods within 3 yr. to avoid breaking the disease cycle.																			0031-949X	1943-7684				NOV	1989	79	11					1293	1301		10.1094/Phyto-79-1293	http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/Phyto-79-1293													WOS:A1989CF58900016

Hg concentrations increased from autotrophic organisms to herbivores < detritivores < omnivores < carnivores. Within the carnivores studied, raptors had higher blood Hg concentrations than their songbird prey. The Hg concentration in the blood of the focal study species, Bicknell's thrush (Catharus bicknelli), varied over the course of the summer in response to a diet shift related to changing availability of arthropod prey. The Bicknell's thrush food web is more detrital-based (with higher Hg concentrations) in early summer and more foliage-based (with lower Hg concentrations) during late summer. There were significant year effects in different ecosystem compartments indicating a possible connection between atmospheric Hg deposition, detrital-layer Hg concentrations, arthropod Hg concentrations, and passerine blood Hg concentrations.

Response of Microcystis and Stephanodiscus to Alternative Flow Regimes of the Regulated River Nakdong (South Korea) Quantified By Model Ensembles Based on the Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm (HEA)	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												This study demonstrates the use of inferential models for scenario analyses by simulating direct and indirect effects of predictor variables on state variables through model ensembles. Two model ensembles have been designed to predict the response of the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa and the diatom Stephanodiscus hantzschii to modified flow regimes of the River Nakdong (Korea) by a scenario analysis. Whilst flow-independent predictor variables of growth of Microcystis and Stephanodiscus such as water temperature and pH remain unchanged during the scenario analysis, flow-dependent predictor variables such as turbidity, electrical conductivity, phosphate, nitrate, silica and chlorophyll a are forecasted by inferential models. In the course of scenario analysis, flow-independent and flow-dependent predictor variables feed into the Microcystis and Stephanodiscus models to make sure that both direct and indirect effects of altered flow regimes are taken into account. The eight inferential models that were incorporated into the model ensembles have been developed by the hybrid evolutionary algorithm based on 19years of time-series monitored in the River Nakdong between 1993 and 2012. The models achieved good accuracy in terms of timing and magnitudes reflected by coefficients of determination r(2)=0.94 for Microcystis and r(2)=0.83 for Stephanodiscus. The scenario analysis revealed that extreme summer blooms of Microcystis as observed between 1994 and 1997, and winter blooms of Stephanodiscus as observed between 1994 and 1997 and in 2004 can be prevented in the River Nakdong by adaptive management of seasonal water release from adjacent dams.

J	Borgström, A; Hansson, LA; Sjöstedt, J				Borgstrom, Anna; Hansson, Lars-Anders; Sjostedt, Johanna			Wetlands as a Local Scale Management Tool to Reduce Algal Growth Potential	WETLANDS												Recent land-use changes have led to a significant loss of natural wetlands worldwide resulting in increased amounts of organic and inorganic compounds reaching lakes and coastal areas. In turn, this has led to an increased algal growth, and subsequently the risk of algal blooms and deteriorated water quality. The capacity of wetlands to retain nutrients is well-known, suggesting that constructed wetlands may be a potential management strategy to mitigate algal blooms in downstream waters, although little is known about seasonal variation in reduction of algal growth potential. Therefore, in a long-term study, we experimentally evaluated the efficiency of seven wetlands to reduce the algal growth potential by comparing the growth in cultures containing 50:50 wetland water from the inlet or outlet and water from a eutrophic lake as a standard inoculum. We show that the majority of the wetlands have a considerable potential to reduce algal growth potential, with up to 89% for cyanobacteria and 73% for green algae. However, there were strong temporal variations in efficiency within, as well as between wetlands. Specifically, we show that the potential to reduce algal growth (standardized conditions) was generally higher in winter than in summer. In addition, the wetlands showed different efficiency in reducing the growth potential of cyanobacteria and green algae. Taken together, our results show that wetlands have a considerable potential to reduce algal growth potential, suggesting that they are an efficient local-scale tool in reducing the risk of algal blooms especially from a future climate change perspective.

Based on three years of field observations in sediments of Tai Lake, China, concentrations of organochlorine (OC) pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in areas where blooms occurred were 2.4 and 3.4 times greater than concentrations in areas without blooms. Concentrations of octylphenol (OP), nonylphenol (NP) and bisphenol A (BPA) in areas where blooms did not occur were 3.8, 4.4 and 2.6 times greater than concentrations in areas where blooms did occur. To explain the differences, simultaneous, seasonally determinations of the water-sediment-phytoplankton-snails disequilibria were determined empirically. Greater sinking and lesser diffusion were shown to be probable drivers of the burial of 8-HCH, 4-ring and 5-ring PAHs in surface sediments of areas in which blooms occurred, being as much as 0.58, 38 and 45 g month-1. Large biodegradation and low burial was shown to be the probable reason of the inverse proportion of NP, OP and BPA in both water and sediment to biomass which might be due to the enhanced metabolic capacity of bacterial community associated with algae blooms. These phenomena further influence the persistent hydrophobic organic chemicals in the snail species (Bellamya quadrata) being greater in winter but lesser in summer, which is probably due to the positive relationship with the concentrations in sediment when snails were dormant and with the concentrations in water after dormancy. Thus, in Tai Lake, the fate and distribution of persistent and biodegradable contaminants in sediments and snails is influenced by blooms of phytoplankton, which should be included in models of environmental fates of contaminants.

GEORGI'S 18TH CENTURY ETHNOGRAPHICAL HANDBOOK	EZHEGODNIK FINNO-UGORSKIKH ISSLEDOVANII-YEARBOOK OF FINNO-UGRIC STUDIES												German origin natural scientist Johann Gottlieb Georgi participated in the Orenburg Expedition, organized by the Imperial Academy of St. Petersburg. Between 1770 and 1774 he travelled in the Middle and Lower Volga Region, the Orenburg area, Bashkiria, the neighbourhood of Lake Baikal and reached as far as the Russian-Chinese-Mongolian border. He summarized his experiences of the journey in his book titled Bemerkungen einer Reise im Russischen Reich im Jahre 1772-1774. A few years later he published an extended version of the Bemerkungen, titled Beschreibung aller Nationen des Russischen Reichs, a richly illustrated volume describing in detail the customs and religious life of 80 peoples in Russia. One of these is the Udmurts. Georgi tells us about the living circumstances, clothing, wedding and burying customs of the Udmurts and describes very thoroughly their gods, ghosts, holidays, sacrifices, also providing us with the Udmurt names for them. He writes about the main gods (Inmar, Kildisin, Mu-Kildisin, Sundi mumi), the evil god (Sajtan), the guardian spirits and the evil spirits (Vorsud, Vu murt, Palas murt, Ubir, Albaste). He also describes the sacrificial places (keremet and lud, kuala, mudor), writes about the sacrificial (vos, vosan) ceremony and about the mediators (tuno, utis, vedin) between earth and heaven. He also mentions some special events like the spring sowing and the summertime and autumn harvests.																			2224-9443	2311-0333					2021	15	2					328	340		10.35634/2224-9443-2021-15-2-328-340	http://dx.doi.org/10.35634/2224-9443-2021-15-2-328-340													WOS:000667764900012

Diversity of Fungal infections and Histopathological preparations of some economically important Fresh Water Fishes in Bhadra Reservoir Project, Karnataka, INDIA	RESEARCH JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY												Fungal infections are very serious diseases in culturable freshwater fishes. The present research work aimed to investigate the fungal infections in four economically important freshwater carps i.e. Catla catla, Labeo rohita, Cirrhinus mrigala and Cyprinus carpio which were collected from the Fish seed production unit at Bhadra Reservoir Project (BRP). The infected fishes were collected in polythene bags and brought for mycological study in the laboratory. The fungal strains were isolated using potato dextrose agar and Sabourd's dextrose agar media. Out of 240 fishes, 168 (70%) infection have been recorded with six different fungal genera of Saprolegnia sp. (54.167%), Penicillium sp. (7.14%), Aspergillus sp. (14.285%), Trichoderma sp. (6.546%), Rhizopus sp. (4.167%) and Mucor sp. (13.695%). These fungi were frequently isolated and identified based on spore structure and morphological characteristics. The monthly variation and percentage of fungal infection in Catla catla was 35.10 %, Labeo rohita was 24.99%, Cirrhinus mrigala was 21.41% and Cyprinus carpio was 18.42%. Winter season (57.5%) and the rainy season (39%) was more favorable for the growth of Saprolegnia sp. than summer season (10%). Histopathological study was carried out to study the effect of Saprolegnia sp. on infected fish. Based on the results, Catla catla fishes were more susceptible to Saprolegnia sp. than other varieties of fishes.																			2278-4535					JAN	2024	19	1					59	70		10.25303/1901rjbt059070	http://dx.doi.org/10.25303/1901rjbt059070													WOS:001158163000008

A total of 38 influenza A viruses were isolated from 2066 fecal samples collected during November 2006 through March 2007. The overall isolation rate was 1.84%. Eleven different subtypes were isolated, including nine H5N2, seven H6N8, seven H10N1, four H4N6, three H6N1, three H11N9, and one each of H1N1, H6N2, H6N5, H10N9, H11N1. Only the H4N6 subtype was detected during two successive months, November and December, from Lake Ogawara of Aomori prefecture. One wintering site, Lake Izunuma of Miyagi prefecture, was negative for virus isolation throughout the study period. During the sampling period, the highest virus isolation rate was in December (4.90%) followed by November (2.18%), January (0.91%), and February (0.30%). Virus isolation was negative for samples collected in March 2007. These results suggest that influenza viruses are introduced by Northern pintail when they migrate into Japan, but the viruses are not maintained in the flocks, most likely because the birds are not breeding during the winter. We believe that this relatively large data set creates a strong foundation for future studies of avian influenza virus (AIV) prevalence, evolution, and ecology in wintering sites, along with the role of Northern pintails in the spread of AIV during their migration from northern Russia and Asia to Japan.

Observation-derived ice growth curves show patterns and trends in maximum ice thickness and safe travel duration of Alaskan lakes and rivers	CRYOSPHERE												The formation, growth, and decay of freshwater ice on lakes and rivers are fundamental processes of northern regions with wide-ranging implications for socio-ecological systems. Ice thickness at the end of winter is perhaps the best integration of cold-season weather and climate, while the duration of thick and growing ice cover is a useful indicator for the winter travel and recreation season. Both maximum ice thickness (MIT) and ice travel duration (ITD) can be estimated from temperature-driven ice growth curves fit to ice thickness observations. We simulated and analyzed ice growth curves based on ice thickness data collected from a range of observation programs throughout Alaska spanning the past 20-60 years to understand patterns and trends in lake and river ice. Results suggest reductions in MIT (thinning) in several northern, interior, and coastal regions of Alaska and overall greater interannual variability in rivers compared to lakes. Interior regions generally showed less variability in MIT and even slightly increasing trends in at least one river site. Average ITD ranged from 214 d in the northernmost lakes to 114 d across southernmost lakes, with significant decreases in duration for half of sites. River ITD showed low regional variability but high interannual variability, underscoring the challenges with predicting seasonally consistent river travel. Standardization and analysis of these ice observation data provide a comprehensive summary for understanding changes in winter climate and its impact on freshwater ice services.

Seasonal and short-term variations of P concentrations were measured by intensive automatic sampling covering P fluxes from the entire Gjern Angstrom watershed and two subcatchments: the Gelbaek and Lake Sobygard. Moreover, infrequent sampling was performed in all major tributaries of the river system. Transport of P compounds (dissolved and particulate P) exposed a seasonal pattern which was highly affected by flow conditions, instream processes, as well as point and non-point sources. Stormflow P transport during the two study years (1987-8 and 1988-9) constituted 56 and 61% in the Gelbaek, respectively, compared with 25 and 23% in the Gjern Angstrom, respectively. Particulate P transport in the Gelbaek constituted 56 and 75% of annual total P transport during the two years compared with 77 and 75% in the Gjern Angstrom. The magnitude of monthly baseflow and stormflow total P loads was significantly correlated with the mean monthly discharge during baseflow and stormflow in the Gelbaek, whereas only stormflow loads were correlated to discharge in the Gjern Angstrom. In situ measurements of retention showed that the maximum amount of P stored in the Gelbaek during summer (June to August) was 22 g P m(-2) (1988) compared with 27 g P m(-2) (1987) in the Gjern A. Lake Sobygard was a P source during summer but a P sink during winter and on an annual basis the net P released was 810 and 1420 kg, which corresponded to 7 and 20% of the annual P export from the watershed, respectively. Retention constituted about 30% of gross P transport in the Gelbaek during summer compared with 20% in the Gjern Angstrom. Resuspension of retained P during stormflows in September 1987 constituted 94% of the stormflow P transport and 54% of the total P transport. Monthly total P and dissolved reactive P (DRP) mass balances for the main channel of the Gjern Angstrom revealed a significant DRP retention over 17 months (p < 0.05) caused by P adsorption on sediments and biological uptake. On an annual basis the main channel was a sink of DRP (1220 and 1660 kg P) but a source of total P (3440 and 1000 kg P), implying that the channel is an important source of particulate P. Bank erosion proved to be a significant P source in the main channel of Gjern Angstrom, whereas P delivery from soil erosion was possibly of minor importance. The annual non-point P export from two intensively sampled catchments was significantly higher (0.89 and 0.45 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1)) than from the five extensively sampled subbasins (0.43 and 0.17 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1)). No significant relationship could be established between non-point P export acid the proportion of arable land and soil type. Only for the wet year of 1987-8 was a significant relationship established between non-point P export and the P load from scattered dwellings outside sewage areas in five subbasins.					kronvang, brian/I-7715-2013														0885-6087					FEB-MAR	1995	9	2					119	142		10.1002/hyp.3360090202	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.3360090202													WOS:A1995QR84900001

Combined DNA/RNA Amplicon Sequencing and Metatranscriptomics Reveals Microbial-Driven Nutrient Transformations and Core Taxa in Agriculturally Impacted Sediments	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY REPORTS												Chronic non-point nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loads reshape sediment microbial biogeochemical cycling in headwater systems, altering ecosystem function. This study integrates DNA and RNA amplicon sequencing with metatranscriptomics to examine microbial taxonomic and functional responses to nutrient inputs in lower Great Lakes watersheds, focusing on N, P, and sulphur (S) metabolism. RNA-based taxa showed a stronger correlation with metabolic functions than DNA-based taxa, highlighting RNA-based approaches as valuable tools for assessing active microbial responses to nutrients. Site-specific analyses revealed distinct microbial metabolic profiles linked to watershed fertiliser sources and seasonal variation. Inorganic fertiliser inputs were associated with tightly coupled N reduction and sulphur oxidation, driven by differential expression of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia (DNRA) and sox genes. In contrast, a manure-amended site exhibited elevated nitrosative stress and sulphur assimilation pathways, consistent with detection of ammonia-oxidising genera. The low-impact reference site demonstrated intermediate functional turnover, enhanced nitrogen fixation, and the highest microbial diversity, suggesting greater ecosystem resilience. Seasonally, functional turnover increased in fall, with fewer shared core taxa across sites compared to summer. These findings highlight the impact of chronic nutrient enrichment on site-specific microbial adaptations and underscore the importance of temporal dynamics in assessing freshwater sediment microbial communities.																			1758-2229					SEP 27	2025	17	5							e70205	10.1111/1758-2229.70205	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.70205								41013990					WOS:001581890600001

However, the spread of H5N1 virus between the two flyways is still unclear. Here, the movements of wild waterfowl were obtained from satellite tracking data covering seven bar-headed geese and three great black-headed gulls breeding in the Qinghai Lake area (along the EA flyway), and 20 whooper swans wintering in the Sanmenxia Reservoir area (at the CA flyway). From the 2688 samples that were screened from wild birds at Qinghai Lake after an outbreak of HSN1 in July 2015, four genomes of HSN1 virus were obtained from bar-headed geese. The results of phylogenetic analysis indicated that these H5N1 viruses belonged to Glade 2.3.2.1c and their gene fragments were highly homologous with A/whooper swan/Henan/SMX1/2015 (HSN1) virus (ranging from 99.76% to 100.00%) isolated from a dead whooper swan from the Sanmenxia Reservoir area along the EA flyway in January 2015. Furthermore, the coincidental timing of the HSN1 outbreak with spring migration, together with phylogenetic evidence, provided new evidence of the east-to-west spread of HPAI H5N1 between the EA and CA migratory flyways of China.

Recent developments in satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors and their processing techniques enabled frequent observations, allowing monitoring of landslides and revealing the triggering factors. In this study, we analyzed the slope movements in Kalekoy dam reservoir built in 2018 in Bingol Province, T & uuml;rkiye using weekly Sentinel-1 SAR time series data. We used LiCSAR (Looking into Continents from Space with SAR) products freely served by the COMET-LiCS (Center for the Observation and Modeling of Earthquake Volcanoes and Tectonics) web portal to perform interferometric SAR (InSAR) time-series analysis. Using land use land cover, snow and vegetation indices derived from the Sentinel-2 optical imagery, and combining with precipitation, lake level measurements, and seismic and anthropogenic activities between 2015 and 2022, our findings revealed that the use of SAR data with regular global coverage is essential for deformation monitoring in dam reservoirs and ensure a comprehensive understanding of landslide phenomena in regions prone to such events. The slope movements were clearly observable in the InSAR time series with seasonal cycles especially in winter, and changes of snow cover were linked to them. Vegetation cover decreased over time in the region, likely influenced by the dam reservoir. Sudden changes in slope deformations were related to lake water levels and spring snowmelt as the saturation of landslide toe zones increased pore water pressure. Despite varying characteristics, changes in lake water levels and snowmelt were common triggers for all landslides analyzed.

Five species of fish including Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus, tecopharyngodon idella valenciennes, Leuciscus cephalus L., Capoeta capoeta Goldenstad, and Hypophthalmichthys nobilis were selected for the study. During 4 times sampling, 150 samples were taken and transported live to the laboratory on which different parts from skin, fins and gills were examined for their appearance and fish crustacean parasitic infestation by using a microscope and a loop. In order to preserve and accurately identify the samples, preservatives were used by maintaining the contemporary techniques and mechanisms. Regarding the type of analysis, which were done, it was found that 36% of the fish under study were somehow infected with crustaceans parasitic infection including Ergasilus, Lernaea cyprinacea, and Tracheliastes polycolpus. The degree of infestation was at its highest degree in summer with 22% and at its lowest level 9.33% in winter among which the highest and lowest frequencies of the infestation were related to the Ergasilus and Tracheliastes polycolpus with 42.59 and 20.37%, respectively.

J	Jedrysek, MO				Jedrysek, MO			Depth of the water column in relation to carbon isotope ratios in methane in freshwater sediments	GEOLOGICAL QUARTERLY					7th Workshop of the European-Society-for-Isotope-Research	JUN 27-JUL 01, 2004	Karl Franzens Univ, Seggauberg, GERMANY	European Soc Isotope Res	Karl Franzens Univ			Methane was collected from the surficial sedimentary layer (0 to about 20 cm) in 45 freshwater lakes in Poland. Sampling was also carried out at various depths of the overlying water column (0.15 to 12 m) between noon and early afternoon, on a seasonal basis, between 1992 and 1996. A positive correlation between the depth of the lake water, the delta C-13 (CH4) value (from ca. -1.4 to -2.3% per I m depth) and the wider delta C-13(CH4) variation over the thermocline are probably due to: the time of sinking of organic particles resulting in more intense acetate fermentation in shallower portions of the lake; the temperature variation; differences in the precursors of methane, the diffusion effect, and an increase of bioavailable DIC (dissolved inorganic carbon) at greater depths. Non-seasonal variation of isotope ratios in methane and the depth-isotope ratio correlation show that the lake system is in dynamic equilibrium on a scale of hours and days. Therefore, earlier models of methanogenesis relating and the atmospheric methane isotopic budget, proposed by other authors and based on sampling of methane from sediments, need to be revised. Moreover, delta C-13 (CH4) values higher during seasonal overturn (mixing of benthic and surface waters) than during stagnation, have been observed. This is probably due to the fact that during overturn periods some organic compounds (methane precursors) and methane in the surficial part of sediments, are oxidized with a resalting kinetic isotope effect. It is proposed that oxidation of methane and other organic compounds during seasonal overturn may be responsible for post-depositional lamination observed as pale (autumn overturn) and dark (summer organic-rich unoxic stagnation) millimetres-thick layers in freshwater lake sediments.																			1641-7291	2082-5099					2005	49	2					151	164																WOS:000230420700007
J	Park, JH; Mitchell, MJ; Driscoll, CT				Park, JH; Mitchell, MJ; Driscoll, CT			Winter-time climatic control on dissolved organic carbon export and surface water chemistry in an Adirondack forested watershed	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Although most of forested watersheds in temperate and boreal regions are snow-covered for a substantial portion of the year, responses of biogeochemical processes under the snow pack to climatic fluctuations are poorly understood. We investigated responses of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and surface water chemistry in stream and lake discharge waters draining the Arbutus Lake Watershed in the Adirondacks of New York State to climatic fluctuations during the snow-covered months from December through April. Interannual variability in stream discharge corresponded to changes in air temperature and snow pack depth across the winter months. Concentrations of DOC in stream water draining a subcatchment showed immediate positive responses to rising temperatures and subsequent increases in runoff during most snowmelt events. Increases in DOC concentrations usually coincided with decreases in pH and increases in total aluminum (AI) concentrations, while the correlations between concentrations of DOC and SO42- or base cations were negative. Although changes in air temperature, snow pack depth, and runoff were all significantly correlated with stream water concentrations of major solutes, stepwise linear regression found that runoff was the best predictor of solute concentrations. Results of stepwise linear regression with long-term monthly monitoring data collected at the lake outlet showed weaker but still consistent climatic effects on interannual variations in concentrations of DOC and other solutes. Over the 17 winter periods from December 1983 through April 2000, changes in seasonal average concentrations of DOC, H+, and Al in lake discharge generally corresponded to interannual variations in temperature, precipitation, and runoff, while SO42- and base cations displayed an opposite trend. The results suggest that snowmelt-mediated DOC responses to temperature fluctuations during the winter months might offset increases in the surface water pH caused by decreasing acidic deposition and pose a potential hazard of Al toxicity in surface waters.

Conventional aeration by air bubble plumes and other techniques usually mixes the water column and produces hazardous open water in the ice cover. A non-mixing winter lake aeration system which creates a fish refuge was designed and field tested to oxygenate the water and maintain water temperature stratification in a lake such that no open water is created. The system uses a cascade aerator and has a design discharge and dissolved oxygen input rate of 85 l/s and 70 kg/d, respectively. Aerated water is discharged near mid-depth with minimum disturbance of the ambient water through a specially designed diffuser. The system was tested in a shallow 3 m deep lake of 17 ha surface area during two winters and was found to perform as expected. Significant photosynthetic production of dissolved oxygen under the ice-cover was also observed during snow-free periods.																			0043-1370					NOV-DEC	1991	27	6					903	914																WOS:A1991HQ44900002

QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Northern Asia (here, the Russian Federation east of the Urals) played a key role in the spread of anatomically modern humans (AMH) across the Eurasian continent during the Upper Palaeolithic (UP). This time interval witnessed the climatically harshest and most variable part of the last glacial epoch when AMH spread to all continents, with the exception of ice-covered Antarctica, thus raising questions about how humans and environments interacted. Our review of available proxy records shows that the study region was largely dominated by productive steppe and tundra plant communities, which promoted a diverse small- to mega-scale fauna throughout the UP. While this rich fauna was an ideal food resource for AMH populations, its possible influence on the growth of woody plants through grazing is less well resolved. Another non-climatic factor that may have impacted on the spread of woody taxa are human activities (e.g. setting fires to facilitate hunting). Evidence that small populations of woody taxa were distributed in climatically favourable habitats comes from plant macroremains from sediment sequences and archaeological sites and from aDNA data. Contrary to the long-standing view of a generally colder-than-present last glacial climate, these proxy records reveal evidence that summers were warmer than today by several degrees Celsius, providing additional advantages for human activities. Another benefit for large herbivores, and thus human subsistence, were the generally low winter precipitation levels (similar to those of the modern steppe regions of Mongolia), which sustained year-round grazing grounds. These factors apparently outweighed the harsh colder-than-present winter conditions and promoted habitation of AMH in Northern Asia even during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) ca. 30-18 cal kyr BP. While our understanding of qualitative climate trends, mainly based on fossil pollen records, has substantially improved, quantification of climate parameters is still a challenging task. For the last glacial interval in Northern Asia, plant macroremains, chironomids, diatoms and ostracods may provide suitable alternative proxies.

Links between climate change, water-table depth, and water chemistry in a mineralized mountain watershed	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Recent studies suggest that climate change is causing rising solute concentrations in mountain lakes and streams. These changes may be more pronounced in mineralized watersheds due to the sensitivity of sulfide weathering to changes in subsurface oxygen transport. Specific causal mechanisms linking climate change and accelerated weathering rates have been proposed, but in general remain entirely hypothetical. For mineralized watersheds, a favored hypothesis is that falling water tables caused by declining recharge rates allow an increasing volume of sulfide-bearing rock to become exposed to air, thus oxygen. Here, we test the hypothesis that falling water tables are the primary cause of an increase in metals and SO4 (100-400%) observed since 1980 in the Upper Snake River (USR), Colorado. The USR drains an alpine watershed geologically and climatologically representative of many others in mineralized areas of the western U. S. Hydrologic and chemical data collected from 2005 to 2011 in a deep monitoring well (WP1) at the top of the USR watershed are utilized. During this period, both water table depths and groundwater SO4 concentrations have generally increased in the well. A numerical model was constructed using TOUGHREACT that simulates pyrite oxidation near WP1, including groundwater flow and oxygen transport in both saturated and unsaturated zones. The modeling suggests that a falling water table could produce an increase in metals and SO4 of a magnitude similar to that observed in the USR (up to 300%). Future water table declines may produce limited increases in sulfide weathering high in the watershed because of the water table dropping below the depth of oxygen penetration, but may continue to enhance sulfide weathering lower in the watershed where water tables are shallower. Advective air (oxygen) transport in the unsaturated zone caused by seasonally variable recharge and associated water table fluctuations was found to have little influence on pyrite oxidation rates near WP1. However, this mechanism could be important in the case of a shallow dynamic water table and more abundant/reactive sulfides in the shallow subsurface. Data from WP1 and numerical modeling results are thus consistent with the falling water table hypothesis, and illustrate fundamental processes linking climate and sulfide weathering in mineralized watersheds.

Five cores were (210)Pb dated and analysed for spheroidal carbonaceous particles (SCPs), indicators of deposition from fossil-fuel combustion sources, and trace metals. Surface and pre-industrial levels of five cores were analysed for 10 polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCB) isomers and 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds, whilst all 21 surface sediments were analysed for SCPs. Temporal and spatial trends in the atmospheric deposition of pollutants were identified. Whilst temporal patterns of deposited pollutants may have been truncated due to concentrations falling below the limits of detection, spatial patterns showed elevated levels of SCP, PAH, PCB, and possibly Pb within 60-70 km of Isfjord. Tenndammen (U), the closest site to Longyearbyen, showed the highest levels of contamination for all pollutants. Differences in the deposition patterns of PAH and PCB are thought to be due to local sources of PAH from coal combustion whilst PCB sources are remote. It is concluded that the impact from atmospheric deposition on Svalbard is due to a combination of spatially limited local sources superimposed on a broad-scale, long-range pattern.					; Rose, Neil/C-5739-2008	Appleby, Peter/0000-0002-6945-1841; Boyle, John/0000-0002-1172-1079; Rose, Neil/0000-0002-5697-7334													0921-2728					MAY	2004	31	4					499	513		10.1023/B:JOPL.0000022548.97476.39	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:JOPL.0000022548.97476.39													WOS:000220602400007

In contrast, sediment inorganic carbon (IC) and organic carbon (OC) concentrations were low in last glacial deposits from 38,000 to 12,000 cal yr B.P., indicating cool temperatures and low productivity. The 50,000-yr record has alternating peaks of carbonate and coarse-grain (>38 mu m) quartz that reflect warm, moist interglacial or interstadial conditions alternating with cold, dry glacial or stadial conditions, respectively. Spectral analysis of the carbonate and quartz signals reveals power concentrated at periods of 7200 and 8900 cal yr, respectively, that may reflect a nonlinear climate response to precessional forcing at a time of reduced eccentricity modulation (McIntyre and Molfino, 1996). Oxygen isotope values of calcite from Yunnan lake cores indicate the summer monsoon was weak during the last glaciation from 50,000 to 12,000 cal yr B.P. The summer monsoon intensified between 12,000 and 8000 cal yr B.P., but weakened gradually in response to insolation forcing during the mid-to-late Holocene. Our results support the Overpeck ef al. (1996) model that posits a weak summer monsoon during the last glaciation that responded nonlinearly to insolation forcing when its intensity was affected by Eurasian snow cover and ice-sheet extent. The summer monsoon intensified and responded linearly to seasonal insolation forcing in the Holocene when ice volume diminished. (C) 1999 University of Washington.

A semi-lagrangian study of circulation and transport in Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												A particle tracking model (PTM) is linked with a hydrodynamic model to evaluate mean seasonal circulation patterns in Lake Ontario, and also to provide a basis for predicting movement of algal blooms. The PTM is based on a random walk algorithm that combines a deterministic advective component with a stochastic component associated with the turbulent diffusivity field to calculate trajectories of neutrally buoyant particles, where both the advective and diffusive velocities are obtained from the hydrodynamic model. Mean circulation is calculated using 30-year average meteorological forcing data collected from five stations around the lake. Seasonal variations in lake circulation are demonstrated, and a clockwise flow in the eastern basin during summer and early fall is identified, contrary to some previous observations that suggest counterclockwise flow. The impacts of Niagara and St. Lawrence river flows on general take circulation are found to be small, except within approximately 10 kin of the river mouth. Development and application of the PTM demonstrate its potential to provide calculations of (Lagrangian) movements as determined from the hydrodynamic output, and to serve as a first step toward development of an algal transport model. Particle tracking helps to visualize flow patterns and provides a means of evaluating the probability a bloom will reach a specified area, given an initial position and the predicted velocity and diffusivity fields. This capability, when set up for real-time applications, can provide an important tool to support management decisions that may be needed when a bloom is observed,,for example in predicting potential impacts of the bloom on a beach or a water intake.																			0380-1330					DEC	2007	33	4					774	790		10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[774:ASSOCA]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[774:ASSOCA]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000252473500005
J	Lopez, RD; Fennessy, MS				Lopez, RD; Fennessy, MS			Testing the floristic quality assessment index as an indicator of wetland condition	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Biological indicators of ecosystem integrity are increasingly being sought for use in ecosystem assessment and goal-setting for restoration projects. We tested the effectiveness of a plant community-based bioassessment tool, the floristic quality assessment index (FQAI) in 20 depressional wetlands in Ohio, USA. A priori, the 20 depressional wetlands were classified by type and ranked to form a disturbance gradient according to the local landscape condition. Ranks were based on surrounding land cover characteristics, vegetated buffer characteristics, and the extent of human-induced hydrologic alteration at the wetland site. The index was negatively correlated with the disturbance rank of a wetland and with the distance to neighboring wetlands (P = 0.01). Index values were lower for wetlands surrounded by agricultural or urban land use, wetlands with less vegetation on the wetland perimeter, and wetlands with more hydrologic modification, and at sites with greater distances to other wetlands. The wetlands with lower FQAI values tended to be dominated by plants that are typical of heavily cultivated landscapes or urban regions. Thus, the index is interpreted as a measure of environmental factors that maintain and control plant communities. The index was not correlated with differences in wetland surface water chemistry (alpha = 0.05) but was positively correlated with soil total organic carbon (P = 0.01), phosphorus (P = 0.05), and calcium (P = 0.05). Repeated wetland sampling in the summer and autumn revealed that the floristic quality assessment index could be useful for the assessment and monitoring of wetland ecosystems and for tracking wetland restoration projects over time.

J	Macdonald, RW; Carmack, EC; Paton, DW				Macdonald, RW; Carmack, EC; Paton, DW			Using the δ18O composition in landfast ice as a record of arctic estuarine processes	MARINE CHEMISTRY					5th International Symposium on Model Estuaries - New Approaches to Estuarine Chemistry	MAY 25-29, 1997	RIMOUSKI, CANADA	US Natl Sci Fdn, Dept Fisheries & Oceans, Heritage Canada, INRS, UQAR				Estuaries that produce substantial amounts of ice differ from those that do not. First, ice formation and melting make important contributions to salt and freshwater budgets and thereby influence water circulation. Second, ice cover provides a physical barrier which severely restricts the air-sea exchange of properties and energy. Unfortunately, the logistical problems of oceanographic sampling in the Arctic during winter have resulted in sparse data sets. Here, we show how the oxygen isotope composition (delta(18)O) in landfast ice at the end of winter provides a record of surface water properties throughout winter. Two arctic estuaries are contrasted: the Mackenzie estuary which faces directly onto a broad, open shelf and the Husky Lakes estuary which comprises a series of basins that exchange with one another and the shelf through narrow channels. The method of converting records of delta(18)O in ice cores to surface water salinity as a function of time throughout winter is outlined. The Mackenzie estuary has a large winter inflow which spreads beneath the ice as a plume overwhelming brine production by sea-ice formation and thereby shutting down convection. Using only ice records, confident estimates can be made of the rate and direction of plume spreading. In contrast, the Husky Lakes estuary is supported only by a local, truly Arctic drainage basin which becomes frown in winter. The landfast ice in this system records a large. and relatively static, horizontal gradient in surface salinity. Small variations in delta(18)O with time evident in all ice cores are found to correlate between adjacent sites suggesting coherent displacements of surface water by 10-15 km as might be produced by seiching.

Milankovitch precession cycles (similar to 20 kyr) regulate the mean annual precipitation (250-700 mm/yr), and the similar to 2500 mm/yr evapotranspiration results in a negative hydrologic balance. Despite persistent aridity, extensive deposits of freshwater limestone punctuate the stratigraphic record. Between 2 and 1 Ma, Lake Olduvai occupied the basin, and its sediments are a proxy for climate-driven cycles. Three limestones (1.84, 1.80, and 1.36 Ma in age), which formed within lake-margin floodplains adjacent to the lake, were studied to determine their depositional environment using field relations, sedimentary structures, fossils, petrography, and stable-isotope and major-element geochemistry. The three limestones are similar in that they contain peloidal micrite, siliciclastic detrital grains, and rhizoconcretions. Abundant faunal remains (gastropods, ostracods, Charaphytes, and fish) indicate that ponded water was relatively fresh and alkaline. Geochemical and stable-isotope data indicate two types of groundwater-sourced carbonate-producing waters: a deeper-sourced fluid that was enriched in iron and manganese due to extended water-rock interactions, and a shallower groundwater that traveled through alluvial-fan deposits. Regional faults tapped the deeper groundwater, producing carbonate at spring sites, while seeps associated with basinward changes in alluvial-fan slopes drew on shallower groundwater sources. Isotope compositions indicate that fault-related waters experienced some evaporation as water moved away from the spring sites while compositions of the seep-related carbonate remained relatively constant. Pedogenic alteration and meteoric calcite cementation affected the carbonate when the spring and seep sites dried out. Secondary strontium-rich dolomite precipitated within the limestones during burial under paleo-Lake Olduvai sediments and fluids during periods of lake expansion. Integrating these data within the geological context of regional paleoclimatic and local environmental change indicates that the freshwater carbonates formed periodically when the conditions were just right, i.e., a "Goldilocks Effect." Carbonates near the basin center formed from groundwater flowing under a hydraulic head from faults or fractures during the falling limbs of Milankovitch cycles when the lake was in recession. Carbonates near the basin margin formed from an increased rate of groundwater seepage that occurred only on the rising limbs of cycles. In both contexts, the continuous flow of groundwater with surface evaporation and CO2 degassing optimizes the conditions for limestone formation in this arid environment. These results help explain the formation of freshwater limestones in the rift basin, link the carbonates to specific portions of Milankovitch cycles, and document that localized sources of potable water were present for use by hominins in Olduvai Gorge during an important period of human evolution.																			1527-1404	1938-3681				NOV	2014	84	11					988	1004		10.2110/jsr.2014.80	http://dx.doi.org/10.2110/jsr.2014.80													WOS:000345516200004
J	Arndt, A; Scherer, D; Schneider, C				Arndt, Anselm; Scherer, Dieter; Schneider, Christoph			Atmosphere Driven Mass-Balance Sensitivity of Halji Glacier, Himalayas	ATMOSPHERE												The COupled Snowpack and Ice surface energy and mass balance model in PYthon (COSIPY) was employed to investigate the relationship between the variability and sensitivity of the mass balance record of the Halji glacier, in the Himalayas, north-western Nepal, over a 40 year period since October 1981 to atmospheric drivers. COSIPY was forced with the atmospheric reanalysis dataset ERA5-Land that has been statistically downscaled to the location of an automatic weather station at the Halji glacier. Glacier mass balance simulations with air temperature and precipitation perturbations were executed and teleconnections investigated. For the mass-balance years 1982 to 2019, a mean annual glacier-wide climatic mass balance of -0.48 meters water equivalent per year (m w.e. a(-1)) with large interannual variability (standard deviation 0.71 m w.e. a(-1)) was simulated. This variability is dominated by temperature and precipitation patterns. The Halji glacier is mostly sensitive to summer temperature and monsoon-related precipitation perturbations, which is reflected in a strong correlation with albedo. According to the simulations, the climate sensitivity with respect to either positive or negative air temperature and precipitation changes is nonlinear: A mean temperature increase (decrease) of 1 K would result in a change of the glacier-wide climatic mass balance of -1.43 m w.e. a(-1) (0.99m w.e. a(-1)) while a precipitation increase (decrease) of 10% would cause a change of 0.45m w.e. a(-1) (-0.59m w.e. a(-1)). Out of 22 circulation and monsoon indexes, only the Webster and Yang Monsoon index and Polar/Eurasia index provide significant correlations with the glacier-wide climatic mass balance. Based on the strong dependency of the climatic mass balance from summer season conditions, we conclude that the snow-albedo feedback in summer is crucial for the Halji glacier. This finding is also reflected in the correlation of albedo with the Webster and Yang Monsoon index.

This study aims to reveal the dynamical effect of water-land roughness contrast on precipitation during a summer rainfall event, which was detected by rain gauge and remote sensing observations around Lake Selin Co (a large Tibetan lake). During this event, precipitation amount to the west (downwind) of the lake was much higher than that to the east (upwind). Numerical experiments based on Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) were conducted to investigate this phenomenon. High-resolution WRF simulations can reproduce the precipitation contrast between downwind and upwind of the lake, but fails with the lake aerodynamic surface roughness enhanced by either enlarging the length directly or replacing the lake with adjacent land cover. Further analyses indicate that the water-land surface friction contrast directly leads to acceleration of wind above the water surface and deceleration over the land surface, enhancing the air convergence and precipitation over land area downwind of the lake. By contrast, the heat flux and evaporation from the lake are small in summer and hardly show important effects on precipitation around the lake. Therefore, the dynamical effect of the lake surface plays a dominant role in the precipitation enhancement downwind of the lake during the summer.					zhou, xu/GYU-0536-2022; Yang, Kun/G-8390-2011; Lu, Hui/H-4349-2011; Chen, Yingying/AAH-4969-2021	zhou, xu/0000-0002-6469-1889; Yang, Kun/0000-0002-0809-2371; Lu, Hui/0000-0003-1640-239X; 													0930-7575	1432-0894				APR	2021	56	7-8					2113	2126		10.1007/s00382-020-05575-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-020-05575-x		JAN 2021											WOS:000605141600006

Effects of El Nino/Southern Oscillation on simulated phosphorus loading in south Florida	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												The El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a global climate phenomenon with strong effects on Florida's weather patterns. ENSO has been shown to have predictable effects on streamflow, rainfall, and crop yield; however, the relationship between N and P loading and ENSO has not been previously explored. Nutrient loads for a Lake Okeechobee sub-basin for 1965-2001 were simulated with the Watershed Assessment Model (WAM) and compared to measured P loads. The NS coefficients for simulated and measured monthly P loads were 0.73 for the calibration period and 0.63 for the validation period, which indicates "satisfactory" to "good" model performance. With a probable error range (PER) of +/-27.8% for measured P loads, the modified NS coefficients increased to 0.94 for the calibration period and 0.93 for the validation period. Results showed that ENSO strongly affected simulated seasonal and monthly phosphorus runoff. El Nino years produced seasonal peak loads of P runoff into Lake Okeechobee significant at the 99% level during the spring (February April), which indicates dominance of positive load anomalies. La Nina years produced significant seasonal peak loads in the summer (May-July) but with much greater variability in loads. Neutral years exhibited less predictable seasonal loading, although simulated P loads were generally similar to measured long-term means. Nutrient loading patterns during specific ENSO phases were comparable to previously explored precipitation and streamflow patterns in south Florida. This research has potential for use by land and water managers who can add short-term ENSO-based climate forecasts to their toolbox for reducing nutrient runoff.

J	Sklyarova, OA; Sklyarov, EV; Fedorovskii, VS				Sklyarova, OA; Sklyarov, EV; Fedorovskii, VS			Structural control of location and water chemistry of lakes and springs in the Olkhon region	GEOLOGIYA I GEOFIZIKA												The location and water chemistry in lakes and springs In the Olkhon region arc structurally controlled by Cenozoic faults of two types: I) inherited NE faults that follow the Early Paleozoic syncollisional (late stage) dextral strike-slip faults; ii) NEN pull-apart faults produced by sinistral strike-slip movements at the early stage of Baikal rifling. Water in springs has a generally low salinity (0.2-0.5 g/l) and compositions with invariable cations (Ca-Mg) and variable anions (from HCO3 to SO4-HCO3). The lakes we studied are fresh-water (up to 1 g/l), brackish (1-10 g/l), and saline (14-45 g/l). Fresh-water lakes have mostly Mg-Ca-Na or Mg-Na-Ca bicarbonate chemistry, the composition of brackish lakes is either HCO3-SO4 Na-Mg (Mg-Na) or SO4-HCO3-Cl, Na-Mg (Mg-Na), and that of saline lakes Is dominated by SO4, Cl, Mg, and Na. The composition of limnic water is controlled by the chemistry of feeder groundwater and by the grade of water metamorphism. Springs and lakes of different salinities show regular association with the two types of faults: Low-mineralized springs and fresh-water lakes are located within inherited faults, whereas most of brackish and saline lakes are attributed to pull aparts. There are two possible explanations for this regularity. (1) The water chemistry of springs and fresh-water lakes in inherited faults is closer to the meteoric water as the depth of their feeder channels is constrained by complex thrust and strike-slip geometry of older faults with shallow-dipping planes. Pull-apart faults associated with synrift sinistral strike-slip motions are discordant with pre-Cenozoic structures and drain deeper aquifers with compositions (Cl-Na) strongly different from meteoric water, Mixing of various groundwaters and their metamorphism may be responsible for the observed variations In total mineralization and chemistry of lake water. (2) The diversity of water compositions in lakes is rather controlled by metamorphism (most often cryogenic) of the feeder meteoric water, and pull-apart faults maintain long existence of relatively small lakes In which water evolution reaches a high grade.

J	Todd, MC; Mackay, AW				Todd, MC; Mackay, AW			Large-scale climatic controls on Lake Baikal ice cover	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Long-term records of winter ice duration, formation, and breakup dates ( 1869 - 1996) and maximum thickness ( 1950 - 95) on Lake Baikal are analyzed to determine the nature of temporal trends and the relationship with the large-scale atmospheric circulation. There are highly significant trends of decreasing ice duration ( and thickness) over the period, associated with later ice formation and earlier breakup dates. These trends are broadly in line with those of winter air temperatures in the region. Variability in Lake Baikal ice formation date, duration, and thickness is significantly related to winter temperatures over a wide area from the Caspian Sea to the Pacific and from northern India to the Kara Sea off the northern coast of Siberia. Thus, Lake Baikal ice cover is a robust indicator of continental-scale winter climate. Correlation and composite analysis of surface and upperatmospheric fields reveal that interannual variability in ice cover is associated with a tripolar pattern of upper-level geopotential height anomalies. In years of high ( low) ice duration and thickness, significant positive (negative) 700-hPa geopotential height anomalies occur over northern Siberia and the Arctic, complemented by negative (positive) anomalies over central-eastern Asia and southern Europe. This structure induces an anomalous meridional flow regime in eastern Siberia with cold ( warm) temperature advection from the northeast ( southwest) in years of high ( low) ice duration and thickness. Analysis of the lower-tropospheric heat budget during years of extreme early and late ice onset indicates that horizontal temperature advection is largely responsible for the observed temperature anomalies. These circulation anomalies are associated with certain recognized patterns of Northern Hemisphere climate variability, notably the Scandinavian and Arctic Oscillation patterns. Significant correlations also occur between Lake Baikal ice cover and the Pacific - North American pattern in the previous winter. The component of variability in Lake Baikal ice cover unrelated to these modes of Northern Hemisphere climate variability is associated with the position and intensity of the Siberian high.					todd, martin/I-4143-2015														0894-8755					OCT	2003	16	19					3186	3199		10.1175/1520-0442(2003)016<3186:LCCOLB>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0442(2003)016<3186:LCCOLB>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000185707600006

Sources and downstream variation of surface water chemistry in the dammed Waitaki catchment, South Island, New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS												This article presents the results of a pilot study exploring downstream changes in water chemistry in the Waitaki catchment, which drains the eastern slopes of the Southern Alps. The headwaters of this catchment are glaciated, and both natural glacial lakes and hydroelectric reservoirs occur in the catchment. The dominant lithology is calcite-poor quartzo-feldspathic metasedimentary rock. We sampled surface waters from streams and the inflow and outflow of lakes in the catchment on four occasions over the course of 1year, at c.3-monthly intervals between summer 2013 and spring 2014. We also sampled ice released from the terminus of the Tasman Glacier. Small but measurable variations were observed in the major element (Ca, Mg, K, Na, Si), trace element (Al, Fe, Rb, Sr) and Sr isotopic composition of the surface waters in the catchment. The composition of the waters is interpreted to reflect the change from calcite-dominated weathering near the top of the catchment toward more silicate weathering down the catchment that has been observed in other studies. The composition of samples collected from the uppermost part of the catchment displays more temporal variability than those samples collected from dammed lakes, suggesting that seasonality is dampened by anthropogenic modification of the catchment.					; Riesselman, Christina/H-5037-2012	Riesselman, Christina/0000-0002-2436-4306; 													0028-8306	1175-8791					2018	61	2					207	218		10.1080/00288306.2018.1465985	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288306.2018.1465985													WOS:000432730700007
J	Deaconu, LF				Deaconu (Stanescu), Luminita-Florentina			The Characterization of Heavy Metals Distribution at the Level of Abiotic Compartments of the Dambovnic River	REVISTA DE CHIMIE												We carried out an intensive study at the level of Dambovnic River, aiming to characterize the spatial and temporal dynamics of heavy metals in correlation to the catchment hydrogeomorphological characteristics and to obtain an improved process-understanding of heavy metals pathways. The monitoring program was conducted over a period of two years and revealed the influence of both point and diffuse emission sources and the particularities of adjacent ecosystems on heavy metals loads in water and sediment. Concentrations of Cd, in water column, are higher than 0,5 mu g/L only accidentaly and only upstream the river (lakes) or station D4 (Roata), being correlated with the industrial discharges of waste water, oil extraction respectively. The mean values of Cr concentrations, in water column, are part of a small variation gap, between 1.10 and 2.50 mu g/L, and decrease very slowly from upstream to downstream, showing a certain constancy of the composition. Unlike the dynamics of Cd and Cr concentrations in water column, Mn could highlight a seasonal variation, with minimum values during summer-autumn. The analyses performed on samples of sediment from the river Dambovnic showed a range with 0.025 to 0.300 mu g Cd /g dry weight, with a surprising amplitude fluctuation of Cd concentration in station D1a. Cr concentrations recorded higher values in station D1a (170 mu g Cr / g dry weight), indicating a correlation between the content of the sediments and reached concentrations of metal ions in water. Spatial dynamics of Mn content in sediments reveals slightly higher concentrations in sediments downstream stations, as for water, indicating the sediment-water correlation observed for other metals. According to results, the main compartment of Mn storage, in the river Dambovnic, is the water column. The most sediment storage capacity occurs for Cr.																			0034-7752					OCT	2012	63	10					1069	1074																WOS:000311927200020

This study was to compare the relationship between the WPSH and summer precipitation in Dongting Lake basin (24 degrees 35 '-30 degrees 27 ' N, 107 degrees 13 '-114 degrees 18 ' E) based on different datasets by employing the multivariate regression analysis. The observed precipitation data was from China Meteorological Data (CMD) sharing service system and the six gridded precipitation datasets were CFSR, ERA-Interim, CMAP, GPCP, CRU, and PREC/L, respectively. The WPSH exerted different influences on the precipitation of summer months. The indexes including westward extension ridge point index and northern boundary index in June, ridge line index and northern boundary index in July and August had important effect on the precipitation over Dongting Lake Basin. The gridded data could generally reproduce the relationship between the ridge line index and precipitation in July. The relationship between the northern boundary and the precipitation from gridded data was similar to that from observed data in June and July, while the relationship between the western extension ridge index and the precipitation in June could be reproduced by the gridded data except CFSR and ERA-Interim. Only in part area, the relationship between the intensity index and the CMD precipitation could be reproduced by gridded precipitation. The fitness of correlation in some area from the CMD could be reproduced by the gridded data. General speaking, GPCP precipitation data was more applicable to the Dongting Lake Basin in studying on the relationship between the precipitation and a single index of WPSH.																			1976-7633	1976-7951				AUG	2021	57	3					663	678		10.1007/s13143-020-00217-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13143-020-00217-y		AUG 2020											WOS:000560287900001
J	Schreiber, EA; Otter, RR; van den Hurk, P				Schreiber, Erika A.; Otter, Ryan R.; van den Hurk, Peter			A biomarker approach to measure biological effects of contaminant exposure in largemouth bass from Lake Conestee, South Carolina, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Sediments from Lake Conestee, a former reservoir now filled with pollutant-enriched sediments, located south of Greenville, South Carolina, USA, and other nearby reservoirs were collected and analyzed for lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Hepatic ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT), sulfotransferase (SULT), and erythrocyte delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) were measured in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) to characterize biological effects of these contaminants over three seasons. Results showed that total PAH concentrations in Lake Conestee sediments were significantly greater than the control during each season. An average 10-fold induction in EROD activity was observed at Lake Conestee compared with the control over all three seasons, indicating that PAHs present in sediment were bioavailable to fish. Significant gender effects were observed in EROD activity during the spring, in which activity in reproductively active female fish was significantly suppressed compared with the male fish. Sediments from Lake Conestee had elevated lead concentrations, but the lack of ALAD inhibition in bass indicated that lead was not biologically available. Total GST activity, UGT activity, and SULT activity were not significantly induced in fish from any of the affected sites compared with the reference site. Both EROD and UGT activities were highest during the winter, as were sediment PAH concentrations in Lake Conestee, possibly linked to seasonal resuspension events. The biomarkers measured in this study were useful as a first investigation into the biological effects of contaminant exposure, as well as in determining the bioavailability of contaminants in Lake Conestee.					van den Hurk, Peter/AFQ-0516-2022	van den Hurk, Peter/0000-0002-8131-0996													0730-7268	1552-8618				JUL	2006	25	7					1926	1932		10.1897/05-589R.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1897/05-589R.1								16833156					WOS:000240429200030

The results suggest that offshore sedimentation rates have exhibited considerable spatial variation over the past 8000 years, particularly during the mid-Holocene. We attribute offshore, mid-Holocene sedimentation changes to alterations in whole basin circulation, perhaps precipitated by a greater dominance of the Gulf of Mexico air mass during the summer season. Nearshore bays are characterized by high sedimentation rates for at least 1000 years after varve cessation and during a period between around 4500 and 2000 cal. BP. After 2000 cal. BP, sedimentation rates subsided to earlier rates. The increases between 4500 and 2000 cal. BP are probably due to lake level fall after the Nipissing II highstand. The older glaciolacustrine varve thickness records suggest that the influx of glacially derived sediment ended abruptly everywhere in the lake, except near the Lake Nipigon inlets. Multiple sediment cores reveal 36 anomalously thick varves, previously ascribed to the formation of the Nakina moraine, which were deposited just prior to varve cessation in the open lake. The PSV records support the observation that the cessation of these thick varves is a temporally correlative event, occurring at 9035 +/- 170 cal. BP (calibrated years before 1950, ca 7950-8250 C-14 BP). This date would correlate to the eastern diversion of Lake Agassiz and glacial meltwater into Lake Ojibway. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

However, between 12,400 and 8800 cal yr B.P., eastern Amazonia received substantial moisture whereas the Bolivian Altiplano was arid.

The decline of fishing amount during the years is improved by the artificial fertilization of koran applied both in Macedonia and Albania. Thereby, lake Ohrid reinhabited with about one million offsprings of Salmo letnica per year, only from the Albanian part. The technical enhancement of artificial fertilization makes possible the considerable increase of the koran amount in the hunting period. Meanwhile, the koran summer form, Salmo letnica aestivalis has resulted in a decrease of the fishing amount according to data fishermen. The main purpose of this paper is to show that the management of koran artificial fertilization is directly connected with the fishing amount. So the enlargement of artificial fertilization even in summer time, for the Albanian part, will result in the fishing summer form increased.

J	Domagalski, JL; Morway, E; Alvarez, NL; Hutchins, J; Rosen, MR; Coats, R				Domagalski, Joseph L.; Morway, Eric; Alvarez, Nancy L.; Hutchins, Juliet; Rosen, Michael R.; Coats, Robert			Trends in nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment concentrations and loads in streams draining to Lake Tahoe, California, Nevada, USA	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Lake Tahoe, a large freshwater lake of the eastern Sierra Nevada in California and Nevada, has 63 tributaries that are sources of nutrients and sediment to the lake. The Tahoe watershed is relatively small, and the surface area of the lake occupies about 38% of the watershed area (1313 km(2)). Only about 6% of the watershed is urbanized or residential land, and as part of a plan to maintain water clarity, wastewater is exported out of the basin. The lake's clarity has been diminishing due to algae and fine sediment, prompting development of management plans. Much of the annual discharge and nutrient load to the lake results from snowmelt in the spring and summer months. To understand the relative importance of land use, climate, forest management, and other factors affecting trends in nutrient stream concentrations and loads, a Weighted Regression on Time Discharge and Season (WRTDS) model simulated these trends over a time frame of >25 years (mid-1970s to 2017). All studied locations generally show nitrate concentration and load trending down. Ammonium concentration and load initially trended down then increased continuously after 2005. Some locations show initially decreasing orthophosphate trends, followed by small significant increases in concentration and loads starting around 2000 to 2005. Total Kjeldahl nitrogen, total phosphorus and suspended sediment mostly trended downward. Overall, the trends in various forms of nitrogen were observed at most sites irrespective of the degree of development and indicate a change in ecological conditions is affecting the nitrogen cycle throughout the watershed, most likely attributable to forest aggradation and fire suppression. Ratios of bioavailable nitrogen in the form of nitrate and ammonium to orthophosphate have also trended downward during the period of record suggesting a shift of these streams from phosphorus limited to nitrogen limited.

Climate change has significantly altered its hydrological cycle, affecting water source composition. To investigate recharge dynamics in alpine regions, precipitation, surface water, and groundwater samples were collected from the NRB in Tibet, China, and analyzed for hydrogen and oxygen isotopes. Precipitation isotopes showed strong seasonal fluctuations, with the lowest values in winter and the highest in summer. The local meteoric water line (LMWL) had a lower slope and intercept than the global counterpart, indicating notable sub-cloud evaporation. Along the Naqu River, isotopic values varied spatially, becoming more enriched downstream. Lacustrine water had a higher isotopic composition than river water, reflecting intense evaporation in Cuona Lake. The river's main recharge sources include precipitation, glacial meltwater, groundwater, and lake water, with variations between freeze-thaw periods and along different sections. Meltwater and groundwater dominated recharge in upstream tributaries, particularly during the freeze ignition period, while lake water became a key source downstream.HIGHLIGHTSMeltwater drives upstream runoff (52-93%) during thaw periods in the Naqu River Basin. Groundwater provides a stable 35% contribution across freeze-thaw cycles. Lake water contributes 87% downstream but decreases by 34% per 100 km.																			2709-6092	2709-6106				2025 SEP 27	2025										10.2166/wrd.2025.073	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wrd.2025.073		SEP 2025											WOS:001588407000001
J	ROCA, JR; RIBAS, M; BAGUNA, J				ROCA, JR; RIBAS, M; BAGUNA, J			DISTRIBUTION, ECOLOGY, MODE OF REPRODUCTION AND KARYOLOGY OF FRESH-WATER PLANARIANS (PLATYHELMINTHES, TURBELLARIA, TRICLADIDA) IN THE SPRINGS OF THE CENTRAL PYRENEES	ECOGRAPHY												The distribution, reproductive modality and karyology of populations of freshwater planarians were studied together with physico-chemical variables in 149 springs in the central Pyrenees. Diversity was limited to four species (Dugesia(Dugesia)subtentaculata, Polycelis felina, Crenobia alpina and Phagocata vitta), already known from streams and lakes. Planarians were found rarely (only a third of springs contain them), in low-moderate abundance, and any single spring did not harbour more than one species. The distribution of potential predators and preys among the springs sampled was fairly uniform. So, we assume that whereas predation is unlikely to influence triclad distribution, the oligotrophic character of these habitats may explain, through food shortage and ensuing interspecific competition, the presence of a single species in each spring. Besides interspecific competition, the distribution of each species can also be influenced by particular abiotic parameters. Temperature and current velocity appeared to be the dominant factors, the first separating C. alpina from the rest of species, and th second favouring the presence of P. felina in a large set of springs. These factors also seem to determine planarian distribution in streams and rivers. Other environmental factors such as calcium bicarbonated water (for D. subtentaculata) and preference for karst systems (for Phagocata vitta) are of importance. Some peculiarities of distribution, like the scarcity of C. alpina in reophile habitats and the thermal tolerance of Phagocata vitta, may be due both to competition from P. felina and to historical factors in the former and to morphological (presence of pigment) and ecological (epigean habits) features in the latter, respectively. Karyological analyses demonstrated triploidy in all populations of D. subtentaculata, a polyploid origin for C. alpina and the finding in Phagocata vitta of a new polyploid series leading to the highest chromosome number in turbellarians (14n = 238). Furthermore, the basic chromosome number of C. alpina (n = 21) and Phagocata vitta (n = 17) differs from those found in northern European populations (n = 7 in both, respectively). This suggests that under the specific names C. alpina and Phagocata vitta more than one species actually occurs, this being a problem for further studies. Whereas polyploidy has often been related to living in cold, harsh habitats, asexual reproduction has been linked to environments where biotic stress is low. The preeminence of asexual reproduction (by fissiparity) and polyploid forms in freshwater planarians inhabiting the unproductive, biotically unsaturated springs of the central Pyrenees adds new evidence to strengthen such links.																			0906-7590	1600-0587				OCT-DEC	1992	15	4					373	384		10.1111/j.1600-0587.1992.tb00047.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.1992.tb00047.x													WOS:A1992JU66500004
J	Molinari, J; Vollaro, D; Skubis, S; Dickinson, M				Molinari, J; Vollaro, D; Skubis, S; Dickinson, M			Origins and mechanisms of eastern Pacific tropical cyclogenesis: A case study	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												The genesis of Hurricane Hernan (1996) in the eastern Pacific was investigated using gridded analyses from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and gridded outgoing longwave radiation. Hernan developed in association with a wave in the easterlies that could be tracked back to Africa in longitude-time plots of the filtered nu component of the wind (2-6-day period) at 700 mb. The wave crossed Central America near Lake Nicaragua with little change in its southwest-northeast tilt, but the most intense convection shifted from near the wave axis in the Caribbean to west of the wave axis in the Pacific. The wave intensified as it moved through a barotropically unstable background state (defined by a low-pass filter with a 20-day cutoff) in the western Caribbean and eastern Pacific. A surge in the southwesterly monsoons and enhanced convection along 10 degrees N occurred to the west of the 700-mb wave in the Pacific and traveled with the wave. This had the effect of enhancing low-level vorticity over a wide region ahead of the 700-mb wave. Available evidence suggests that additional low-level vorticity was produced by enhanced how from the north through the Isthmus of Tehuantepec as the 700-mb wave approached. Depression formation did not occur until 6-12 h after the 700-mb wave reached this region of large low-level vorticity in the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Eastern Pacific SST and vertical wind shear magnitude are typically favorable for tropical cyclone development in Northern Hemisphere summer and early fall. Because the favorable mountain interaction and the surge in the low-level monsoons appear to relate directly to the wave in the easterlies, it is argued that the strength of such waves reaching Central America from the east is the single most important factor in whether subsequent eastern Pacific cyclogenesis occurs. Possible parallels with western Pacific cyclogenesis are discussed.																			0027-0644					JAN	2000	128	1					125	139		10.1175/1520-0493(2000)128<0125:OAMOEP>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0493(2000)128<0125:OAMOEP>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000084609300007

Existing knowledge on the variations and potential transport of atmospheric aerosols from the Aral Sea Basin (ASB) is limited. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study tried to identify the variations and long-range transport of atmospheric aerosols from the ASB in recent years. The Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) data were used to gain new insight into the types, variation and long-range transport of atmospheric aerosols from the ASB. The results showed five types of tropospheric aerosols and one type of stratospheric aerosol were observed over the ASB. Polluted dust and dust were the dominant subtypes through the year. Sulfate/other was the only stratospheric aerosol detected. The occurrence frequency of aerosols over the ASB showed obvious seasonal variation. Maximum occurrence frequency of dust appeared in spring (MAM) and that of polluted dust peaked in summer (JJA). The monthly occurrence frequency of dust and polluted dust exhibited unimodal distribution. Polluted dust and dust were distributed over wide ranges from 1 km to 5 km vertically. The multi-year average thickness of polluted dust and dust layers was around 1.3 km. Their potential long-range transport in different directions mainly impacts Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and eastern Iran, and may reach as far as the Caucasus region, part of China, Mongolia and Russia. Combining aerosol lidar, atmospheric climate models and geochemical methods is strongly suggested to gain clarity on the variations and long-range transport of atmospheric aerosols from the Aral Sea Basin.					; ge, yongxiao/K-1251-2012; Issanova, Gulnura/AAN-9181-2021	ji, li li/0000-0001-8483-1554; , Wu Na/0000-0001-7205-1390; Galymzhan, Saparov/0000-0002-6392-2032; Issanova, Gulnura/0000-0002-4496-0463; 														2072-4292				JUL	2022	14	13							3201	10.3390/rs14133201	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14133201													WOS:000824271000001

Therefore, the present study aim to present a comprehensive overview of the water quality state and pollution sources of the river. Some physicochemical water quality parameters were analyzed by standard methods along the surface water of river spatiotemporally. The concentrations of major elements and heavy metals (Na, Mg, K, Ca, Al, Cr, Fe, Co, Mn, Ni, Zn, Cd, Cu, Pb, As) were measured in water samples. Relationships between physicochemical data were assessed by using multivariate statistical analysis (MSA) methods. The order of the mean values of cations were as follow: Ca2+ > Mg2+ > Na+ > K+ > NH4+ (32.66, 26.82, 13.29, 6.45, 0.305; mg/L), and order of anions: SO42- > NO3- >F- > NO2- (7.88, 3.988, 1.01, 0.0316; mg/L). Increases in ion concentrations in the downstream zone have been monitored in the summer and autumn months. Average water quality index (WQI) 22, heavy metal pollution index (HPI) 15.61, heavy metal evaluation index (HEI) 0.78, and nutrient pollution index (NPI) 0.404 values indicated that the general water quality of Terme River was fine. All hazard quotient (HQ) and hazard index (HI) values in this study were calculated below the risk threshold (<1). HI-total values (2.48E-01) in children were higher than in adults (2.14E-01). This suggests that children's health is at higher risk than adults. Principal component analysis (PCA) data formed four principal components (PCs) explaining 85.22% of the total variance. These PCs revealed that the significant changes in water quality occurred from point and diffuse sources, including rock types of the basin, soil erosion, domestic wastewater discharges, and agricultural flow of inorganic fertilizers.					; TEPE, Yalçın/B-6587-2015; USTAOGLU, FIKRET/AAP-4558-2020; Taş, Beyhan/ABT-1207-2022; ustaoğlu, fikret/AAP-4558-2020	TAS, Beyhan/0000-0001-6421-2561; TEPE, Yalcin/0000-0002-8415-3754; USTAOGLU, FIKRET/0000-0002-8195-8557; TOPALDEMIR, Halim/0000-0002-4494-9715; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				NOV	2021	28	44					62736	62754		10.1007/s11356-021-15135-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-15135-3		JUL 2021						34215978					WOS:000669179700012

We applied cavity ring-down spectrometer measurements to continuously monitor carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) surface-water concentrations, covering the coastal archipelagos of Sweden and Finland and the open and deeper parts of the Northern Baltic Proper. This allowed us to (i) follow an upwelling event near the Swedish coast leading to elevated CO2 and moderate CH 4 outgassing, and (ii) to estimate CH4 sources and fluxes along the coast by investigating water column inventories and air-sea fluxes during a storm and an associated downwelling event. At the end of the heat wave, before the storm event, we found elevated CO2 (1583 mu atm) and CH4 (70 nmol/L) concentrations. During the storm, a massive CO2 sea-air flux of up to 274 mmol m(-2) d(-1) was observed. While water-column CO2 concentrations were depleted during several hours of the storm, CH4 concentrations remained elevated. Overall, we found a positive relationship between CO2 and CH4 wind-driven sea-air fluxes, however, the highest CH4 fluxes were observed at low winds whereas highest CO2 fluxes were during peak winds, suggesting different sources and processes controlling their fluxes besides wind. We applied a box-model approach to estimate the CH4 supply needed to sustain these elevated CH4 concentrations and the results suggest a large source flux of CH4 to the water column of 2.5 mmol m(-2) d(-1). These results are qualitatively supported by acoustic observations of vigorous and widespread outgassing from the sediments, with flares that could be traced throughout the water column penetrating the pycnocline and reaching the sea surface. The results suggest that the heat wave triggered CO2 and CH4 fluxes in the coastal zones that are comparable with maximum emission rates found in other hot spots, such as boreal and arctic lakes and wetlands. Further, the results suggest that heat waves are as important for CO2 and CH4 sea-air fluxes as the ice break up in spring.

In this study, a scheme implicitly representing a snow-fed wetland, in which snowmelt can be stored with consideration of subgrid terrain complexity, was implemented in the Minimal Advanced Treatments of Surface Interaction and Runoff (MATSIRO) land surface model. An atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) experiment was conducted using the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate, version 5 (MIROC5), with and without the wetland scheme, with the main aim of reducing the model bias of warm and dry boreal summer at mid-to high latitudes. The experiment showed not only a better surface hydrology but also a weaker land-atmosphere coupling strength and larger (smaller) latent (sensible) heat flux due to the delayed snowmelt runoff. The summer warm and dry bias was partially improved over snowy and flat areas, particularly over much of western Eurasia and North America, without an apparent deterioration of simulated surface hydrology and climate over the rest of the land in the other seasons; the mean absolute error of 2-m air temperature and precipitation over land at 458-908N in summer decreased by 19% and 4%, respectively. The next step of model development will involve implementing an explicit representation of subgrid-scale surface water and related processes.

J	Choi, KS; Kang, SD; Kim, HD				Choi, Ki-Seon; Kang, Sung-Dae; Kim, Hae-Dong			Interdecadal change in North Korean winter mean rainfall	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												In the present study, it was found that there was a significant climate regime shift in 1993 from average rainfall amounts in winter (December of a year and January and February of the next year) in North Korea over the last 30 years (1982-2011). This significant climate regime shift in 1993 also appeared in empirical orthogonal function analysis conducted using the winter mean rainfall amounts observed at 26 weather observation stations in North Korea. The reason why winter mean rainfall amounts in North Korea were smaller during the period of 1994-2011 than during the period of 1982-1994 was that anomalous anticyclone was reinforced in regions near Lake Baikal while anomalous cyclone was reinforced on the sea on the east of Japan so that the winter pressure system pattern (west high-east low pattern) appeared and thus anomalous cold and dry northerlies were reinforced in most East Asian regions including North Korea. To figure out the reason why anomalous anticyclone was reinforced further in the East Asian continent in winters during the period of 1994-2011, differences in water equivalent of accumulated snow depths between the two periods were analyzed. As a result, more snow was observed in most East Asian regions during the period of 1994-2011. Therefore, anomalous anticyclone could be further reinforced in the East Asian continent because surface air temperature dropped further due to snow-albedo effect. The surface air temperature cooling deepened further in the East Asian continent during the period of 1994-2011 due to snow-albedo effect was identified through differences in sensible heat net flux between the two periods.																			0177-798X	1434-4483				OCT	2013	114	1-2					169	182		10.1007/s00704-012-0819-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-012-0819-3													WOS:000324677900014

On the morphological variability of Aulacoseira baicalensis and Aulacoseira islandica (Bacillariophyta) of Lake Baikal, Russia	PHYCOLOGIA												Reliable identification of the diatoms is of crucial importance to understand the changing environmental signals stored in the sediments of Lake Baikal. Light and scanning electron microscopy combined with mathematical methods, including principal components analysis, were used to estimate morphological diversity in the structure of mantles of the two dominant species of Lake Baikal, Aulacoseira baicalensis (K. Meyer) Simonsen and Aulacoseira islandica (O. Muller) Simonsen. Species-specific features, such as areolar density, ultrastructure and form of linking spines, were found to be widely variable within cells of the same filaments of A. baicalensis. This finding suggests that the diagnosis of this species will have to be broadened. Besides the thin-walled frustules and the ability to form spores, the population of A. islandica in Lake Baikal is characterized by a higher density of areolae on the mantle compared to the published diagnoses, including the diagnosis of the subspecies helvetica. Morphological features of A. baicalensis and A. islandica are very similar in early spring when the cells produce auxospores, but diverge in summer. The most important distinguishing feature is the density of areolae-the number of areolar rows per 10 mu m and the number of areolae per 10 mu m of a row.

Holocene temperature history at the western Greenland Ice Sheet margin reconstructed from lake sediments	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Predicting the response of the Greenland Ice Sheet to future climate change presents a major challenge to climate science. Paleoclimate data from Greenland can provide empirical constraints on past cryospheric responses to climate change, complementing insights from contemporary observations and from modeling. Here we examine sedimentary records from five lakes near Jakobshavn Isbrae in central West Greenland to investigate the timing and magnitude of major Holocene climate changes, for comparison with glacial geologic reconstructions from the region. A primary objective of this study is to constrain the timing and magnitude of maximum warmth during the early to middle Holocene positive anomaly in summer insolation. Temperature reconstructions from subfossil insect (chironomid) assemblages suggest that summer temperatures were warmer than present by at least 7.1 ka (the beginning of the North Lake record; ka = thousands of years before present), and that the warmest millennia of the Holocene occurred in the study area between 6 and 4 ka. Previous studies in the Jakobshavn region have found that the local Greenland Ice Sheet margin was most retracted behind its present position between 6 and 5 ka, and here we use chironomids to estimate that local summer temperatures were 2-3 degrees C warmer than present during that time of minimum ice sheet extent. As summer insolation declined through the late Holocene, summer temperatures cooled and the local ice sheet margin expanded. Gradual, insolation-driven millennial-scale temperature trends in the study area were punctuated by several abrupt climate changes, including a major transient event recorded in all five lakes between 4.3 and 3.2 ka, which overlaps in timing with abrupt climate changes previously documented around the North Atlantic region and farther afield at similar to 4.2 ka.

From screening interviews conducted with l,118 fishers on-site during the winter and fall of 1996, the authors selected 60 Montrealers who consumed at least one sportfish meal per week and 72 who consumed less than one sportfish meal per week. Fishers at the higher level of sportfish consumption had elevated blood lead concentrations, compared with fishers who ate little sportfish (geometric mean = 57.4 mug/l vs. 48.2 mug/l, respectively; p < .05). This result was surprising inasmuch as fish is not considered a significant source of lead. In addition to sportfish consumption, age, sex, occupation, smoking, and waterfowl consumption also showed independent associations with blood lead levels. Among frequent (i.e., greater than or equal to 1 meal/wk) consumers of sportfish, ingestion of waterfowl was associated with higher blood lead levels (geometric mean = 69.4 mug/l vs. 51.8 mug/l, respectively; p < .05); this association was not present for infrequent consumers. In multivariate analysis, the association of higher blood lead levels with sportfish consumption could be accounted for in large part by waterfowl consumption among frequent consumers of sportfish.

Between 1770 and 1774 he travelled in the Middle and Lower Volga Region, the Orenburg area, Bashkiria, the neighbourhood of Lake Baikal and reached as far as the RussianChinese-Mongolian border. He summarized his experiences of the journey in his book titled Bemerkungen einer Reise im Russischen Reich im Jahre 1772-1774. A few years later he published an extended version of the Bemerkungen, titled Beschreibung aller Nationen des Russischen Reichs, a richly illustrated volume describing in detail the customs and religious life of 80 peoples in Russia. One of these is the Udmurts. Georgi tells us about the living circumstances, clothing, wedding and burying customs of the Udmurts and describes very thoroughly their gods, ghosts, holidays, sacrifices, also providing us with the Udmurt names for them. He writes about the main gods (Inmar, Kildisin, Mu-Kildisin, Sundi mumi), the evil god (Sajtan), the guardian spirits and the evil spirits (Vorsud, Vu murt, Palas murt, Ubir, Albaste). He also describes the sacrificial places (keremet and lud, kuala, mudor), writes about the sacrificial (vos, vosan) ceremony and about the mediators (tuno, utis, vedin) between earth and heaven.

J	Jepsen, DB; Winemiller, KO; Taphorn, DC				Jepsen, DB; Winemiller, KO; Taphorn, DC			Temporal patterns of resource partitioning among Cichla species in a Venezuelan blackwater river	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												In channel and floodplain habitats of the Cinaruco River, Venezuela, Cichla temensis was more abundant and larger than C. intermedia and C. orinocensis. Seasonal variation in hydrology influenced habitat use, spawning, and predator-prey interactions. The three piscivores partitioned habitat, with C. intermedia showing a strong affinity for structured habitats in the main channel during all water level fluctuations. C. orinocensis was most abundant in shallow areas with submerged structure in lagoons and, to a lesser extent, in low velocity regions of the channel, and C. temensis occupied a wide range of lotic and lentic habitats. During the low-water period, the feeding frequency and body condition of all three species declined, and this was related, in part, to preparation for spawning near the end of the low-water season. The diet of C. intermedia was least similar to its two congeners during falling and rising water. C. orinocensis and C. temensis had lowest diet overlap during the low-water conditions, the period when many individuals of these two species move into lagoons for nesting. Prey in stomachs were significantly larger during the falling-water than the rising-water period, and predation by Cichla and other large piscivores during the falling-water period may have reduced the abundance of large prey, particularly Semaprochilodus kneri. These migratory detritivorous fish were important prey for C. temensis during the falling-water period and probably contributed a substantial fraction of the annual energy intake for this species. Together, the three Cichla species consume a wide spectrum of prey from a diverse fish assemblage, but prey are subdivided based on habitat, prey type, and season.

Influence of lakebed sediment deposit on the interaction of hypersaline lake and groundwater: A simplified case of lake Urmia, Iran	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Lake Urmia, which was once the second-largest saline lake in the world, has been shrinking dramatically. Moreover, Lake Urmia has become supersaturated with total salinity averaging more than 350 g/l. Salt precipitation and dissolved materials brought by inflowing rivers have formed a layer of sediment with low hydraulic conductivity on the lakebed. Considering the flat bathymetry of Lake Urmia, we conducted a series of numerical simulation scenarios to study the groundwater flow pattern in the vicinity of the hypersaline Lake Urmia using COMSOL Mulliphysics (R). In the first step, we performed the simulations in steady-state conditions. Secondly, we simulated the lake level fall in 10 years at a rate of - 35 cm/year followed by a lake level rise at a rate of 35 cm/year for another 10 years. The steady-state results demonstrate that decreasing sediment hydraulic conductivity layer and increasing its thickness lead to a less intense saltwater intrusion, with lower saltwater flux from the lake to the aquifer. As the lake level begins to fall, in cases with high sediment hydraulic conductivity, incoming saltwater from the lake decreases and reaches nearly zero values through the time; instead, the lake begins to get recharged. On the other hand, as the lake level begins to rise after the falling period, the saltwater flux from the lake to the aquifer increases and finally reaches a value of nearly two times greater than steady-state results. In low sediment hydraulic conductivity cases, incoming saltwater from the lake to the aquifer remains negligible through both rising and falling scenarios.					; Simmons, Craig/H-7458-2015; Safaie, Ammar/ABD-1143-2020; Ashtiani, Behzad/AAM-7567-2021	Safaie, Ammar/0000-0003-3327-2224; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				SEP	2020	588								125110	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125110	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125110													WOS:000568826300069

The results are based on a winter road test conducted by the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR), for the Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT), in the Lake Tahoe basin, during the winter of 1989-90. CMA test sections and salt control sections were employed to make comparative evaluations. Road conditions were monitored during winter storms in test and control sections. Reports from maintenance personnel and road monitors were used to evaluate resulting responses of test and control sections to determine the performance of the applied chemicals. Operational characteristics of CMA use were noted by NDOT supervisors. Topics addressed include the minimum temperature of CMA and salt effectiveness, the nature of CMA and salt interaction with varying road conditions, clearing times and levels of service for CMA and salt, and operational characteristics of CMA use.

Catchment-scale dissolved carbon concentrations and export estimates across six subarctic streams in northern Sweden	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Climatic change is currently enhancing permafrost thawing and the flow of water through the landscape in subarctic and arctic catchments, with major consequences for the carbon export to aquatic ecosystems. We studied stream water carbon export in several tundra-dominated catchments in northern Sweden. There were clear seasonal differences in both dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations. The highest DOC concentrations occurred during the spring freshet while the highest DIC concentrations were always observed during winter baseflow conditions for the six catchments considered in this study. Long-term trends for the period 1982 to 2010 for one of the streams showed that DIC concentrations has increased by 9% during the 28 yr of measurement while no clear trend was found for DOC. Similar increasing trends were also found for conductivity, Ca and Mg. When trends were discretized into individual months, we found a significant linear increase in DIC concentrations with time for September, November and December. In these subarctic catchments, the annual mass of C exported as DIC was in the same order of magnitude as DOC; the average proportion of DIC to the total dissolved C exported was 61% for the six streams. Furthermore, there was a direct relationship between total runoff and annual dissolved carbon fluxes for these six catchments. These relationships were more prevalent for annual DIC exports than annual DOC exports in this region. Our results also highlight that both DOC and DIC can be important in high-latitude ecosystems. This is particularly relevant in environments where thawing permafrost and changes to subsurface ice due to global warming can influence stream water fluxes of C. The large proportion of stream water DIC flux also has implications on regional C budgets and needs to be considered in order to understand climate-induced feedback mechanisms across the landscape.

(2) The distribution of eight, rather sharply delineated, vegetation types correlates most strongly with water level variations resulting from the presence of a 4.1-ha convex peat mound. (3) A network of shallow ground-water wells installed in the wetland has identified an upwelling of water under artesian pressure at sites underlying the mound. (4) The well-buffered water, containing high concentrations of inorganic solutes, is derived from an aquifer that is recharged on an upland moraine and is confimed beneath a clay till sheet. (5) A breach in this clay layer beneath the mound allows water to flow upward and radially outward as the hydraulic head is dissipated in the overlying marl and peat. (6) The marl and organic lake sediments in the wetland were formed during the Nipissing level of ancestral Lake Michigan (4000-6000 years ago) when the wetland basin was probably a small bay of the lake. (7) The peat mound developed when the lake level fell from the Algoma through to modern times.

Boqueirao lake waters were found to be suitable for bathing but not for unrestricted irrigation. Rain contributed to fecal pollution to a large extent.

Moulds were present in all the samples but yeasts were consistently present in the high fecal pollution environments (chi(2)o=69; chi(2)cr=9.21; alpha=0.01), where Candida exhibited the highest diversity (7 species). The incidence of NSF, Candida spp. and C.albicans was higher in the more polluted waters, showing statistically significant differences (NSF chi(2)o= 26.2; Candida spp.chi(2)o= 12.96; chi(2)cr=9.21; alpha=0.01). Both streams did not present any significant differences in the number of taxa and fecal concentrations. However, the incidence of NSF and C.albicans was associated with fecal coliform levels. The results suggested that NSF, Candida spp. and C.albicans are potential indicators of fecal contamination in tropical semi-arid freshwaters. Regional studies on substrate diversity could lead to a better understanding of the distribution and richness of geofungi.																			0001-3714					APR-JUN	1995	26	2					90	100																WOS:A1995TC21000004
J	FORESTER, RM				FORESTER, RM			OSTRACODE ASSEMBLAGES FROM SPRINGS IN THE WESTERN UNITED-STATES - IMPLICATIONS FOR PALEOHYDROLOGY	MEMOIRS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF CANADA												Ostracodes are a diverse group of marine and continental crustaceans that have radiated into virtually all oxygenated aquatic environments that persist for more than about a month. Continental ostracodes live in both surface water and groundwater. Ostracodes living in springs and seeps have typically been the subject of systematic rather than ecologic studies. These taxa may or may not occur in other surface-water bodies. Similarly, lacustrine taxa may or may not be found in springs. Spring taxa occurring in other surface waters are often found in ponds, marshes, streams, or on the edges of lakes where groundwater discharge is important. Groundwater discharge, unlike lake water, shows limited and predictable variability in chemistry and temperature during the year. That level of variability relative to lake water may define particular ostracode environmental gradients. The gradients would range from stable, high-volume discharge springs occupied principally by spring species to high variability lakes occupied largely by lacustrine species. Ostracode occurrences may also be described by parameters such as temperature, solute (dissolved ion) composition, solute concentration (salinity, conductivity, ionic strength), and calcite saturation indices. A plot of these parameters associated with the presence of a taxon illustrates its physiologic response to the environment, a field. Three general fields bounded by chemical parameters are delineated by existing data. Those fields are as follows: (1) a restricted range and (2) a full range of fresh water, and (3) both fresh and saline water. Fields bounded by temperature and chemistry are also recognized. The fields also offer a way of describing ostracode occurrences in terms of hydrogeology and climate. If ostracode occurrences are limited by major chemical and physical properties of the aquatic environment, then their habitat may be defined by certain physical-chemical principles. The same physical-chemical principles must apply to the past. The ecology of extinct taxa may, therefore, be defined in the same environmental terms as those for extant taxa.																			0071-075X					SUM	1991		155					181	201																WOS:A1991FU07100011

Colin			Palaeovegetation in China during the late Quaternary: Biome reconstructions based on a global scheme of plant functional types	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Two previous reconstructions of palaeovegetation across the whole of China were performed using a simple classification of plant functional types (PFTs). Now a more explicit, global PFT classification scheme has been developed, and a substantial number of additional pollen records have become available. Here we apply the global scheme of PFTs to a comprehensive set of pollen records available from China to test the applicability of the global scheme of PFTs in China, and to obtain a well-founded reconstruction of changing palaeovegetation patterns. A total of 806 pollen surface samples, 188 mid-Holocene (MH, 6000 C-14 yr BP) and 50 last glacial maximum (LGM, 18,000 C-14 yr BP) pollen records were used to reconstruct vegetation patterns in China, based on a new global classification system of PFTs and a standard numerical technique for biome assignment (biomization). The biome reconstruction based on pollen surface samples showed convincing agreement with present potential natural vegetation. Coherent patterns of change in biome distribution between MH, LGM and present are observed. In the MH, cold and cool-temperate evergreen needleleaf forests and mixed forests, temperate deciduous broadleaf forest, and warm-temperate evergreen broadleaf and mixed forest in eastern China were shifted northward by 200-500 km. Cold-deciduous forest in northeastern China was replaced by cold evergreen needleleaf forest while in central northern China, cold-deciduous forest was present at some sites now occupied by temperate grassland and desert. The forest-grassland boundary was 200-300 km west of its present position. Temperate xerophytic shrubland, temperate grassland and desert covered a large area on the Tibetan Plateau, but the area of tundra was reduced. Treeline was 300-500 m higher than present in Tibet. These changes imply generally warmer winters, longer growing seasons and more precipitation during the MH. Westward shifts of the forest-shrubland-grassland and grassland-desert boundaries imply greater moisture availability in the MH, consistent with a stronger summer monsoon. During the LGM, in contrast, cold-deciduous forest, cool-temperate evergreen needleleaf forest, cool mixed forests, warm-temperate evergreen broadleaf and mixed forest in eastern China were displaced to the south by 300-1000 km, while temperate deciduous broadleaf forest, pure warm-temperate evergreen forest, tropical semi-evergreen and evergreen broadleaf forests were restricted or absent from the mainland of southern China, implying colder winters than present. Strong shifts of temperate xerophytic shrubland, temperate grassland and desert to the south and east in northern and western China and on the Tibetan Plateau imply drier conditions than present.

J	KERSHAW, KA				KERSHAW, KA			STUDIES ON LICHEN-DOMINATED SYSTEMS .20. EXAMINATION OF SOME ASPECTS OF NORTHERN BOREAL LICHEN WOODLANDS IN CANADA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												The existence of 2 major types of lichen woodland in Canada, Cladonia stellaris woodland and Stereocadon paschale woodland, is discussed in relation to their seral nature and their rarely developed theoretical climax type. Recent observations, coupled with previous descriptions from a wider area, suggest that S. paschale woodland replaces C. stellaris woodland in a more or less continuous zone from just west of Churchill across to Great Slave Lake, immediately north and south of latitude 60.degree. N. Both woodland types are often typical of sandy soils (pH 6 or less) and almost always represent the final recovery phase after fire. Rarely, the lichen surface is replaced by a continuous moss cover as the spruce canopy closes. The lichen surface is thus dependent on the lack of competition from higher plants, the absence of which is characteristic of the climate of this northern boreal region. C. stellaris woodland also occurs on palsas and peat plateaux where, again, lack of higher plant competition and a suitable pH exist. The recovery sequence after fire is a highly complex process and as yet only the following parameters were categorized. In the early recovery phases, limited soil mositure and hence a reduced summer latent heat flux enhance the sensible heat flux. The surface conditions are analogous to those of a hot desert with very high surface temperatures and extremely large diurnal temperature fluctuations. The physiology of these initial moss and lichen colonizers presumably enables them to tolerate these harsh conditions. The establishment of a few spruce seedlings and the subsequent development of open lichen woodland modulates the harsh summer temperature regime and allows the further development of a vegetated surface. After humus accumulation, which acts as an effective mulch, summer soil moisture is elevated, enhancing the latent heat flux and correspondingly reducing the sensible heat flux. This probably allows the full development of mature lichen woodland with its almost monospecific ground cover of either C. stellaris or S. paschale. Limited data suggest that the net photosynthetic responses of these 2 spp. is favored by the relatively warm mesic conditions established by the open spruce canopy. Good accumulation of snow in the winter is probably also important for protection of the lichen surface from low temperatures. The open nature of mature lichen woodland is apparently maintained by an active inhibition of spruce seedling establishment by the lichen mat, although the mechanism is not entirely clear.																			0008-4026						1977	55	4					393	410		10.1139/b77-050	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b77-050													WOS:A1977CZ85900003

Moreover, the REE signatures of Ash Meadows ground waters are similar to those of springs in the Furnace Creek region of Death Valley but different from shallow ground waters from predominantly tuffaceous alluvial deposits in the Amargosa Desert, perched ground waters from felsic volcanic rocks, and ground waters that have only flowed through the regional Paleozoic carbonate aquifer. The similar REE patterns of Ash Meadows and Furnace Creek ground waters support previous investigations that suggested ground waters discharging from the Furnace Creek springs are similar to the ground waters emerging from the Ash Meadows springs. The REE patterns indicate that the contribution of ground water from the Amargosa Desert to the Furnace Creek springs is of minor importance. Our REE analyses along with previous stable isotope, ground-water potentiometric surface relationships, and geologic structure analyses support ground-water flow from east to west in the fractured and faulted carbonate rocks beneath Ash Meadows, the Amargosa Desert, and the southern end of the Funeral Mountains. Our observations are contrary to some previous investigations that identified shallow ground waters from the central and northwestern Amargosa Desert as a substantial component of the ground water that discharges from the Furnace Creek springs.

Quantitative palaeotemperature records inferred from fossil pollen and chironomid assemblages from Lake Gilltjarnen, northern central Sweden	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Palaeotemperature reconstructions based on radiocarbon-dated fossil pollen and chironomid stratigraphies obtained from Lake Gilltjarnen provide evidence of climate changes during the last 11 000 years in the boreal zone of northern central Sweden. The records show consistent trends during the early and mid-Holocene, indicating low temperatures at 11 000-10 000 cal. yr BP, followed by a rising trend and a period of maximum values from about 7000 to 4000 cal. yr BP. At 3000 cal. yrBP the chironomid-inferred temperature values rise abruptly, deviating from the late-Holocene cooling trend indicated by the pollen-based reconstruction and most of the other palaeotemperature records from central Scandinavia, probably as a result of local limnological changes in Lake Gilltjarnen and its catchment. Comparison of the present results with a lake-level reconstruction from Lake Ljustjarnen, ca. 100 km southwest of Lake Gilitjarnen, shows that the low early-Holocene temperatures were associated with high lake-levels at 10500-8500 cal. yrBP, whereas low lake-levels and dry conditions prevailed during the period of high temperatures at between 7500 and 5000 cal. yr BP, probably due to high summer evapotranspiration and lower precipitation.

J	Gardner, PM; Heilweil, VM				Gardner, Philip M.; Heilweil, Victor M.			A multiple-tracer approach to understanding regional groundwater flow in the Snake Valley area of the eastern Great Basin, USA	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Groundwater in Snake Valley and surrounding basins in the eastern Great Basin province of the western United States is being targeted for large-scale groundwater extraction and export. Concern about declining groundwater levels and spring flows in western Utah as a result of the proposed groundwater withdrawals has led to efforts that have improved the understanding of this regional groundwater flow system. In this study, environmental tracers (delta H-2, delta O-18, H-3, C-14, He-3, He-4, Ne-20, Ar-40, Kr-84, and Xe-129) and major ions from 142 sites were evaluated to investigate groundwater recharge and flow-path characteristics. With few exceptions, delta H-2 and delta O-18 show that most valley groundwater has similar ratios to mountain springs, indicating recharge is dominated by relatively high-altitude precipitation. The spatial distribution of H-3, terrigenic helium (He-4(terr)), and H-3/He-3 ages shows that modern groundwater (<60 yr) in valley aquifers is found only in the western third of the study area. Pleistocene and late-Holocene groundwater is found in the eastern parts of the study area. The age of Pleistocene groundwater is supported by minimum adjusted radiocarbon ages of up to 32 ka. Noble gas recharge temperatures (NGTs) are generally 1-11 degrees C in Snake and southern Spring Valleys and >11 degrees C to the east of Snake Valley and indicate a hydraulic discontinuity between Snake and Tule Valleys across the northern Confusion Range. The combination of NGTs and 4Heterr shows that the majority of Snake Valley groundwater discharges as springs, evapotranspiration, and well withdrawals within Snake Valley rather than continuing northeastward to discharge at either Fish Springs or the Great Salt Lake Playa. The refined understanding of groundwater recharge and flow paths acquired from this multi-tracer investigation has broad implications for interbasin subsurface flow estimates and future groundwater development.

In the study area, there are no significant spatial variations of K-d(PAR), but the seasonal changes are obvious, with the highest value in winter and the lowest value in summer. Statistics analysis suggests that there are strong correlations between K-d(PAR) and SD, TPM, TIM, the value of R-2 are 0.7791, 0.7285, and 0.7637, respectively. The relationship between K-d(PAR) and DOC is less significant(R-2=0.1289). However, the correlation between K-d(PAR) and Chla was weak (R-2=0.006). Further study shows that, the impact of total particulate matters on the optical properties of water body is as a result of both seasonal impoundment of the TGR and particular hydrological condition of Xiaojiang river basin.																			1022-6680		978-0-87849-259-6				2010	113-116		1-3				840	+		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.113-116.840	http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.113-116.840													WOS:000291337700175
J	Wei, Z; Yu, YX; Yi, YJ				Wei, Zhen; Yu, Yanxin; Yi, Yujun			Prediction of Future Chlorophyll-a Concentrations in Large Eutrophic Shallow Lakes Under Multiple Stressors	EARTHS FUTURE												Assessing future chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) changes is crucial for developing effective lake management programs. Future assessments should integrate socio-economic and climatic factors, including extreme climate impacts. However, such assessments are lacking. This study developed a novel framework and integrated model to analyze Chl-a response in Chaohu Lake to climate (e.g., precipitation, temperature, and wind) and socio-economic (e.g., population, fertilizer application, and livestock farming). The results indicated that by around 2050, the Chl-a concentration would change by -6.5% to -0.1% compared to around 2020. While socio-economic and climatic factors significantly altered nitrogen and phosphorus loading, exogenous loading had a minimal effect on Chl-a due to high endogenous releases. The decrease in Chl-a is mainly due to the increase in precipitation. Chl-a reduction was primarily driven by increased precipitation (0.6%-12.9%), leading to -9.4% to -4.4% Chl-a changes. The runoff increase also provided an opportunity to treat the heavily polluted lake area. Air temperature increases of 5.1%-9.2% resulted in Chl-a increases of 0.9%-3.1%. On annual scales the effects of precipitation and temperature were mainly due to changes in mean values. The effects of variability were significant at seasonal scales, for example, lower spring temperatures favored a decrease in summer Chl-a. There was uncertainty about the impact of future wind speeds. This study emphasized the importance of comprehensively quantifying the impacts of external pressures in lake water quality assessment and provided a reference and pathway support for the assessment and management of large, shallow lakes.																				2328-4277				MAY	2025	13	5							e2024EF005293	10.1029/2024EF005293	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024EF005293													WOS:001485372500001

Spring phytoplankton bloom and associated lower trophic level food web dynamics on Georges Bank: 1-D and 2-D model studies	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												A coupled biological-physical model was developed and tested in one-dimensional (1-D, vertical) and two-dimensional (2-D, cross-sectional) domains to examine the spring phytoplankton bloom and associated lower trophic level food web dynamics on Georges Bank (GB). The biological model consists of nine compartments: dissolved inorganic nutrients (nitrate, ammonium and silicate), phytoplankton (large and small size classes), zooplankton (large and small size classes), and detrital organic nitrogen and biogenic silica. The 1-D model results showed that in the shallow central bank, the timing and duration of spring blooms are closely linked to the light intensity and its downward penetration, while the intensity of blooms is regulated by initial nutrient concentrations and zooplankton grazing pressure. In the deeper flank area, the bloom dynamics is directly controlled by the seasonal development of stratification. The interactions between the shallow and deep regions of the bank were examined by a 2-D model, which showed that the cross-sectional gradients of biological quantities were caused mainly by the shallow-deep topographic transition and tidal mixing. Between the shallow and deep regions, a possible phytoplankton maximum concentration area was seen in the model at the time before the formation of the tidal-mixing front. Once the tidal-mixing front was established during late spring, the model showed a relatively high concentration of phytoplankton near the front as the result of the tidally driven up-front nutrient flux. Both the 1-D and 2-D models captured the basic seasonal cycles of the nutrients and phytoplankton in the central bank, but failed to reproduce those patterns in the deep flank regions, where horizontal advection might play a significant role.

Laja Lake in Chile is a natural lake, which was formed by a volcanic barrier. Outflow from the lake is created by seepage through the barrier and via a controllable artificial outlet, which adds reservoir characteristics to the lake. Hydroelectric power stations have been built at both outlets. Downstream, water is diverted into irrigation canals, and the Laja River forms the Laja Falls, a popular tourist attraction. The previous operating policy preferred the most upstream water user and was found to be inadequate because the lake level decreased over long term. The current reservoir operation policy was established through stakeholder negotiations. This study investigated whether optimization (using Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II) can further improve the operation of Laja Lake while maintaining a fair balance between stakeholder groups. The results were compared with the stakeholder agreement and the previous policy. The main difference is in the spring when Laja Lake fills up before the irrigation season starts. The optimization strategy prioritizes hydropower generation during this period, resulting in reduced storage. Ultimately, optimization proves to be a valuable tool for identifying trade-offs and exploring different scenarios in water management.

J	JONES, B; RENAUT, RW				JONES, B; RENAUT, RW			CRYSTAL FABRICS AND MICROBIOTA IN LARGE PISOLITHS FROM LAGUNA-PASTOS GRANDES, BOLIVIA	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Large, pisoliths from the Laguna Pastes Grandes playa in the Bolivian Altiplano have a wide diversity of cortical fabrics and variable mineralogical composition. The cortical laminae are composed of radial calcite bundles, spar calcite, micrite, amorphous silica, mixed micrite-amorphous silica, quartz, gypsum and halite. Diatoms are common in the outer parts of some radial calcite laminae and amorphous silica laminae, but cyanobacterial filaments are rare. Although the organization of the cortical laminae is highly variable, some repetitive sequences of different laminae are present. Cavities in and between pisoliths contain micrite, detrital grains, calcite bundles and peloids morphologically similar to those found in marine reefs. The pisoliths grow in shallow ephemeral pools fed by hot springs. Radial bundles of calcite precipitate rapidly by degassing and photosynthetic removal of CO2 following spring snowmelt. Conditions for micrite precipitation are unclear, but there is evidence to suggest formation in partially stagnant waters, some of elevated salinity. Amorphous silica laminae precipitate mainly by evaporative concentration; quartz may precipitate from warm silica-rich spring waters that remain below amorphous silica saturation. The evaporite minerals form during desiccation of the pools or from spray. The peloids in cavities are probably primary precipitates. Different types of laminae may form simultaneously in different pools because of the highly variable conditions across the playa. Lateral migration of spring locations through time has created a complex carbonate-silica pavement. Large spherical pisoliths form in outflow channels near spring orifices and across discharge aprons where waters are several decimetres deep. With mineral precipitation, channels are filled and become shallow, producing discoid pisoliths and crusts. In shallow waters and on distal aprons only small pisolith gravels form. As spring pools fill with deposits, their locations shift laterally; new pisoliths form elsewhere or precipitation may recommence on older abandoned pisoliths.					; Jones, Brian/H-9935-2019	Jones, Brian/0000-0003-3088-5543; 													0037-0746					DEC	1994	41	6					1171	1202		10.1111/j.1365-3091.1994.tb01448.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.1994.tb01448.x													WOS:A1994PU26600008

High-resolution millennial and centennial scale Holocene monsoon variability in the Higher Central Himalayas	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Relict lake sediments situated within the transition of the lesser and higher central Himalayas show a persistent millennial to centennial-scale monsoon variability during the Holocene. Based on high resolution geochemical data supported by radiocarbon dating, six phases of enhanced Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) with varying magnitude have been identified. These are dated between 10,000-9600, 9500-9200, 8600-5800, 5000-4200, 3500-2400 and 1800-1000 cal yr BP. The millennial and multi-centennial-scale phases of enhanced ISM are broadly comparable with the existing continental and marine records from the monsoon dominated region of SE Asia, suggesting sensitivity of the regions to short-term climatic perturbations. Further, the study observed that the phases of weakened ISM largely correlate with the drift-ice record of the northern Atlantic implying a coupling between short-term solar irradiance induced glacial boundary condition in the northern Atlantic and the millennial and multi-centennial scale monsoon variability in the central Himalaya.					; Shukla, Anil/L-7858-2016	Bhushan, Ravi/0000-0003-1347-5446; Majumdar, Alik Sundar/0000-0002-7416-1611													0031-0182	1872-616X				JAN 1	2018	489						95	104		10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.09.032	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.09.032													WOS:000416501000008
J	Jones, AR; Johnson, JA; Newman, RM				Jones, Ajay R.; Johnson, James A.; Newman, Raymond M.			Effects of repeated, early season, herbicide treatments of curlyleaf pondweed on native macrophyte assemblages in Minnesota lakes	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												We examined the response of native aquatic macrophyte communities to spring herbicide treatments of curlyleaf pondweed (Potamogeton crispus) from 2006 through 2009. Eleven lakes were examined during our study; 8 were treated in May with endothall at 0.751.00 mg active ingredient per liter (ai/L) and 3 were used as untreated reference lakes. Macrophyte communities were assessed for frequency of occurrence in the littoral zone with the point intercept method in the summer after each treatment. During each survey, we collected biomass samples from 40 random locations in each lake. In the reference lakes, curlyleaf persisted at moderate to high frequencies over the 4 years, and no consistent changes in native macrophyte frequency of occurrence were seen. In most treated lakes, overall native macrophyte frequency of occurrence and species richness changed little over the 4 consecutive years of treatment, although shifts in the abundance of some species were observed. In untreated lakes, biomass varied between years, whereas in many treated lakes, biomass generally increased; however, these increases were usually not significant. The most substantial increases in biomass were attributed to single species in each treatment lake. Likewise, we observed substantial but insignificant increases of Chara sp. frequency and biomass in many treated lakes. Multiple years of treatment may be needed to see significant increases in overall native macrophyte abundance because significant changes in abundance were not observed within 4 years of treatment; however, consecutive early season, lakewide endothall treatments of curlyleaf pondweed can control curlyleaf pondweed without substantial harm to native macrophytes.

In southern Brazil the genus Neidium Pfizer has only been studied in floristic surveys, with little information and illustrations about the taxa that occur in lentic environments. We present the morphological, morphometric and structural features of three species [N. ampliatum (Ehrenberg) Krammer, N. iridis (Ehrenberg) Cleve. var. iridis and N. siveri Lange-Bertalot & Metzeltin] found in swamp and lake located in the northeastern region of Patos Lagoon, between the coordinates 30 degrees 10' - 30 degrees 40' S and 50 degrees 30' - 51 degrees 30' W; 30 degrees 14' - 30 degrees 30' S and 50 degrees 33' - 50 degrees 39' W. The study was based on analysis of samples collected in plankton and metaphyton in the fall and spring of 2003, in pelagic and/or littoral waters bodies. Morphometric differences were found in N. iridis var. iridis and N. siveri compared to specimens from other countries in America and Europe. This is the first record of N. siveri for Brazil and its structure in scanning electron microscopy are reported herein.

LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The plankton outburst during the so-called late winter bloom in subtropical waters was studied in relation to lunar illumination in the Canary Island waters. Nutrient enrichment by mixing and dust deposition promoted a bloom of phyto- and zooplankton. Mesozooplankton biomass increased as the winter mixing progressed but peaked in every full moon and decreased thereafter because of the effect of predation by interzonal diel vertical migrants (DVMs). The pattern was similar to the one described in lakes due to predation by fishes and confirms that this phenomenon is important in the sea. The estimated consumption and subsequent transport of epipelagic zooplankton biomass by DVMs after every full moon is on the order of the mean gravitational export and is an unaccounted flux of carbon to the mesopelagic zone that may play a pivotal role in the efficiency of the biological pump.

Depletion occurs as a result of the entrainment of reduced substances that have accumulated in the lake's hypolimnion over the summer. Recovery (return to near-saturated conditions) occurs over a period of 3-4 weeks. Observations of dissolved oxygen (DO) levels during the recovery period of two years are used to calculate the reaeration coefficient (K-a,K-20 = 0.22 d(-1)) in 1989, and 0.13 d(-1) in 1990) and the liquid film transfer coefficient for oxygen (K-L,K-20 = 2.64 m . d(-1) in 1989, and 1.50 m . d(-1) in 1990). Local wind measurements are used to develop an empirical relationship between wind speed (U-10, m . s(-1)) and K-L,K-20: K-L,K-20 = alpha .

However, little was known about the impact of phytoplanktivorous fish on spring phytoplankton community structure in the Three-Gorges Reservoir. In this study, an enclosure experiment was conducted to assess the impact of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) on the plankton community structure and water quality of the Three-Gorges Reservoir during 2 April to 2 May 2008. The field experiment was performed in six enclosures. Stocking silver carp into enclosures caused a dramatic change in the aquatic ecosystem. For example, pH, transparency, DO and phosphate were reduced, while chlorophyll-a concentration and turbidity increased dramatically. Furthermore, during the enclosure experiment, some zooplankton such as rotifer and copepoda were significantly reduced, and some phytoplankton and protozoa were significantly increased by silver carp. The predation by silver carp might have increased phytoplankton biomass through reducing the densities of some zooplankton which directly fed on phytoplankton. It was concluded that silver carp was not suitable for clearing spring phytoplankton (<20 mu m) blooms in the Three-Gorges Reservoir at the present time.

Survey of water supply and assessment of groundwater quality in the suburban communes of Selembao and Kimbanseke, Kinshasa in Democratic Republic of the Congo	SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												In many suburban municipalities of developing countries, the household drinking water comes mainly from groundwater including, wells, streams and springs. These sources are vulnerable because poor hygienic conditions and sanitation prevail causing persistence and recurrent waterborne diseases. In this research, a survey study on water resource use and an epidemiological survey of waterborne diseases were conducted among users of water points and medical institutions in suburban communes of Selembao and Kimbanseke (Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo). In addition, physicochemical (temperature, pH, O-2, electrical conductivity, and soluble ions: Na+, K+, PO43-, SO42-, NO3-, NO2-) and bacteriological (FIB: faecal indicator bacteria) analyses of water from 21 wells and springs were performed according to the seasonal variations. FIB included Escherichia coli (E. coli), Enterococcus and Total Coliforms. The survey results indicate that more than 75% of the patients admitted to local medical institutions between 2016 and 2019 are affected by waterborne diseases, including typhoid fever, amoebic dysentery, diarrhoea, gastroenteritis disorders and cholera. Except for NO3- in some sites, the water physicochemical parameter values are within WHO permissible limits for drinking/domestic water quality. On the contrary, the results revealed high FIB levels in water from unmanaged wells and springs during rainy and dry seasons. The microbiological pollution was significantly higher in the rainy season compared to the dry season. Interestingly, no FIB contamination was observed in water samples from managed/developed wells. The results from this study will guide local government decisions on improving water quality to prevent recurrent waterborne diseases.

Mineralogy, petrology, geochemistry, and chronology of the Murrili (H5) meteorite fall: The third recovered fall from the Desert Fireball Network	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE												Murrili, the third meteorite recovered by the Desert Fireball Network, is analyzed using mineralogy, oxygen isotopes, bulk chemistry, physical properties, noble gases, and cosmogenic radionuclides. The modal mineralogy, bulk chemistry, magnetic susceptibility, physical properties, and oxygen isotopes of Murrili point to it being an H5 ordinary chondrite. It is heterogeneously shocked (S2-S5), depending on the method used to determine it, although Murrili is not obviously brecciated in texture. Cosmogenic radionuclides yield a cosmic ray exposure age of 6-8 Ma, and a pre-atmospheric meteoroid size of 15-20 cm in radius. Murrili's fall and subsequent month-long embedment into the salt lake Kati Thanda significantly altered the whole rock, evident in its Mossbauer spectra, and visual inspection of cut sections. Murrili may have experienced minor, but subsequent, impacts after its formation 4475.3 +/- 2.3 Ma, which left it heterogeneously shocked.

Continuous Hydrologic Modeling of Snow-Affected Watersheds in the Great Lakes Basin Using HEC-HMS	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING												To reproduce historical stream flows, climate and land-use change studies require watershed models with physically based parameters, rather than empirical models that are simply calibrated. With this in mind, soil moisture accounting and the temperature index (degree-day) snowmelt models embodied in the Hydrologic Engineering Center's hydrologic modeling system (HEC-HMS) are applied to three Great Lakes watersheds-Kalamazoo, Maumee, and St. Louis-with different climatic and land-use characteristics. Watershed and subwatershed models are calibrated and validated on a daily time step using gauge precipitation measurements, observed snow water equivalent data, and physically based parameters estimated using geospatial databases. Results are compared with area-scaled outputs from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) large basin runoff model (LBRM) for historical conditions. The results show modest improvements resulting from the increased spatial resolution of the HEC-HMS models, in addition to the benefits of the more process-based snow algorithm in HEC-HMS, particularly for the snow-dominated St. Louis watershed. However, both LBRM and HEC-HMS models had difficulty reproducing peaks in late winter and early spring runoff, and discrepancies could not be attributed to any systematic errors in the snowmelt models.

Partitioning hydrologic contributions to an 'old-growth' riparian area in the Huron Mountains of Michigan, USA	ECOHYDROLOGY												Over the past century, annual snowfall has increased across the 'snow-belt' region of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, yet total annual precipitation has not changed, with potential impacts on hydrological processes and ecosystem composition. Using an integrated hydrochemical approach, we characterized groundwater discharge and quantified the contribution of snow- and rain-derived waters to groundwater for an old-growth riparian area within the Huron Mountains in northern Michigan. We then quantified the relative contribution of lateral, hillslope-derived groundwater and upstream lake water to streamwater, and the extent of hyporheic zone expansion and contraction during one growing season. During a period of above-average snowfall, yet below average growing season precipitation, similar to 80% of the riparian area's groundwater reservoir was derived from snowmelt. The relative contribution of groundwater to streamflow ranged from 70% in June to 100% in August. The remainder was derived from upstream lakes and wetlands, which dropped in elevation and relative contribution from June to August. Finally, the extent of the hyporheic zone was small (<50 cm from streambed surface) and contracted towards the stream during the recession limb of the hydrograph. We conclude that if snowfall continues to rise while total annual precipitation declines, in line with climate change scenarios for the region, then water fluxes from snowmelt will increasingly dominate summer baseflow and could potentially increase spring flooding. However, because of overall declines in precipitation, streamflow patterns will likely change towards lower overall flow following the influence of the snowmelt period.

Gloria			Relationship between the Concentrations of Dissolved Organic Matter and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in a Typical UK Upland Stream	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Concentrations of total and freely dissolved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were measured in water collected during four sampling events at five sites from the River Wyre. The sites are typical of streams draining upland organically rich soils in northwest U.K. Freely dissolved PAHs were separated from those associated with DOC using a flocculation method. The sum of concentrations of the total and freely dissolved PAHs analyzed ranged from 2.71 to 18.9 ng/L and 2.61 to 16.8 ng/L, respectively. PAH concentrations and PAH fluxes derived from concentrations and water flow rates generally increased downstream, the trend in the latter being more pronounced. The concentration of individual PAHs containing five or more aromatic rings was found to be strongly correlated to the DOC concentration (p < 0.0001), suggesting common terrestrial sources and hydrological pathways. In contrast, no significant relationships were observed between concentrations of PAHs with four or fewer rings and DOC. Concentrations of PAHs with more than four rings showed similar seasonal variation as DOC concentration (peaking in the late summer), while variation in two or three ring PAHs was out of phase with DOC (peaking in the winter). As the PAH DOC relationship appeared partly dependent on the molecular weight of the PAHs, a linear regression function that included an interaction between this variable and DOC concentration was used to model PAH concentrations over a 2 year period to estimate annual fluxes. The relationship identified between PAR concentrations and DOC should help to enhance interpretation of PAH monitoring data that are currently sparse both spatially and temporally and, thus, enable more robust assessments of the potential risks of these environmental pollutants to sensitive aquatic organisms and human water supplies.

J	Keller, W; Heneberry, J; Leduc, J				Keller, W; Heneberry, J; Leduc, J			Linkages between weather, dissolved organic carbon, and cold-water habitat in a Boreal Shield lake recovering from acidification	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												To investigate potential effects of climate change on lake thermal structure, we examined relationships between the amount of cold-water habitat in late summer (defined as the 10 degrees C depth), summer weather, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration over a two-decade period (1981-2002) in a small Boreal Shield lake recovering from acidification. DOC concentration, wind-days (the product of mean daily wind speed and the number of days between ice-out and late-summer stratification), and mean daily temperature were significant predictors of the 10 degrees C depth in a multiple-regression model. A similar model using simply the number of ice-free days instead of wind-days was almost as effective. The models were quite successful in explaining interannual variations in the 10 degrees C depth when tested on a chemically and morphometrically similar nearby lake. While factors related to summer weather were important in explaining interannual variations in the amount of late-summer cold-water habitat, increased DOC concentration over the study period largely explained observed long-term decreases in the 10 degrees C depth (increases in cold-water habitat). DOC concentration was positively correlated with pH. In acidified regions, increases in DOC that accompany the recovery of acidified lakes will need to be considered in assessments of potential climate-change effects on lake thermal structure.

J	Bonacci, O				Bonacci, Ognjen			Karst hydrogeology/hydrology of dinaric chain and isles	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												This paper gives a comprehensive explanation of the hydrogeological and hydrological characteristics of different water occurrence, which exists in the extremely complex Dinaric karst system. The area and boundaries of the Dinaric karst have never been precisely determined. It covers about 60,000 km(2) stretching the length of the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea, from the Bay of Trieste in the north, to the Drim River basin in the south, and the Western Morava River valley in the east. Due to very high infiltration rates, overland and surface flows are rare in comparison with non-karst terrains. The Dinaric karst is an extremely heterogeneous medium which can be explained only by the use of a great number of measurements points and by continuously monitoring and measuring different parameters. The hydrogeological and hydrological regime of all water phenomena in the Dinaric karst depends mostly upon the interaction between groundwater and surface water. The dominant flow of the groundwater contained in the Dinaric karst is towards the Adriatic Sea through rivers and many permanent and intermittent coastal and submarine springs. The paper presents many examples of karst water phenomena from the Dinaric karst: (1) springs (Jadro, Ombla and Crnojevica Springs); (2) open streamflows (Ljubljanica, Pazincica, Dobra, Lika, Gacka, Krka, Zrmanja and Cetina Rivers); (3) lakes and wetlands (Cerknica, Vrana, Plitvice, Vransko, Red and Blue Lakes); and (4) coastal and island karst (Brac. Island).

New evidence for persistent impact-generated hydrothermal activity in the Miocene Ries impact structure, Germany	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE												The extent of impact-generated hydrothermal activity in the 24km sized Ries impact structure has been controversially discussed. To date, mineralogical and isotopic investigations point to a restriction of hydrothermal activity to the impact-melt bearing breccias, specifically the crater-fill suevite. Here, we present new petrographic, geochemical, and isotopic data of postimpact carbonate deposits, which indicate a hydrothermal activity more extended than previously assumed. Specifically, carbonates of the Erbisberg, a spring mound located upon the inner crystalline ring of the crater, show travertine facies types not seen in any of the previously investigated sublacustrine soda lake spring mounds of the Ries basin. In particular, the streamer carbonates, which result from the encrustation of microbial filaments in subaerial spring effluents between 60 and 70 degrees C, are characteristic of a hydrothermal origin. While much of the primary geochemical and isotopic signatures in the mound carbonates have been obliterated by diagenesis, a postimpact calcite vein from brecciated gneiss of the subsurface crater floor revealed a flat rare earth element pattern with a clear positive Eu anomaly, indicating a hydrothermal fluid convection in the crater basement. Finally, the strontium isotope stratigraphic correlation of the travertine mound with the crater basin succession suggests a hydrothermal activity for about 250,000yr after the impact, which would be much longer than previously assumed.

J	Jones, ML; Shuter, BJ; Zhao, YM; Stockwell, JD				Jones, ML; Shuter, BJ; Zhao, YM; Stockwell, JD			Forecasting effects of climate change on Great Lakes fisheries: models that link habitat supply to population dynamics can help	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Future changes to climate in the Great Lakes may have important consequences for fisheries. Evidence suggests that Great Lakes air and water temperatures have risen and the duration of ice cover has lessened during the past century. Global circulation models (GCMs) suggest future warming and increases in precipitation in the region. We present new evidence that water temperatures have risen in Lake Erie, particularly during summer and winter in the period 1965-2000. GCM forecasts coupled with physical models suggest lower annual runoff, less ice cover, and lower lake levels in the future, but the certainty of these forecasts is low. Assessment of the likely effects of climate change on fish stocks will require an integrative approach that considers several components of habitat rather than water temperature alone. We recommend using mechanistic models that couple habitat conditions to population demographics to explore integrated effects of climate-caused habitat change and illustrate this approach with a model for Lake Erie walleye (Sander vitreum). We show that the combined effect on walleye populations of plausible changes in temperature, river hydrology, lake levels, and light penetration can be quite different from that which would be expected based on consideration of only a single factor.

It is an Ox-bow kind of lake which occupies an area of 34.32 sq. km. It is evident from the physical and chemical analysis that the values of dissolved solids (10.9 +/- 7 mg/l), total suspended solids 48.7 +/- 2.5 mg/l, dissolved Oxygen (10.9 +/- 0.7 mg/l), biological oxygen demand (4.8 +/- 0.2 mg/l) were more than the normal standard. The pH of water was observed as partly acidic and mostly alkaline. Out of the different nutrients, nitrogen (45.5 +/- 0.2 mg/l) and Phosphorus (1.2 +/- 0.002 mg/l) were more than the required amount. The productivity of phytoplankton was maximum in March (2.83 g/carbon/m(2)/day) and minimum (0.32 g/cargon/m(2)/day) during August. Aquatic plants were represented by a total of 35 species, whose number was maximum during rains, fewer during winters and minimum during summers.

Predicting the vertical distribution of the opossum shrimp, Mysis relicta, in Lake Ontario: a test of laboratory-based light preferences	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Light and temperature strongly influence the vertical distribution of the mysid shrimp, Mysis relicta. We monitored the vertical movements and depth selection behavior of mysids exposed to different light intensities and light-temperature gradients in the laboratory and derived a mysid light preference function in units relevant to mysid vision: "mylux''. Mysids preferred light levels between 10(-8) and 10(-7) mylux (similar to 10(-6) to 10(-5) lux) and rarely moved into waters of 10(-3) mylux (similar to 0.1 lux) and greater. A model that assumed equal weight and independence of mysid light and temperature preference functions successfully predicted the proportion of mysids found in two different temperature-light combinations in the laboratory. This model also predicted the depth of maximum mysid density to within 2 m on two spring nights and within 5 m on two summer nights of varying moon phase and thermal conditions in Lake Ontario. This study provides novel insights into how temperature and light interact to influence the vertical distribution of mysids. Our model may be used to predict mysid vertical distribution in any deepwater system inhabited by mysids in which the primary mysid predators are visual feeders.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JAN	2009	66	1					101	113		10.1139/F08-190	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F08-190													WOS:000264957200010
J	Raina, R; Smith, E				Raina, Renata; Smith, Erika			Determination of Azole Fungicides in Atmospheric Samples Collected in the Canadian Prairies by LC/MS/MS	JOURNAL OF AOAC INTERNATIONAL												An LC/MS/MS method has been developed for the determination of azole fungicides in the atmosphere at low pg/m(3) concentrations. Detection limits in the range of 0.16 to 1.2 pg/m(3) for a weekly air sample were obtained for the 31 fungicides analyzed. This work represents the first detection of propiconazole, prothioconazole-desthio, and trace levels of hexaconazole in gas phase atmospheric samples collected in a Canadian agricultural region. Samples were collected during April-October 2010 at Bratt's Lake, Saskatchewan, in the Canadian prairies where there was known historical use of selected azole fungicides. Atmospheric concentrations were above detection limits only during June-August 2010, with maximum concentrations occurring in July at 77.9 and 37.5 pg/m(3) for propiconazole and prothioconazole-desthio, respectively. Gas phase atmospheric concentrations of propiconazole and prothioconazole-desthio increased following a spring and early summer with higher than normal daily precipitation. These azole fungicides showed the largest gas phase concentrations during periods of lower temperature and during sampling events with at least 1 day with no precipitation. The higher atmospheric gas phase concentrations of each azole fungicide were observed on different days, indicating different formulations may be in use in the prairie agricultural region.																			1060-3271	1944-7922				SEP-OCT	2012	95	5					1350	1356		10.5740/jaoacint.SGE_Raina	http://dx.doi.org/10.5740/jaoacint.SGE_Raina								23175965					WOS:000310652300011

Skin and liver tumors were lacking in brown bullheads from Buckeye Lake, a reference site, and the incidence of lip tumors was low ( < 2%). Liver tumors, primarily cholangiocarcinomas, increased significantly (P < 0.05) with age in Black River brown bullheads, occurring in 28-44% of the 4-year-old fish collected in 1980-1982. External tumors did not increase consistently with age. Within year classes, the occurrence of grossly observable liver tumors was higher in fall than in spring. Liver tumor incidence was not correlated with sex. Organic contaminants were higher in brown bullheads from the Black River than in those from Buckeye Lake. Polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons were particularly high, including carcinogens such as benz[a]anthracene and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P). Limited electron microscopy of cholangiocarcinomas provided no evidence of virus. Since brown bullhead have the ability to hepatically activate B[a]P, and since B[a]P has been shown to induce cancer in fish, the hypothesis of a chemical etiology for the tumors in the Black River brown bullheads best fits the available data.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				JAN	1987	116	1					79	86		10.1577/1548-8659(1987)116<79:TFACCI>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1987)116<79:TFACCI>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1987M621300011
J	Guo, X; Chafetz, HS				Guo, Xuan; Chafetz, Henry S.			Large tufa mounds, Searles Lake, California	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Mounds that have formed around spring vents occur in a variety of environmental settings, many at sites generally difficult or inaccessible for sampling. In contrast, over 500 tufa mounds occur in the dry bed of Searles Lake, California. The mounds range from minor features to 45 m in height; most are 5 to 12 m high. These mounds, composed of calcite and aragonite, formed associated with spring vents in the Pleistocene lake bottom. Thus, analyses of these mounds in Searles Lake provide a model with regard to the origin and architecture of tufa mounds. The mounds consist of four distinctive tufa facies. The initial deposits consist of porous tufa, including the innermost (porous 1) and the outermost (porous 2) deposits, followed by nodular tufa, then columnar tufa, and laminated crusts. There are two simple sequences of tufa deposition. The first sequence is from porous 1 to nodular to laminated crusts and, finally, to porous 2. A second sequence consists of: porous 1 to columnar to laminated crusts and, lastly, to porous 2. Facies changes are a response to changes in environmental conditions from deep water (porous 1 facies) to an essentially dry lake phase (during and after the formation of laminated crusts facies), to deep water (porous 2 facies) and, at the present time, totally dry. The primary constituents that comprise the tufa deposits include thin laminae, pisoids, spherulites, peloids and stromatolite-like crusts. On the microscopic scale, these constituents dominantly make up nano-spheres, micro-rods and rod-like crystals, as well as other calcified bodies. These constituents are interpreted to be the calcified remains of bacterial bodies. These findings suggest that microbial participation in the construct of other mounds should be a major concern of investigation, both for terrestrial and extraterrestrial spring-fed mounds.																			0037-0746	1365-3091				AUG	2012	59	5					1509	1535		10.1111/j.1365-3091.2011.01315.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.2011.01315.x													WOS:000306362100005

Pollen spectra and insect fauna indicate that relatively wet grasssedge tundra habitats dominated during an interstadial c. 200-170 ka BP. Summers were rather warm and wet, while stable isotopes reflect severe winter conditions. The pollen spectra reflect sparser grass-sedge vegetation during a Taz ( Late Saalian) stage, c. 170-130 ka BP, with environmental conditions much more severe compared with the previous interstadial. Open Poaceae and Artemisia plant associations dominated vegetation at the beginning of the Kazantsevo ( Eemian) c. 130 ka BP. Some shrubs ( Alnus fruticosa, Salix, Betula nana) grew in more protected and wetter places as well. The climate was relatively warm during this time, resulting in the melting of Saalian ice wedges. Later, during the interglacial optimum, shrub tundra with Alnus fruticosa and Betula nana s.l. dominated vegetation. Climate was relatively wet and warm. Quantitative pollen-based climate reconstruction suggests that mean July temperatures were 4-5 C higher than the present during the optimum of the Eemian, while late Eemian records indicate significant climate deterioration.

We determined nitrogen recovered by rice and wheat, N remained in soil, and the losses of reactive N (i.e., NH3, N2O, NO3 (-), organic N and NH4 (+)) to the environment. Quantitative allocation of nitrogen fate varied for the rice and wheat growing seasons. At the conventional application rate of 550 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) (250 kg N ha(-1) for wheat and 300 kg N ha(-1) for rice), nitrogen recovery of wheat and rice were 49% and 41%, respectively. The retention of fertilizer N in soil at harvest accounted for 29% in the wheat season and for 22% in the rice season. N losses through NH3 volatilization from flooded rice paddy was 12%, far greater than that in the wheat season (less than 1%), while N leaching and runoff comprised only 0.3% in the rice season and 5% in the wheat season. Direct N2O emission was 0.12% for the rice season and 0.14% for the wheat season. The results also showed that some dissolved organic N (DON) were leached in both crop seasons. For the wheat season, DON contributed 40-72% to the N- leaching, in the rice season leached DON was 64-77% of the total N leaching. With increasing fertilizer application rate, NH3 volatilization in the rice season increased proportionally more than the fertilizer increase, N leaching in the wheat season was proportional to the increase of fertilizer rate, while N2O emission increased less in proportion than fertilizer increase both in the rice season and wheat season.

Phytoplankton size fractions (micro-, nano- and picoplankton) were analysed, as well as the abundance of bacterioplankton and planktonic ciliates. No permanent vertical stratification was found owing to the shallowness of the lake. Both nutrient concentrations and chlorophyll a values indicated highly eutrophic conditions, which are a consequence of a natural enrichment by seabirds. Significant differences in temperature between the 1997 and 1998 seasons strongly influenced most of the biological features. The phytoplankton community showed a high algal species-richness, with important contributions of epilithic, cryobiontic and soil algae. The dominant algal group was Chlorophyta, mainly represented by Chlamydomonas aff. celerrima, followed by Chl. aff. braunii. Some replacement of phytoplanktonic species took place in summer and was more evident in 1998. Picophytoplankton reached high densities, similar to those reported from other Antarctic lakes. Bacterioplankton abundances were typical of eutrophic and hypereutrophic lakes. There was a positive correlation between bacterial and total phytoplankton abundance. Ciliates reached some very h ah peaks, with higher figures than those reported for other Antarctic systems with similar trophic status.

Stratification and mixing dynamics of hypersaline Lake Urmia (Iran)	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: Lake Urmia, northwestern Iran Study focus: This study investigates the stratification and vertical mixing dynamics of Lake Urmia, a transboundary hypersaline lake under critical ecological stress. Using multi-year, high-resolution in-situ temperature and salinity measurements (2016-2019), we characterize seasonal mixing patterns and quantify the relative contributions of salinity and temperature to vertical water column stability. A lake-specific density formulation and thermal energy estimates are applied to assess buoyancy structure and overturn dynamics across contrasting seasonal phases. New hydrogeological insights from the region: Lake Urmia exhibits a dual-phase mixing regime, polymictic during the warm season with recurrent full-depth mixing, and inverse meromictic during the cold season due to salinity-enhanced density stratification. Salinity is shown to be the dominant stabilizing factor, while temperature plays a supporting role, primarily as a long-term tracer. The lake is classified as Hyperhalimictic, where mixing is governed by salinity rather than classical thermal stratification. A seasonal salinity pump mechanism is identified-winter brine rejection deepens stratification, while summer halite re-dissolution erodes it. Thermal inertia in lakebed sediments contributes to persistent cold-phase stratification. Findings indicate a trend toward increasing vertical decoupling, reduced overturning, and elevated risk of ecological stress. These insights support improved understanding of hypersaline lake behavior and can guide monitoring and resilience strategies in similar terminal lakes worldwide.																				2214-5818				OCT	2025	61								102697	10.1016/j.ejrh.2025.102697	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2025.102697													WOS:001585652600001
J	Park, Y				Park, Yongeun			Predicting trophic state changes in the Yeongsan Reservoir, South Korea: modeling and management	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Eutrophication is a critical water quality issue in lake systems. Algal blooms, in particular, cause severe water quality deterioration leading to reduced water clarity, decreased biodiversity, and depleted oxygen. This study assesses the potential variation of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration caused by climate change in the Yeongsan Reservoir (YSR) using the CE-QUAL-W2 two-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model with up-to-date hydrodynamic, meteorological, and water quality data. The influence of climate change on Chl-a concentrations was investigated by considering the spatial characteristics of changes in air temperature. Spatiotemporal patterns in Chl-a concentrations were used as a key indicator to evaluate the future trophic status in the reservoir system under climate change conditions. The results revealed that air temperature in the 2050s was lower than 2008 in the summer season, whereas higher than that in the winter season; the air temperature in the 2090s was higher than 2008 in the entire year. The variations in air temperature resulting from climate change significantly influenced Chl-a concentrations in terms of change in algal growth. There were distinct changes in the distribution of Chl-a concentrations compared to the current distribution due to changes in reservoir hydrodynamics. Overall, this study presents the benefit of an evaluation approach to assess the impacts of climate change on the spatiotemporal concentration of Chl-a with a reasonable prediction of algal growth.																			1944-3994	1944-3986				MAR	2020	180						111	116		10.5004/dwt.2020.25167	http://dx.doi.org/10.5004/dwt.2020.25167													WOS:000545003000012

The Influence of Large-Scale Climate Variability on Winter Maximum Daily Precipitation over North America	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												The generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution is fitted to winter season daily maximum precipitation over North America, with indices representing El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) as predictors. It was found that ENSO and PDO have spatially consistent and statistically significant influences on extreme precipitation, while the influence of NAO is regional and is not field significant. The spatial pattern of extreme precipitation response to large-scale climate variability is similar to that of total precipitation but somewhat weaker in terms of statistical significance. An El Nino condition or high phase of PDO corresponds to a substantially increased likelihood of extreme precipitation over a vast region of southern North America but a decreased likelihood of extreme precipitation in the north, especially in the Great Plains and Canadian prairies and the Great Lakes/Ohio River valley.

Climate warming impacts lacustrine thermal regimes, accelerates harmful cyanobacterial growth, and increases the probability of periodic anoxic bottom conditions. Legacy P in sediments becomes influential over eutrophication because of its reactivation under anoxic conditions. Lake Stechlin is a deep glacial lake of the Baltic Lake area, Germany in which artificial external P loading has been effectively blocked for more than 3 decades. The lakes trophic status was oligotrophic, until roughly 2 decades ago when it accelerated toward higher trophic levels. Here we analyse the temporal dynamics of Lake Stechlin phytoplankton biomass and composition in relation to chemical and hydrological covariates, based on monitoring data from 1994 to 2019 at sampling frequency of c. 27 samples per year. Our results show an assemblage change toward cyanobacterial dominance that took place at several temporal scales. Intra-annual compositional change became more pronounced over the study period, mainly because of changes during the autumn and winter seasons. Results from a structural break point analysis of the phytoplankton time series with covariates, and from a hierarchical cluster analysis show that major changes occurred in 2007-2011. An analysis of early warning indicators did not unambiguously support this period as a critical transition. The change rather occurred as a rapid succession of major events during these years. Results from convergent cross-mapping causality tests are consistent with the hypothesis that increasing relative water column stability may drive eutrophication, and additionally, that the intra-annual timing of the biomass change plays an important role in the lakes P loading. Although quantitative data on internal P loading are unavailable, internal P mobilisation from sediments appears to be the most plausible mechanism behind the increased phytoplankton biomass. Lake Stechlin, therefore, is an example of the challenges that legacy P poses to the management of freshwater ecosystems in the context of climate warming, even when external P sources are effectively blocked, and local protective measures are in place.					; Selmeczy, Géza/IXE-0106-2023; Soininen, Janne/A-4205-2008; Casper, Peter/B-7384-2011; Padisak, Judit/B-4514-2008	Soininen, Janne/0000-0002-8583-3137; Selmeczy, Geza/0000-0002-6386-2738; Casper, Peter/0000-0002-5956-4674; Padisak, Judit/0000-0001-8285-2896													0046-5070	1365-2427				MAY	2023	68	5					737	751		10.1111/fwb.14060	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.14060		MAR 2023											WOS:000957904900001

Impact of Urbanization on the Predictions of Urban Meteorology and Air Pollutants over Four Major North American Cities	ATMOSPHERE												The sensitivities of meteorological and chemical predictions to urban effects over four major North American cities are investigated using the high-resolution (2.5-km) Environment and Climate Change Canada's air quality model with the Town Energy Balance (TEB) scheme. Comparisons between the model simulation results with and without the TEB effect show that urbanization has great impacts on surface heat fluxes, vertical diffusivity, air temperature, humidity, atmospheric boundary layer height, land-lake circulation, air pollutants concentrations and Air Quality Health Index. The impacts have strong diurnal variabilities, and are very different in summer and winter. While the diurnal variations of the impacts share some similarities over each city, the magnitudes can be very different. The underlying mechanisms of the impacts are investigated. The TEB impacts on the predictions of meteorological and air pollutants over Toronto are evaluated against ground-based observations. The results show that the TEB scheme leads to a great improvement in biases and root-mean-square deviations in temperature and humidity predictions in downtown, uptown and suburban areas in the early morning and nighttime. The scheme also leads to a big improvement of predictions of NOx, PM2.5 and ground-level ozone in the downtown, uptown and industrial areas in the early morning and nighttime.

Scaling of pelagic metabolism to size, trophy and forest cover in small Danish lakes	ECOSYSTEMS												We tested whether pelagic light and nutrient availability, metabolism, organic pools and CO2-supersaturation were related to lake size and surrounding forest cover in late summer-autumn measurements among 64 small (0.02-20 ha), shallow seepage lakes located in nutrient-rich, calcareous moraine soils in North Zealand, Denmark. We found a strong implicit scaling to lake size as light availability increased significantly with lake size while nutrient availability, phytoplankton biomass and dissolved organic matter declined. Forest lakes had significantly stronger net heterotrophic traits than open lakes as higher values were observed for light attenuation above and in the water, dissolved organic matter, pelagic community respiration (R) relative to maximum gross primary production (R/GPP) and CO2-supersaturation. Total-phosphorus was the main predictor of phytoplankton biomass (Chl) despite a much weaker relationship than observed in previous studies of larger lakes. Maximum gross primary production increased with algal biomass and decreased with dissolved organic matter, whereas community respiration increased with dissolved organic matter and particularly with gross primary production. These results suggest that exogenous organic matter supplements primary production as an energy source to heterotrophs in these small lakes, and particularly so in forest lakes experiencing substantial shading from the forest and dissolved humic material. This suggestion is supported by 20-30-fold CO2 supersaturation in the surface water of the smallest forest lakes and more than sixfold supersaturation in 75% of all measurements making these lakes among the most supersaturated temperate lakes examined so far.

J	Smith, AJ; Turner, JV				Smith, AJ; Turner, JV			Density-dependent surface water-groundwater interaction and nutrient discharge in the Swan-Canning Estuary	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Salinity in the Swan-Canning Estuary, Western Australia, varies seasonally from freshwater conditions in winter up to the salinity of seawater in summer. Field observations show that the resulting seasonal density contrasts between the estuary and the adjacent fresh groundwater system are sufficient to drive mixed-convection cells that give rise to circulation of river water in the aquifer. In this study, we examine the role of steady density-driven convection as a mechanism that contributes to the exchange of dissolved nutrients, particularly ammonium, between the Swan-Canning Estuary and the local groundwater system. We present results from two-dimensional (section) and three-dimensional density-coupled flow and mass transport modelling, in comparison with Glover's abrupt-interface solution for saltwater intrusion. The modelling is focused on developing an understanding of the physical processes that influence the longterm or mean convective behaviour of groundwater beneath the estuary. It :is shown that the convective stability depends fundamentally on the interplay between two factors: (1) the downward destabilizing buoyancy effect of density contrasts between the estuary and aquifer; and (2) the upward stabilizing influence of regional groundwater discharge. The structure of convection cells beneath the estuary and recirculation rates of estuary water within the groundwater system are shown to be related to a flow-modified Rayleigh number that depends critically on the aquifer anisotropy and estuary meander pattern. The recirculation of estuary water by these mechanisms is responsible for transport of high concentrations of ammonium, observed in pore fluids in the estuary bed sediments, into groundwater and its eventual return to the estuary.

We estimated dreissenid densities at sites affected by warmwater discharges into Lake Erie (Nanticoke, Ontario) to separate the effects of depth and temperature. Both species' densities increased with depth. After controlling for depth, quagga mussel were more abundant at thermally enriched sites than at sites unaffected by the discharge. This suggests that quagga mussel may occur in deep water not because such sites are cooler in summer, but because they are warmer over winter because of the inverse stratification in the range 0-4 degrees C. Zebra mussels were unaffected by the warmwater plume at a broad scale, but were almost entirely absent from a site al the mouth of the discharge canal. This is inconsistent with previous indications that zebra mussel can tolerate higher temperatures than quagga mussel. Even in shallow water unaffected by the discharge, quagga mussel were more abundant than zebra mussel. Because Nanticoke was among the first places in North America to be colonized by quagga mussel, their numerical dominance at Nanticoke may be followed by similar changes in other nearshore areas of the lower Great Lakes.

Two types of large (up to 4 cm long) noncrystallographic dendrites are important components of these deposits. Feather dendrites are characterized by multiple levels of branching with individual branches developed through crystal splitting and spherulitic growth, Scandulitic (from Latin meaning ''shingle'') dendrites are formed of stacked calcite crystals and are generally more compact than feather dendrites. These developed through the incremental stacking of rectangular-shaped calcite crystals that initially grew as skeletal crystals. Feather and scandulitic dendrites precipitated from the same waters in the same springs. The difference in morphology is therefore related to microenvironments in which they grew. Feather dendrites grew in any direction in pools of free-standing water provided that they were in constant contact with the solute. Conversely, scandulitic dendrites grew on rims of dams where water flowed over the surface in concert with the pulses of spring water. Thus, each calcite crystal in these dendrites represents one episode of crystal growth. The orientation of the component crystals in scandulitic dendrites is controlled by the topography of the dam or surface, not crystallographic criteria. The noncrystallographic dendrites formed from spring waters with initial temperatures of 90-99 degrees C. Surficial water cooling, loss of CO2, and presence of other elements that can interfere with crystal growth contributed to the formation of these unusual crystals,					Jones, Brian/H-9935-2019	Jones, Brian/0000-0003-3088-5543													1073-130X					JAN 2	1995	65	1					154	169																WOS:A1995QE05100017
J	Mason, WT				Mason, WT			Macrobenthic monitoring in the Lower St. Johns River, Florida	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The macrobenthos in the oligohaline 132 km reach of the Lower St. Johns River, Florida, is an unusual blend of freshwater and marine organisms within the annelid, mollusk, aquatic insect, and crustacean groups. During 1993-1994, the community composition was freshwater-oriented in the 47 km (seg I) and estuarine-dominated in the lower 85 km (seg II). Of the total 146 taxa collected, 89% were euryecious 'eutrophic' and 'pollution-tolerant' organisms. Densities ran;Sed between 5000 and 20 000 individuals/m(2) ann av and maximum densities (85 000 individuals/m(2)) occurred in the muck substrate at the confluence of major tributaries and embayments. Throughout the lake-like seg LI, benthic hypoxia existed during much of summer through fall. Biotic index values for grab, artificial substrate, and sled trawl samples reflected greatest stresses to the macrobenthos then. Both low taxonomic diversity and densities of organisms at the most downriver stations nearest the port of Jacksonville indicated that toxic substances also adversely affected the macrobenthos. Maintenance of the narrow band of littoral submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) and adjacent shoreline riparian vegetation is important to sustain macrobenthic communities and other kinds of aquatic life in the river.																			0167-6369					APR	1998	50	2					101	130																WOS:000072674800001

Here, using survey data collected across 14 inland lakes in Jiangsu Province in 2022, we calculated wintering waterbirds diversity (taxonomic, functional, phylogenetic) and assembly patterns (MPD/MNTD of functional and phylogenetic). Then, we interpreted satellite imagery of lake areas and buffer zones (5 km), and partitioned them into three land-use and landscape index categories (anthropogenic, ecological, and lake landscape). Finally, we employed multiple linear regression and hierarchical partitioning to explain the influence of landscape scales on wintering waterbird communities. Our results showed that the diversity and assembly of regional wintering waterbird communities tended to be consistent across taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic dimensions. The standardized diversity indices indicated that functional assembly of communities tends to be clustered at both local and regional scale. In contrast, the phylogenetic structure showed a predominantly overdispersed pattern in most lakes at the local scale, while neutral processes dominated at the regional scale. Modeling showed that selected variables explained waterbird diversity and assembly well. Lake fragmentation increased species evenness but reduced other diversity indices, while landscape evenness was negatively associated with functional and phylogenetic assembly. Among anthropogenic factors, aquaculture ponds and impervious surfaces reduced all diversity dimensions, whereas cropland connectivity enhanced phylogenetic diversity. These factors had consistent effects on community assembly. For ecological variables, grassland area enhanced functional and phylogenetic diversity but led to more clustered functional assembly. Overall, maintaining the integrity and connectivity of lakes and their surrounding landscapes is essential for sustaining waterbird diversity and guiding wetland restoration.

Species-specific length-mass regression models were developed to predict the dry masses of the larval stages of Cladotanytarsus sp., Cryptochironomus sp., Polypedilum bicrenatum, P. nubeculosum, and Stictochironomus pictulus. The predicted dry-mass values differed by less than 20% from the measured values, suggesting that these original equations will be important in chironomid production studies. Regressions at the subfamily level were also developed for case identification at the genus or species level, which is difficult to obtain. The chironomid weights were determined directly and a dry/wet-weight-conversion ratio was estimated. The results were consistent with previously reported results. The relationships between the dry masses and the body lengths were compared with published data for different types of lake all over the world. We found that regression models for other freshwater environments somehow differed from those in Lake Maggiore, albeit slightly. The combination of diversity-based and trait-based approaches improves our knowledge about chironomids and our understanding of the effects of global environmental changes on freshwater biota. This first collection of trait data on summer-autumn chironomid assemblages in a temperate subalpine lake is a valuable contribution to the European trait database. The taxonomic diversity and abundance of chironomids were uploaded for open access on the GBIF platform.

The temporal evolution of this mechanism is related to biotic and abiotic processes that produce mercury in its elemental form and as DGM. The efficiency of these processes depends upon the intensity of the solar radiation, the ambient temperature of the air parcel above the seawater, and the water temperature. In the Mediterranean region, the magnitude of these mechanisms are particularly significant, due to favorable climate conditions and to the presence of large cinnabar deposits that cross the whole region; all these synergic factors yield significant evasional fluxes of mercury from the surface water during most of the annual period. In this work, mercury fluxes were measured by using a floating flux chamber connected to an atomic absorption analyzer. Photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) and UV components of the solar radiation were measured using the same system adopted in the EC 'ELDONet project'. The measurements of the mercury evasional fluxes were carried out at three sites of the northern Tyrrhenian Sea during 1998. Two sites were located at unpolluted and polluted coastal areas, and the third was an offshore site. The evasional flux showed a typical daily trend, highest at midday when the ambient temperature and solar radiation were at the maximum, and lowest, near to zero, during the night. Besides the day-night behavior, a seasonal trend was also observed; with minimum values during the winter period (0.7-2.0 ng/m(2) h) and maximum values during the summer (10-13 ng/m(2) h).

Chlorination Cessation Alters Greenhouse Gas Dynamics in Artificial Urban Ponds	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Cities are facing an ecological challenge, and international policies are increasingly focused on implementing nature-based solutions to support this transition. In this context, the naturalization of artificial urban ponds (AUP) is a promising approach with proved benefits for biodiversity and human well-being. However, the naturalization of AUP may be accompanied by increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Here, we evaluated the effect of chlorination cessation, an essential step in the naturalization process, on GHG dynamics in AUP. Partial pressures of CO2 (pCO2), CH4 (pCH4), and N2O (pN2O) were measured in 41 artificial urban ponds (28 non-chlorinated and 13 chlorinated) in the city of Barcelona during winter and summer to assess: (a) the effect of chlorination treatment, (b) the effect of seasonality, and (c) the main drivers behind the partial pressures of these GHGs. Results show that although chlorination cessation increased pCH4, it reduced pN2O and had no significant effect on pCO2. The main drivers of these patterns were naturalization, with factors related to primary production playing a major role; seasonality, with temperature as a key environmental variable; and groundwater legacy. Importantly, the net global warming potential (GWP), expressed as CO2 equivalents, was not significantly higher in non-chlorinated ponds. These findings suggest that the naturalization of artificial water bodies could be a viable strategy to create more resilient cities without significantly increasing GHG emissions.

Once completed, the period covered will span from 1950 to the present, with continuous updates to support land monitoring applications. ERA5-Land describes the evolution of the water and energy cycles over land in a consistent manner over the production period, which, among others, could be used to analyse trends and anomalies. This is achieved through global high-resolution numerical integrations of the ECMWF land surface model driven by the downscaled meteorological forcing from the ERA5 climate reanalysis, including an elevation correction for the thermodynamic near-surface state. ERA5-Land shares with ERA5 most of the parameterizations that guarantees the use of the state-of-the-art land surface modelling applied to numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. A main advantage of ERA5-Land compared to ERA5 and the older ERA-Interim is the horizontal resolution, which is enhanced globally to 9 km compared to 31 km (ERA5) or 80 km (ERA-Interim), whereas the temporal resolution is hourly as in ERA5. Evaluation against independent in situ observations and global model or satellite-based reference datasets shows the added value of ERA5-Land in the description of the hydrological cycle, in particular with enhanced soil moisture and lake description, and an overall better agreement of river discharge estimations with available observations. However, ERA5-Land snow depth fields present a mixed performance when compared to those of ERA5, depending on geographical location and altitude. The description of the energy cycle shows comparable results with ERA5. Nevertheless, ERA5-Land reduces the global averaged root mean square error of the skin temperature, taking as reference MODIS data, mainly due to the contribution of coastal points where spatial resolution is important. Since January 2020, the ERA5-Land period available has extended from January 1981 to the near present, with a 2- to 3-month delay with respect to real time. The segment prior to 1981 is in production, aiming for a release of the whole dataset in summer/autumn 2021. The high spatial and temporal resolution of ERA5-Land, its extended period, and the consistency of the fields produced makes it a valuable dataset to support hydrological studies, to initialize NWP and climate models, and to support diverse applications dealing with water resource, land, and environmental management.					; Dutra, Emanuel/A-3774-2010; Harrigan, Shaun/X-5048-2019; Buontempo, Carlo/GLQ-7538-2022; Harrigan, Shaun/C-9370-2014; Balsamo, Gianpaolo/I-3362-2013; Piles, Maria/M-1057-2014; Albergel, Clement/B-8896-2012; Rodriguez-Fernandez, Nemesio Jose/N-7710-2015; Thepaut, Jean-Noel/IWU-7629-2023; Rodriguez-Fernandez, Nemesio/N-7710-2015; Miralles, Diego/K-8857-2013	Choulga, Margarita/0000-0003-4393-931X; Dutra, Emanuel/0000-0002-0643-2643; Albergel, Clement/0000-0003-1095-2702; Boussetta, Souhail/0000-0001-8646-8701; Munoz-Sabater, Joaquin/0000-0002-5997-290X; Harrigan, Shaun/0000-0002-0992-3667; Balsamo, Gianpaolo/0000-0002-1745-3634; Piles, Maria/0000-0002-1169-3098; Rodriguez-Fernandez, Nemesio Jose/0000-0003-3796-149X; 													1866-3508	1866-3516				SEP 7	2021	13	9					4349	4383		10.5194/essd-13-4349-2021	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-4349-2021													WOS:000695408800002

Evaluation of Nitrate-Nitrogen Leaching From Lysimeter-Grown Bearing Apple Trees	SOIL SCIENCE												A 2-year investigation was conducted on eight replicate plots located 30 miles east of Lake Michigan on sand to sandy-clay-loam soil, using 1.8-m-deep lysimeters (4.8 m(3) of volume), consisting of an undisturbed monolith excavated from the soil and containing a bearing (2- to 3-year-old) apple tree each. The aims of this research were to study the leaching rate and migration time of nitrate-N (NO3--N) through the soil profile and to assess the suitability of soil suction tube (SST) water samples to predict the NO3--N leaching rate. The NO3--N concentration in the water collected by the lysimeters ranged from less than 10 mg L-1 (in late summer) to more than 40 mg L-1 (in winter). We calculated that NO3--N lost via leaching in a year amounts up to 141 kg ha(-1), with the most potential for groundwater pollution occurring during the cold and wet season. The application of labeled N ammonium nitrate as fertilizer increased the concentration of NO3--N in the solution collected by SST. Labeled N was found at the bottom of lysimeters 3 months after its application, leaching through the soil profile at a speed of 2 cm day(-1), so that the NO3--N concentration of SST was correlated significantly with NO3--N concentration of lysimeters only when the time of movement was considered. The application of fertilizer did not increase the amount of NO3--N collected by lysimeters, meaning that the NO3--N leaching rate is mostly the result of the breakdown of soil organic matter.					, moreno/Q-9591-2016	, moreno/0000-0001-5632-6331													0038-075X	1538-9243				JUN	2011	176	6					280	287		10.1097/SS.0b013e318219db11	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/SS.0b013e318219db11													WOS:000291202300003

Model output is compared with measurements of total phosphorus, chlorophyll-a and zooplankton biomass recorded in twelve high-altitude mountain lakes in the Gran Paradiso National Park (northwestern Italy) during the summer season from 2006 to 2009. Model results are consistent with measured data, indicating the appropriateness of this modeling approach for quantitatively studying mountain lake ecosystems and their response to environmental changes. The comparison between the results obtained for lakes without fish and those where the allochthonous brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) was introduced clearly indicates the strong impact of fish stocking in alpine lakes.

We infer variations in large-scale atmospheric circulation systems by combining in-lake productivity indicators obtained from traditional and high-resolution techniques (e.g. LOI550, TOC, inc / coh), diatom assemblages, and compound-specific hydrogen isotopes (delta 2HC25). Before 105+95/-75 cal BP (similar to 1850 CE), changes in productivity and the occurrence or disappearance of the diatom species Stephanocostis chantaicus reflect winter temperature variability, while variations in the compound-specific hydrogen isotopes suggest changes in the moisture source region. We observe distinct variations between (i) milder winter temperatures with a moisture source region in the southern-central North Atlantic and (ii) colder winter temperatures with a moisture source in the northern North Atlantic and/or Arctic regions. Such distinct variations in winter temperature and moisture source region are mainly modulated by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). This affects, among others, westerly wind strength and pathways and, thereby, winter temperature and moisture source region for northern central Europe. Besides these long-term shifts in atmospheric conditions, short-term variations in titanium can be linked to lake-level variability, most likely influenced by changes in precipitation and/or evaporation, and after the 12th century to anthropogenic impacts. Since 105+95/-75 cal BP (similar to 1850 CE), productivity has been driven predominantly by nutrient availability related to anthropogenic activities masking the hydroclimatic signal.

To this aim, the continuous microclimate monitoring of (i) a rural area; (ii) a suburban area; and (iii) an urban area is carried out, and the comparative analysis of the different boundary conditions is performed. In particular, the effect of the presence of a large lake in the rural area on building energy demand for heating and cooling is evaluated, both in winter and summer. Coupled degree hour method and numerical analysis are performed in order to predict the energy requirement of buildings subject to local microclimate boundary conditions. The main results show higher air temperature and relative humidity values for the rural area. No significant mitigation effect due to the lake presence is found in urban and suburban areas because of the peculiar wind regime of the region. Additionally, the dynamic thermal-energy simulation shows a decrease of 14% and 25% in the heating consumption and an increase of 58% and 194% in cooling requirements of buildings situated in the rural area around the lake compared to the urban and suburban areas, respectively.

Seven character states qualitatively describe the behaviour of the pollen percentage trends for each taxon: 0, absent; 1, present with no visible trend but high noise; 2, rising through time; 3, falling through time; 4, rise-fall; 5, fall-rise; and 6, stable through time. The three similarity indices (S) used were of the form S equals the number of characters in agreement divided by the number of informative characters. The three clustering techniques used are single linkage, complete linkage, and unpaired weighted geometric mean analysis. Single linkage and unpaired weighted geometric mean analysis showed a north-south division with all three indices; complete linkage showed only rare local groupings with all three indices. The division between the two clusters falls just south of Lake Nipissing. All successions indicate climatic cooling; the clusters reflect southward movement of the centres of species abundances, particularly white pine. The method identifies regions of similar vegetation dynamics.					campbell, ian/C-5291-2011	Campbell, Ian/0000-0002-9639-1995													0008-4026					AUG	1991	69	8					1719	1730		10.1139/b91-219	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b91-219													WOS:A1991GL09800013

They are assumed to be an ideal biomonitoring tool in long-term monitoring programs implemented by the EU Water Framework Directive due to their sensitivity to environmental factors. Therefore, this study focuses on the evaluation of the ecological status in Lake Sapanca using macrophyte composition and abundance in order to make future predictions on the health of aquatic ecosystems and to form effective management. Submerged macrophyte assemblages related to environmental parameters were investigated from February to November of 2017. A total of 12 submerged macrophyte species were recorded in the littoral zone of the lake. The main findings on the most dominant 7 species of this community indicated significant differences among stations and seasons. They also revealed that submerged macrophyte density was shaped in relation to environmental variables, particularly temperature and nutrients. Submerged macrophyte assemblages reached their highest species number and biomass value (5312 gm(-2)) in summer, while no species was recorded in winter. High biomass values of these species corresponded with lower macrophyte diversity. The macrophyte index results demonstrated that Lake Sapanca is at a critical level in terms of nutrient enrichment. More frequent observation of species such as Ceratophyllum demersum and Elodea canadensis, which indicated "massive" nutrient enrichment, revealed that the ecological status of the lake varies from meso-to eutrophic at the local level.					; AKTAN TURAN, Yelda/AAD-1812-2020	Aktan Turan, Yelda/0000-0001-7920-8979; guresen, aysu/0000-0001-9919-1545													1300-008X	1303-6106					2020	44	5					552	562		10.3906/bot-2002-23	http://dx.doi.org/10.3906/bot-2002-23													WOS:000572677300006

No significant effect of winter drawdown on species richness was recorded across lakes. Total fish density for stony bottoms of the regulated and reference lakes averaged 19.3 and 32.7 individuals per 100 m(2), respectively, but this difference was not statistically significant. The combined proportion of littoral fish species, including minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus), bullhead (Cottus gobio), alpine bullhead (Cottus poecilopus), nine-spined stickleback (Pungitius pungitius), and stone loach (Barbatula barbatula), supplemented with zoobenthos feeders ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus) and young burbot (Lota lota), was much lower in the regulated lakes than in the reference lakes. Besides winter drawdown, other variables, such as nutrient level and lake size, affected the fish community.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2008	613						13	20		10.1007/s10750-008-9468-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-008-9468-z													WOS:000258401000003

Subsequent excavations of archaeological level 22 (FLK Zinj) Bed I uncovered remains of Homo habilis and a high-density collection of fossils and Oldowan stone tools. The occurrence of this unusual collection of bones and tools at this specific location has been controversial for decades. We present paleoecological data that provide new insights into the origin of FLK Zinj. Our recent excavations 200 m north of the site uncovered a 0.5-m-thick tufa mound draped by Tuff IC, in the same stratigraphic horizon as level 22. Stable isotope analyses indicate that the carbonates were deposited by a freshwater spring. Phytolith analysis of the waxy clay under Tuff IC revealed abundant woody dicotyledon and palm phytoliths, indicating that the site was wooded to densely wooded. The time equivalency and close physical proximity of the two environments indicate the two are related. This study has provided the first documented evidence of springs in Bed land these data have important implications for the interpretation of hominin behavior in meat acquisition and the ongoing debate on scavenging versus hunting.

The present study focused on updating existing estimates of the riverine nutrient contributions and on improving the favailable information on temporal and spatial variation in such input. The results show that the gulf received an average of 113,300 tons of nitrogen, 2050 tons of phosphorus and 64,900 tons of dissolved silica (DSi) annually during the time period 1977-1995. There was large interannual variation in loads, e.g., a factor two difference was found between the two most extreme years (1984 and 1990); this was attributed mainly to natural variation in water discharge. The seasonal distribution of nutrient loads exhibited a distinct pattern for practically all studied constituents, especially nitrate. Loads were high during the spring-flow and relatively low during the low-flow summer period. Examination of the spatial variation of nutrient loads showed that the Daugava River alone accounted for approximately 60% of the total riverine load. The highest area-specific loads of nitrate and phosphate were observed in the agriculturally dominated Lielupe River, and the highest loads of organic-nitrogen (org-N) and total phophorus (tot-P) were found in the Parnu River. However, the values for all the studied rivers and constituents were rather low (phosphorus) or moderate (nitrogen and silica) compared to those reported for many other drainage areas of the Baltic Sea. This was true despite the inefficient sewage treatment and intensive agriculture in the studied basins in the 1970s and 1980s. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

It shows that, CO2 flux diurnal Variation of Qinghai lake alpine wetland ecosystem in the spring showed U font, flux numerical is negative during 9:00-18:00, it is positive value other time, The minimum value occurs in 13: 30, the diurnal average of CO2 flux is 0.046 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)(about0.175 g.m(-2).d(-1)). From March to May, CO2 flux difference between day and night and total value increases gradually, carbon dioxide emissions were highest in the may. By correlation analysis with net radiation, air temperature and surface soil temperature, It showed that the net radiation is a main factor which influences CO2 flux change in the daytime in the Qinghai lake alpine wetland ecosystem in the spring, air temperature takes second place, surface soil temperature has little impact on CO2 flux change in the daytime.

J	MEASURES, LN				MEASURES, LN			EPIZOOTIOLOGY, PATHOLOGY, AND DESCRIPTION OF EUSTRONGYLIDES-TUBIFEX (NEMATODA, DIOCTOPHYMATOIDEA) IN FISH	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												In Guelph Lake, a man-made reservoir in Ontario, Canada, prevalence of larval Eustrongylides tubifex in pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus), rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris), and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) was 12.9% and mean intensity ranged from 1 to 1.8. Larvae were encapsulated on the mesentery of fish. Pumpkinseed and yellow perch were the important fish hosts in Guelph Lake as most larvae in these fish were alive. In contrast, 40% of larvae in rock bass were dead and calcified. Third- and fourth-stage larvae from naturally infected fish are described. Larvae in the three species of fish elicited a granulomatous inflammatory reaction. Attempts to transfer third-stage larvae from experimentally infected oligochaetes and third-stage larvae from naturally infected fish to laboratory-reared pumpkinseed were unsuccessful. Fourth-stage larvae from naturally infected fish were transferred successfully to pumpkinseed. Eutropic lakes such as Guelph Lake are particularly suitable enzootic areas because of the abundant populations of tubificid intermediate hosts and the presence of fish hosts such as pumpkinseed and perch. The advanced stage and development of larvae (to the fourth stage) in fish likely represents an adaptation for a parasite that occurs in a migratory host such as Common Mergansers (Mergus merganser), which frequent Guelph Lake for only about 1 month in spring and fall.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				OCT	1988	66	10					2212	2222		10.1139/z88-329	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z88-329													WOS:A1988Q690600019

The Sea receives agricultural runoff and, to a lesser extent, municipal wastewater that is high in nutrients, salt, and suspended solids. High sulfate concentrations (4x higher than that of the ocean), coupled with warm temperatures and low-redox potentials present during much of the year, result in extensive sulfate reduction and hydrogen sulfide production. Hydrogen sulfide formation may have a dramatic effect on the iron (Fe) geochemistry in the Sea. We hypothesized that the Fe(II)-sulfide minerals should dominate the iron mineralogy of the sediments, and plans to increase hypolimnetic aeration would increase the amount of Fe(III)-oxides, which are strong adsorbers of phosphate. Sequential chemical extractions were used to differentiate iron mineralogy in the lake sediments and suspended solids from the tributary rivers. Iron in the river-borne suspended solids was mainly associated with structural iron within silicate clays (70%) and ferric oxides (30%). The iron in the bottom sediments of the lake was associated with silicate minerals (71% of the total iron in the sediments), framboidal pyrite (10%), greigite (11%), and amorphous FeS (5%). The ferric oxide fraction was < 4% of the total iron in these anaerobic sediments. The morphological characteristics of the framboidal pyrite as determined using SEM suggest that it formed within the water column and experiences some changes in local redox conditions, probably associated with alternating summer anoxia and the well-mixed and generally well-aerated conditions found during the winter. The prevalence of Fe(II)-sulfide minerals in the sediments and the lack of Fe(III)-oxide minerals suggest that the classic model of P-retention by Fe(III)-oxides would not be operating in this lake, at least during anoxic summer conditions. Aeration of the hypolimnion could affect the internal loading of P by changing the relative amounts of Fe(II)-sulfides and Fe(III)-oxides at the sediment/water interface.

However, a coarse riverbed structure and low discharge may facilitate cannibalism by providing pools for large fish whilst limiting refuges for small ones. We estimated the autumn size structure and density of the seatrout population in a regulated stream in western Norway over a period of 12 years. Bioenergetics models were used to relate energy intake in large trout ( greater than or equal to 17 cm) to the biomass of small fish present. The number of 0 + trout in autumn decreased with increasing abundance of large trout (log-log regression, nonlinear R-2 = 0.80, n = 10, p = 0.0005). The size distribution of 0 + trout in autumn had a lower mean, but more positive skewness, when many small fish were present. Twenty percent of the large trout sampled had parr of trout or salmon Salmo salar in their stomach. The total food consumption estimated for large trout exceeded the total energy content of small fish in years with few small per large trout. We conclude that cannibalism appears to be an important cause of small-fish mortality in this stream, regulating the abundance and size distribution of small trout. In streams with low discharge, weir building can improve conditions for large trout, presumably reducing the density of small fish. However, it is difficult to predict the net effect on smolt production of improved growth but increased mortality. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We hypothesised that a winterkill in a clear and a turbid shallow lake would equalise their fish community composition, but seasonal plankton successions would differ between lakes. After a partial winterkill, we observed a reduction of fish biomass by 16 and 43% in a clear-water and a turbid small temperate lake, respectively. Fish biomass and piscivore shares (5% of fish biomass) were similar in both lakes after this winterkill, but young-of-the-year (YOY) abundances were higher in the turbid lake. Top-down control by crustaceans was only partly responsible for low phytoplankton biomass at the end of May following the winterkill in both lakes. Summer phytoplankton biomass remained low in the clear-water lake despite high abundances of YOY fish (mainly roach). In contrast, the crustacean biomass of the turbid lake was reduced in summer by a high YOY abundance (sunbleak and roach), leading to a strong increase in phytoplankton biomass. The YOY abundance of fish in shallow eutrophic lakes may thus be more important for their summer phytoplankton development after winterkill than the relative abundance of piscivores.

NITROGEN FLUXES	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Vertical fluxes of nitrogen were examined in hypersaline Mono Lake over a 9-yr period which encompassed the onset, persistence, and breakdown of meromixis. Under monomictic conditions, ammonia, which accumulates in the hypolimnion, is mixed into the euphotic region during autumn overturn. Following the onset of meromixis in 1983 and elimination of the winter period of holomixis, ammonia was depleted in the mixolimnion and accumulated beneath the chemocline. The mean rate of particulate nitrogen deposition, as measured by sediment traps over a 2-yr period during meromixis, was 2.0 mmol m-2 d-1. Until meromixis weakened in 1988, ammonia concentrations in the euphotic zone remained below 5 muM and increased to approximately 500 muM beneath the chemocline. Meromixis ended in November 1988 and a large pulse of ammonia was injected into surface waters, resulting in surface ammonia concentrations of approximately 45 muM. Because the pH of Mono Lake is high (9.8) the NH3 : NH4+ ratio is approximately 5, and elevated surface concentrations of ammonia during the 2 yr following breakdown of meromixis resulted in high losses of nitrogen via ammonia volatilization (mean, approximately 10 mmol m-2 d-1). High release rates of ammonia from the sediments were estimated from both the ammonia gradients in pore-water profiles (3-10 mmol m-2 d-1) and the balance of mixolimnetic nitrogen fluxes (4-10 mmol m-2 d-1). The monimolimnetic balance suggested fluxes of ammonia out of the sediments below the chemocline were reduced during meromixis					Jellison, Robert/E-4923-2012	Miller, Laurence/0000-0002-7807-3475													0024-3590					JUL	1993	38	5					1020	1039		10.4319/lo.1993.38.5.1020	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1993.38.5.1020													WOS:A1993MZ48500011

Yet, the limited chronological extent of the instrumental records accompanied with the control of the climatic variables on the ISM, has hampered the efforts to document the climate change for the last two millennia. The present multiproxy study reports a high-resolution sedimentary record from the Gulf of Khambhat region (Western India) which represents two alternating climatic phases representing relatively arid and humid climatic conditions that coincides with the widely reported Dark Ages Cold Period (DACP) (AD 680 - AD 920) and Medieval Warm Period (MWP) (AD 920 to similar to AD 1400). This variability of the ISM, further tends to be modulated by the solar forcings, with the periods of solar minima coinciding well with the episodes of the reduced monsoonal strength and vice-versa. The difference in timing of DACP and MWP in the North Atlantic Region (NAR) and the present study, hints at the linkage between the ISM and NAR via an atmospheric route, driven by the solar variability.																			1040-6182	1873-4553				SEP 10	2022	631						82	92		10.1016/j.quaint.2022.05.011	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2022.05.011													WOS:000923105500001

To investigate the function and dynamics of this extreme ecosystem, four water samples were collected from the lake in the fall of 2010. The acidophilic community structure was analyzed by molecular approaches, and bacterial and archaeal clone libraries of 16S rRNA genes were constructed. In contrast to dominance of chemolithotrophic acidophiles in typical AMD environments, autotrophic iron/sulfur-oxidizing bacteria were detected in only one sample with low abundance. Unexpectedly, the Cyanobacteria group was the predominant in all four samples (54.9%-77%). Chemoheterotrophs Acidiphilium and Acidisphaera were also abundant. These two heterotrophic groups contain bacteriochlorophyll that can perform photosynthesis, an advantage to grow and survive in such oligotrophic acidic environments. Only two clone sequences related to Legionella (2.8% of the total clones) were recovered from one sample in sharp contrast to its higher abundance (12.7%) in the summer of 2009. All archaeal sequences were affiliated to the phylum Crenarchaeota. The results of statistical analysis suggested that the water chemistry of the AMD lake controlled microbial composition of the AMD ecosystem.

Isidora			Effects of exotic fish farms on bird communities in lake and marine ecosystems	NATURWISSENSCHAFTEN												Salmon farming is a widespread activity around the world, also known to promote diverse environmental effects on aquatic ecosystems. However, information regarding the impact of salmon farming on bird assemblages is notably scarce. We hypothesize that salmon farming, by providing food subsidies and physical structures to birds, will change their local community structure. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a seasonal monitoring of bird richness, abundance, and composition at paired salmon pen and control plots in two marine and two lake sites in southern Chile, from fall 2002 to summer 2004. Overall, salmon farming had no significant effects on species richness, but bird abundance was significantly and noticeably higher in salmon pens than in controls. Such aggregation was mainly accounted for by the trophic guilds of omnivores, diving piscivores, carrion eaters, and perching piscivores, but not by invertebrate feeders, herbivores, and surface feeders. Species composition was also significantly and persistently different between salmon pens and controls within each lake or marine locality. The patterns described above remained consistent across environment types and seasons indicating that salmon farming is changing the community structure of birds in both lake and marine habitats by promoting functional and aggregation responses, particularly by favoring species with broader niches. Such local patterns may thus anticipate potential threats from the ongoing expansion of the salmon industry to neighboring areas in Chile, resulting in regional changes of bird communities, toward a less diverse one and dominated by opportunistic, common, and generalist species such as gulls, vultures, and cormorants.

Cosmic-ray exposure age accumulated in near-Earth space: A carbonaceous chondrite case study	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE												This study investigates the expected cosmic-ray exposure (CRE) of meteorites if they were to be ejected by a near-Earth object, that is, from an object already transferred to an Earth-crossing orbit by an orbital resonance. Specifically, we examine the CRE ages of CI and CM carbonaceous chondrites (CCs), which have some of the shortest measured CRE ages of any meteorite type. A steady-state near-Earth carbonaceous meteoroid probability density function is estimated based on the low-albedo near-Earth asteroid population, including parameters such as the near-Earth dynamic lifetime, the impact probability with the Earth, and the orbital parameters. This model was then compared to the orbits and CRE ages of the five CC falls with precisely measured orbits: Tagish Lake, Maribo, Sutter's Mill, Flensburg, and Winchcombe. The study examined two meteoroid ejection scenarios for CI/CM meteoroids: Main Belt collisions and ejections in near-Earth space. The results indicated that applying a maximum physical lifetime in near-Earth space of 2-10 Myr to meteoroids and eliminating events evolving onto orbits entirely detached from the Main Belt (Q < 1.78 au) significantly improved the agreement with the observed orbits of carbonaceous falls. Additionally, the CRE ages of three of the five carbonaceous falls have measured CRE ages one to three orders of magnitude shorter than expected for an object originating from the Main Belt with the corresponding semi-major axis value. This discrepancy between the expected CRE ages from the model and the measured ages of three of the carbonaceous falls indicates that some CI/CM meteoroids are being ejected in near-Earth space. This study proposes a nuanced hypothesis involving meteoroid impacts and tidal disruptions as significant contributors to the ejection and subsequent CRE age accumulation of CI/CM chondrites in near-Earth space.

Ground Temperatures and Permafrost Warming from Forest to Tundra, Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands and Anderson Plain, NWT, Canada	PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES												Annual mean ground temperatures (T-g) decline northward from approximately -3.0 degrees C in the boreal forest to -7.0 degrees C in dwarf-shrub tundra in the Tuktoyuktuk Coastlands and Anderson Plain, NWT, Canada. The latitudinal decrease in T-g from forest to tundra is accompanied by an increase in the range of values measured in the central, tall-shrub tundra zone. Field measurements from 124 sites across this ecotone indicate that in undisturbed terrain Tg may approach 0 degrees C in the forest and -4 degrees C in dwarf-shrub tundra. The greatest range of local variation in T-g (similar to 7 degrees C) was observed in the tall-shrub transition zone. Undisturbed terrain units with relatively high T-g include riparian areas and slopes with drifting snow, saturated soils in polygonal peatlands and areas near lakes. Across the region, the warmest permafrost is associated with disturbances such as thaw slumps, drained lakes, areas burned by wildfires, drilling-mud sumps and roadsides. Soil saturation following terrain subsidence may increase the latent heat content of the active layer, while increases in snow depth decrease the rate of ground heat loss in autumn and winter. Such disturbances increase freezeback duration and reduce the period of conductive ground cooling, resulting in higher Tg and, in some cases, permafrost thaw. The field measurements reported here confirm that minimum T-g values in the uppermost 10 m of permafrost have increased by similar to 2 degrees C since the 1970s. The widespread occurrence of T-g above -3 degrees C indicates warm permafrost exists in disturbed and undisturbed settings across the transition from forest to tundra.

During the water diversion periods in the winter of 2014 and 2015, the nutrients and organic pollutant contents of the Wangyu River channel were significantly lower than those during the non-diversion period in 2016. Moreover, the phytoplankton diversities and relative proportions of Bacillariophyta during the diversion periods evidently increased during the water diversion periods in winter. The increase in the water turbidity content, the decrease in the contents of the permanganate index, and the total phosphorus explained only 21.4% of the variations in the phytoplankton communities between the diversion and non-diversion periods in winter, which revealed significant contributions of the allochthonous species from the Yangtze River and tributaries of the Wangyu River to phytoplankton communities in the Wangyu River. The increasing gradient in the contents of nutrients and organic pollutants from the Yangtze River to Lake Taihu indicated the potential allochthonous pollutant inputs along with the Wangyu River. Further controlling the pollutants from the tributaries of the Wangyu River is critical in order to improve the phytoplankton habitats in river channels and Lake Taihu.					; Wang, Fangfang/KII-9109-2024; Qianqian, Yang/GRR-6804-2022	Dai, Jiangyu/0000-0002-8605-1022; xue, wanyun/0000-0001-5724-0951; Zhu, Senlin/0000-0003-2803-5419														2073-4441				JUN	2018	10	6							759	10.3390/w10060759	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10060759													WOS:000436515100090

To improve the lake's water quality, a diversion construction project is underway to divert water from the Yangtze River to the lake to accelerate the flow cycle and decrease nutrient concentrations. This study assessed the effects of proposed diversion schemes on water quality using the composite water quality identification index (CWQII) method and a 2-dimensional (2D) water quality model. The study results indicated that the water quality of the lake is strongly influenced by diversion schemes, including diverting locations, discharge, and time. The optimum diversion inlet was inlet 2 (located in Shuiguo Bay), and the most efficient discharge was 30 m(3)/s. Diverting from different inlet locations caused more obvious reduction rates of CWQII in summer (Jul) than in winter (Jan). After diversion, CWQII values throughout the entire lake were reduced, and the spatial distribution of CWQII became more homogeneous. The highest reduction of CWQII occurred near the inlet location. The CWQII method and 2D water quality model provided a relevant example for assessing the general water quality and designing optimal schemes for diversion projects to improve water quality in large shallow lakes.					张, 亮/AGR-2540-2022														1040-2381	2151-5530					2014	30	4					358	370		10.1080/10402381.2014.942044	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2014.942044													WOS:000344167000004

This study investigated both the reversal of the decadal trend in the WCAR during 1961-2020 and the related atmospheric circulation and oceanic backgrounds. The results showed that the decadal trend in the WCAR underwent distinct reversal in the late 1990s, with a significant trend of decline (increase) before (after) this reversal, which was directly linked to variations in the large-scale Eurasian atmospheric circulation, local moisture transport and dynamic conditions, and sea surface temperature (SST) in the subtropical South Pacific. Further investigation indicated that reduced sea level pressure over Asia, an enhanced European blocking high, and a deepened Lake Balkhash trough during the latter period favored southward movement of high-latitude cold air into West China. Moreover, a stronger southerly flow in the southern West China was observed in the latter period, which tended to transport more moisture from low-latitude ocean areas. Northward displacement of the East Asian jet (EAJ) also played a strong dynamic role in the reversal of the WCAR trend. Additionally, the reversal of the decadal trend in WCAR might also be attributed to a change in the trend of SST in the subtropical South Pacific from warming to cooling in the late 1990s. This resulted in southward displacement of the EAJ, which generated an anomalous descent and reduction in the WCAR.

However, little is known about effects of these changes on the alternating dominance of deciduous and evergreen vegetation in East Asia, particularly in the regions now dominated by evergreen broadleaved forest (EBLF) that forms a vast ecotonal zone between tropical and temperate belts. In this study, we have used two representative records in center of the EBLF distribution, associated with broader regional pollen data from eastern China, to reconstruct spatiotemporal biome changes over the last 22 ka. The results showed a dominance of deciduous broadleaved forest at the LGM in most mountainous regions of the subtropical zone, and the EBLF began to migrate and expand into the low latitude subtropical areas during the last deglaciation, particularly at ca.11.3 ka after the Younger Dryas. However, major biome replacement from deciduous to evergreen forest across eastern China did not occur until 8.1 ka, indicating an earlier forest replacement at sites in low latitude regions as compared to sites located further north or at higher mountains. Our evidence agrees well with quantitative climate reconstruction and simulations at local and regional scales, showing that forest transformed when thermal conditions reached relevant thresholds. Both simulated and reconstructed paleotemperatures are consistent with the early-to-middle Holocene being a key period when climatic thresholds (particularly winter and/or annual temperatures) gradually approached then exceeded bioclimatic constraints on EBLF recolonization. By contrast, the precipitation in most part of mountainous subtropical southeast China may not be a key constraint for evergreen/deciduous forest transformation since the last deglaciation. During the late Holocene, the reconstructed biome has shifted unstably, probably due to interactive effects of several regional-scale factors, including seasonal climate biases and major fluctuations in effective moisture associated with weakening of summer monsoon before the enhanced human interventions of the last 3000 years.

J	Huntington, TG; Hodgkins, GA; Dudley, RW				Huntington, TG; Hodgkins, GA; Dudley, RW			Historical trend in river ice thickness and coherence in hydroclimatological trends in Maine	CLIMATIC CHANGE												We analyzed long-term records of ice thickness on the Piscataquis River in central Maine and air temperature in Maine to determine whether there were temporal trends that were associated with climate warming. The trend in ice thickness was compared and correlated with regional time series of winter air temperature, heating degree days (HDD), date of river ice-out, seasonal center-of-volume date (SCVD) (date on which half of the stream runoff volume during the period 1 Jan. to 31 May has occurred), water temperature, and lake ice-out date. All of these variables except lake ice-out date showed significant temporal trends during the 20th century. Average ice thickness around 28 February decreased by about 23 cm from 1912 to 2001. Over the period 1900 to 1999, winter air temperature increased by 1.7degreesC and HDD decreased by about 7.5%. Final ice-out date on the Piscataquis River occurred earlier (advanced), by 0.21 days yr(-1) over the period 1931 to 2002, and the SCVD advanced by 0.11 days yr(-1) over the period 1903 to 2001. Ice thickness was significantly correlated(P-value <0.01) with winter air temperature, HDD, river ice-out, and SCVD. These systematic temporal trends in multiple hydrologic indicator variables indicate a coherent response to climate forcing.

Taxonomic and nontaxonomic responses to ecological changes in an urban lowland stream through the use of Chironomidae (Diptera) larvae	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Biotic descriptors - both taxonomic (diversity indices, species richness, and indicator species) and nontaxonomic (biomass, oxygen consumption/production, and anatomical deformities) - are useful tools for measuring a stream's ecological condition. Nontaxonomic parameters detect critical effects not reflected taxonomically. We analyzed changes in Chironomidae populations as taxonomic parameters and mentum deformities as a nontaxonomic parameter for evaluating a South-American-plains stream (Argentina). We performed samplings seasonally (March, June, September, and December; 2005) and physical and chemical measurements at three sampling sites of the stream (DC1 at river source, through DC3 downstream). The specimens collected in sediment and vegetation were analyzed to investigate mouth deformities in Chironomidae larvae. We identified a total of 9 taxa from Chironomidae and Orthocladiinae subfamilies. Shannon's diversity index for Chironomidae decreased from 1.6 bits ind(-1) (DC1) to 0.3 bits ind(-1) (DC3). The total density of the Chironomidae exhibited a great increase in abundance at site DC3, especially that of Chironomus calligraphus. Chironomidae taxonomic composition also changed among the three sites despite their spatial proximity: C. calligraphus, Goeldichironomus holoprasinus, Parachironomus longistilus, and Polypedilum were present at all three; Cotynoneura and Paratanytarsu at DC1 only; Cricotopus at DC1 and DC3; Apedilum elachistus notably at DC2 and DC3; and Parametriocnemus only at DC2. C. calligraphus individuals from DC1 showed no mentum deformities; only 2 from DO exhibited mouth-structure alterations; while specimens from DO presented the most abnormalities, especially during autumn and late winter. Type-II deformities (supernumerary teeth and gaps) were the most common. Anatomical deformities are sublethal effects representing an early alert to chemically caused environmental degradation. Mentum deformities in benthic-Chironomidae larvae constitute an effective biological-surveillance tool for detecting adverse conditions in sediments and evaluating sediment-quality-criteria compliance. Taxonomic (community composition) and nontaxonomic (condition of larval mouth parts) descriptors, used together, can indicate a stream's ecological state. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The relatively high salinity (18 000 mgCl l-1), boron content (3.9 mg l-1), and deltaB-11 value (44parts per thousand) and the low B/Cl ratios of the saline Tiberias Hot Spring suggest dilution of deep-seated trapped CaCl2 brines with a deltaB-11 almost-equal-to 44 parts per thousand, which is consistent with previous interpretations based on Na/Cl (0.58) and deltaO-18 (-3parts per thousand) values. The deltaB-11 values of the springs in Hammat Gader decrease gradually from deltaB-11 of 41.9parts per thousand to 20.9parts per thousand with increasing salinity (70 to 497 mgCl l-1), temperature (25-degrees-50-degrees-C), and boron content (0.1-0.3 mg l-1). The deltaB-11 values suggest that boron is derived from leaching of calcium carbonate or desorption of clay minerals of a deltaB-11 = 14parts per thousand and mixing with meteoric water of a high deltaB-11 value. The relatively low deltaB-11 values of two low salinity springs (1240 and 2700 mgCl l-1) along the Sea of Galilee (deltaB-11 = 31.6parts per thousand and 31.8parts per thousand) and the lake itself (24parts per thousand) suggest that a significant fraction of boron in these waters is also derived from rock leaching. The influence of boron that is leached from the rocks is limited and can be recognized mainly in boron-depleted groundwater. The variations of deltaB-11, Na/Cl, and deltaO-18 parameters in the Hammat Gader springs demonstrate the sensitivity of each element to different sources. Whereas oxygen-isotope compositions reflect the meteoric source, the major ions (e.g. Na/Cl and Br/Cl ratios) record the influence of the deep-seated brines, and boron isotopes in diluted groundwater are sensitive to water-rock interaction.

John			Climatic influence on the inter-annual variability of late-Holocene minerogenic sediment supply in a boreal forest catchment	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Processes controlling sediment yield vary over a range of timescales, although most process-based observations are extremely short. Lake sediments, however, can be used to extend the observational timescale and are particularly useful when annually laminated (varved) sediment is present. The sediment record at Kassjon (N. Sweden) consists of similar to 6400 varves, each 0.5-1 mm thick. Image analysis was used to determine grey-scale variation and varve thickness from which annual minerogenic accumulation rate (MinAR) (mg cm(-2) year(-1)) was inferred for the period 4486 BC - AD 1900. MinAR varies On annual to centennial scales and mainly reflects channel bank erosion by the inflow streams. The mineral input reflects the intensity of the spring run-off, which is dependent on the amount of snow accumulated during the winter, and hence MinAR is a long-term record of variability in past winter climate; other factors will be a variable response to catchment uplift, vegetation succession and pedogenesis. A major shift from low to high MinAR occurred similar to 250 BC, and peaks occurred around AD 250, 600, 1000, 1350 and 1650. Wavelet power spectrum analysis (confirmed by Fourier analyses) indicated significantly different periodicities throughout the period 4000 BC - AD 1700, including 275 years for the period 4000 BC - 2900 BC, 567 years for the period 2901 BC - 1201 BC, and 350 and 725 years for the period 1200 BC - AD 1700. The long-term, centennial scale variability (similar to 350 years) may reflect solar forcing (cf the 385-year peak in tree-ring calibrated C-14 activity) but interestingly, there is no obvious link to high frequency forcing, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation. The high resolution component of the record highlights the relevance of varved lake sediment records for understanding erosion dynamics in undisturbed forested catchments and their link to long-term climate dynamics and future climate change.

J	BAUMGARDNER, DJ; BURDICK, JS				BAUMGARDNER, DJ; BURDICK, JS			AN OUTBREAK OF HUMAN AND CANINE BLASTOMYCOSIS	REVIEWS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES												In the summer and fall of 1988, three humans and one dog in a lakeshore community in northern Wisconsin were found to have blastomycosis on the basis of the results of cultures and histologic studies; the infection was also suspected in one human and four dogs on the basis of clinical data. Serologic testing with use of enzyme immunoassay for antibody to the A antigen of Blastomyces dermatitidis was performed for 77 additional human residents and visitors in the area an average of 9 months after the outbreak. Titers of antibody of greater-than-or-equal-to 1:32 were considered presumptive evidence of blastomycosis, and measurement of such titers enabled identification of 18 additional suspected cases in this group, compared with none in a control group (n = 40). Of the 22 humans with confirmed and suspected cases, 16 (73%) were asymptomatic. Epidemiologic and meteorologic data gathered during this period suggested an association between this outbreak and the presence of dust from excavation for a hotel across the lake. The result of this study further confirm the common occurrence of self-limited and subclinical infection with B. dermatitidis and suggest that excavation in an area endemic for B. dermatitidis is a risk factor for human and canine infection.																			0162-0886					SEP-OCT	1991	13	5					898	905											1962106					WOS:A1991GJ45900022

Proxy-based reconstructed precipitation in northern China shows a peak in the mid-Holocene (7800-5300 years BP) followed by a declining trend until the present day. Most studies attributed this decline to the decrease in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation and weakening of the East Asian summer monsoon. However, the details of the drying mechanisms still remain elusive. Here we explore the drivers of this drying trend in northern China using two transient experiments, one that includes dynamic vegetation and one that does not. The experiment with dynamic vegetation successfully captured the slight increase in precipitation in the early mid-Holocene as well as the rapid decline of precipitation in the late mid-Holocene, whereas the experiment without dynamic vegetation predicted no change in precipitation. Specifically, in the dynamic-vegetation experiment, vegetation cover increased over time, which led to higher evapotranspiration and sensible heat and thus a reduction in convective precipitation from about 7800 years BP onwards. We suggest that the dynamics of vegetation played a key role in modulating the long-term trend of precipitation during the Holocene.

Therefore, this study investigated the seasonal variation and vertical distribution of nitrogen and other environmental factors from April 2012 to April 2015 in the Zhoucun Reservoir. The results show that nitrate was the primary nitrogen species in the entire water column except the hypolimnion, where ammonium dominated. Total nitrogen fluctuations were larger in near-surface water, with a range of 0.38-3.11 mg/L. Nitrate concentrations were homogeneous throughout the water column and experienced a clear decline in spring. In contrast, ammonium was in stratification from May to October. Surface ammonium reached a maximum in the high flow period during summer, while bottom ammonium remained high throughout stratification. Our results suggest that aerobic denitrification and nitrogen load from inflow rivers were the main processes that affected surface nitrogen content, while bottom nitrogen content was primarily affected by anaerobic denitrification and nutrient release from sediment. Of the measured environmental factors, water temperature, water residence time, dissolved oxygen, rainfall, and total phosphorus were the most critical in affecting nitrogen content. Our field surveys show the effects of complex process and environmental factors on the dynamics of nitrogen in the lacustrine zone of the reservoir, helping people understand and predict nitrogen dynamics in temperate, stratified lentic waters. Based on our results, the water resource managers can select suitable measures to control the eutrophication.					; Shilei, Zhou/AGM-5703-2022; Huang, Shu/AFR-4893-2022	Shilei, Zhou/0000-0002-5497-0673; 													1755-1307						2019	252								052040	10.1088/1755-1315/252/5/052040	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/252/5/052040													WOS:000491996704046

The concentrations of N-NO3 and N-NH4 in the groundwaters of these soils were studied and compared with the dynamics of the mineralization process of organic matter in the soil. The findings have proved that the rate of the mineralization of organic nitrogen compounds in the soils under study varied in particular seasons of the year depending on the state of their moisture and the way of utilization. The most mineral N was released in the gyttja and half-bog soil under pasture in summer periods. The N-NO3 form dominated in the process of the mineralization of organic nitrogen compounds. The pasture-purpose utilization of gyttja soil favoured the nitrification process and increased nitrate outwashing to groundwaters. It has been found out that in the groundwaters of the Mgyhh160ps soils under the pasture the average annual concentration of N-NO3 amounted to 0.774 mg . dm(-3) N-NO3. The highest content of N-NO3 in the groundwaters was found out mostly in the summer periods when the nitrification process in the soil occurred most intensely. A calculated coefficient of correlation between the content of N-NO3 and N-NH4 in water and in gyttja soils under pasture shows a positive correlation for N-NO3. In the case of gyttja soils under birch alder carr there was a similar interdependence as in the soil under the pasture except that only the power of the relation between the content of N-NH4 in the soil to the concentration in the water was statistically significant. In the case of unused gyttja soils and those under the meadow, the correlation between the content of nitrogen N-NO3 in the soil and water was negative. A calculated correlation coefficient for gyttja soils irrespective of the way of their use proved that the increase in the concentration of N-NO3 in the soil involved a growth of the concentration of N-NO3 in the water. In the case of N-NH4, in spite of the increase of this form of nitrogen in the soil, a decrease in its concentration in the water was observed.

J	Vokoun, JC; Rabeni, CE				Vokoun, JC; Rabeni, CE			Home range and space use patterns of flathead catfish during the summer-fall period in two Missouri streams	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Flathead catfish Pylodictis olivaris were radio-tracked in the Grand River and Cuivre River, Missouri, from late July until they moved to overwintering habitats in late October. Fish moved within a definable area, and although occasional long-distance movements occurred, the fish typically returned to the previously occupied area. Seasonal home range was calculated with the use of kernel density estimation, which can be interpreted as a probabilistic utilization distribution that documents the internal structure of the estimate by delineating portions of the range that was used a specified percentage of the time. A traditional linear range also was reported. Most flathead catfish (89%) had one 50% kernel-estimated core area, whereas 11% of the fish split their time between two core areas. Core areas were typically in the middle of the 90% kernel-estimated home range (58%), although several had core areas in upstream (26%) and downstream (16%) portions of the home range. Home-range size did not differ based on river, sex, or size and was highly variable among individuals. The median 95% kernel estimate was 1,085 m (range, 7069,090 m) for all fish. The median 50% kernel-estimated core area was 135 m (10-2,260 m). The median linear range was 3,510 m (150-50,400 m). Fish pairs with core areas in the same and neighboring pools had static joint space use values of up to 49% (area of intersection index), indicating substantial overlap and use of the same area. However, all fish pairs had low dynamic joint space use values (&LT; 0.07; coefficient of association), indicating that fish pairs were temporally segregated, rarely occurring in the same location at the same time.																			0002-8487					MAR	2005	134	2					509	517		10.1577/T04-064.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T04-064.1													WOS:000228908900020

Due to the high spatial and temporal variability of the underlying environmental drivers (e.g., concentrations of dissolved CO2 and CH4, turbulence, and temperature), it has remained difficult to address the importance and upscale the emissions to annual whole-system and regional values. In this study, we measured concentrations and calculated emissions of CO2 and CH4 at diel and seasonal scales at 15 stations in a 1.4 km2 stream network that drains a mixed lowland catchment consisting of agriculture (210 km2), forest (56 km2), and lakes, ponds, and wetlands (22 km2) in the upper River Odense, Denmark to evaluate environmental drivers behind the spatiotemporal variability. We used automatically venting floating chambers to calculate hourly diffusive fluxes of CO2 and CH4 and CH4 ebullition. We found: 1) highly supersaturated CO2 and CH4 concentrations (median: 175 and 0.33 mu mol L-1, respectively) and high diffusive fluxes of CO2 and CH4 (median: 3,608 and 19 mu mol m-2 h-1, respectively); 2) lower daytime than nighttime diffusive emissions of CO2 in spring and summer, but no diel variability of CH4; 3) higher concentrations and emissions of CH4 at higher temperatures; and 4) higher emissions of CH4 at stations located in sub-catchments with higher agricultural coverage. Ebullition of CH4 peaked at two stations with soft organic sediment and low summer flow, and their ebullition alone constituted 30% of total annual CH4 emissions from the stream network. Mean annual CO2 emissions from the hydrological network (37.15 mol CO2 m-2 y-1) exceeded CH4 emissions 100-fold (0.43 mol CH4 m-2 y-1), and their combined warming potential was 1.83 kg CO2e m-2 y-1. Overall, agricultural sub-catchments had higher CH4 emissions from streams, while lakes and ponds likely reduced downstream CH4 and CO2 emissions. Our findings demonstrate that CO2 and CH4 emissions data at high spatial and temporal resolution are essential to frame the heterogeneous stream conditions, understand gas emissions regulation, and upscale to annual values for hydrological networks and larger regions.

Grizzly bear predation links the loss of native trout to the demography of migratory elk in Yellowstone	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												The loss of aquatic subsidies such as spawning salmonids is known to threaten a number of terrestrial predators, but the effects on alternative prey species are poorly understood. At the heart of the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem, an invasion of lake trout has driven a dramatic decline of native cutthroat trout that migrate up the shallow tributaries of Yellowstone Lake to spawn each spring. We explore whether this decline has amplified the effect of a generalist consumer, the grizzly bear, on populations of migratory elk that summer inside Yellowstone National Park (YNP). Recent studies of bear diets and elk populations indicate that the decline in cutthroat trout has contributed to increased predation by grizzly bears on the calves of migratory elk. Additionally, a demographic model that incorporates the increase in predation suggests that the magnitude of this diet shift has been sufficient to reduce elk calf recruitment (4-16%) and population growth (2-11%). The disruption of this aquatic-terrestrial linkage could permanently alter native species interactions in YNP. Although many recent ecological changes in YNP have been attributed to the recovery of large carnivores-particularly wolves-our work highlights a growing role of human impacts on the foraging behaviour of grizzly bears.

The results show that The Guangdong precipitation during the winter exhibits quasi-periodic significant oscillations of 40 years and 2 years; rainfall is less from the end of the 1950s to the start of the 1970s and from the end of the 1990s to the present than from the mid 1970s to the mid 1990s. The frequency of sustained drought is more than sustained flooding during the winter. The Guangdong precipitation during this time period is in significantly positive correlation to the equatorial central and eastern Pacific SST, but in a significantly negative correlation with the western and northern Pacific SST east of the Philippine Sea. 61.5% of the sustained drought occurred in the phase of negative anomalies of the Nino3.4 index and 38.5% in the phase of positive ones. A composite analysis of atmospheric circulation is performed for the positive and negative phases of the Nino3.4 region associated with the sustained drought. The results showed that a weak polar vortex, a strong trough in Europe and a ridge near Balkhash Lake, active cold air and consistent northerly wind anomalies controlling Guangdong at low levels, an inactive westerly low disturbance in the low-mid latitude of the Asian continent, and a weak southern branch westerly trough, are all mutual causes for the sustained drought.

Samples of newly fallen snow, old snow, as well as water from lakes, ponds and streams were collected during the 4th Turkish Antarctic Expedition in February-early March 2020. Determination of Ag, Al, As, Ba, Be, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Na, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Th, Tl, U, V and Zn content was carried out using the ICP-MS method. Totally 39 samples were analyzed.It was established that, variability and average concentrations of major and trace elements are significantly higher in newly fallen snow compared to old snow. The lowest concentrations of major and a number of trace elements (Fe, Cr, Se, Ba, As and Tl) were recorded in samples of old snow, and the highest -in water of streams. All types of samples have the highest Na concentrations, that confirms sea aerosols as the source of their input.High enrichment factors EFc (>100) for Zn, Cd, Se and Sb (especially in newly fallen snow) indicate possible anthropogenic impact connected with long-range air mass transfer.					; Kukharchyk, Tamara/MSY-9008-2025	Kukharchyk, Tamara/0000-0003-3434-1244; 													1873-9652	1876-4428				JUN	2022	32								100792	10.1016/j.polar.2022.100792	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polar.2022.100792		MAY 2022											WOS:000809777100001

Late-summer water temperatures and forage fish densities in 168 habitat cells were collected from 1989 to 1996 and were used to estimate the potential growth of lake trout inhabiting each cell. Results of model simulations indicated that habitat quality for lake trout growth had decreased from 1990 to 1993. This decrease in lake trout growth rate potential was related to decreased forage fish densities during this period. Lake trout condition, as measured using length-weight analyses of individuals captured in spring gillnetting surveys, also decreased from the early 1990s to the mid-1990s. The change in the slope of the length-weight relationship was correlated with the proportion of habitat cells containing positive simulated growth rate potentials (r(2) = 0.60, p = 0.024). No significant correlation between the sum of growth rate potentials in habitat cells and changes in the slope of the length-weight relationship was apparent. These correlations suggest that spatially explicit models of habitat quality have relevance to the performance of individual organisms functioning in field environments.

In the present study, the water quality monitoring data in Zhanjiang Port from 2015 to 2022 were utilized to analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics and reveal the correlation between different parameters. The structural equation model has been applied to profile the dominant factors of water quality level. The results showed that the port water quality was generally worse in summer and better in winter. Variations in total phosphorus (TP), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total nitrogen (TN) content directly led to water quality changes in Zhanjiang Port, where an increase in TP content resulted in a significant decrease in water quality level (path coefficient is 2.87). Permanganate index (CODMn) and ammonia nitrogen content indirectly affected the water quality level, while changes in pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) showed no impact. Ammonia nitrogen, pH and DO contents were significantly associated with TP. Human activities and industrial production were identified as the main sources of water quality pollution. The increasing trend of certain water quality parameters highlights the urgency of implementing timely measures to improve water quality conditions in Zhanjiang Bay, China.

Herbicide concentrations exhibited distinct geographic and seasonal patterns. The highest concentrations occurred in midwestern cornbelt states following herbicide application to cropland. Volume-weighted concentrations of 0.2-0.4 mu g/L for atrazine and alachlor were typical in this area during mid-April through mid-July, and weighted concentrations as large as 0.6-0.9 mu g/L occurred at several sites. Concentrations of 1-3 mu g/L were measured in a few individual samples. Atrazine was detected most often followed by alachlor, deethylatrazine, metolachlor, cyanazine, and deisopropylatrazine. The high ratio (similar to 0.5) of deethylatrazine to atrazine in rainfall suggests atmospheric degradation of atrazine. Mass deposition of herbicides was greatest in areas where herbicide use was high and decreased with distance from the cornbelt. Estimated deposition rates for both atrazine and alachlor ranged from more than 240 mu g m(-2) yr(-1) for some areas in the midwestern states to less than 10 mu g m(-2) yr(-1) for the New England states. The estimated annual deposition of atrazine on the Great lakes ranged from about 12 to 63 mu g m(-2) yr(-1). The total a mounts of atrazine and alachlor deposited annually in rainfall in the study area represent about 0.6% of the atrazine and 0.4% of the alachlor applied annually to crops in the study area.					; Thurman, Earl/B-5131-2011; Meyer, Michael/N-7630-2017	THURMAN, Earl Michael/0000-0002-2191-1407; Meyer, Michael/0000-0001-6006-7985													0013-936X					MAY	1997	31	5					1325	1333		10.1021/es960847o	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es960847o													WOS:A1997WW94800028

LCRA's power production includes hydroelectric power plants at the six dams of the Highland Lakes reservoir system, on the Colorado River. To improve power generation, LCRA has investigated alternative operating procedures to increase the winter hydroelectric power generation in the upper reservoirs of the Highland Lakes. A methodology using both optimization and simulation techniques was developed to evaluate the ability of the hydroelectric power plants to meet weather-related winter peak power requirements. A linear-programming procedure determined the hourly generation schedule, over a 24-hr period, that maximized the total power generated over the 6 h of peak power demand. Based on statistical simulation of daily winter inflows and releases using a LOTUS 1-2-3 spreadsheet, it was found that the full generating capacity could be supplied to meet winter power demands with no significant impact on water availability or lake water-surface levels. The developed operating plan is being implemented in LCRA power system operations.																			0733-9496					NOV-DEC	1995	121	6					438	446		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9496(1995)121:6(438)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9496(1995)121:6(438)													WOS:A1995TA12300006

Temporal and Spatial Coexistence of Archaeal and Bacterial amoA Genes and Gene Transcripts in Lake Lucerne	ARCHAEA-AN INTERNATIONAL MICROBIOLOGICAL JOURNAL												Despite their crucial role in the nitrogen cycle, freshwater ecosystems are relatively rarely studied for active ammonia oxidizers (AO). This study of Lake Lucerne determined the abundance of both amoA genes and gene transcripts of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) over a period of 16 months, shedding more light on the role of both AO in a deep, alpine lake environment. At the surface, at 42 m water depth, and in the water layer immediately above the sediment, AOA generally outnumbered AOB. However, in the surface water during summer stratification, when both AO were low in abundance, AOB were more numerous than AOA. Temporal distribution patterns of AOA and AOB were comparable. Higher abundances of amoA gene transcripts were observed at the onset and end of summer stratification. In summer, archaeal amoA genes and transcripts correlated negatively with temperature and conductivity. Concentrations of ammonium and oxygen did not vary enough to explain the amoA gene and transcript dynamics. The observed herbivorous zooplankton may have caused a hidden flux of mineralized ammonium and a change in abundance of genes and transcripts. At the surface, AO might have been repressed during summer stratification due to nutrient limitation caused by active phytoplankton.					; Bodelier, Paul/A-9591-2011; Muyzer, Gerard/A-3161-2013; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012; Laanbroek, Hendrikus/AAV-9215-2020; Schleper, Christa/C-2567-2013	Muyzer, Gerard/0000-0002-2422-0732; Schleper, Christa/0000-0002-1918-2735; Tourna, Maria/0000-0002-6346-0683; Anselmetti, Flavio/0000-0002-8785-3641; Bodelier, Paul/0000-0002-5757-5572; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X; Laanbroek, Hendrikus/0000-0003-2400-3399; 													1472-3646	1472-3654					2013	2013								289478	10.1155/2013/289478	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/289478								23533328					WOS:000316135800001

Lakes Michigan and Huron, which are undergoing oligotrophication after reduction of phosphorus loading, invasion by dreissenid mussels and variation in climate, provide an opportunity to conduct large-scale evaluation of the relative importance of these changes for lake productivity. We used remote sensing, field data and an information-theoretic approach to identify factors that showed statistical relationships with observed changes in chlorophyll a (chla) and primary production (PP). Spring phosphorus (TP), annual mean chla and PP have all declined significantly in both lakes since the late 1990s. Additionally, monthly mean values of chla have decreased in many but not all months, indicating altered seasonal patterns. The most striking change has been the decrease in chla concentration during the spring bloom. Mean chlorophyll a concentration was 17% higher in Lake Michigan than in Lake Huron, and total production for 2008 in Lake Michigan (9.5tgyear(-1)) was 10% greater than in Lake Huron (7.8tgyear(-1)), even though Lake Michigan is slightly smaller (by 3%) than Lake Huron. Differences between the lakes in the early 1970s evidently persisted to 2008. Invasive mussels influenced temporal trends in spring chla and annual primary production. However, TP had a greater effect on chla and primary production than did the mussels, and TP varied independently from them. Two climatic variables (precipitation and air temperature in the basins) influenced annual chla and annual PP, while the extent of ice cover influenced TP but not chla or primary production. Our results demonstrate that observed temporal patterns in chla and PP are the result of complex interactions of P, climate and invasive mussels.

The constraint consists of restricting the set of modern pollen samples considered as analogues of the fossil samples to those locations where the implied change in annual precipitation minus evapotranspiration (P-E) is consistent with the regional change in moisture balance as indicated by lakes. An artificial neural network was used for the spatial interpolation of lake-level changes to the pollen sites, and for mapping palaeoclimate anomalies. The climate variables reconstructed were mean temperature of the coldest month (T-c), growing degree days above 5 degrees C (GDD), moisture availability expressed as the ratio of actual to equilibrium evapotranspiration (alpha), and P-E. The constraint improved the spatial coherency of the reconstructed palaeoclimate anomalies, especially for P-E. The reconstructions indicate clear spatial and seasonal patterns of Holocene climate change, which can provide a quantitative benchmark for the evaluation of palaeoclimate model simulations. Winter temperatures (T-c) were 1-3 K greater than present in the far N and NE of Europe, but 2-4 K less than present in the Mediterranean region. Summer warmth (GDD) was greater than present in NW Europe (by 400-800 K day at the highest elevations) and in the Alps, but >400 K day less than present at lower elevations in S Europe. P-E was 50-250 mm less than present in NW Europe and the Alps, but alpha was 10-15% greater than present in S Europe and P-E was 50-200 mm greater than present in S and E Europe.

Trace metal chemistry in the pristine freshwater Lake Hauroko, Fiordland, New Zealand	MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL												The south-western region of the South Island of New Zealand is remote from human activities and is thought to be minimally affected by anthropogenic contaminants, making it a good candidate for understanding the geochemistry of pristine systems, and for providing baseline concentrations for trace elements and other chemical parameters. We have determined the inorganic and physical characteristics of a remote mountain lake (Lake Hauroko) in this region. The lake exhibits oligotrophic character and major ion concentrations and total alkalinity are very constant throughout summer and winter as well as with depth. Because of the low ionic strength, trace metal concentrations were measured directly on acidified samples by Quadrupole ICP-MS. Concentrations are low throughout, averaging (in ng l(-1)) for Mn 102.9, Fe 4570, Co 531, Ni 98.6, Cu 247.8, Zn 140.7, Cd 1.23 and Pb 24.85. We have compared these results with other lakes in New Zealand, with freshwater systems in Europe and North America as well as with the temperate stream model of Meybeck (1987). These comparisons confirm the very pristine character of this lake, making it an ideal natural laboratory for the study of natural biogeochemical cycles of trace element and nutrients at temperate latitudes.

Mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), and persistent organic pollutants including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are of concern, and these are reported, in some cases for the first time, for fish sampled in and around King William Island, located in Nunavut, Canada. More than 500 salmonids, comprising Arctic char, lake trout, lake whitefish, and ciscoes, were assayed for contaminants. The studied species are anadromous, migrating to the ocean to feed in the summers and returning to freshwater before sea ice formation in the autumn. Assessments of muscle Hg levels in salmonids from fishing sites on King William Island showed generally higher levels than from mainland sites, with mean concentrations generally below guidelines, except for lake trout. In contrast, mainland fish showed higher means for As, including non-toxic arsenobetaine, than island fish. Lake trout were highest in As and PCB levels, with salmonid PCB congener analysis showing signatures consistent with the legacy of cold-war distant early warning stations. After DNA-profiling, only 4-32 Arctic char single nucleotide polymorphisms were needed for successful population assignment. These results support our objective to demonstrate that genomic tools could facilitate efficient and cost-effective cluster assignment for contaminant analysis during ocean residency. We further suggest that routine pollutant testing during the current period of dramatic climate change would be helpful to safeguard the wellbeing of Inuit who depend on these fish as a staple input to their diet. Moreover, this strategy should be applicable elsewhere.

Age Structure and Feeding of the Neotropical Grasshopper Cornops aquaticum (Bruner) (Orthoptera: Acrididae) on Water Hyacinth	NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY												We aimed to evaluate the variation in the age structure of Cornops aquaticum (Bruner) population and its relation to the host plant biomass and the feeding of the different age classes of this grasshopper on the water hyacinth Eichhornia crassipes along 2 years, in a Parana River floodplain lake (Chaco, Argentina). Individuals of C. aquaticum were captured with a 70-cm diameter sweep and separated in nymphs A (instars I and II), nymphs B (instars III to VI), adult females, and adult males; host plant biomass was sampled using a ring with a 0.30-m(2) diameter. Relative daily feeding of C. aquaticum population was calculated by multiplying the number of individuals captured per minute by the daily consumption by individual obtained in each age classes. We found that the age structure and the relative daily feeding of C. aquaticum varied between seasons and years. The highest values of grasshopper abundance, leaf biomass, and relative daily feeding of C. aquaticum population were observed in summer 2006. Plant biomass was directly correlated with nymph abundance and not correlated with adult abundance. Plant biomass available as refuge (leaves), food (laminas), and oviposition site (petioles) to C. aquaticum represented up to 62% of the total plant biomass. The results obtained in C. aquaticum show the importance of considering total plant biomass and plant biomass available for herbivores separately. Our study highlights the need to find an adequate method to estimate the density of C. aquaticum and other semiaquatic grasshoppers in the Parana River floodplain involving different seasons, years, and water phases (rising and falling).

Controls on the chemical and isotopic composition of carbonate springs during evolution to saturation with respect to calcite	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												We investigated the stable carbon isotopic composition (delta C-13) of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in carbonate springs that evolve chemically to supersaturation with respect to calcite and to isotopic equilibrium with atmospheric CO2(g). The delta C-13 of DIC (delta C-13(DIC)) will track isotopic fractionation accompanying carbon loss to the atmosphere, precipitation of calcite or carbon exchange with atmospheric CO2(g). We assessed the DIC and delta C-13(DIC) evolution along the flow paths of springs in the field. Since chemical equilibrium is a precondition for isotopic equilibrium, and because it is difficult to follow the evolution of carbonate springs to isotopic equilibrium with atmospheric CO2(g) in field settings, three sets of spring samples were exposed to laboratory atmospheric CO2(g) and allowed to evolve to isotopic equilibrium. One subset of the experimental sample was agitated to simulate mixing in the field. The physical, chemical and carbon isotopic changes in the field and laboratory experiments were complex and varied. Chemical speciation and isotopic mass balance modeling showed that the evolution to calcite supersaturation can be conceptualized in 4 discrete steps, each characterized either by kinetic fractionation, equilibrium fractionation or carbon isotopic exchange with atmospheric CO2(g). These steps sequentially are (1) undersaturation to supersaturation where DIC decreases from CO2(g) loss from solution and small increases in the delta C-13(DIC) (1-2%) are from kinetic fractionation, (2) saturation to supersaturation where relatively no DIC is lost and small increases in the delta C-13(DIC) (similar to 1%) are likely due to isotopic exchange of carbon between DIC and atmospheric CO2(g), (3) decreasing supersaturation where DIC concentration decreases and larger increases in the delta C-13(DIC) (similar to 5%) are from equilibrium isotopic fractionation and (4) increasing saturation where the previous decreasing supersaturation and DIC concentration decreases reverse and increase because of evaporation, and the continued increase in the delta C-13(DIC) (similar to 2%) is from isotopic exchange of carbon between DIC and atmospheric CO2(g). The unmixed laboratory samples evolved through steps 1, 2 and 3, while the mixed laboratory sample evolved through steps 1, 2, 3 and 4 because agitation of the solution increased the reaction rates and enhanced DIC-atmospheric CO2(g) interaction. The chemical and isotopic evolution of the field samples were limited to steps 1 and 2 because of the relatively short length of flowing springs which limit carbonate evolution to calcite saturation. Our findings suggest that for carbonate springs in contact with atmospheric CO2(g), significant delta C-13(DIC) enrichment that occurs after calcite supersaturation is dominated by equilibrium isotopic effect, despite conditions conducive for calcite precipitation. We hypothesize that the chemical and isotopic behavior observed for the field and laboratory experiments may characterize other carbonate-rich waters (e.g., streams and lakes) evolving in contact with the atmosphere.

Striped bass (n = 28) and HSB (n = 33) were implanted with temperature-sensitive radio tags and tracked biweekly for a period of 19 months to record position and habitat use. Striped bass averaged 715 mm total length (range 533-940) whereas HSB averaged 547 mm total length (range 460-659). Habitat separation was most apparent in the warm season months of June through August. During this period, when deoxygenation of the metalimnion and hypolimnion was not limiting, STB and HSB segregated according to apparent temperature preferences, with HSB selecting warmer temperatures. As deoxygenation progressed, HSB and especially STB were forced into warmer strata than preferred. Results from this study suggest that if favorable dissolved oxygen levels are maintained, STB and HSB will vertically segregate during summer stratification. Temperature selection and qualitative observations of fish mortality in summer indicated that adult HSB would be less vulnerable than adult STB to a temperature-dissolved oxygen squeeze in summer and its detrimental effects.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-36-3				2013	80						147	159																WOS:000323292100008

Male fish dominated the samples, possibly an effect of aggressive behaviour towards the sampling gear used. Ages, determined from sectioned sagittal otoliths, ranged from one to nine years with 94% of the sample being between one and four years of age. An annulus was deposited in late-winter/early spring. Female fish, despite being the largest fish sampled, were found to grow at a significantly slower rate than males. Growth was modelled with the von Bertalanffy model as L (t) = 37.22 (1-exp(-0.66t)) cm SL for males, and L(t) = 48.16(1-exp(-0.41t)) cm SL for females. All fish matured after one year, thereafter they spawned over a four-month period between July and October. Reproductive activity peaked in August. Largemouth bass has successfully colonized freshwater bodies in southern Africa where it has been introduced, causing significant ecological damage to the indigenous ichthyofauna. Given its ability to grow to a large size, and live to an old age and to breed successfully, further introductions should be viewed with extreme caution.

In most of the years, there was a mutual exclusion of mass growths of these two groups. High yields of Fragilaria caused low yields of blue-greens and vice versa. In the first years, Fragilaria was always the first to achieve a mass growth, followed by the Cyanobacteria. Then, in the last years, the blue-greens were succeeded by Fragilaria. Only in some years, there was a large and simultaneous growth of both groups. It has been shown, that the supply of silicon and phosphorus immediately before controlled the pattern of succession in the midsummer period. Mostly, the Si:P ratio was the regulating factor, but there were also years In which tile absolute concentration level of these two nutrients were either non-limiting high or below the minimum resource concentration necessary to compensate for the losses. In these cases, the Si:P ratio lost its controlling function. Other influencing factors are discussed, In particular the effect of turbulent mixing. The special nutrient conditions in the midsummer were nor only determined by the external load but also by the Si depletion during the spring mass development of diatoms other than Fragilaria, which mostly is physically controlled. Therefore, the succession pattern in the midsummer is sensitive to the meteorological conditions to a large extent.																			0273-1223						1995	32	4					77	88		10.1016/0273-1223(95)00683-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0273-1223(95)00683-4													WOS:A1995TP50500010

These phenomena were (1) massive invasive ctenophore blooms during the summer of 2020 and red tide occurrences in spring 2021 in the northern Adriatic, (2) the formation of the gelatinous macroaggregates in the coastal waters of the central Adriatic during the summer of 2021, and (3) intense autotrophic activity within the water column of the highly stratified and eutrophic marine system of Rogoznica Lake. All these events encompassed single -species plankton blooms characterized by a remarkable increase of OM (up to 320 mg L-1 of DOC and POC) with different surface-active properties (up to 15 mg L-1 of SAS) appearing in the otherwise oligotrophic Adriatic Sea. The NSA, in addition to voltammetric curves with well-defined desorption waves, is a good indicator of the presence of a different type of OM, which can be considered a possible tracer for certain processes in the marine environment. Based on our measurements, a rough threshold value for the OM hydrophobicity -reactivity of NSA = 0.083 is proposed. OM with a value above this threshold is more hydrophobic, as in the case of red tides and gelatinous zooplankton blooms with an average NSA between 0.13 and 0.16. OM with a value below this threshold indicates the presence of more hydrophilic substances such as pollen and OM produced by purple sulfur bacteria.					ciglenecki, irena/N-8792-2013; Paliaga, Paolo/AAW-6830-2021	Ciglenecki, Irena/0000-0002-1873-6193; 													1108-393X						2024	25	1								10.12681/mms.35082	http://dx.doi.org/10.12681/mms.35082													WOS:001208385300001

Merganser used the widest reaches of rivers, and islands and shoals habitats that accounted for only a small proportion of overall habitat. Percentage of woodland and farmland along the river bank was large. Chinese merganser apparently adapted to large-scale width variation of the river using vegetation cover to mitigate effects of human activity. Distance between the river, where merganser resided, and artificial land (residence, industrial land and bridge) was relatively far, while the distance between river and motorways was relative short. Chinese merganser preferred habitat which had larger percentage of island and was far away from artificial land. In winter, the Chinese merganser was able to tolerate small degree of disturbance such as small population or traffic flow, but avoided higher levels of disturbance. Effective winter habitat protection for the Chinese merganser should include protecting watersheds from flooding and avoiding excessive human activity particularly on more narrow reaches of rivers that are devoid of vegetation.																			0030-9923					OCT	2015	47	5					1421	1426																WOS:000363996800027

The effect of the East Atlantic pattern on the precipitation δ18O-NAO relationship in Europe	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is known to influence precipitation delta O-18 (delta O-18(p)) through its control on air temperature and on the trajectory of the westerly winds that carry moisture onto Europe during boreal winters. Hence, paleoclimate studies seeking to reconstruct the NAO can exploit the delta O-18 signal that is commonly preserved in natural archives such as stalagmites, ice cores, tree rings and lake sediments. However, such reconstructions should consider the uncertainties that arise from non-stationarities in the delta O-18(p)-NAO relationship. Here, new insights into the causes of these temporal non-stationarities are presented for the European region using both observations (GNIP database) and the output of an isotope-enabled general circulation model (ECHAM5-wiso). The results show that, although the East Atlantic (EA) pattern is generally uncorrelated to delta O-18(p) during the instrumental period, its polarity affects the delta O-18(p)-NAO relationship. Non-stationarities in this relationship result from spatial shifts of the delta O-18(p)-NAO correlated areas as a consequence of different NAO/EA combinations. These shifts are consistent with those reported previously for NAO-winter climate variables and the resulting non-stationarities mean that delta O-18-based NAO reconstructions could be compromised if the balance of positive and negative NAO/EA states differs substantially in a calibration period compared with the period of interest in the past. The same approach has been followed to assess the relationships between delta O-18(p) and both winter total precipitation and winter mean surface air temperature, with similar results. Crucially, this study also identifies regions within Europe where temporal changes in the NAO, air temperature and precipitation can be more robustly reconstructed using delta O-18 time series from natural archives, irrespective of concomitant changes in the EA.

Spatial Distribution of Methane Concentration in Baikal Surface Water in the Spring Period	ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS												The results of describing the spatial distribution of methane concentration in the surface water of Lake Baikal in the spring are presented. The basis was the measurements of CH4 content which were first carried out in the round-the-clock continuous mode along the entire route of the passage of research vessel in the complex expeditions of Limnological Institute, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences, in the spring seasons of 2013, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2021, and 2022. Based on the results of six expeditions, a merged data array was compiled; it included 12 100 segments (with a step of 0.005 degrees in latitude and 0.01 degrees in longitude) which covered the total area 4466.7 km(2), or 14% of the surface of Lake Baikal. For a more detailed description of the spatial distribution of methane concentrations in surface water throughout the Baikal water area, the statistical characteristics were calculated in four zones: between 0 and 100 m, 100 and 200 m, 200 and 400 m, and over 400 m isobaths. The comparison of the methane concentrations in the analyzed array with the data of other researchers obtained in different years in nearby regions of the water area made it possible to conclude that the results presented in the work adequately reflect the most stable features of the spatial distribution of methane concentration in surface water of Lake Baikal in spring seasons.

J	Ahearn, DS; Dahlgren, RA				Ahearn, DS; Dahlgren, RA			Sediment and nutrient dynamics following a low-head dam removal at Murphy Creek, California	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We studied the impact of the removal of a 3-m dam on sediment and nutrient export. In the year after dam removal, sediment and nitrogen (N) export increased by an order of magnitude over the previous 2-yr mean. Longitudinal surface water samples were collected, sediments were cored, and the channel was surveyed during different seasons to determine the mechanisms driving sediment and nutrient dynamics in the recovering system. The majority of sediment transport occurred in pools and in the lowest 50 in of the 620-m restored reach. Phosphate export occurred primarily during large storms, with the restored reach acting as a phosphate sink during most flow conditions. The majority of surface water N originated from areas within the sediment wedge that had high extractable N concentrations (average NH4-N = 50 mu g g(-1) and NO3-N = 38 mu g g(-1)) and dried out on a seasonal basis. Near the former dam site, year-round water saturation apparently inhibited nitrification and export of N as nitrate. This wetland area was the only portion of the restored reach that was an ammonium sink. After dam removal, N leaching from sediments occurred in autumn 2003 and again during the subsequent autumn, suggesting that N leaching from reservoir sediments is largely a seasonal process that may affect downstream aquatic ecosystems for a number of years.

AD 600 and was most pronounced between ca. AD 1000 and 1200. Warmer summer temperatures during this period (coeval with the 'Medieval Warm Period' observed in other parts of Europe) are evident in a 100-140 m upward shift in the pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) limit in the Khibiny Mountains. On average, the cellulose of pine trees that grew between ca. AD 1000 and 1300 is enriched by delta(13)C values of around 1parts per thousandcompared to the modem trees from the region, further suggesting warmer summer climate than at present. The Medieval Warm Period was also accompanied by a steady decline in avalanche activity and the resulting fort-nation of soils on the current avalanche cones in the Khibiny Mountains, suggesting lower winter precipitation and thinner snow cover. Lower precipitation is also evident by currently submerged tree stumps dating to the medieval period that indicate lower lake levels on the Kola Peninsula. In the middle of the peninsula at about AD 1000, the level of small closed-basin lakes was similar to1 m lower than the modem time at some sites. Drier conditions may be attributable to decreased cyclonic activity. The medieval warm and dry episode was followed at ca. AD 1300 by the development of a colder climate with increased precipitation resulting in a decline in the alpine pine limits, increased avalanche activity, and higher lake levels. That phase corresponds to the modem aeolian episode reconstructed in subarctic Finland. Our results indicate that the Medieval Warm Period on the Kola Peninsula experienced notably warm and dry conditions. Hence, this period of warming extends to northwestern Russia as well as other parts of Europe. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

J	Li, Y; Xu, LM				Li, Yu; Xu, Lingmei			Asynchronous Holocene Asian monsoon vapor transport and precipitation	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Millennial-scale variations in the Asian monsoon vapor transport are always associated with long-term changes in monsoon rainfall according to the conventional understanding. However, recent advances in monsoon studies suggested that regional monsoon rainfall has different responses to monsoon vapor transport. This paper presents a comparison between monsoonal vapor and precipitation records along the path of the Asian summer monsoon vapor transport. Pedogenic carbonate delta O-18 values in both surface sediment and Holocene eolian and lacustrine sediments from the Shiyang River drainage basin were used to investigate the variations of the Asian monsoon vapor transport. Meanwhile, Holocene lake-level changes of the terminal lake were reconstructed to reflect the monsoon precipitation variability. The results show that millennial-scale monsoon vapor transport is in accordance with low-latitude summer insolation, while the increasing summer monsoon rainfall during the early Holocene lags the monsoon water vapor transport. In addition, the relatively cold oceans left over from glacial periods and slow melting of ice sheets may temper the onset of the rainfall. These findings can provide insights into the interpretation of the asynchronous Holocene records from lakes and caves,in East Asia. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effects of climate change and eutrophication on cisco Coregonus artedi abundance in Minnesota lakes	BIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT OF COREGONID FISHES - 2008	Advances in Limnology				10th Symposium on the Biology and Management of Coregonid Fishes	AUG, 2008	Winnipeg, CANADA					Trends in cisco abundance were examined from 1947 through 2007 in 634 Minnesota lakes. Declines in cisco abundance starting in 1980 corresponded with significantly warmer summer nights and longer growing seasons. The increased warming and longer durations of summer stratification likely reduced thermal habitat to the point where cisco populations are being impacted. Cisco have declined both in lakes that have experienced cultural eutrophication in the Eastern Temperate Forests ecoregion and in lakes that have not experienced significant cultural eutrophication in the Northern Forests ecoregion. Cultural eutrophication since the late 1800s probably set a lower baseline abundance for cisco in some lakes primarily in the Eastern Temperate Forests ecoregion, but recent declines in abundance in these lakes were probably the result of climate change. Also, increased abundances of an important cisco predator, northern pike, may have contributed to the decline.																			1612-166X		978-3-510-47065-5				2012	63						417	+																WOS:000313086600028

This review examines the physical habitat and ecology of glacial rivers which have been relatively unstudied compared with rivers originating from other sources. 2. Typical glacial rivers have summer temperatures below 10 degrees C, a single seasonal peak in discharge, which in the Northern Hemisphere typically occurs in July, a diel fluctuation in flow which usually peaks in late afternoon, and turbidity levels in summer that exceed 30 NTU. These variables contrast with those in snowmelt/rainfall streams, particularly in summer, and make conditions more extreme for the biota. 3. Where maximum temperatures are less than or equal to 2 degrees C benthic invertebrate communities are dominated by Diamesa (Chironomidae). Downstream, temperatures increase, channels become more stable and valley floors become older. Orthocladiinae (Chironomidae), Simuliidae, Baetidae, Nemouridae and Chloroperlidae become characteristic members of the invertebrate community. 4. Fauna may be displaced, or at least colonization delayed, by channel instability; the variable age structure of the valley floor will influence the faunal gradient, which may also be reset by the effects of tributaries, lakes and valley confinement. 5. We propose a qualitative model that outlines zoobenthic community gradients determined by two principal variables, water temperature and channel stability, as a function of distance downstream, or time since deglaciation.																			0046-5070					OCT	1994	32	2					295	307		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1994.tb01127.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1994.tb01127.x													WOS:A1994PQ02700005

Linking Dominant Rainfall-Runoff Event Hydrologic Response Dynamics With Nitrate and Chloride Load Estimates of Three Boreal Shield Catchments	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Understanding hydrological dynamics in boreal Shield catchments is critical for projecting changes in stream runoff and chemistry in a region that is, sensitive to climate change. Previous work has mostly focused on a limited number of events over one or a few seasons because of the relative scarcity of high-frequency datasets and automated tools for rainfall-runoff event delineation. For the boreal region, a greater understanding of seasonality in hydrologic response and solute export related to rainfall-initiated events is needed, as significant shifts in hydrologic regimes from climate change are expected. This study aimed to help resolve these knowledge gaps by assessing event-scale hydrologic response dynamics and stream loads of nitrate and chloride using long-term data from three boreal Shield catchments. Hydrometric and stream chemistry data from 2001 to 2018 were analyzed to delineate rainfall-runoff events and estimate event nitrate and chloride loads. Event hydrologic response and loads were highly variable, especially with respect to catchment runoff initiation. Only subtle differences in hydrologic response dynamics were observed between summer and fall events, while seasonal differences in event nitrate and chloride loads were most statistically significant. Interestingly, a wide range of rainfall-runoff events classified by response magnitude and timing was associated with differences in nitrate and chloride export. This study further confirms the utility of long-term high-frequency datasets and illustrates the need for additional work to further assess long-term changes in event-based hydrologic response and stream solute concentrations in the boreal region.					; Casson, Nora/P-1915-2018	Ross, Cody/0000-0002-4095-7566; Casson, Nora/0000-0002-0701-1816													2169-8953	2169-8961				SEP	2021	126	9							e2020JG006187	10.1029/2020JG006187	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JG006187													WOS:000703067000017

The authors also examined the level of respiration activity of soil in the presence of shrimp waste. Results demonstrate that the number of microorganisms in soil were variable. During the entire research period, the analyzed groups of microorganisms predominated in ploughland soils with the number of heterotrophic bacteria significantly exceeding that of actinomyces and fungi. The proportion of microorganisms capable of decomposing chitin was greater among actinomycetes and fungi than among heterotrophic bacteria. Chitinolytic bacteria constituted 15-25% of the total number of heterotrophic bacteria and their proportion was higher in sandy soil. Chitinolytic fungi constituted 29-42% and also dominated in sandy soil. Chitinolytic actinomycetes constituted 48-69% and also dominated in sandy soil. The level of respiration activity soil statistically depended on examined factors. Respiratory activity was highest at 24 degrees C (in summer) and lowest at 6 degrees C (in spring). During the entire research period, the microorganisms inhabiting sandy soil were more readily able to take advantage of shrimp waste and found shrimp heads the most useful, shells the least useful.

J	Berg, LK; Zhong, SY				Berg, LK; Zhong, SY			Sensitivity of MM5-simulated boundary layer characteristics to turbulence parameterizations	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY												The sensitivity of high-resolution mesoscale simulations to boundary layer turbulence parameterizations is investigated using the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5) and observations from two field campaigns. Three widely used turbulence parameterizations were selected for evaluation, two of which [Blackadar (BK) and Medium Range Forecast (MRF) schemes] are simple first-order nonlocal schemes and one [Gayno-Seaman (GS) scheme] of which is a more complex 1.5-order local scheme that solves a prognostic equation for turbulence kinetic energy (TKE). The two datasets are the summer 1996 Boundary Layer Experiment (BLX96) in the southern Great Plains and the autumn 2000 Vertical Transport and Mixing (VTMX) field campaign in the Salt Lake Valley in Utah. Comparisons are made between observed and simulated mean variables and turbulence statistics. Despite the differences in their complexity, all three schemes show similar skill predicting near-surface and boundary layer mean temperature, humidity, and winds at both locations. The BK and MRF schemes produced daytime boundary layers that are more mixed than those produced by the GS scheme. The mixed-layer depths are generally overestimated by the MRF scheme, underestimated by the GS scheme, and well estimated by the BK scheme. All of the schemes predicted surface latent heat fluxes that agreed reasonably well with the observed values, but they substantially overestimated surface sensible heat fluxes because of a significant overprediction of net radiation. In addition, each parameterization overestimated the sensible and latent heat flux aloft. The results suggest that there is little gain in the overall accuracy of forecasts with increasing complexity of turbulence parameterizations.

The input data include: rainfall, temperature, extraterrestrial radiation and astronomical mid-month daylight hours. The model uses two empirical coefficients for computing the potential evaporation and one parameter for the soil capacity. The case studies are two subcatchments of the Altiplano (196 000 km(2)), in which the central low points are Lake Titicaca and a salar corresponding to the desiccation of the Tauca palaeolake. During the Holocene, the two catchments experienced a 100 m fall in water level corresponding to a decrease in water surface area of 3586 km(2) and 55 000 km(2), respectively. Under modern climatic conditions with a marked rainy season, the model allows simulation of water levels in good agreement with the observations: 3810 m a.s.l. for Lake Titicaca and lack of permanent wide ponds in the southern subcatchment. Simulations were carried out under different climatic conditions that might explain the Holocene fall in water level. Computed results show quite different behaviour for the two subcatchments. For the northern subcatchment, the time required for the 100 m fall in lake-level ranges between 200 and 2000 years when, compared with the present conditions, (i) the rainfall is decreased by 15% (640 mm/year), or (ii) the temperature is increased by 5-5 degreesC, or (iii) rainfall is distributed equally over the year. For the southern subcatchment (Tauca palaeolake), the time required for a 100 m decrease in water level ranges between 50 and 100 years. This decrease requires precipitation values lower than 330 mm/year. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

J	Kunkel, KE; Angel, JR				Kunkel, KE; Angel, JR			Relationship of ENSO to snowfall and related cyclone activity in the contiguous United States	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The relationship of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation to the contiguous U.S, snowfall was investigated using data from 3841 cooperative observer stations for the period 1951-1997. Snowfall for seven strong El Nino and five strong La Nina events was compared with snowfall occurring during the other 34 winters. The average snowfall for the seven El Nino winters exhibits a coherent large-scale pattern with below-average snowfall across approximately the northern half of the United States and above-average snowfall over the southwestern United States. Application of the t-test indicates that these snowfall anomalies are significantly different (at the 10% level) from the base period snowfall in parts of the mid-Mississippi River basin, the northern Ohio River basin, the western Great Lakes, and the northwestern United States. During strong La Nina winters, above-normal snowfall occurs in the northwest United States and northern Great Lakes. Although these anomalies do not pass tests of statistical significance (at the 10% level), the difference between La Nina and El Nino years is quite notable in the northwest United States. The results suggest that useful long-range outlooks of snowfall anomalies are possible for certain areas of the contiguous United States during strong El Nino events. An analysis of the frequency of strong cyclones (central pressure <992 hPa) shows that the El Nino winters were characterized by above-normal frequency in the extreme southern United States and below-normal frequency along the U.S.-Canadian border, with the pattern approximately reversed in the La Nina winters.

Daphnia growth rates were obtained from standardized laboratory experiments feeding the animals natural lake seston. The experimental period spanned one season. Elemental (carbon nitrogen, phosphate) and biochemical (fatty acids) food parameters of this natural food source were compared. The correlation between growth rates and sestonic phosphorus was very weak (r2 = 0.08). The regressions with the nitrogen (r2 = 0.42) and carbon (r2 = 0.62) content were significantly better but still exhibited the usual considerable scatter around the regression line. In contrast, a very tight correlation (r2 = 0.93) was found between Daphnia growth rates and the sestonic content of eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5 omega 3), an essential, highly unsaturated fatty acid. This relationship exhibited a normal asymptotic curve with a distinct plateau above concentrations of 0.8 mug 20:5 omega 3/L. In contrast, a plateau was not observed for particulate organic carbon, nitrogen or phosphate. Carbon, nitrogen and other essential fatty acids were not only moderatly correlated to Daphnia's growth rates but also to 20:5 omega 3. Thus, the modest suitability of carbon and nitrogen as food parameters seems to be due to co-occurrence with 20:5 omega 3. This shows, that the sestonic 20:5 omega 3 content is a parameter for natural food quantity including its food quality. High 20:5 omega 3 concentrations within the plateau region occurred mostly during spring. These results suggest that Daphnia was limited by the 20:5 omega 3 concentration during most of the summer.																			0003-9136					JAN	1995	132	3					297	307																WOS:A1995QH26600003
J	Williams, MR; King, KW				Williams, Mark R.; King, Kevin W.			Changing Rainfall Patterns Over the Western Lake Erie Basin (1975-2017): Effects on Tributary Discharge and Phosphorus Load	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												In agricultural watersheds, shifting climate and hydrologic patterns present an immediate and future risk to both farm productivity and downstream aquatic ecosystems. Here, our objective was to evaluate long-term spatiotemporal trends in rainfall amount and intensity within the Maumee River-Lake Erie system and quantify the effects of rainfall patterns on streamflow and phosphorus loading. Across the watershed, annual rainfall increased by 102 +/- 115 mm (11 +/- 13%) from 1975-2017. Heavy (25.4-76.2 mm) and very heavy (>76.2 mm) rainfall accounted for most of the increase in total rainfall, with observed increases of 45 +/- 32% that occurred primarily during spring and summer. Trends in streamflow for 12 monitored subwatersheds generally followed patterns in rainfall, as discharge increased by 19 +/- 32%. Discharge-to-rainfall ratio increased in 9 of 12 subwatersheds despite no change or increases in watershed storage capacity, suggesting that increasing rainfall intensity that exceeds short-term watershed storage capacity (i.e., during/immediately following the rainfall event) may control patterns of discharge more than long-term gains in watershed storage (i.e., changes in soil water holding capacity). Long-term trends in phosphorus (total phosphorus and soluble reactive phosphorus) load indicate that changes in rainfall amount and intensity have substantially contributed to increased loading through increased discharge volumes. Differences in total phosphorus and soluble reactive phosphorus concentration trends also highlight how concomitant changes in rainfall and land management practices have influenced loading. Findings therefore suggest that changing patterns in rainfall amount and intensity have and will likely continue to pose a significant challenge to conservation efforts in agricultural landscapes aiming to decrease phosphorus delivery to surface waters.

How well do single samples reflect rotifer species diversity?: A test based on interannual variation of rotifer communities in Big Bend National Park (Texas, USA)	HYDROBIOLOGIA					11th International Rotifer Symposium	MAR 11-18, 2006	Natl Autonomous Univ Mexico, Mexico City, MEXICO	Autonomous Metropolitan Univ, Unit Xochimilco	Natl Autonomous Univ Mexico			Studies of rotifer community composition and dynamics often rely on limited sampling regimes. To determine how well species richness is reflected in these studies, we examined interannual variation of rotifer species richness and monogonont community structure from 10 aquatic systems comprising four habitat types-springs, rock pools (tinajas), former cattle tanks, and artificial ponds-in Big Bend National Park (Texas, USA). Planktonic, littoral, and benthic samples were collected from all sites at about the same date for each of five summers (2001-2005). Our survey yielded 15 monogonont families including 30 genera and 84 species. Two bdelloid taxa also were designated. Species richness varied widely among these four habitats: range, 1-32; mean (+/- 1 SD), 11.2 +/- 8.0. Total Species richness in the habitats also varied considerably: springs (54 taxa) > artificial ponds (35 taxa) > tinajas (19 taxa) > cattle tanks (15 taxa). Sessile species comprised approximate to 13% of the taxa in our samples. Species turnover indices (STI) of these systems indicate low overall relatedness: mean (+/- 1 S.D.) = 85.2 +/- 7.1%. The relative frequency of encounter of most taxa in the four systems was low, with 79 taxa (approximate to 92%) having values <= 2.0%. Singleton rates were quite high, ranging from 46.7 to 71.4%, with an overall mean approximate to 65.1%. Most importantly, we found that both species richness and STI varied considerably among habitat type. Species richness varied by 2-10x between consecutive years and STI ranged from 64 to 89% over the entire study. Our results indicate that rotifer community composition fluctuates greatly over time, and that rotifer community structure may be more labile than is generally believed. Species richness and thus biodiversity may be dramatically underestimated using single sampling or short-term strategies that are often employed in studies of zooplankton community structure.

J	Johansen, KM; Lemelin, RH				Johansen, Kelsey M.; Lemelin, Raynald Harvey			Is winter coming? Outdoor recreation voluntary associations and fat biking in Northwestern Ontario and Northeastern Minnesota	JOURNAL OF OUTDOOR RECREATION AND TOURISM-RESEARCH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												Outdoor recreation voluntary associations (ORVAs) such as mountain biking associations play vital roles in the creation, management, and upkeep of trail systems in North America. While research on ORVAs has expanded in the last decade, studies have not sufficiently examined the challenges presented by the impacts of climate disruption on ORVAs, including increased demands on volunteers and event cancellations, nor the potential longterm impacts on the viability of trail-based activities coordinated by ORVAs. Based on interviews and surveys conducted in Northwestern Ontario (NWO) and Northeastern Minnesota (NEM), this study aimed to 1) ascertain the extent of fat biking participation in NWO and NEM and the ridership profiles of those engaged in this recreational activity, 2) assess their levels of engagement as volunteers within local ORVAs, 3) assess their willingness to volunteer in the future, and 4) explore the challenges and opportunities associated with the inclusion of fat biking as a climate change adaptive strategy within regional recreation offerings. Findings revealed that while fat bikers appreciated the volunteer efforts of trail groomers and event/race coordinators more than forty percent were unlikely to volunteer with local ORVAs. Existing ORVA volunteers reported higher demands on their time during heavy snow seasons, as well as burnout associated with a lack of volunteer recruitment and retention strategies. With climate disruption trends expected to continue, Mountain Biking ORVAs (MB-ORVAs) must proactively manage associated and compounded challenges by developing seasonal trail grooming and volunteer recruitment, management, and retention strategies and should consider rotating co-hosting duties for collaborative fat bike events to ensure the provision of safe and well-groomed trails, and regularly occurring events, which support the continued development and growth of regional winter fat biking engagement. Statement of management implications: By highlighting how fat biking is employed to provide yearround trail riding opportunities, this study expands on current understandings of Mountain Biking Outdoor Recreation Voluntary Associations (MB-ORVAs) in the U.S. and Canada. MB-ORVAs must proactively manage the challenges associated with climate disruptions and the increased demand placed on volunteer groomers and administrative capacities. MB-ORVAs should: center dot Continually assess fat bikers' perceptions of natural resource conditions (e.g., snow volume, frequency and severity of snow fall, depth of snowpack, etc. ) within provided recreation settings, and the individual adaptive strategies fat bikers and other outdoor recreationists employ when faced with suboptimal conditions; center dot Assess the impact of fat bikers' perceptions of natural resource conditions and the severity of climate disruptions on their willingness to volunteer for trail grooming and event hosting initiatives; center dot Develop a binational/biannual fat biking event to distribute hosting responsibilities, reduce strain on volunteers and local MB-ORVA resources, and provide a platform to showcase existing and emerging fat biking trails in both regions; center dot Develop and implement an annual volunteer engagement and sentiment survey to solicit feedback on perceived volunteer workload, sentiment towards volunteering, and experiences of volunteering from both active and passive ORVA members; and, center dot Implement volunteer recruitment and retention strategies, including establishing a volunteer recognition program, developing targeted volunteer recruitment and retention plans, and hiring a dedicated volunteer coordinator to lead these initiatives. Adopting these strategies will position MB-ORVAs in NWO and NEM, and other regions impacted by climate disruptions, to deliver high-quality winter recreational experiences, including safe, well-groomed trails, and regularly occurring events.

J	TARDIF, J; BERGERON, Y				TARDIF, J; BERGERON, Y			ECOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF BLACK ASH STANDS (FRAXINUS-NIGRA) ON THE SHORE OF LAKE DUPARQUET (NORTHWESTERN QUEBEC)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												Spring and early summer flood is one of the main factors affecting the dynamics of black ash (Fraxinus nigra Marsh.) stands growing on lake floodplains in the boreal forest. The effect of flooding on the vegetation was studied in five stands on the shore of Lake Duparquet in Abitibi, northwestern Quebec. Divisive hierarchical classification analysis (Twinspan) revealed the existence of four different vegetation types: (i) black ash - speckled alder (Alnus rugosa) - bog willow (Salix pedicellaris), (ii) black ash - balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera) - ostrich fern (Matteuccia struthiopteris), (iii) black ash - pussy willow (Salix discolor) - sensitive fern (Onoclea sensibilis), and (iv) black ash - speckled alder - sensitive fern. Detrended correspondance analysis (Decorana) shows that elevation and drainage are the main factors affecting plant distribution and dynamics. Geomorphology also plays a major role in the way each stand responds to flooding. For each of the vegetation types studied, black ash shows a particular regeneration pattern and sexual regeneration tends to become less frequent with increasing exposure to flooding. Finally, the strong sexual regeneration and the youth of the populations found in the most elevated sites could be related to a possible alteration of the flood regime.																			0008-4026					NOV	1992	70	11					2294	2302		10.1139/b92-285	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b92-285													WOS:A1992KE67400022

Mineralogy and origin of rhizoliths on the margins of saline, alkaline Lake Bogoria, Kenya Rift Valley	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												A wide range of rhizoliths occurs around the margins of Lake Bogoria, Kenya. These include root casts, moulds, tubules, rhizocretions, and permineralised root systems. These rhizoliths are variably composed of opaline silica, calcite, zeolites (mainly analcime), fluorite, and possibly fluorapatite, either alone or in combinations. Some rhizoliths are infilled moulds with detrital silicate grains. Most rhizoliths are in situ, showing both vertical and horizontal orientations. Reworked rhizoliths have been concentrated locally to form dense rhizolites. Hot-spring fluids, concentrated by evapotranspiration and capillary evaporation, have provided most of the silica for the permineralisation of the plant tissues. Precipitation involved the growth of silica nanospheres and microspheres that coalesced into homogeneous masses. Calcite rhizoliths formed following evaporative concentration, evapotranspiration, and (or) CO2 degassing of Ca-bearing runoff water that infiltrated the sediment, or by mixing of runoff with saline, alkaline groundwater. Fluorite precipitated in areas where mixing of hot-spring and meteoric waters occurred, or possibly where hot-spring fluids came into contact with pre-existing calcite. Zeolitic rhizoliths formed during a prolonged period of aridity, when capillary rise and evaporative pumping brought saline, alkaline waters into contact with detrital silicate minerals around roots.

J	Ndebele-Murisa, MR; Hill, T; Ramsay, L				Ndebele-Murisa, Mzime Regina; Hill, Trevor; Ramsay, Lisa			Validity of downscaled climate models and the implications of possible future climate change for Lake Kariba's Kapenta fishery	ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT												Downscaled global climate models can be used to investigate the regional impacts of future emission scenarios. The downscaled models can be validated by how well they can reproduce past, observed climate. This paper investigates the possible future climate of Lake Kariba in Northwestern Zimbabwe under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) A2 and B1 emission scenarios for the near (2046-2065) and far future (20812100). Nine models were employed and all reflected past climate (1961-2009) well, accurately reproducing the annual cycle and capturing the unimodal annual rainy season and temperatures summer maxima and winter minima. The models project a drier climate with an average decrease in rainfall ranging from 3% to 27.46% with the exception of increased rainfall around the early rainy period (October-November) under A2 and in March under both scenarios for both the near and far future periods. Models predict that both minimum and maximum temperatures will increase by an average of 3.17-3.42 degrees C. A polynomial (order 3) model was used to investigate the implications of the future climate projections on the sardine fish Limnothrissa miodon (Kapenta) production based on the median of all nine models for future climate. If all conditions remain the same the Kapenta fish production in Lake Kariba could continue to decline. Options and strategies for fishery management that can boost Kapenta fish production are suggested in the wake of such possible, detrimental future climate changes.

J	Wu, HY				Wu, Hongyan			Irreversibility and natural resource allocation: applying Krutilla-Fisher model in water allocation	WATER SUPPLY												Development projects that are created on the basis of using surface water resources such as rivers and lakes without considering the values of the ecosystem cause irreparable damage. Water transfer is one of the options of water management, which is done to allocate water to the agricultural, domestic and industrial sectors and reduces the ecosystem's share of natural water resources. Food supply, industrial development and population growth are the phenomena of the present condition, which are opposed to the ecosystem services that the future generation needs. This study has been carried out in order to develop an optimal control model for the allocation of a natural water resource considering irreversibility. This method is inspired by the Krutilla-Fisher model, which was developed in the form of the possibility of improving agricultural water management. The results showed that by applying optimal management in 25% of agricultural water use, it is possible to provide 100 and 65% of the ecosystem's water requirements in winter and summer, respectively. It showed that the allocation of river water for different uses in the current situation does not follow an optimal policy. In fact, it exacerbates environmental irreversibility in the ecosystem.																			1606-9749	1607-0798				NOV	2023	23	11					4625	4635		10.2166/ws.2023.259	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/ws.2023.259		OCT 2023											WOS:001080845600001
J	Gilbert, R; Lamoureux, S				Gilbert, R; Lamoureux, S			Processes affecting deposition of sediment in a small, morphologically complex lake	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Devil Lake is morphologically complex as a result of Pleistocene glacial erosion of the Frontenac Axis of the Canadian Shield. In order to assess the processes causing highly variable sedimentation in the lake, we monitored currents, suspended sediment and temperature in the lake before and during autumn overturn in 2002. Strong summer thermal stratification (stability number to 0.11 s(-1) declining with the approach of overturn) was insufficient to prevent a dynamic response in the hypolimnion to wind forcing. Superimposed on a gradual increase in suspended sediment concentration in the last weeks of stratification from less than 2 mug/l to about 30 mug/l were shorter-term rises lasting up to several days. Associated with these events was an increase in particle size of the sediment from a mode of 40 - 50 to 150 - 200 mum ascribed to flocculation from primary particles. These events culminated in rapid (< 1 h) clearing of the water associated with strong, sustained winds over the lake, especially from the southwest. After overturn, the events were more frequent, and flocculation was unable to develop as well in the more vigorous circulation. However, currents in the hypolimnion occurred throughout the period before, during and after overturn with speed related to wind speed, but direction largely independent of wind direction. The results represent an approach to understanding the nature of sedimentary processes and thus to strengthening the use of sedimentary records as proxy in environmental and paleoenvironmental assessment.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				JAN	2004	31	1					37	48		10.1023/B:JOPL.0000013279.78388.24	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:JOPL.0000013279.78388.24													WOS:000188423700004

To present various CG lightning flash characteristics, 10 km x 10 km grid cells are used, while for estimating thunderstorm days, circles with radii of 17.5 km in the 1 km x 1 km grid cells are used. A total of 4 328 892 CG lightning flashes are used to analyze counts, density, polarity, peak current, and thunderstorm days. An average of 151 days with thunderstorm (appearing anywhere in Poland) occurs each year. The annual number of days with thunderstorms increases southeasterly from the coast of the Baltic Sea (15-20 days) to the Carpathian Mountains (30-35 days). The mean CG lightning flash density varies from 0.2 to 3.1 flashes km(-2) yr(-1) with the highest values in the southwest-northeast belt from Krakow-Czstochowa Upland to the Masurian Lake District. The maximum daily CG lightning flash density in this region amounted to 9.1 km(-2) day(-1) (3 July 2012). The monthly variation shows a well-defined thunderstorm season extending from May to August with July as the peak month. The vast majority of CG lightning flashes were detected during the daytime (85%) with a peak at 1400 UTC and a minimum at 0700 UTC. Almost 97% of all CG lightning flashes in the present study had a negative current, reaching the highest average monthly values in February (55 kA) and the lowest in July (24 kA). The percentage of positive CG lightning flashes was the lowest during the summer (2%-3%) and the highest during the winter (10%-20%).					; Taszarek, Mateusz/CNK-2728-2022	Taszarek, Mateusz/0000-0001-9578-5872; Czernecki, Bartosz/0000-0001-6496-1386; 													0027-0644	1520-0493				NOV	2015	143	11					4285	4304		10.1175/MWR-D-15-0206.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-15-0206.1													WOS:000363696800001
J	DeMott, LM; Scholz, CA; Awaleh, MO				DeMott, Laura M.; Scholz, Christopher A.; Awaleh, Mohamed Osman			Lacustrine carbonate towers of Lake Abhe, Djibouti: Interplay of hydrologic and microbial processes	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Lake Abhe, located at the triple junction between the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Main Ethiopian rift trends, is a hypersaline and alkaline closed lake that is known for its exposures of massive carbonate chimneys on the flat-lying sediments of the lakes eastern margin. This study describes the morphological, textural, and petrographic characteristics of these chimneys at the basin- to microscopic-scale in order to constrain the carbonate depositional system in the context of basin hydroclimate history. Chimneys occur in three main fields and are assessed according to 1) large-scale (>5 m) morphological variations, 2) meso-scale (cm to <5 m) textures, and 3) micro-scale (<1 cm) fabrics. The dominant chimney fabric is a porous crystalline framework of trigonal prismatic and dendritic calcite crystals that locally contain spherulites, sickle-cell calcite fabrics, and entombed microbial coca In addition to the crystalline chimneys, other carbonate sediments include stromatolitic crusts composed of microdigitate laminated columns dominated by crystalline fan microfabrics, as well as carbonate-rich mudstones and relatively rare, localized, carbonate-rich diatomites. Chimneys are interpreted to form primarily as products of mixing between hydrothermal sublacustrine springs and lake waters during lake highstand intervals, while stromatolitic dusts are interpreted to form during lowstand lake levels. Our interpretation of mixing processes is supported by the delta O-18 composition of chimney caldte, which is representative of lake water and area hot spring endmembers. The observation of stromatolitic crusts with more positive values of delta(OB)-O-13 and delta O-18 than crystalline chimneys indicates that crusts formed during periods of high evaporation and low lake level. Crusts also contain Mg-silicate minerals, which are not present in crystalline chimneys, and further support the interpretation of lowstand depositional conditions. Although the age of chimney formation is not well constrained, evidence from seismic reflection data suggests a pattern of chimney formation during lake level rise and highstand times, followed by lake level fall, subaerial exposure and weathering that occurred at several times throughout the Late Pleistocene and Holocene.

Arrival patterns and movements of adult sockeye salmon in lake washington: Implications for management of an urban fishery	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												The Lake Washington watershed in Washington State has several discreet breeding populations of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka that return over the course of several months and remain in the lake for up to 6 months before spawning. Depending on the arrival timing and distribution of sockeye salmon in the lake, in-lake fisheries might disproportionately exploit one population or another and might select individuals from within populations having traits that covary with arrival timing (e.g., age, size, and sex). We applied disk tags to adult sockeye salmon as they entered the lake in 2003 and 2004 and tracked individual fish with ultrasonic transmitters. Recovery rates of disk-tagged fish declined over the course of both seasons and were lower in 2004 than in 2003, suggesting that prespawning mortality was occurring because of high water temperatures. Arrival timing did not vary consistently between populations and was at most weakly correlated with life history traits (older fish tended to arrive earlier). Ultrasonic transmitters revealed that individual sockeye salmon were distributed throughout the lake in the early summer but gradually congregated near the mouth of their natal stream in the fall. Fisheries are therefore likely to exploit the populations in proportion to their overall abundance without selecting strongly for spawning date or life history traits, tending to minimize evolutionary effects within populations. However, the expansion of a hatchery on the river with the largest population has been proposed; if fisheries increase to take advantage of the enhanced population, they may have a disproportionate effect on the smaller wild populations in other tributaries.																			0275-5947					AUG	2007	27	3					908	917		10.1577/M06-058.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M06-058.1													WOS:000249158900020

The predominance of bacteria participating in sulfur and nitrogen cycles and significant changes in the composition of microbial communities were noted at changing physicochemical conditions. Thiovirga sp. (sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, up to 37%) and Azonexus sp. (nitrogen-fixing bacteria, up to 43%) were dominant at high temperatures and concentrations of hydrogen sulfide in two hydrotherms. In addition, a significant contribution of the Rhodocyclaceae family (up to 51%) which is involved in the denitrification processes, and Acetoanaerobium sp. (up to 20%) fixing carbon oxide were found in the spring water. In the stream, mainly oxygenic cyanobacteria (up to 56%) developed at a temperature of 33 degrees C, in the presence of hydrogen sulfide and oxygen. In addition, sulfur bacteria of the genus Thiothrix (up to 48%) found in epibiotic communities of benthic animals of Lake Baikal were present here. Thiothrix sp. formed massive fouling in the zone of mixing lake and thermal waters with a significant contribution of hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria of the genus Hydrogenophaga (up to 22.5%). As well as chemolitho- and phototrophic bacteria, chemoorganotrophs (phyla Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, Desulfobacterota, Nitrospirota, Fibrobacterota, etc.) have been identified in all communities. The chemical parameters of water in spring and coastal zones indicate a significant change in the composition of thermal waters occurring with the participation of diverse microbial communities that contribute to the assimilation of inorganic components of mineral thermal waters.

At the present study, impact of seasonal changes on zooplankton biodiversity was conducted in the Ukkadam Lake (Lat 10 degrees 59' N and Long 76 degrees 57' E), at Coimbatore city, Tamil Nadu, India. Results: The biodiversity of zooplankton taxa were studied for a period from December 2011 to November 2012 on seasonal basis. During this time period, in total, 28 species of zooplankton were noticed, which includes 9 species of each Rotifera and Cladocera and 5 species of Copepoda and Ostracoda. In this present observation, total abundance of Rotifera was found to be predominant with 35%, followed by Cladocera 29%, Copepoda 29% and Ostracoda 7%. The population density of various group of zooplankton was observed, and it was found to be following order Rotifera > Copepoda > Cladocera > Ostracoda. The high and low population densities were recorded in summer and early monsoon season respectively. This higher zooplankton population density in summer might be due to the temperature acceleration in the Ukkadam Lake. Conclusions: The present study revealed that zooplankton productivity was found to be higher in the Ukkadam Lake when the temperature was increased in summer season. It indicates that the temperature has influence on the zooplankton diversity. Therefore, increased temperature due to global climate change might have influence on the zooplankton production. Assessment of zooplankton biodiversity will be useful to monitor the health (water quality) and wealth (fishery productivity) of this lake system in the near future.

J	Lewis, DB				Lewis, DB			Trade-offs between growth and survival: Responses of freshwater snails to predacious crayfish	ECOLOGY												Foraging organisms must often balance the conflicting demands of feeding and avoiding predators. I investigated whether the freshwater snail Amnicola limosa trades off obtaining food for reducing the risk of mortality from predatory crayfish (Orconectes). Field surveys and experiments were conducted to determine, first, whether snails altered habitat use when presented with predation risk, and second, whether this behavior had consequences for growth. Surveys of 20 northern Wisconsin lakes revealed that snail occupancy of food-poor macrophytes was positively related land occupancy of food-rich bottom sediments was negatively related) to crayfish abundance. Similarly, in a lake where crayfish (O. rusticus) are abundant, but differentially active among seasons, seasonal sampling indicated that snails occupied sand during the spring period of low crayfish activity but were absent from this habitat during summer. These distributional patterns derive from a combination of active habitat shifts and differential mortality among habitats, as indicated by laboratory experiments and field estimates of snail dispersal rates. Furthermore, aggregation of snails on macrophytes reduces snail growth. The average length of adult snails collected from bottom sediments was greater than the length of snails on macrophytes. Similarly, in the laboratory, snails that migrated up vertical surfaces in response to chemical alarm signals from feeding crayfish exhibited a growth depression. This trade-off of maximum growth rates for increased survival from crayfish by A. limosa likely poses constraints on snail fitness, which, in turn, can affect interactions with other predator species.

Application of eDNA methods to evaluate abundance and reproduction of winter-breeding freshwater mussels (Buldowskia iwakawai) in the Ishikari River floodplain	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Freshwater mussels (Order Unionoida) can provide crucial ecological functions and services. However, many of them are endangered worldwide due to local extirpation and reproductive failure, which emphasizes the importance of mussel life cycle monitoring, including reproduction. Buldowskia iwakawai (Suzuki, 1939) is one such species native to the Ishikari floodplain oxbow lakes where its reproductive failure was recently reported. In this study, a species-specific environmental DNA (eDNA) assay was developed to monitor B. iwakawai abundance and winter reproduction in the laboratory and natural environment simultaneously even at times when natural lakes are covered by ice. A positive CPUE-eDNA correlation was observed across all the 14 lakes sampled prior to ice cover formation. The eDNA concentration significantly differed between gravid and non-gravid mussels in relation to their metabolic-rate differences in laboratory experiments, but the eDNA concentration increase was not detected in the intensively monitored lakes during the glochidia release period. PCR inhibition in natural water has been suggested, and reducing its effects combined with appropriate seasonal contexts has the potential to improve the applicability of this method. This research sheds new light on the applicability of the eDNA assay for monitoring mussel reproductive activities throughout their life cycle including the winter season.

Mercury patterns in lakes within a natural hotspot in the Southern Volcanic Zone of the Andes (Nahuel Huapi National Park, Patagonia, South America)	ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY												Environmental context The pristine oligotrophic lakes of Andean Patagonia are influenced by volcanic eruptions and atmospheric deposition. This study focuses on mercury (Hg) dynamics in two connected lakes in a natural Hg hotspot of the southern Andes. The lake waters have low dissolved organic carbon and moderate to high Hg concentrations, resulting in high Hg availability. These promote Hg binding to natural particulates, thereby favouring its incorporation into food webs.Rationale Mercury hotspots have been identified in pristine volcanic areas of the northern Patagonian Andes (South America). In this study, we investigated spatial and seasonal patterns of total mercury (THg) in two oligotrophic lakes in Nahuel Huapi National Park (Argentina), adjacent to the Puyehue Cord & oacute;n Caulle volcanic complex (Chile). We hypothesise that THg levels in the lakes are linked to seasonal terrestrial inputs and that in-lake processes influence its distribution and availability.Methodology Water samples were collected seasonally in the connected lakes Pire (shallow) and Brazo Rinc & oacute;n branch of L. Nahuel Huapi (BR, deep). The concentration of THg was studied together with physicochemical variables, including the concentration and quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM). THg was measured by cold vapour atomic fluorescence spectrometry (CVAF) and DOM was characterised through absorbtion and fluorescence spectroscopy.Results Lakes showed moderate to high THg concentrations and remarkable Hg availability. THg increased downwards in the landscape and was associated with DOM terrestrial prints, indicating its co-transport from the catchment during high connectivity periods (from winter to early summer). In summer, THg levels were associated with higher mineralisation (higher dissolved inorganic carbon, DIC) and diffusion from sediments, especially in the shallow lake. THg availability and distribution were related to the quality of the DOM pool and the total suspended solids (TSS) year round. The high biotic contribution to TSS (higher chlorophyll-a:TSS) in BR indicated Hg binding to phytoplankton and incorporation into lake food webs.Discussion Pristine oligotrophic lakes influenced by natural Hg sources have a high potential for Hg accumulation in food webs because their typically high Hg and low DOC concentrations result in high Hg availability, promoting Hg binding to abiotic and biotic particles.

The concentration and characteristics of elements in these salt lakes resemble those found in geothermal water in northern Tibet, which highlights both as crucial sources of rare elements. This study presents comprehensive analyses of the hydrochemical composition and isotopes of B, strontium (Sr), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O) in typical salt lakes, along with samples from surrounding springs and rivers in the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone of northern Tibet. The results reveal an extremely negative and anomalous distribution pattern of B isotopes in Zabuye Salt Lake that is closely associated with geothermal water. The enrichment of these elements in other salt lakes in the region is attributed to concentration of evaporation and sediment adsorption. Given the very high elevation of the recharge for geothermal water, the infiltration of salt lakes obviously cannot feed geothermal springs. On the contrary, we correlate the unusual enrichment of Li and B and other resources in salt lakes to geothermal spring discharge. The ultimate origin of these elements lies in magmatic sources, with later water-rock interaction leading to significant enrichment of incompatible elements such as Li, rubidium (Rb), cesium (Cs), and B in the geothermal system. The geothermal springs directly or indirectly fed the salt lakes, and with further evaporation, they became super- scale brine deposits.

Here, we built the past ~500-year history of lake area and discharge of Lake Tuosu in the northeastern Qaidam Basin. We found that the lake area and inflow variations were sensitive to westerly-forced winter-spring precipitation and showed long-term decreasing trends after 1850. Enhanced local human activities (e.g., agricultural irrigation) led to further rapid shrinkage of Lake Tuosu during 1990-2000, and the lake size reached its minimum in the past ~ 500 years in approximately 2000. Our integrated moisture indices for mountains and basins in southern arid Central Asia showed opposing trends, and the humidity gradient from mountains to basins successively increased after 1850, which may be linked to the migration of the boreal westerlies, global warming, and human activities. After 1950, the humidity increased further, reaching its maximum value in approximately 2000, which likely resulted from the excessive utilization of water resources from anthropogenic activities. Therefore, the mountain-river-basin hydrological system in arid Central Asia has changed significantly, beyond the natural variation pattern, after CE 1950. Therefore, integrated management and rational utilization of water resources are important for ecological protection and sustainable development in the future.					; jiaju, zhao/ABZ-9580-2022; Li, Xiang-zhong/B-1576-2009	Zhao, Jiaju/0000-0003-1077-634X; li, xiang zhong/0000-0003-3491-8824; He, Yuxin/0000-0003-4916-2820; 													0341-8162	1872-6887				AUG	2022	215								106367	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106367	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106367		MAY 2022											WOS:000805029700002

In this study, we present a high-resolution palynological investigation from a 5 m core from the Ganchi peatland (southwest margin of the Sichuan Basin, southwest China) in order to reconstruct regional vegetation and climate over the last 25 kyrs. The succession, from bottom to top, comprises lake, wetland, and peat deposits, and wetland/aquatic pollen types are found to be a sensitive indicator of palaeoenvironmental change. Deciduous broad leaf forests dominated by Betula were present between 25-18 cal kyrs BP, suggesting a cold and dry climate during the Last Glacial Maximum. After 18 cal kyrs BP, temperature and summer insolation increased gradually, marking the Lateglacial transition. Thermophilous and hygrophilous species expanded between 11-8 cal kyrs BP, indicating a progressively warmer and wetter climate. From 8-4 cal kyrs BP, evergreen forests developed, while Tsuga reached its maxim abundance, implying a warm and humid climate coincided with the mid-Holocene climatic optimum. Results indicate that residual ice sheets may have impeded the northward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, resulting in peak Holocene warmth lagging behind peak summer insolation forcing. Vegetation change was primarily controlled by climate, with no obvious evidence of anthropogenic disturbance until the last 1 cal kyrs BP. Our study shows that vegetation and climate in the southwest margin of the Sichuan Basin were controlled by summer insolation and ice sheet dynamics, and also influenced by sea surface temperature in the Indian Ocean.

Fish were captured in the summer and fall, and sampled before or after a confinement of one hour. Metal concentrations in the kidneys and the interrenal tissues (homologous to mammalian adrenals) were measured to compare tissue-specific metal accumulation. An exposure-related decrease of condition factor, gonadosomatic index (GSI), branchial Na+/K+-ATPase activity, plasma thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (B), and 17beta-estradiol and an impaired capacity to enhance cortisol levels after confinement were observed. Fish from the metal-contaminated lakes possessed gonads at less mature stages and exhibited structural alterations of their gills, interrenal cells, and thyroid follicle epithelium. A comparison of the morphological, biochemical, and physiological endpoints measured in the present study revealed that plasma concentrations of hormones and parameters of gill function were the most affected by metal contamination. The results of this study indicate that lifelong exposures to sublethal concentrations of metals alter the physiological functions of fish and delay reproduction.

J	SCHUERGER, AC; HAMMER, W				SCHUERGER, AC; HAMMER, W			EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE ON DISEASE DEVELOPMENT OF TOMATO MOSAIC-VIRUS IN CAPSICUM-ANNUUM IN HYDROPONIC SYSTEMS	PLANT DISEASE												Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) induced severe root, stem, and foliar symptoms when pepper (Capsicum annuum cv. Hungarian Wax) plants were root inoculated in a recirculating hydroponic system during warm summer months. Plant height, root length, root dry weight, and shoot dry weight of root-inoculated peppers were all significantly less than noninoculated control plants. When plants were root inoculated in cooler winter months, plant symptoms were less severe, and only root lengths of inoculated plants were shorter than those of noninoculated control plants. The numbers of local lesions observed on Chenopodium amaranticolor leaves inoculated with nutrient solution or hydroponic filter-sludge samples increased between 28 and 35 days after peppers were root inoculated in a recirculating hydroponic system, regardless of season. The increase in the numbers of local lesions on C. amaranticolor coincided with the occurrence of root symptoms on root-inoculated peppers and is believed to indicate the release of viable ToMV inoculum from infected plant roots. In growth chamber experiments, the effects of temperature on root- or foliar-inoculated peppers were similar; the greatest: difference between inoculated and noninoculated plants occurred at 24 degrees C. Moderate or severe symptoms failed to develop on either root- or foliar-inoculated plants incubated at 18 degrees C but were observed on foliar-inoculated plants incubated at 32 degrees C. The severity of foliar systemic symptoms and the rate of disease development were greatest in foliar-inoculated pepper plants incubated at 24 degrees C.																			0191-2917					SEP	1995	79	9					880	885		10.1094/PD-79-0880	http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-79-0880													WOS:A1995RR69000003
J	Fonseca, R; Del Pozzo, ALM				Fonseca, Rita; Lillian Martin Del Pozzo, Ana			The ash-fall hazard from a Plinian eruption at Colima Volcano, Mexico	ANNALS OF GEOPHYSICS												The historical eruptive activity at Colima Volcano has been characterized by Strombolian and Merapi type eruptions and Vulcanian explosions associated with dome growth, which have ended in a Plinian eruption about every 100 years. The situation now prevailing at Colima Volcano is similar to that which preceded these explosive eruptions, when a dome fills the crater. This study proposes seven scenarios for the ash-fall from a Plinian eruption, based on historical eruptive activity, isopach thickness from the 1913 Plinian eruption, land use, socioeconomic data, and a 15-year statistical wind study realized with daily radiosonde data grouped according to four altitudinal levels: 4,000-9,000 (I); 9,000-14,000 (II); 14,000-17,000 (III) and 17,000-28,000 (IV) ma.s.l., based on common wind speeds and directions. We have integrated the wind distribution at level IV and estimated the ash dispersion for a Plinian eruption. From January to March, the main impact would be towards the northeast, in April and in October, towards the east, in May, towards the north-northeast or north-northwest, from June to August, towards the northwest, in September, towards the west, and in November and December, towards the west-southwest. The fallout would damage the coniferous forests of the Colima National Park, two lagoons and three lakes. More than 30 million people living in Guadalajara, Mexico City, Leon and Colima would suffer eye, respiratory and skin problems. The proximal areas, such as Ciudad Guzman, would be subject to roof collapsing and communication problems. The agricultural and livestock sectors would suffer severe financial losses. The Queseria sugar mill, the Atenquique paper mill, and the cement plants in Zapotiltic would halt work due to chimney obstruction and machinery abrasion. Four thermoelectric plants, twenty airports and four commercial ports would be affected if the eruption occurs in summer.

J	Jenkins, JM; Jackman, RE; Hunt, WG				Jenkins, JM; Jackman, RE; Hunt, WG			Survival and movements of immature Bald Eagles fledged in northern California	JOURNAL OF RAPTOR RESEARCH												We studied survival and movements of 13 radiotagged immature Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) fledged in 1989 and 1990 from nests at Lake Britton in northcentral California. Initial observations were consistent with a previously-described postfledgling northward migration into Canada and Alaska. First-year eagles returned to northern California between January and May of the following year and moved extensively in the general region of northcentral California. Of the two cohorts, 10 birds were located within a year of fledging for a minimum first-year survivorship of 76.9%. Seven eagles returned to our study area. Five of these birds returned briefly to their natal territories. Three of 10 returning birds were not observed again in our study area bur were recorded infrequently at distances of 50-190 km outside the study area. Two different movement patterns emerged within the 10 returning birds: five birds showed a high degree of affinity to the study area and five did not. In their second year of life, radiotagged immatures showed less affinity for our study area during late summer and fall. We could not determine if this disappearance indicated a regular or repeated migration, or merely an increased tendency to wander.																			0892-1016	2162-4569				JUN	1999	33	2					81	86																WOS:000081084300001

Paul			The composition of particulate phosphorus: A case study of the Grand River, Canada	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We examined the fractions of particulate phosphorus (PP) in the lower reaches of the Grand River, Canada, to test the hypothesis that the river is a source of both particulate-bound orthophosphate and labile species of PP. At the mouth of the Grand River, the proportion of particulate organic P (POP) was, on average, 57.7% of total PP, which was significantly higher than the proportion of particulate inorganic P (PIP) in PP. Analysis with P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy showed that the proportion of P species other than orthophosphate in the NaOH- EDTA extract was 1.75 times greater than that of orthophosphate. Labile P species (e.g. nucleotides and pyrophosphate) were present in the NMR spectrum; whereas, refractory organic P (myo-inositol hexakisphosphate) was absent. These results suggest that during winter and spring, the Grand River supplies primarily bioavailable phosphorus species in organic forms to Lake Erie, rather than inorganic orthophosphate. These results suggest that labile organic P is contained in PP rather than alkaline extractable inorganic P. Future studies should examine POP species in other rivers of the Lake Erie watershed.

Throughout this long history, technology has improved and the needs of users have evolved, so Great Lakes ice cover datasets have been upgraded several times in both spatial and temporal resolutions. In order to make those long-term data consistent and accessible, we reprocessed the Great Lakes ice cover database to generate daily gridded data (1.8 km resolution) using a re-project method with Nearest Neighbor Search for spatial interpolation, and linear interpolation with categorization for temporal interpolation.

In November 2014, brine in a conduit within the glacier was penetrated and sampled using clean-entry techniques and a thermoelectric melting probe called the IceMole. We analyzed the englacial brine sample for filterable iron (fFe), total Fe, major cations and anions, nutrients, organic carbon, and perchlorate. In addition, aliquots were analyzed for minor and trace elements and isotopes including D and O-18 of water, S-34 and O-18 of sulfate, U-234, U-238, B-11, Sr-87/Sr-86, and Br-81. These measurements were made in order to (1) determine the source and geochemical evolution of the brine and (2) compare the chemistry of the brine to that of nearby hypersaline lake waters and previous supraglacially sampled collections of Blood Falls outflow that were interpreted as end-member brines. The englacial brine had higher Cl- concentrations than the Blood Falls end-member outflow; however, other constituents were similar. The isotope data indicate that the water in the brine is derived from glacier melt. The H4SiO4 concentrations and U and Sr isotope suggest a high degree of chemical weathering products. The brine has a low N:P ratio of similar to 7.2 with most of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen in the form of NH4+. Dissolved organic carbon concentrations are similar to end-member outflow values. Our results provide strong evidence that the original source of solutes in the brine was ancient seawater, which has been modified with the addition of chemical weathering products.

Laboratory modeling of the structure of a thermal bar and related circulation in a basin with a sloping bottom	OCEANOLOGY												Development of a thermal bar in a laboratory flume with an inclined bottom (3.7 degrees-12 degrees) under the conditions of cooling/heating of the water with a temperature close to that of the maximal density is studied. The structure of the temperature field and currents during different stages of the circulation is examined: (i) formation of an along-slope gravity current, (ii) generation of a subsurface jet, and (iii) transformation of one type of the circulation into another at passing the temperature of the maximum density. The "fall" and "spring" types of the thermal bar are shown to be dynamically equivalent: the transport of the near-shore waters to the deepwater part, which is driven by the buoyancy flux rather than by the heat flux across the surface, transforms stage (i) into stage (ii), while the opposite (on-shore) flow is generated in the intermediate layers. A comparison of the results with the field and laboratory data published allows us to suggest that the propagation of the thermal bar front in the "fast" stage can be considered as the development of a convective jet with its velocity U similar to h(3/4), which is proportional to the growing thickness of the upper layer h affected by the heating/cooling processes					Demchenko, Natalia/L-3051-2016; Chubarenko, Irina/I-7423-2017	Chubarenko, Irina/0000-0003-3876-3022													0001-4370					JUN	2008	48	3					327	339		10.1134/S0001437008030041	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0001437008030041													WOS:000257382100004

In order to understand the seasonal variation of infection in a nutrient-enriched lake, parasitological investigation was carried out in the indigenous cyprinid fish, Schizothorax niger Heckel 1838 from September, 2008 to August, 2009. Overall, this study revealed definite seasonality of infection (p<0.05), with greater infection in summer (prevalence=39.5%) and lesser in winter (prevalence=8.1%). The prevalence among different seasons revealed significant differences (p<0.05). Sex was not an important factor influencing the prevalence of the Asian tapeworm. A strong positive correlation (Pearson's correlation, r=0.7; p=0.02) between total length of S. niger and number of Asian fish tapeworms was observed. Similarly, a strong positive correlation existed between weight of fish and number of tapeworms (Pearson's correlation, r=0.7; p=0.005). Prevalence and mean abundance were positively and significantly correlated with water temperature (r=0.8, p<0.01 and r=0.8, p<0.01, respectively). Thus seasonal dynamics, total length and weight of the host significantly influenced the tapeworm infection. The above findings will be useful in devising the appropriate control strategies for the Asian tapeworm in wild fish in Kashmir valley as well as in similar climatic zones of other parts of the world. Also, information from this study will be used to assess the spread and extent of B. acheilognathi which is a potential threat to the indigenous fish fauna of Anchar Lake.					zargar, ummer/AAT-2979-2021														0932-0113	1432-1955				JAN	2012	110	1					427	435		10.1007/s00436-011-2508-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-011-2508-z								21739312					WOS:000299521000051

These characteristics of wind-induced turbulent movement have been monitored from January 1992 through December 1996. The turbulence parameters were strongly correlated to wind energy inputs, calculated daily as 5 day cumulative inputs. There have been dramatic changes in the annual and seasonal development of phytoplankton, together with unusually high levels of primary production in this lake since 1994. We observed different patterns of vertical and horizontal turbulent movement and of TKE dissipation rates during the years when 'unusual' phytoplankton development occurred (1994-1996) compared to 'normal' years (1992, 1993). The first appearance of the filamentous cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon in this lake in August-September 1994 coincided with a period of markedly lower rates of TKE dispersion and a shift from vertical to horizontal dominance of the turbulent eddy spins. The absence of a regular winter-spring bloom of the dinoflagellate, Peridinium, in 1996 occurred when dissipation rates of TKE were extremely high, while record high amounts of dinoflagellates (1994, 1995) appeared when dissipation rates were very low. Correlations were shown between phytoplankton parameters (chlorophyll, primary production and the ratio of primary production to chlorophyll) and both the dissipation rate of TKE and the intensity of water turbulent mixing in the vertical plane. We suggest that the changes in the 'turbulence climate' of Lake Kinneret were an important factor in determining shifts in phytoplankton succession and the population composition of the algal assemblage.																			0142-7873					APR	1998	20	4					709	726		10.1093/plankt/20.4.709	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/20.4.709													WOS:000073780300007

Phosphorus speciation, burial and regeneration in coastal lagoon sediments of the Gippsland Lakes (Victoria, Australia)	ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY												Solid-phase phosphorus pools in the sediments of two shallow lakes (Wellington and Victoria) in the Gippsland Lakes coastal lagoon system of south-east Australia are discussed. Cores (20-cm depth) were taken in summer and winter in both lakes and a sequential extraction scheme (SEDEX) was used to profile the exchangeable P (P,x), iron oxide/hydroxide bound P (P-Fe), authigenic P (P-auth), detrital P (P-det) and organic P (P-org). Pore-water (P-pw) dissolved reactive phosphorus concentration profiles were also measured. The dominant forms of P were P-Fe (up to 53%) and P-org (35-55%), with the P-Fe fraction playing a key role in the short-term retention of P in the sediment. Benthic phosphorus fluxes at the sediment-water interface (mu mol m(-2) d(-1)) were determined from the sequential extraction data. The results were compared with flux measurements from the complementary approaches of benthic chamber experiments and Fickian diffusion calculations, to allow an insight into the nature and seasonal variations of the fluxes. The burial flux of phosphorus was also estimated from excess Pb-210 profiles in the sediment of the lakes. All of these data were used to produce a phosphorus budget for the Gippsland Lakes which suggested that the sediment represents a substantial source of phosphorus within the lakes and thus clearly highlights the importance of the sedimentary compartment in shallow eutrophic ecosystems. Minimum realistic timescales for complete labile phosphorus depletion from the sediment (assuming no resupply from the sediment-water interface) were calculated and ranged from 8 to 22 years.					; Kolev, Spas/L-5719-2016	Worsfold, Paul/0000-0002-2262-7723; McKelvie, Ian/0000-0003-1199-180X; 													1448-2517	1449-8979					2007	4	5					334	346		10.1071/EN07049	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/EN07049													WOS:000251600300006

The production operations affect the environment in the form of air pollution and wastewater emissions to lakes downstream from the factory. The toxic effects of the mining effluents on gills of perch (Perca fluviatilis) and roach (Rutilus rutilus) were studied. In lakes close to the factory, heavy metal concentrations in gills were not high, even though the metal content in sediment was elevated. In fish gills the relative proportion of phosphatidylcholine was elevated and cholesterol reduced, while the histological structure of the gills was changed. The number of mucus cells, as well as the sizes and the lengths of open areas in the chloride cells, had increased in spring and summer. The hypertrophy of chloride cells is possibly caused by the increased ambient concentrations of K+ and Li+. Changes in gill cholesterol and phospholipid proportions increase the fluidity of membranes and possibly strengthen their protective qualities, counterbalancing the adverse changes in chloride cell structure. The bioavailability and toxic effects of metals on fish are reduced by the hardness and high pH of water discharged by the mining plant. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

To understand fully observed annual changes, we need to monitor demographic rates to understand factors affecting global population size. Annual reproduction success contributes to dynamic changes in population size and age structure, so an assessment of the juvenile ratio (i.e. first winter birds as a proportion of total number aged) of overwintering waterbirds can be an important indicator of the reproductive success in the preceding breeding season. Methods During 2016-2019, we sampled juvenile ratios among 10 key waterbird species from the wetlands in the YRF. Based on these data, we here attempt to establish a simple, efficient, focused and reliable juvenile ratio monitoring scheme, to assess consistently and accurately relative annual breeding success and its contribution to the age structure among these waterbird species. Results We compared juvenile ratio data collected throughout the winter and found that the optimal time for undertaking these samples was in the early stages of arrival for migratory waterbirds reaching their wintering area (early to mid-December). We recommend counting consistently at key points (i.e. those where > 1% biogeographical flyway population were counted) at sites of major flyway importance (Poyang Lake, East Dongting Lake, Shengjin Lake, Caizi Lake, Longgan Lake and Chen Lake). Based on this, the error rate of the programme (155 planned points, the count of 10 waterbird species is 826-8955) is less than 5%. Conclusions We established a juvenile ratio monitoring programme for 10 key waterbird species in the wetlands of the YRF, and discuss the feasibility and necessity of implementing such a future programme, and how to use these data in our monitoring and understanding of the population dynamics of these waterbird populations.

CARBONATE LAKE DEPOSITS ASSOCIATED WITH DISTAL SILICICLASTIC PERENNIAL-RIVER SYSTEMS	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												The genesis of thick accumulations of carbonate lake deposits on the siliciclastic floodplains of perennial rivers situated below the regional spring line requires (1) a significant source for calcium in the watershed and (2) a protected area to accumulate calcite. The Phanerozoic record of fluvial deposits shows that anastomosing rivers with carbonate-rich provenance situated in distal areas below the spring line are the best environments for floodplain accumulation of significant carbonate lake deposits. Anastomosing rivers exist below the regional spring line and have isolated flood basins generally protected from bedload by high levees, receiving suspended and dissolved load during flooding events. Numerical modeling to test the rate of accumulation for these carbonate sediments was performed using stratigraphic data from the Pennsylvanian succession containing floodplain limestones of the Stewart Quadrangle of Athens County in Ohio (USA). Limestone volumes for six limestone units (Upper Pittsburgh, Fishpot, Sewickley, Benwood/Arnoldsburg, Uniontown, and Waynesburg limestones) were calculated with the assumption of overland input of dissolved calcite from carbonate source areas. In comparing the calcium input rate to the amount of calcium calculated from limestone unit volumes, overland transport of calcium ions, not spring input, can supply sufficient ions to accumulate thick carbonates over the short lifetime of floodplain lakes within anastomosing river systems.						/0000-0002-9787-1675													1527-1404	1938-3681				NOV-DEC	2013	83	11-12					1114	1129		10.2110/jsr.2013.81	http://dx.doi.org/10.2110/jsr.2013.81													WOS:000332501200015

Furthermore, Si research in estuaries has mainly been focused on subtidal benthic sediments and uptake and recycling by diatom communities. The biogeochemical cycling of Si in tidal wetlands, which can contain large amounts of Si, has thus far been neglected. We have conducted several whole ecosystem Si mass-balances on a freshwater marsh located in the Schelde estuary (6 tidal cycles, 2 with BSi included). Our measurements show that the freshwater marsh acts as an important source of dissolved Si to the main river (1-18% more export than import, on average 0.114 g m(-2)). This export is compensated by import of amorphous silica into the marsh (19-55% more import than export). The marsh was shown to act as silica recycler, resupplying biologically available dissolved Si to the estuarine ecosystem. Extrapolations show that during summer and spring months, when dissolved silica is depleted due to diatom growth, almost half of the total dissolved silica load in the main river channel could result from marsh recycling.

CCA results explained about 91% of correlation between species and environmental variables. The Pseudorichness Ratio of the lake was very low (Pr=0.25), indicating dominancy of cosmopolitan species over noncosmopolitans. To investigate the relationship between ostracod occurrence patterns, community assemblage, and abiotic factors, we sampled five sites on lake Karamurat (Bolu, Turkey) and two nearby rheocrene springs. Thirteen ostracod taxa (10 from the lake, three from the springs) were collected. Species exhibited clear habitat preferences, and lake and spring ostracods showed clear differences in their monthly and seasonal occurrences. Darwinula stevensoni and Cypria ophtalmica were the dominant species for the lake and Psychrodromus cf. fontinalis and P. olivaceus were only reported from the springs. Ostracod Watch Model illustrated that a rare species, Notodromas monacha, was only found in May to August from the lake while two species (D. stevensoni, C. ophtalmica) were encountered from all year around. Common species also exhibited relatively high levels of ecological tolerances to multiple environmental variables. Canonical correspondence analyses explained about 91% of correlation between species and environmental variables and indicated that four variables (water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH and electrical conductivity) most strongly influenced species occurrences. Also, binary data of sample medians showed significant (P < 0.01) differences between ostracod assemblages from 13 lakes and reservoirs compared to Lake Karamurat. A significant correlation was detected between Lake Karamurat and two other lakes (Abant and Yenicaga) located in the same region. The Pseudorichness Ratio (noncosmopolitan/cosmopolitan species) of the lake was very low (Pr = 0.25), indicating dominancy of cosmopolitan species over noncosmopolitans. Conservation efforts should be considered to addressed increasing anthropogenic impacts to Lake Karamurat.

J	Jones, R; Kelso, D; Schaeffer, E				Jones, R. Christian; Kelso, Donald P.; Schaeffer, Elaine			Spatial and seasonal patterns in water quality in an embayment-mainstem reach of the tidal freshwater Potomac River, USA: a multiyear study	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Spatial and temporal patterns in water quality were studied for seven years within an embayment-river mainstem area of the tidal freshwater Potomac River. The purpose of this paper is to determine the important components of spatial and temporal variation in water quality in this study area to facilitate an understanding of management impacts and allow the most effective use of future monitoring resources. The study area received treated sewage effluent and freshwater inflow from direct tributary inputs into the shallow embayment as well as upriver sources in the mainstem. Depth variations were determined to be detectable, but minimal due mainly to the influence of tidal mixing. Results of principal component analysis of two independent water quality datasets revealed clear spatial and seasonal patterns. Interannual variation was generally minimal despite substantial variations in tributary and mainstem discharge among years. Since both spatial and seasonal components were important, data were segmented by season to best determine the spatial pattern. A clear difference was found between a set of stations located within one embayment (Gunston Cove) and a second set in the nearby Potomac mainstem. Parameters most highly correlated with differences were those typically associated with higher densities of phytoplankton: chlorophyll a, photosynthetic rate, pH, dissolved oxygen, BOD, total phosphorus and Secchi depth. These differences and their consistency indicated two distinct water masses: one in the cove harboring higher algal density and activity and a second in the river with lower phytoplankton activity. A second embayment not receiving sewage effluent generally had an intermediate position. While this was the most consistent spatial pattern, there were two others of a secondary nature. Stations closer to the effluent inputs in the embayment sometimes grouped separately due to elevated ammonia and chloride. Stations closer to tributary inflows into the embayment sometimes grouped separately due to dilution with freshwater runoff. Segmenting the datasets by spatial region resulted in a clarification of seasonal patterns with similar factors relating to algal activity being the major correlates of the seasonal pattern. A basic seasonal pattern of lower scores in the spring increasing steadily to a peak in July and August followed by a steady decline through the fall was observed in the cove. In the river, the pattern of increases tended to be delayed slightly in the spring. Results indicate that the study area can be effectively monitored with fewer study sites provided that at least one is located in each of the spatial regions.																			0167-6369					DEC	2008	147	1-3					351	375		10.1007/s10661-007-0126-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-007-0126-0								18214699					WOS:000260766600034
J	Sanger, D; Kelley, AR; Berry, HN				Sanger, D; Kelley, AR; Berry, HN			Geoarchaeology at Gilman Falls: An archaic quarry and manufacturing site in central Maine, USA	GEOARCHAEOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL												Interdisciplinary investigations at the Milford Reservoir, central Maine, resulted in excavation and analysis of a Middle Archaic quarry and manufacturing site at Gilman Falls, dated to between 7300 and 6300 yr B.P. Lithological analysis indicates that the majority of the artifacts came from very local outcrops, providing low-grade metamorphic rocks. Native Americans used a specialized technique to reduce the granofels and other rocks to long rods, artifacts commonly placed in local cemeteries. The Gilman Falls site was largely abandoned once these artifacts were no longer in vogue. Therefore, access to particular bedrock outcrops seems to have played an important role in site selection. Gilman Falls and other early to middle Holocene sites are preserved where bedrock sill dams ponded water that deposited fine sand. Early site sedimentation history is paralleled by a drainage change in the headwaters of the Penobscot River. Evidence for lower mid-Holocene lake levels and a period of higher temperatures and lower precipitation may correlate with the sedimentation history. (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

J	VANZOEST, R; VANECK, GTM				VANZOEST, R; VANECK, GTM			OCCURRENCE AND BEHAVIOR OF SEVERAL GROUPS OF ORGANIC MICROPOLLUTANTS IN THE SCHELDT ESTUARY	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Between May 1986 and January 1989, samples were taken on three occasions from the heavily polluted Scheldt esturary, in order to determine the pathways and fate of organic micropollutants. One group parameter (cholinesterase inhibition activity, CHOL) and 30 individual compounds (including chlorobenzenes, chloronitrobenzenes, volatile halocarbons and pesticides) were detected on at least one occasion. Another 10 organic pollutants were identified and quantified by GC/MS analysis. Many other, as yet unidentified, compounds were also present. The River Scheldt appeared to be the major source for most pollutants, although pollutants, although additional emissions along the estuary were also detected. Most pollutants were removed from the water during estuarine mixing (non-conservative behaviour), probably due to various processes, such as volatilization, degradation and photolysis. The fractional loss for most volatile halocarbons was approximately 75%, but in some cases 100% (e.g., trichloromethane). The fractional loss for CHOL was seasonally dependent: 5-10% in winter, and 35-40% in summer months. For most compounds, reasonable agreement was found when observed sediment-water partition coefficients (K(oc)) were compared with predicted values. Pronounced deviations were observed, however, indicating non-equilibrium conditions, probably because of slow sorption kinetics. The concentrations measured in the inflowing freshwater were compared with recently published ecotoxicological freshwater quality objectives. The results show that some organic pollutants (e.g., hexachlorobenzene, CHOL, lindane, 1,1,1-trichloroethane) exceeded the published ecotoxicological risk values in all samples, suggesting that these pollutants may have an impact on the ecosystem of the Scheldt estuary.																			0048-9697					APR 1	1991	103	1					57	71		10.1016/0048-9697(91)90353-G	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0048-9697(91)90353-G													WOS:A1991FH91400006

Sulphate and NO3- in ambient precipitation received on four replicate plots were augmented with additions of dilute (0.02 N) H2SO4 and HNO3, applied atone and in combination periodically during the growing seasons of 1993 and 1994. The equivalent load of SO42- applied in the present experiment was ca. 6 times that in ambient precipitation in the H2SO4-only treatment and half that in the combined treatment over the study period. In situ soil respiration measured during the summer and fall of 1994 showed no adverse effects of acid treatment. In the laboratory, soil microbial respiration, biomass (as determined by substrate-induced respiration), and microbial biomass carbon : organic carbon (C-mic/C-org) ratios were significantly depressed in the L or FH layers of the forest floor when H2SO4 was applied alone or in combination with HNO3. No effects of HNO3 were detected when applied alone. Microbial respiration, substrate-induced respiration, and C-mic/C-org ratios were significantly correlated with forest floor pH. Microbial metabolic quotients (respiration:biomass ratios) were not adversely affected by any of the treatments. The observed deleterious effects of H2SO4 application under experimental conditions suggest the possibility of adverse effects in the field over the long-term.																			0045-5067					AUG	1996	26	8					1446	1453		10.1139/x26-161	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x26-161													WOS:A1996VF70100015

Impact assessment of effluents from fish ponds on water quality of the discharge site in the stream Strumyk Goleniowski in Zachodniopomorskie Province, north-western Poland	INDIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES												Fish farming may have a negative impact on the environment through discharge of water containing organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus. The paper presents the impact of effluents from the Fish Breeding and Stocking Centre (FBSC), located in Goleniowski, Zachodniopomorskie Province in north-western Poland on water quality of the discharge area in the stream Strumyk Goleniowski. FBSC uses rational methods of fish keeping and breeding. The water quality parameters of the input and output water of the centre was monitored. We identified multi-directional processes which shaped the water quality in the study sites with the main factors influencing the water quality being, temperature, alkalinity, total hardness, nutrients, ammonium nitrogen (NH3-N), total reactive phosphorus and total phosphorus. During summer season, decomposition of organic matter decreased oxygen concentration in water and during winter source of DO was diffusion. Increase in concentration of organic matter in outflow from FBSC resulted from culture as well as from primary production. Increase in concentration of NH3-N and phosphorus in outflow water resulted from released metabolites by live fish and from feed decomposition. Ammonification and nitrification influenced seasonal changes in nonorganic nitrogen forms. NH4+-N and nitrate nitrogen were substantial source of nitrogen for autotrophs. The hydro-chemical conditions in the water of the FBSC should be regarded as optimum for fish that are sensitive to pollution and it did not deteriorate the quality of the outflow water.

Widespread and accelerating glacier retreat on the Lyngen Peninsula, northern Norway, since their 'Little Ice Age' maximum	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												The recession of mountain glaciers worldwide is increasing global sea level and, in many regions, human activities will have to adapt to changes in surface hydrology. Thus, it is important to provide up-to-date analyses of glacier change and the factors modulating their response to climate warming. Here we report changes in the extent of >120 glaciers on the Lyngen Peninsula, northern Norway, where glacier runoff is utilised for hydropower and where glacial lake outburst floods have occurred. Glaciers covered at least 114 km(2) in 1953 and we compare this inventory with those from 1988, 2001 and a new one from 2014, and previously-dated Little Ice Age (LIA) limits. Results show a steady reduction in area (similar to 0.3% a(-1)) between their LIA maximum (similar to 1915) and 1988, consistent with increasing summer air temperatures, but recession paused between 1988 and 2001, coinciding with increased winter precipitation. Air temperatures increased 0.5 degrees C per decade from the 1990s and the rate of recession accelerated to similar to 1% a(-1) between 2001 and 2014 when glacier area totalled similar to 95.7 km(2). Small glaciers (<0.05 km(2)) with low maximum elevations (<1400 m) experienced the largest percentage losses and, if warming continues, several glaciers may disappear within the next two decades.

Temperature and oxygen in Missouri reservoirs	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Vertical profiles of water temperature (n = 7193) and dissolved oxygen (n = 6516) were collected from 235 Missouri reservoirs during 1989-2007; most data were collected during May-August and provide a regional summary of summer conditions. Collectively, surface water temperature ranged from a mean of 22 C in May to 28 C in July, and individual summer maxima typically were 28-32 C. Most (95%) reservoirs stably stratify by mid-May, but few are deep enough to have hypolimnia with near-uniform temperatures. Among stratified reservoirs, maximum effective length and maximum depth accounted for 75% of the variation in mixed depth and thermocline depth. Ephemeral, near-surface thermoclines occurred in 39% of summer profiles and were most frequent in small, turbid reservoirs. Isotherms below the mixed layer deepen during stratification, and the water column is 20 C by August in all but the deepest reservoirs. Most reservoirs showed incipient dissolved oxygen (DO) depletion by mid-May, and by August, 80% of profiles had DO minima of 1 mg/L. Surface area and chlorophyll (Chl) explained 37% of variation in the earliest date of anoxia, and Chl explained 50% of variation in DO below the mixed layer during summer. Warm summer temperatures and widespread low DO often limit available fish habitat in Missouri reservoirs and compress warm-water fish communities into subsurface layers that exceed their thermal preferences. This study provides a regional baseline of reservoir temperature and oxygen conditions useful for future evaluations of eutrophication and the effects of a warming climate.					; Jones, John/AFL-3145-2022	Graham, Jennifer L./0000-0002-6420-9335; 													1040-2381	2151-5530					2011	27	2					173	182	PII 938726920	10.1080/07438141.2011.583713	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438141.2011.583713													WOS:000291853900007
J	Lin, ZD; Yang, Q				Lin, Zhongda; Yang, Qin			Three leading coupled modes of summer rainfall with atmospheric circulations over northern East Asia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Northern East Asia (NEA) is characterized by wet monsoon region in the east and mid-latitude westerly-controlled dry inland in the west in summer, where ecosystem and environment are vulnerable to rainfall variability. Previous studies found close relationship between summer rainfall in NEA and local large-scale atmospheric circulation systems including East Asian upper-tropospheric westerly jet (EAJ) and middle-tropospheric trough (EAT), and lower-tropospheric low over NEA (NEAL). However, major features of rainfall-circulation coupling over NEA are still not fully understood. This study addresses this issue using multivariate empirical orthogonal functions method based on the ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset and the GPCP precipitation data for 1979-2018. Three leading coupled modes are identified, together accounting for 30-50% of summer rainfall year-to-year variance in most of NEA. The first mode features consistent decrease of rainfall in NEA related to the decelerated EAJ, southward shifted EAT, and weakened NEAL, with a significant interdecadal change in late 1990s. The second mode exhibits a meridional dipole rainfall pattern, with less rainfall along the East Asian subtropical rainy belt and more rainfall in southern Russian Far East, coupled with the northward shifted EAJ, weakened EAT, and intensified NEAL. The third mode presents a zonal dipole rainfall pattern, with suppressed rainfall in southern Russia east of northeast China and enhanced rainfall around the Lake Baikal related to the decelerated EAJ, and westward shifted EAT and NEAL. Further investigation shows that the first mode is remotely modulated by summer rainfall anomalies in the Sahel region and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) on the interdecadal timescales, and by the Polar/Eurasia teleconnection on the interannual timescales. The second and third modes are, respectively, modulated by summer rainfall in the western North Pacific and north central-eastern India through the East Asia-Pacific and circumglobal teleconnection patterns.						lin, zhongda/0000-0002-1126-1121													0899-8418	1097-0088				SEP	2022	42	11					5916	5934		10.1002/joc.7568	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.7568		MAR 2022											WOS:000765011900001

Water column abundances and sedimentation losses to those dinoflagellates were followed throughout 1994 and 1995. The objective was to quantify, the variables that describe population dynamics, that in turn will shed more light on the seasonal patterns of bloom dynamics. Sedimentation losses were measured by means of sediment traps with and without a preservative (formaldehyde) that were exposed for 24 h once every 2-3 weeks. Annual sedimentation losses of Peridinium (hypolimnetic trap catches) were 209 g wet wt m(-2) year(-1) in 1994 and 187 g wet wt m(-2) year(-1) in 1995, which constituted 16 and 23% of Peridinium production in those years, respectively. This study revealed that increased death rates preceded a mass sedimentation flux of Peridinium and caused the decline of the bloom in Lake Kinneret. Annual sedimentation losses of Peridiniopsis were 55 g wet wt m(-2) year(-1) in 1994 and 34 g wet wt m(-2) year(-1) in 1995. In contrast to live Peridinium cells, Peridiniopsis cells continued to swim to the lower trap after the onset of thermal stratification, possibly taking advantage of the higher nutrient concentrations below the thermocline, at a time when the lake is already stratified and the epilimnion is nutrient depleted. This could be an important factor allowing Peridiniopsis spp. to peak after the decline of Peridinium.																			0142-7873					JUN	2003	25	6					591	602		10.1093/plankt/25.6.591	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/25.6.591													WOS:000183553300002

They harvest light energy using bacteriochlorophyll a-containing reaction centers to supplement their predominantly heterotrophic metabolism. We used epifluorescence microscopy, HPLC, and infrared fluorometry to examine the dynamics of AAP bacteria in the mesotrophic lake Vlkov during the seasonal cycle. The mortality of AAP bacteria was estimated from diel changes of bacteriochlorophyll a fluorescence. The AAP abundance correlated with water temperature and DOC concentration. Its maximum was registered during late summer, when AAP bacteria made up 20% of total bacteria. The novel element of this study is the seasonal measurements of AAP mortality rates. The rates ranged between 1.15 and 4.56 per day with the maxima registered in early summer coinciding with the peak of primary production, which documents that AAP bacteria are a highly active component of freshwater microbial loop.

The study was carried out in summer 1993, the last year of the 5 year mass removal of coarse fish in L. Vesijarvi in southern Finland. Additionally, the habitat shifts by the roach were explored based on the differences in the density estimates given by cohort analysis and echosounding. The estimates on the density of the stock in the beginning of the fishing season given by cohort analysis (1276-1423 fish ha(-1), depending on the natural mortality rate) and the depletion method (1235-1383 fish ha(-1)) were in agreement. The echosounding estimates in the early summer (500 fish ha(-1)) were much lower than those given by cohort analysis, whereas in the late summer echosounding gave higher estimates than cohort analysis. The differences were due to the habitat shifts by the roach. The differences in the stock estimates given by the different assessment methods can be used especially in studying the timing of the migrations.																			0165-7836	1872-6763				SEP	1996	28	2					151	161		10.1016/0165-7836(96)00499-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0165-7836(96)00499-7													WOS:A1996VG72800003

The cherts originated as sinters deposited by hot-spring activity. Chert comprises 4.20 m of the cored succession, with the thickest bed, representing a single silicification event, being 0.31 m thick and the thickest composite chert (comprising six beds) 0.76 m thick. Average chert bed thickness is 80 mm. Forty-five plant-bearing chert beds are interbedded with sandstones, mudstones and shales. The sediments were deposited on an alluvial plain with local lakes, the area being periodically affected by hot-spring activity. Plants initially colonized both subaerial sand and sinter surfaces. Rhynia gwynne-vaughanii and Horneophyton lignieri commonly form the basal parts of the profiles with subsequent colonization by other genera. Rhynia is commonly found in life position above originally sandy substrates, and Horneophyton above sinter surfaces. The composition of the Rhynie vegetation is compared with coeval assemblages and, on the basis of current knowledge, it is concluded that there is no unequivocal evidence that the plants were adapted to life in the stressed environments in the immediate vicinity of hot springs.

One of them is Pallaseopsis quadrispinosa which inhabits deep, oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes. The deepest lake in Poland (area 3.11 km(2), max. depth 108.5 m) and on the entire Central European Plain is Lake Hancza, an alpha-mesotrophic lake of unique character. A study of P. quadrispinosa in this lake was carried out between April-October in 2000. Samples were collected at ten sites, to a depth of 16 m, using a tow net. In April, this amphipod crustacean was observed at depths of between 1-12 m with maximal density at 4-6 m (800 individuals per 100 m(2)). In May and July/August, the density was reduced and this organism was found mainly between 6-12 m. In October, P. quadrispinosa was distributed between 1-6 m, with a maximal density of 1400 individuals per 100 m(2) at 2-4 m. Seasonal changes in density at various depths and the spatial heterogeneity of the occurrence of this amphipod indicate migration, probably related to changes in the water temperature and the reproductive cycle. Breeding of P. quadrispinosa was observed throughout the study period, with reproductive peaks in the early spring and autumn. The average number of eggs carried by ovigerous females ranged from 12 to 64, and was significantly correlated with the size of the individual. Newborn juveniles were spatially isolated from the adults as they tended to accumulate at the shallower bottom depth. The sampled material revealed the presence of two subpopulations of P. quadrispinosa. Environmental conditions, especially the consistently high level of dissolved oxygen, reproduction, apparently long life-span and occurrence in all parts of the lake indicate that the P. quadrispinosa population in Lake Hancza is stable and in good condition.																			1505-2249						2009	57	4					729	740																WOS:000273093000010

The limnological character of bog pools in relation to meteorological and hydrological features	MIRES AND PEAT												As part of a major limnological characterisation of Rancho Hambre mire complex (Tierra del Fuego), five water bodies (bog pools) were sampled between October 2008 and April 2010 and their physico-chemical features studied in relation to meteorological, hydrological and morphometric variables. The meteorological data recorded mostly fitted within the ranges of historical records. The influence of water body size was evidenced by the higher thermic stability of the largest pool as compared to the smallest, which reflected changes in air temperature. Water levels in the pools varied according to their superficial connectivity: deep water bodies with surface inflow and/or outflow channels had the most stable water levels; but the deepest water body, which was hydrologically isolated, had the most variable water level. In an ordination of samples resulting from a Principal Component Analysis of limnological data, the first axis reflected the minero/ombrotrophic status of water bodies, while the second represented a temporal gradient separating spring (post-thawing) samples from summer samples. Inter-annual variations in weather also influenced the limnological properties of the water bodies. Our results enable us to propose an interpretative model for the limnological characterisation of the pools, which will be a valuable tool for understanding the structure and fluctuations of the planktonic communities inhabiting these systems.

Hence it is classified as primarily a seasonal breeder with some of the flexibility of an opportunistic breeder. We present evidence of an extension of the 1991-92 breeding season to at least 10 months, from mid-October or earlier, to late July. In May 62.5% of females were pregnant or lactating whereas 25-44% were pregnant or lactating at different sites in July. Our data from sand-mined dunes extend from Bridge Hill Ridge at the northern end of the Myall Lakes National Park to Tomago near the mouth of the Hunter River, We collate data from studies over the last 20 years, documenting extended breeding in 8 different years, 6 from one region, and at least 4 from another. Twenty years of rainfall data from nearby weather stations in the two regions show extended breeding to be a response to climate, when rainfall between September and March exceeds a threshold value of 750-800 mm (approximately 120% of the long-term average), with at least 420-480 mm falling during the first three months of the year (approximately 130% of the long-term average). While rainfall appears to be the ultimate factor, we support Kemper's hypothesis that the proximal factor is most likely to be the abundance or quality of food produced by above-average late summer rainfall.

J	GRENFELL, TC				GRENFELL, TC			SURFACE-BASED PASSIVE MICROWAVE STUDIES OF MULTIYEAR SEA ICE	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Multifrequency passive microwave observations are reported from surface based field experiments carried out over multiyear sea ice in the eastern Arctic Basin, the Beaufort Sea, the Canadian archipelago and the northern Greenland Sea. Dual polarized brightness temperatures at 6.7, 10, 18.7, 37, and 90 GHz were obtained at selected multiyear ice sites covering a wide range of surface properties. Considerable variation was found in the observed spectra over short distances on individual floes under winter conditions where values of [e(V)(37 GHz) - e(V)(18 GHz)]/[e(V)(37 GHz) + e(V)(18 GHz)] ranged from nearly zero to approximately -0.08. Concurrent surface characterization observations consisting of temperature, density, salinity, and grain size profiles in the snow and the upper meter of the ice were carried out frequently in conjunction with Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory personnel. The present analysis shows that the magnitude of the spectral gradient of emissivity is directly related to the existence and thickness of a decomposed surface ice layer with very high porosity. Spectra for melt ponds with a frozen surface layer closely resembled those of lake ice and show a positive spectral gradient. As soon as the ponds were completely frozen, their spectra became nearly the same as those for first-year ice. Fine-grained winter snow produced a mild decrease in the emissivities at 90 GHz with increasing snow thickness from 0 to 0.2 m at which point the snow appears to be optically thick. During the melt season the ice emissivities e(nu) depend most strongly on whether the surface layers are experiencing temporary freezing or not. Under melting conditions, e(nu) depends on the liquid water content only over a very small range (e.g., 0-5% by mass at 90 GHz). If the liquid water in the surface layers is freezing, which can occur at intervals throughout the melt season, the spectral gradient is negative with a slope which depends on the thickness of the refrozen layer. The variance among emissivity spectra for multiyear ice appears to be influenced primarily by the distribution of melt ponds and by the presence of significant amounts of scattering inhomogeneities greater than 1 mm in diameter in the snow and in the upper 20-30 cm of the ice. We expect the signatures of multiyear ice to be regionally dependent, perhaps yielding environmental information about the Arctic ice pack.																			2169-9275	2169-9291				MAR 15	1992	97	C3					3485	3501		10.1029/91JC02651	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/91JC02651													WOS:A1992HJ48800002
J	Tahsin, S; Chang, NB				Tahsin, Subrina; Chang, Ni-Bin			Fast eutrophication assessment for stormwater wet detention ponds via fuzzy probit regression analysis under uncertainty	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Stormwater wet detention ponds have been a commonly employed best management practice for stormwater management throughout the world for many years. In the past, the trophic state index values have been used to evaluate seasonal changes in water quality and rank lakes within a region or between several regions; yet, to date, there is no similar index for stormwater wet detention ponds. This study aimed to develop a new multivariate trophic state index (MTSI) suitable for conducting a rapid eutrophication assessment of stormwater wet detention ponds under uncertainty with respect to three typical physical and chemical properties. Six stormwater wet detention ponds in Florida were selected for demonstration of the new MTSI with respect to total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and Secchi disk depth (SDD) as cognitive assessment metrics to sense eutrophication potential collectively and inform the environmental impact holistically. Due to the involvement of multiple endogenous variables (i.e., TN, TP, and SDD) for the eutrophication assessment simultaneously under uncertainty, fuzzy synthetic evaluation was applied to first standardize and synchronize the sources of uncertainty in the decision analysis. The ordered probit regression model was then formulated for assessment based on the concept of MTSI with the inputs from the fuzzy synthetic evaluation. It is indicative that the severe eutrophication condition is present during fall, which might be due to frequent heavy summer storm events contributing to high-nutrient inputs in these six ponds.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				FEB	2016	188	2							77	10.1007/s10661-015-5073-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-015-5073-6								26733470					WOS:000369430100002

We used multilocus microsatellite genotypes and likelihood and Bayesian-based analyses to characterize the degree of genetic differentiation and evidence of introgression among stream resident brook trout above a natural barrier, and putative stream residents and adfluvial (coaster) brook trout from below the barrier in the Salmon Trout River (STR); the sole tributary along the southern shore of Lake Superior known to be inhabited by a viable remnant population of coaster brook trout. Two genetically differentiated populations were identified, generally associated with individuals inhabiting sections of the SIR above and below the falls. No evidence of differentiation was found between a priori classified resident and coaster brook trout from below the falls. Gene flow from individuals above the falls was detected based on evidence of interbreeding between upper river individuals and coasters below the falls. We collected only a relatively small number of individuals that we a priori classified as being stream residents below the falls, and these individuals had a high probability of having ancestry originating from the population above the barrier, which suggests that the stream-resident life history may be exceptionally rare or absent in the lower Salmon Trout River.

However, the long-term history of terrestrial C-4 ecosystem expansion in East Asia remains poorly documented, and its links to tectonic and/or climate changes remain unclear due to the complexity of its forcing factors. Here, we reconstruct the long-term evolution of terrestrial C-3-C-4 plants biomass in South China since the late Eocene using continuous records of the stable carbon isotopic compositions (delta C-13) of black carbon extracted from sediments at International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Site U1501 in the northern South China Sea (SCS). This study reveals remarkable stepwise expansions of C4 plants in South China at similar to 20 Ma and 15 Ma with a gradual expansion trend at 7-4 Ma. We demonstrate that stepwise drying (long-term weakening of the East Asian summer monsoon and simultaneous strengthening of the East Asian winter monsoon), as well as the enhanced seasonality of precipitation, is responsible for the ecological evolution in South China since the early Miocene. Our black carbon records, combined with previous studies, indicate a coupled evolution of East Asian drying, vegetation shifts and global cooling. We suggest that the major Asian topography framework was established before the middle Miocene, and global cooling overwhelmed tectonic controls of the long-term evolution of the East Asian monsoon thereafter. This study highlights that both Tibetan uplift and global cooling have played a significant role in the long-term evolution of regional climate and vegetation.

Distinguishing Aroclor and non-Aroclor sources to Chicago Air	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Many polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners are found in both legacy Aroclor mixtures and modern materials, and both contribute to PCBs levels in ambient air. The various sources of PCBs make it difficult to quantify the relative importance of emissions from remaining legacy materials and emissions of PCBs released from production and use of modern products. To address this challenge, we utilized active and passive sampling, analytical methods optimized for PCBs, and Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) and cos theta to examine the chemical signature of PCBs in Chicago air. Here we report our findings for over 640 samples collected over 7 years and analyzed for all 209 congeners. We conclude that Aroclor sources (1254, 1016/1242, and 1260) are consistent and dominant contributors to Chicago air. However, non-Aroclors sources accounted for 13%-16% of the total PCBs measured. Our analysis indicates nonAroclor sources explain 99% of PCB11, 90% of PCB 68, and 58-69% of congeners with 8 to 10 chlorines in Chicago air. All of these are known to be emitted from paints or silicone polymers. Additionally, we identified over 20 congeners that have non-Aroclor contributions of more than 50% including PCB 3 (4-monochlorobiphenyl, 83% nonAroclor) as well as 7 congeners of unknown sources: PCBs 43, 46, 55, 89, 96, 137, and 139 + 140. Non-Aroclor emission sources contribute to the entire range of congeners from mono- to deca-chlorobiphenyls. We found evidence of highly localized non-Aroclor sources including a signature similar to that of green paint. We also found source signals similar to the PCB congeners volatilizing from and absorbing to neighboring Lake Michigan. The measured profiles vary from season to season: lower chlorinated congeners dominate in winter months while higher chlorinated congeners contribute more in summer.

Empirical test of the ClimateWNA model for local accuracy in the Kluane Lake area of the southern Yukon, Canada	CLIMATE RESEARCH												Ecological studies related to climate typically require data on temperature and rainfall. If local climate data are not available, the only recourse is to rely on data from the closest meteorological station or interpolated data from regional models of climate. In the southwestern Yukon, we have for the past 25 yr gathered ecological information such as counts of cones on white spruce trees and attempted to relate these biological variables to weather variables, thus requiring accurate climate information. From 2001 to 2014, we measured local summer temperature and rainfall during the growing season at 7 local sites along 250 km of the Alaska Highway and tested the accuracy of the ClimateWNA model estimates for these 7 sites as well as for the Haines Junction Environment Canada meteorological station. Monthly summer temperatures were reasonably well correlated with the predicted ClimateWNA values (r = 0.90, n = 299 mo), but summer rainfall was not (r = 0.37, n = 218 mo). We repeated this analysis with the Daymet climate model and got similar results. We caution the use of ClimateWNA or Daymet rainfall estimates for local areas in this part of the southwestern Yukon for the prediction of ecological measurements.																			0936-577X	1616-1572					2018	75	2					111	115		10.3354/cr01511	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/cr01511													WOS:000434378400002

The lake is designated under the EU Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) for its representative Annex I habitat from which charophytes are the main feature of interest. Groundwater interactions are considered a significant component of the lough's hydrology with its Annex I archetype deemed vulnerable to the pressures of nutrient pollution. This study utilised thermal imagery and geochemical tracers to detect and quantify groundwater inputs. Landsat 7 Thermal Infrared Imagery from two dates in both summer and winter was processed to investigate the potential occurrence of localised seepage points of groundwater captured as anomalous spatial plumes. In situ surveys of radon were undertaken in summer to confirm the presence of groundwater in the lake. Results were subsequently modelled to estimate the total groundwater discharge into the lake during the survey period. Additionally, a conceptual site model was created to characterise potential pressures to the lake from groundwater interactions within the catchment. Thermal imaging failed to conclusively identify thermal plumes consistent with localised groundwater inputs in Lough Arrow. However, the radon inventory applied to the mass balance estimated the lake was subject to 6,722m3 of groundwater influx per day at the time of the survey. The conceptual site model determined the lake was subject to potential pollution pressures from groundwater due to the catchment's physical attributes and land use activities. This is primarily due to the presence of a karst aquifer in the majority of the catchment coupled with significant agricultural and forestry practices. The vulnerability of the aquifer and the influx of groundwater to the lake highlights the potential threat groundwater contamination may pose to the favourable conservation condition of Lough Arrow's Annex I habitat.

The concentrations of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in an animal's excretion are strongly influenced by the C:N:P stoichiometry (molar ratios) of its body and of the food it eats. We measured the C:N:P ratios of quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) tissues and excreta and of seston across wide environmental and spatial gradients in the upper Laurentian Great Lakes. We then investigated how mussel excretion rates were impacted by stoichiometric mismatch-the difference between the C:P ratios of mussel tissues and the C:P ratios their food. Quagga mussel internal C:N:P stoichiometry varied significantly across sites and seasons, driven primarily by changes in tissue P concentrations. When mussel tissues had substantially lower C:P ratios than seston (that is, strong stoichiometric mismatch), mussels excreted significantly less N and P relative to C. Excretion C:N ratios varied by nearly threefold, while C:P ratios varied by tenfold. The effect of the stoichiometric mismatch on excretion stoichiometry was more dramatic in the spring, when mussels had higher tissue P concentrations, than in the summer. This suggests seasonality in mussel P demand. Our results challenge the assumption of strict internal homeostasis in consumers and demonstrate that food and tissue stoichiometry need to be considered to predict consumer excretion stoichiometry. These findings help to better understand the impact of consumer-driven nutrient cycling in aquatic environments and quagga mussel contributions to the nutrient budgets of invaded ecosystems.					; Huff, Audrey/HLQ-2316-2023	Huff, Audrey/0000-0001-6012-8514; 													1432-9840	1435-0629				NOV	2023	26	7					1543	1555		10.1007/s10021-023-00849-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-023-00849-x		MAY 2023											WOS:000992039000001

Two trials were conducted, one at 0-5 degrees C and another at 5-10 degrees C in a controlled environmental chamber with parallel planted and unplanted planted microcosms. This study specifically examined reduction rates for ammonia, (NH3-N), nitrate (NO3- -N), nitrite (NO2- -N) and Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN). Wastewater was pumped at a rate of 27 L/day and influent and effluent were sampled twice per week for four weeks. Our results showed that the planted trials outperformed the controlled trials at both temperature regimes. In particular, there was a 98% decrease in NH3-N concentration for the 5-10 degrees C and 78% decrease for the 0-5 degrees C trial. We believe direct uptake by the plant is the reason for the removal. The planted system also showed a 92 percent increase in SO42--S concentration (p < 0.01). Further research needs to be completed to determine how effective horizontal subsurface constructed wetlands are when built on shallow soil for extreme cold climate constructed wetlands.

J	Russell, MJ				Russell, MJ			The generation at hot springs of sedimentary ore deposits, microbialites and life	ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS												Notwithstanding the current fashion which favours an epigenetic origin for what used to be termed SEDEX deposits, there are several lines of evidence to indicate that Phanerozoic base-metal orebodies of this type have at least some exhalative aspects. The fossil polychaete worms, which occur in Lower Carboniferous pyrite mounds at Tynagh and Silvermines in Ireland, have affinities to Paralvinella, an organism that lives attached to hydrothermal chimneys at the Juan de Fuca hot spring site in the Northeast Pacific. In addition, fossil tube worms, and their moulds, occur both in silica masses underlying the Carboniferous giant Red Dog sulphide orebody in Alaska and in Devonian barite and base-metal deposits in North America and in Russia, respectively. The development of sulphide and carbonate fossil microbialites over exhalative centres further supports generation of some mineral deposits on sea or lake floors. Carbonate microbialite mounds are also developing today over warm springs and seepages. The existence of an environment in which sulphide mineralisation developed at the sea floor has implications also in a different sphere. Life itself may have emerged in a similar milieu at similar to 4.2 Ga from iron monosulphide bubbles. A primitive metabolism could have been driven by the high, long-lived and constant, redox potential of similar to 300 mV made available across an iron monosulphide membrane which would have been spontaneously generated where sulphide-bearing, submarine, alkaline springs issued into the acidic, iron-bearing, Hadean ocean. The alkaline spring provided bisulphide to the iron-rich (carbonic) acid ocean for the precipitation of iron-monosulphide bubbles (probotryoids), as well as acetate (Shock, 1992) - the feeder to the biochemical Krebs cycle, driven in reverse by the high partial pressure of CO2. In addition to its scientific significance, an understanding of these beginnings may well benefit research into many aspects of economic geology. Even more extreme odor contrasts are revealed by the presence of sedimentary jasper or iron formation in three of the major Carboniferous sulphide orebodies in Ireland. Pyritic sulphide microbialites also grew over some of the associated fossil hot-spring sites and may be recognised by their bacteriogenic delta(34)S values (-20 to -40 parts per thousand). Recognition of such fossil hot-spring sites could lead to further discoveries of SEDEX deposits.																			0169-1368					MAY	1996	10	3-6					199	214		10.1016/0169-1368(95)00023-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0169-1368(95)00023-2													WOS:A1996UT96200004
J	Small, EE; Giorgi, F; Sloan, LC				Small, EE; Giorgi, F; Sloan, LC			Regional climate model simulation of precipitation in central Asia: Mean and interannual variability	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												We examine how well the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) regional climate model (RegCM2) simulates the mean and interannual variability of precipitation in a semiarid region to more fully establish the strengths and weaknesses of the model as a tool for studying regional scale climate processes, We compare precipitation observations with RegCM2 output from a 5.5 year long simulation of the climate of central Asia, driven by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts analyses. RegCM2 simulates well the spatial patterns and annual cycles of precipitation observed in climatically different subregions. The magnitude of simulated precipitation is similar to observations except over the driest part of Central Asia where the simulated precipitation is too high. We calculate precipitation anomalies for each month as the difference between the monthly total and the 5 year average for that month, from both observations and RegCM2 output. The magnitude of simulated interannual variability is similar to observations, although there are differences. RegCM2 tends to underpredict (overpredict) the magnitude of variability in the same combinations of subregion and season for which it underpredicts (overpredicts) mean precipitation. RegCM2 closely reproduces precipitation anomalies observed in specific months, except during summer and during winter in the mountains. There is no correlation between model biases in mean precipitation and how well the model reproduces a series of precipitation anomalies, This suggests that the processes controlling the mean and the variability of precipitation differ. Therefore evaluating the ability of a regional climate model to simulate both quantities is a demanding test of model performance.

Finland). Our studies showed that the introduction of elemental chlorine free (ECF) bleaching and secondary treatment of effluents in a modern activated sludge plant at the mill in 1992 have substantially reduced the exposure of feral and caged fish to organochlorines. The liver EROD activity was noticeably lower in feral and caged fish near the mill indicating lesser impacts on the liver mixed function oxygenase (MFO) system. However, at the mill site, liver EROD activies in feral and caged fish still tend to be one to four times higher than at the reference sites. Significantly decreased plasma estradiol-17 beta and testosterone concentrations in perch and roach in the period of development of the gonads (autumn and winter) indicate that there were endocrine disrupting compounds present in the lake receiving ECF pulp and paper mill effluents. Cause-effect relationships, however, are difficult to establish. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of the IAWQ.

Presently, Lake Donggi Cona is located at the boundaries of Westerlies and Asian monsoon circulations in the northeastern TP. However, the exact timing and stimulating mechanisms for climatic changes and monsoon shifts in this region are still debated. We used a 19-ka-long stable isotope record of sedimentary n-alkanes to address this discrepancy by providing insights into paleohydrological conditions. The SD of nC(23) is influenced by lake water evaporation; the BD. values of sedimentary nC(29) are mainly controlled by moisture source and temperature changes. Long-chain n-alkanes dominate over the core whereas three mean clusters (i.e. microbial, aquatic and terrestrial) can be inferred. Multi-proxies suggest five major episodes in the history of Lake Donggi Cona. The Lake Donggi Cona record indicates that the Late Glacial(18.4-14.8 cal ka BP) was dominated by low productivity of mainly microbial and aquatic organisms. Relatively low delta D values suggest low temperatures and moist conditions eventually caused by stronger Westerlies, winter monsoon and melt-water influence. Likely, the shift (similar to 17.9 cal ka BP) from microbial to enhanced aquatic input suggests either a change from deep to shallow water lake or a break in local stratification. Between 14.8 and 13.0 cal ka BP, variable climatic conditions prevailed. Although the Westerlies weekend, the increase in temperature enhanced the permafrost and snow melting (displayed by a high sedimentary accumulation rate). Higher delta D values indicate increasingly arid conditions with higher temperatures which eventually lead to high evaporative conditions and lowest lake levels. Low vegetation cover and high erosion rates led to high sediment accumulation resulting in stratification followed by anoxia in the terminal lake. From 13.0 to 9.2 cal ka BP, lowered values of 813 along with high contents of terrestrial organic matter marked the early-Holocene warming indicating a further strengthening of summer precipitation and higher lake levels. A cooling trend was observed in the mid-Holocene between 9.2 and 3.0 cal ka BP accompanied by higher moisture availability (displayed by lowered SD values) caused by reduced evaporative conditions due to a drop in temperature and recovering Westerlies. After 3.0 cal ka BP, a decrease in lake productivity and cold and semi-arid conditions prevailed suggesting lower lake levels and reduced moisture from recycled air masses and Westerlies. We propose that the summer monsoon was the predominant moisture source during the Belling-Allered warm complex and early -Holocene followed by Westerlies in mid-to-late Holocene period. Stable carbon isotope values-32%o indicate the absence of C-4 -type vegetation in the region contradicting with their presence in the Lake Qinghai record. The 81) record from lake Donggi Cona highlights the importance of the interplay between Westerlies and summer monsoon circulation at this location, which is highly dynamic in northeastern plateau compared to the North Atlantic circulation and insolation changes. Consequently lake Donggi Cona might be an important anchor point for environmental reconstructions on the Tibetan Plateau. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The impact of fossil fuel burning related to scientific activities in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica: Revisited	ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE												Fossil fuel use associated with scientific activities in the Taylor Valley, Antarctic has been examined to determine the fluxes of particulate organic and elemental carbon and nitrogen as well as NOx for the 2015-2016 austral summer field season. These carbon and nitrogen fluxes are compared to our previously published calculations for the 1997-1998 austral summer. In addition, we compile fossil fuel usage and resulting C and N fluxes from the major field camp in Taylor Valley, Lake Hoare Camp (LHC) from the late 1990's through 2017. In general, the annual fluxes do vary from year to year, but there is no significant trend, at least during the primary summer field season. There is indication that increasing the length of scientific operations does increase the C and N inputs via fossil fuel burning. This works supports our original results demonstrating that over long periods of time the anthropogenic flux of N from local fossil fuel burning could become quantitatively important in the region. Although the particulate C fluxes remain very low, the recent finding of black carbon in the Taylor Valley landscape indicates more on-going monitoring of the source of this material is merited.

Synoptic climatology of tornadoes in the northeast USA	CLIMATE RESEARCH												A tornado climatology is constructed for the northeast USA (hereafter, Northeast) for the period 1950-2014. This region is highly susceptible to tornado damage as it includes dense populations in several major cities. This study provides a general climatology of tornadoes in the Northeast by exploring the spatial and temporal characteristics of the region's tornadoes. Additionally, 86 days defined as active tornado days (5+ reports per day) are used to examine the synoptic patterns associated with Northeast tornado environments. Tornadoes in the Northeast were most frequently reported in the late spring and summer months (May to July), during the late afternoon and early evening hours, between 18:00 and 23:00 h UTC (14:00 and 19:00 h local sidereal time [LST]). Tornadoes were reported most frequently along the densely populated Interstate 95 corridor, which connects several of the largest cities in the USA. Approximately 79% of all Northeast tornadoes were given an Enhanced Fujita Scale intensity rating of <= 1. Composite synoptic maps indicate that Northeast tornado outbreaks are commonly associated with a 500 hPa trough and a surface low pressure system over the Great Lakes. Differential positive vorticity advection and warm advection contribute quasi-geostrophic forcing, modifying thermodynamic profiles making them favorable for convection. These lifting mechanisms and associated instability (represented by high equivalent potential temperature and an unstable lifted index), along with sufficient lower tropospheric wind shear, provide the ingredients necessary for severe convection.					; Leathers, Daniel/A-3665-2010	Leathers, Daniel/0000-0001-9002-9031; 													0936-577X	1616-1572					2017	72	1					19	27		10.3354/cr01444	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/cr01444													WOS:000402652000002
J	Jia, BY; Tang, Y; Yang, B; Huang, JH				Jia, Binyang; Tang, Ya; Yang, Bo; Huang, Jen-How			Historical and seasonal dynamics of phosphorus mobility in Sancha Lake of Southwest China's Sichuan Province	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Phosphorus (P) fractionations in the surface sediment of Sancha Lake in China's southwestern Sichuan Province were examined to assess the potential P release at the water-sediment interface and to understand its seasonal (2009-2010) and historical dynamics (1989-2010) in the surface water. Elevated P concentrations were detected in the sediment at main reservoir inflow, south canal of the Dujiangyan irrigation network, and intensive cage fish farming area, accounting for 32 and 40% of current total P discharges. The highest total P concentration (11,200 mu g P g(-1)) was observed in the upper sediment below intensive fish farming area with a specific enrichment of HCl-P (51% of total P) mainly from fish feeds and feces. These sediments had larger MgCl2-P pools with higher diffusive P fluxes (0.43-0.47 mg m(-2) d(-1)) from surface sediment than those from other areas (0.25-0.42 mg m(-2) d(-1)). The general small proportion of MgCl2-P (5.7-10%) and low diffusive P fluxes from surface sediment (<0.02% of sediment P storage (0-1 cm)) indicate low mobility and slow release of P from sediments. The sediment as an internal P source led to a 3-4-year lag for P concentration decrease in the surface water after restriction of anthropogenic P discharges since 2005. Thus, the peak P concentration in April and September could be explained as a combined effect of supplementing internal loading via reductive processes in sediments and seasonal water vertical circulation in the early spring and fall. Policy played a crucial role in reducing P inputs to the lake.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				JAN	2017	189	1							16	10.1007/s10661-016-5727-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-016-5727-z								27975331					WOS:000392300300016

The concentration and characteristics of elements in these salt lakes resemble those found in geothermal water in northern Tibet, which highlights both as crucial sources of rare elements. This study presents comprehensive analyses of the hydrochemical composition and isotopes of B, strontium (Sr), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O) in typical salt lakes, along with samples from surrounding springs and rivers in the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone of northern Tibet. The results reveal an extremely negative and anomalous distribution pattern of B isotopes in Zabuye Salt Lake that is closely associated with geothermal water. The enrichment of these elements in other salt lakes in the region is attributed to concentration of evaporation and sediment adsorption. Given the very high elevation of the recharge for geothermal water, the infiltration of salt lakes obviously cannot feed geothermal springs. On the contrary, we correlate the unusual enrichment of Li and B and other resources in salt lakes to geothermal spring discharge. The ultimate origin of these elements lies in magmatic sources, with later water-rock interaction leading to significant enrichment of incompatible elements such as Li, rubidium (Rb), cesium (Cs), and B in the geothermal system. The geothermal springs directly or indirectly fed the salt lakes, and with further evaporation, they became superscale brine deposits.

Assessment of species richness in Lake Dal, Kashmir, based on classical approach, physiological approach and rDNA ITS sequences from isolates	MICROBIAL PATHOGENESIS												As a first description to document the species richness in Dal Lake, a freshwater lake ecosystem in Kashmir valley, an extensive network of sixteen sampling stations with distinguishing features was sampled seasonally for two years. The identification process yielded fifty-one species probably first and new records for this area to date. The taxonomic groups observed were those with species from Ascomycetes (inclusive of yeasts), Basidiomycetes, Blastocladiomycetes, Zygomycetes, and Peronosporomycetes. Each phylum was represented by a single Order, with the exception of the Peronosporomycetes, which was represented by two Orders- Saprolegniales and Pythiales. In the filamentous fungal group, family Trichocomaceae was dominant followed by Saccharomycetaceae, Mucoraceae, Nectriaceae, Tremellaceae and Hypocreaceae. However, in the group of zoosporic & fungal like eukaryotes, family Saprolegniaceae was most dominant followed by Blastocladiaceae and Pythiaceae. A dramatic decrease in fungal load was observed in different seasons with highest colonial load in the summer season and lowest in the winter season. The observed distribution was statistically significant for both the filamentous fungal species (p < 0.01) as well as zoosporic fungi & fungal like eukaryotes (p < 0.05). In order to assess biodiversity patterns of fungi more accurately, it is necessary to repeat such investigations in other areas and to improve the tools for taxonomic identification of these highly diverse but mostly microscopic organisms.

J	Phillips, KA; Fawley, MW				Phillips, KA; Fawley, MW			Winter phytoplankton blooms under ice associated with elevated oxygen levels	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												Many shallow lakes in north temperate zones experience reduced dissolved oxygen concentration under ice. However, some shallow lakes display supersaturated dissolved oxygen concentrations (>20 mg.L (-) (1) ) in late winter under conditions of maximum ice thickness. During the winters of 1996, 1997, and 1999, we collected phytoplankton samples from Arrowwood Lake near Pingree, North Dakota to determine whether a specific alga was involved in dissolved oxygen supersaturation in this lake. Although dissolved oxygen supersaturation was not observed during this period, we did observe an increase in dissolved oxygen concentration that was associated with a phytoplankton bloom during late February and early March in both 1996 and 1997. In 1996, the bloom was composed of the dinoflagellate, Peridinium aciculiferum (Lemm.) Lemm. and several species of cryptomonads. A similar bloom of P. aciculiferum was followed by a bloom of several species of euglenoids in 1997. In contrast, P. aciculiferum was only a minor component of the winter phytoplankton, dissolved oxygen concentrations remained low, and no bloom event was observed in 1999. Statistical analyses indicated a significant relationship (r (s) = 0.57, P = 0.019) between dissolved oxygen levels and the density of the dinoflagellate, P. aciculiferum , but no significant relationship between dissolved oxygen levels and densities of other phytoplankton. These results suggest that the elevated levels of dissolved oxygen are associated with the dinoflagellate, P. aciculiferum. This bloom was most likely the result of an excystment event rather than a general growth response.																				1529-8817				DEC	2002	38	6					1068	1073		10.1046/j.1529-8817.2002.01044.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1529-8817.2002.01044.x													WOS:000179910900001

Accurate understanding of the spatial distribution of wintering geese and estimates of their population numbers are vital for their conservation. Based on satellite tracking data, the migration timing and spatial distribution of geese in Poyang Lake were studied by using time series and home range analysis. We propose a method for estimating goose populations to address the population underestimation in current ground surveys. We found that the utilization intensity of geese is higher within the Protected area than outside, and during the wintering period, spatial overlap in their distributions is evident. This is especially the case in mid-winter, when the overlap area reaches 257.84 km2. There are missing areas in existing ground surveys, resulting in underestimation of the numbers of Greater White-fronted Goose, Bean Goose and Swan Goose by 13,196, 6157 and 3191, respectively. A reevaluation of the numbers using integrated satellite tracking and ground survey data, indicates the high level of importance of Poyang Lake for the protection of East Asian geese, with the numbers of Greater White-fronted Goose, Bean Goose, and Swan Goose wintering there constituting 56.94%, 14.53%, and 49.93%, respectively, of their estimated populations along the migration flyway. This study provided a scientific foundation for the conservation of East Asian geese populations and offers critical support for the development of targeted conservation strategies in the future.																			0960-3115	1572-9710				MAR	2025	34	4					1541	1558		10.1007/s10531-025-03032-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-025-03032-x		FEB 2025											WOS:001424101700001

The climatological characteristics of this wind are investigated through the analysis of 10 years of observations collected at two representative surface weather stations - one on Lake Garda's shore and the other 30 km inland. Furthermore, the possible influences of the land-water temperature contrast and of the synoptic wind on the development and the propagation of the Ora del Garda are analysed. Lake-breeze days are identified by means of a set of objective criteria based on observations of solar radiation, wind speed and direction at the two stations. The analysis highlights that, on the lake's shoreline, the breeze develops on about 70% of the days in the warmest months, while it rarely occurs from October to February. Moreover, in the warmest months, the Ora del Garda reaches the inland weather station on about 80-90% of the days on which it blows on the lake's shore, after 3.5 h on average. It displays rather strong intensities, reaching average velocities of 5 m s(-1) and gusts of 10 m s(-1), respectively, in summer on the lake's shore and in spring at the inland weather station. No clear relationship is found between the land-water temperature contrast and the lake-breeze strength. On the other hand, synoptic winds are observed to affect significantly the development of the breeze.

Moreover, in these situations the Ora del Garda propagates faster and is detected earlier at the inland weather station.

The results of the physical and chemical conditions of calcite precipitation as well as the delta C-13 values of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) were used to study the processes influencing calcite precipitation. Significant differences between spring, lake and stream waters as well as changes in the downstream direction were observed. The correlation between delta C-13(DIC) values and physico-chemical conditions for calcite precipitation showed that calcite precipitates in lake waters which are oversaturated with respect to CaCO3 (I-sat values 4-10) and with delta C-13(DIC) values between -11.5 and -8.5 parts per thousand. In spring waters, the delta C-13(DIC) values were more negative, from -14 to -12 parts per thousand, and Isat values of 1-2 indicated that equilibrium conditions for calcite precipitation were not attained. The downstream increase in delta C-13(DIC) correlated with the increase in the delta C-13 values of calcite in the lake sediments, suggesting that the freshwater calcite was mainly of autochthonous origin and precipitated within the water column in isotopic equilibrium with DIC.

Life Cycle of the Copepod Limnocalanus macrurus Sars 1863 (Copepoda, Calaniformes, Centropagidae) in Lake Onego	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												Limnocalanus macrurus Sars 1863 (Calaniformes, Centropagidae Giesbrecht 1892) is a glacial marine relict species. In the pelagic zone of Lake Onego, one of the European Great Lakes, this copepod is part of the zooplankton dominant complex all year round. Limnocalanus macrurus is a monocyclic species with one generation and winter reproduction. Based on the analysis of long-term data, the main features of the life cycle of the copepod have been studied in Petrozavodsk Bay and in the central part of Lake Onego. Thus, during the growing season the average values of abundance are two times lower in the bay compared to the central part of the lake (2700 vs. 5500 ind./m(2), respectively). The same tendency was observed in relation to biomass (0.82 vs. 1.36 g/m(2), respectively). A comparison of the average long-term maximal values of abundance and biomass in these parts of the lake also shows that the values of abundance are 1.6 times (5600 vs. 9000 ind./m(2)), while the biomass values are twotimes lower (1.41 vs. 2.83 g/m(2)) in Petrozavodsk Bay compared to the central part. A shift in the timing of the spring development of L. macrurus in Petrozavodsk Bay has been found; here the development begins 2-3 decades earlier due to the difference in the thermal regimes of the areas compared. Despite the climatic changes observed in recent decades, no significant changes in the abundance of L. macrurus have been detected in the lake.

Landscape control of water chemistry in northern boreal streams of Alberta	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												End-member mixing analysis (EMMA) and isotopes of water (deuterium and oxygen-18) are used to describe hydrologic processes for six boreal forest catchments in the discontinuous permafrost of northern Alberta. The data presented in this paper represent pre-disturbance conditions during two average precipitation years for small basins where the impacts of clear cut harvesting will be evaluated in future work. Hydrologic patterns and soil water sources were different between the two streams draining sloped catchments and the four streams draining flat lowlands. In sloped catchments, snowmelt discharged rapidly prior to loss of soil frost. Snowmelt discharge initially contained between 70 and 90% water from mineral soils and peatlands. As melt progressed, soil water was replaced by surface or near-surface runoff comprising 50-80% of stream discharge. Surface storage of snowmelt in sloped catchments was minimal and summer stream discharge was dominated by rainfall routed through organic and mineral soils (34 and 46%, respectively). Surface runoff averaged 20% of total discharge throughout the summer but rose to 60% of discharge following large storms. In contrast, snowmelt was stored in lowland catchments; peak snowmelt discharge was 30-66% of summer peak discharge and was an equal mix of older groundwater and snowmelt. In lowland catchments, watertables and stream flow declined through the summer and summer discharge was increasingly dominated (> 50%) by groundwater routed through organic soils.

Using mark-recapture techniques to assess factors affecting survival of fall stocked walleye Sander vitreus in two Iowa lakes	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Stocking walleye Sander virteus is a common management technique to supplement populations where natural reproduction is limited. However, numerous factors can influence the survival of fall stocked walleye including environmental conditions, predation, and stocked walleye total length (TL), condition, and foraging ability. The relative effects of these factors on survival of stocked walleye are challenging to evaluate and rarely assessed simultaneously. Our objective was to determine factors that influence survival rates of stocked fingerling walleye (98-287 mm TL) from stocking until ice cover in two Iowa systems (East Okoboji and West Okoboji) during fall 2015, 2016, and 2017 using mark-recapture techniques. Each fall, roughly 4000 stocked walleye were implanted with passive integrated transponder tags, stocked across both systems, and recaptured via boat electrofishing. Cormack-Jolly-Seber recapture models estimated walleye weekly apparent survival was negatively related to the weekly average proportion of walleye recovered from predator diets (8 = -0.89; 95 % credibility interval = -1.74 to -0.03) and positively related to weekly average water temperatures (8 = 2.62; 95 % credibility interval = 1.04-4.21). At an average fall water temperature (13.2 celcius), mean walleye apparent survival was 0.83 (95 % credibility interval = 0.75-0.91) when no walleye were recovered from predator diets and declined to 0.54 (95 % credibility interval = 0.28-0.84) when walleye comprised 60 % of predator diets. Between 41-97 % of stocked walleye were lost to apparent mortality from stocking through ice-up and survival was influenced by poststocking predation rather than walleye body size or condition. Thus, strategies that minimize predation following stocking may result in the greatest improvements in walleye stocking success.

J	Rosinska, J; Kozak, A; Dondajewska, R; Goldyn, R				Rosinska, Joanna; Kozak, Anna; Dondajewska, Renata; Goldyn, Ryszard			Cyanobacteria blooms before and during the restoration process of a shallow urban lake	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Swarzedzkie Lake (near Poznan) has been heavily polluted. To improve the water quality, the restoration of lake by three methods: aeration, phosphorus inactivation using small doses of iron sulphate and magnesium chloride (FeSO4 and MgCl2) and biomanipulation was initiated at the end of 2011. The aim of the present study was to determine whether sustainable restoration has a significant impact on phytoplankton, especially cyanobacterial blooms in a shallow, urban, degraded lake. Therefore, phytoplankton and the physico-chemical parameters of water at the summer thermal stratification and autumn water mixing before (2011) and during restoration (2012-2014) was studied. Samples were collected at the deepest place of the lake in depth profile, every 1 m. Phytoplankton samples were preserved with Lugol's solution. The phytoplankton was counted using a Sedgewick-Rafter chamber with a volume of 0.46 ml. Measurements of water temperature were made in the field with a YSI multiparameter meter, transparency using a Secchi disk. Concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus and chlorophyll a were analysed in the laboratory according to Polish standards. As a result of restoration the water quality of the lake has improved. Cyanobacteria had almost disappeared during the first year of restoration, however, a short bloom was observed (dominated by Pseudanabeana limnetica) in the second year. The main reason for this reappearance was a higher water temperature stimulating cyanobacteria growth, but an increased supply of phosphorus from the bottom sediments also contributed. A decrease in the temperature in the third year of restoration limited the growth of cyanobacteria again. Although the decrease in the phosphorus concentration as a result of restoration proved to be sufficient for average climatic conditions, it is highly likely to be more intense in the case of increased water temperature caused by global warming.

To study changes of its habitat, we assessed the spatio-temporal metalimnetic boundaries by applying low-pass filtering and binary thresholding to temperature profiles of long-term data (1978-2013, weekly measurements). Due to increasing temperatures over the last 3.5 decades, the onset and duration of metalimnion formation changed significantly (stratification increased by 33 days). Moreover, the upper metalimnetic boundary has undergone a significant drawdown of 2.3 m, accounting for an overall decrease in metalimnion thickness. Being the most abundant species in this zone, P. rubescens was not negatively affected by altered temporal or spatial stratification patterns during its phase of net growth (July-September), as the zone of its optimal light-dependent buoyancy was still located within the metalimnion. The biomass of P. rubescens in August was even significantly related to increasing temperatures. Nevertheless, a further depression of the metalimnetic top boundary may eventually restrict P. rubescens by forcing it into layers of unfavourable light conditions or into the turbulent epilimnetic zone.

J	Shen, JY; Shen, MQ; Wang, XH; Lu, YT				Shen, JY; Shen, MQ; Wang, XH; Lu, YT			Effect of environmental factors on shoot emergence and vegetative growth of alligatorweed (Alternanthera philoxcroides)	WEED SCIENCE												Laboratory and greenhouse studies were conducted to determine the effect of temperature, soil moisture, light, planting depth, and rhizome water content on shoot emergence and vegetative growth of alligatorweed. Optimum shoot emergence and growth occurred at constant 30 C, and no shoot emergence was found below constant 5 C. A maximum shoot emergence of 93% occurred at constant soil moisture of 30% with temperatures of 10 to 35 C. Shoot emergence and growth decreased as rhizome water content decreased, and shoot emergence did not occur below a rhizome water content of 20%. Shoot emergence and growth decreased with burial depth; shoot emergence was above 90% when rhizomes were buried 0.5 to 1.0 cm deep compared to 16% when they were buried 18 cm deep. Alligatorweed shoot emergence and vegetative growth were not significantly affected by light. In the fields, shoot emergence began in late March and culminated in May and June. These data help explain why this species is most commonly found in crop fields, orchards, roadsides, rivers, lakes, ponds, and irrigation canals. This information may aid in the development of more effective management measures, such as bringing alligatorweed rhizomes to the surface or below 20 cm deep to restrain its emergence and growth at winter or summer plowing.																			0043-1745	1550-2759				JUL-AUG	2005	53	4					471	478		10.1614/WS-04-198R	http://dx.doi.org/10.1614/WS-04-198R													WOS:000230999200008

Here a novel passive sampler, linoleic acid embedded cellulose acetate membrane (LAECAM), was developed and used to in situ measure the freely dissolved concentrations of ten polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the sediment porewaters and the water columns of two lakes in both winter and summer and predict their bioavailability to the shoots of resident submerged macrophytes (Potamogeton malainus, Myriophyllum spicata, Najas minor All., and Vallisneria natans (Lour.) Hara). PAH sampling by LAECAMs could reach equilibrium within 21 days. The influence of temperature on LAECAM-water partition coefficients was 0.0008-0.0116 log units/degrees C. The method of LAECAM was comparable with the active sampling methods of liquid-liquid extraction combined with f(DOC) adjustment, centrifugation/solid-phase extraction (SPE), and filtration/SPE but had several advantages. After lipid normalization, concentrations of the PAHs in LAECAMs were not significantly different from those in the macrophytes. In contrast, concentrations of the PAHs in the triolein containing passive sampler (TECAM) deployed simultaneously with LAECAM were much higher. The results suggest that linoleic acid is more suitable than triolein as the model lipid for passive samplers to predict bioavailability of PAHs to submerged macrophytes.

Based on the observational and reanalysis data during 1961-2018, this study examines the relationship of winter snowfall over northern China with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The results show that their relationship experiences an interdecadal change around 2000. During 2000-2018, the NAO is significantly and negatively correlated to winter snowfall in northern China. When the NAO is in the negative phase, the East Asian subtropical jet and polar front jet tend to move northward and southward, respectively, concomitant with an anomalous cyclonic circulation from Lake Balkhash to Lake Baikal in the middle and lower troposphere. Such an atmospheric background favors the increase of snowfall over northern China by empowering the interactions of cold air with moist airflows in the target region. However, during 1981-1999, the association of the NAO with the above atmospheric circulations seems inconspicuous, thereby reducing its relation to winter snowfall in northern China. Further investigation suggests that the enhancement of the connection between the NAO and aforementioned atmospheric circulations may result from the westward displacement of the NAO southern center from the former period to the latter period.

Water bodies include rivers, lakes, groundwater, oceans, and mountain spring water plays a dynamic role in India's most hilly regions, including the Mizoram of India. Water quality includes all the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of water. Access to safe water is vital for health, livelihoods, security, and quality of life-the study area is located around 25 km from Aizawl city, Mizoram. Landfill receives waste from Aizawl city in vast quantities. There is no proper arrangement to secure the stream, which is just near the dumping ground, due to which spring water is getting affected by toxic substances. The TDS value was found to be between 670 and 690 mg/L, Dissolved Oxygen (DO) in the range of 2-5.2 mg/L, chloride level between 263.3 and 268.2 mg/L, calcium 109.6-113.6 mg/L, hardness in the range of 326-340 mg/L, conductivity higher than 1000 US/cm, ammonia in between 0.165 and 0.849 mg/L in the three sample sites. A reduced amount of dissolved oxygen affects the self-purification of spring, which leads to deteriorating the condition of the water quality. Water quality is dependent on the type of pollutant added and the nature of the self-purification of water. WQI at 215.52 suggests that water is not suitable for drinking.

Chrysophyte stomatocysts, siliceous resting stages of golden-brown algae, are widely distributed in acidic and oligotrophic environments of peatlands. Presently, little knowledge is available on the composition and distribution of stomatocysts in subtropical peatlands. This study investigated the communities of moss-inhabiting stomatocysts in three Sphagnum-dominated peatlands in central China, and their association with environmental variables. Fifty-nine stomatocyst morphotypes with two additional formae were identified according to the International Statospore Working Group guidelines, and stomatocyst assemblages were significantly different among the three peatlands. In addition, these stomatocyst morphotypes were classified into eight morphology-based functional groups according to morphological traits, such as types of collar and ornamentation. Redundancy analyses revealed that stomatocyst assemblages at both morphotype- and functional group-level were significantly correlated with depth to water table, oxidation reduction potential, and morphotype-level composition was further related to electronic conductivity and potassium. Generally, cysts with a complex collar preferred dry hummocks, while large cysts with long spines mainly occurred in wet hollows. This study highlights the usage of chrysophyte stomatocysts as potential bioindicators for environmental changes in these subtropical peatlands, as well as similar peaty environments.					; Chen, Xu/A-7846-2015	Bai, Xue/0000-0002-8667-8511; Chen, Xu/0000-0002-8164-3088; Piatek, Jolanta/0000-0002-3707-8966; Wolowski, Konrad/0000-0001-8298-7731													1470-160X	1872-7034				FEB	2021	121								107125	10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.107125	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.107125													WOS:000604891100001

From January 1997 to December 2000, a total of 13 319 eels (Anguilla anguilla from elver to silver phase) were examined, in which we found 22227 swimbladder nematodes (Anguillicola crassus adults and preadults). A generalised linear model (GLM) framework was used to explore the relative contribution of various factors to the occurrence, intensity and abundance of the parasite. We reveal a major influence of the month of sampling, and we document the existence of a seasonal pattern with regular peaks in early summer and late winter. In contrast, the year of sampling is of secondary importance, and no particular trend in the development of the infection can be detected. More than a decade after the first record of A. crassus in the Rhone River delta, anguillicolosis has thus attained a constant infection rate of nearly 50%, with a mean number of 3 or 4 macroscopic lumen worms per infected eel. The eel length strongly influences the intensity and the abundance of the nematode, but has little it any effect on the probability of being infected. There exists a linear relationship between eel size and the number of parasites, but not between eel size and prevalence. We observe a decrease in the proportion of infected individuals among elver eels. We discuss this result in relation to the possible mortality of heavily infected individuals and/or a change in the eels' alimentary diet.					; Lefebvre, Francois/B-8128-2008	Lefebvre, Francois/0009-0002-9143-1799; 													0177-5103					JUL 29	2002	50	3					181	188		10.3354/dao050181	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/dao050181								12219974					WOS:000178215000003
J	Ostrovsky, I				Ostrovsky, I			Methane bubbles in Lake Kinneret: Quantification and temporal and spatial heterogeneity	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The amount of methane bubbles rising from the bottom of Lake Kinneret was quantified by using a dual-beam echo sounder. Both echo-counting (EC) and echo integration (ET) techniques were implemented. Bubbles can confound the identification of fish targets because their acoustic sizes strongly overlap. Analysis of vertical changes in densities in the anoxic hypolimnion (with no fish) indicated that multiple targets were most abundant near the bottom, which caused an essential bias of bubble density estimates by EC. El was a reliable tool for assessment of bubble density near the bottom. In the upper part of the water column, both techniques provided similar estimates of density of targets (mainly bubbles) because they were measured between dense fish schools during the daytime. The mean acoustic size of rising bubbles. hypolimnion but increased in the epilimnion, suggesting change in the relative importance of factors decreased in the hypolimnion but increased in the epilimnion, suggesting change in the relative importance of factors controlling gas volume. in summer and fall 2001, the bubbles became predominant echo-reflecting objects in the epilimnion. Temporal and spatial changes in bubble densities were highly heterogeneous, suggesting strong variability in factors affecting the gas ebullition. This variability should be taken into consideration when attempting to quantify the methane ebullition and assessing fish abundance in aquatic systems.

Dominant organic matter types, distinguished according to morphological criteria, were sampled and incubated in the laboratory for 26 weeks with periodic leaching and measurement of mineral N. Mineralization data closely fit a first-order kinetic model. Field mineralization, estimated using mass of each organic matter type in the field and first-order model parameters corrected for local temperature, ranged from 2 to 6 g N.m-2. year-1, depending on burn severity, suggesting that slash burning did not reduce N availability below levels required to support early plantation growth, except in situations of severe burns on coarse-textured soils. Differential consumption of forest floor organic matter types increased spatial variability in N mineralization and resulted, at the most severely burned site, in 50% of mineralizable N being derived from materials covering only 5% of the site. Significant correlation between N mineralization and codes and indices of the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index System indicated that predictions of slash-burn impacts on site fertility may be made from weather conditions prior to and during burning.

J	Lai, HT; Kuo, YM				Lai, Hong-Thih; Kuo, Yi-Ming			Environmental Variability and its Impact on Phytoplankton Communities in Taiwan's Aogu Wetland	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The Aogu Wetland Forest Park in Taiwan, a vital ecological hotspot within the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, faces significant threats from anthropogenic activities, agricultural runoff, and climate variability. This study integrated multiple analytical approaches, including Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA), Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA), and Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs), to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of phytoplankton communities across six sites over an eight-year monitoring period (2015-2023). Phytoplankton diversity, assessed using Shannon-Wiener and Margalef indices, revealed distinct patterns driven by environmental gradients, with diversity indices ranging from 0.06 (DS2, May) to 2.21 (CS, July). HCA grouped sites into distinct clusters based on nutrient dynamics and salinity, indicating the influence of site-specific conditions. CCA identified ammonia (NH4-N), nitrate (NO3-N), temperature, and salinity as the most significant environmental drivers affecting genera-level distributions. GAMM analyses further quantified nonlinear interactions between phytoplankton abundance and key parameters, such as total dissolved solids (TDS), total phosphorus (TP), NH4-N, and NO3-N, providing detailed insights into how these factors vary across seasons and sites. The dominance of Cyanobacteria during colder months, with an average winter temperature of 27.8 degrees C, indicates the heightened risk of harmful algal blooms associated with nutrient enrichment. Seasonal dynamics showed that warmer summer months intensified the effects of nitrate and total phosphorus, driving site-specific phytoplankton proliferation. Adaptive wetland management strategies, including enhanced hydrological connectivity, nutrient runoff reduction, and targeted restoration, are essential to mitigate eutrophication and sustain ecological resilience. This approach provided practical insights for balancing conservation goals with ecosystem services in one of Taiwan's key wetlands.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				MAR	2025	236	3							190	10.1007/s11270-025-07831-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-025-07831-4													WOS:001434418000001

Permafrost is continuous under these basins, and sub-freezing temperatures dominate through the annual cycle with the snow-covered season lasting 8-9 months. These two small headwater basins receive about one-third of their annual precipitation as snow and two-thirds as summer rain (occasionally mixed with snow). The snowmelt period is a significant hydrological event each year and often produces the highest annual runoff, the floods of record are rainfall or rain/snow mixed summer events. The highest runoff ratios occur in Imnavait Creek during snowmelt and in Upper Kuparuk River during the summer. The Upper Kuparuk River, besides being 60 times larger, has higher terrain, steeper slopes, extensive bedrock outcrops and a few lakes. Water fluxes leaving Imnavait Creek catchment are about equally split between evapotranspiration and runoff; for the Upper Kuparuk watershed, it is estimated that 64% left as runoff and 36% as evapotranspiration. The quality of the data in these basins is quite good, except during extreme events.					; McNamara, James/F-1993-2011; Hinzman, Larry/B-3309-2013	McNamara, James/0000-0001-7625-4507; 													0144-7815		978-1-901502-82-4				2004	290						224	236																WOS:000248597300021

Tundra Plant Canopies Gradually Close Over Three Decades While Cryptogams Persist	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Global climate change phenomena are amplified in Arctic regions, driving rapid changes in the biota. Here, we examine changes in plant community structure over more than 30 years at two sites in arctic Alaska, USA, Imnavait Creek and Toolik Lake, to understand long-term trends in tundra response to changing climate. Vegetation cover was sampled every 4-7 years on permanent 1 m2 plots spanning a 1 km2 grid using a point-frame. The vascular plant canopies progressively closed at both locations. Canopy cover, defined here as an encounter of a vascular plant above the ground surface, increased from 63% to 91% at Imnavait Creek and from 63% to 89% at Toolik Lake. Both sites showed steady increases in maximum canopy height, increasing by approximately 50% (8 cm). While cover and height increased to some extent for all vascular plant growth forms, deciduous shrubs and graminoids changed the most. For example, at Imnavait Creek the cover of graminoids more than tripled (particularly in wet meadow plots), increasing by 237%. At Toolik Lake the cover of deciduous shrubs more than doubled (particularly in moist acidic plots), increasing by 145%. Despite the steady closing of the plant canopy, cryptogams (lichens and mosses) persisted; in fact, the cover of lichens increased. These results call into question the dominant dogma that cryptogams will decline with increases in vascular plant abundance and demonstrate the resilience of these understory plants. In addition to overall cover, the diversity of vascular plants increased at one site (Imnavait Creek). In contrast to much of the Arctic, summer air temperatures in the Toolik Lake region have not significantly increased over the 30+ year sampling period; however, winter temperatures increased substantially. Changes in vegetation community structure at Imnavait Creek and Toolik Lake are likely the result of winter warming.

Reproductive status of walleye (Sander vitreus) and lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) in two large, shallow Canadian subarctic lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												The reproductive status of walleye (Sander vitreus) and lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) is largely unstudied in the northern extent of their ranges. Tathlina Lake and Kakisa Lake are large, shallow lakes in the Northwest Territories, Canada, supporting important commercial and subsistence fisheries for these species while being threatened by climate change. Fish were sampled in both lakes across multiple years in the spring and autumn to assess differences in reproductive status in the pre- and post-spawning periods for both species. Condition factor (K), gonadosomatic index (GSI), liversomatic index (LSI), and fecundity were calculated, and plasma samples were also taken from each fish to determine levels of reproductive hormones, specifically 17 beta-estradiol in females, and 11-ketotestosterone in males. Significant temporal (intra- and interannual) and spatial (between lakes) variation was found for both species and both sexes for all metrics. Expected differences in hormones and indices of reproductive success between pre- and post- spawning periods were demonstrated. When compared with previously published data, a latitudinal gradient for LSI, GSI and fecundity was evident for walleye, but not for lake whitefish. The differences in the reproductive biology of lake whitefish and walleye in these two neighbouring lakes highlights limitations in the use of a reference lake approach in biomonitoring studies. The data in this study can be used and expanded upon to provide information for the sustainable management of these fish stocks for the future.

Characteristic intervals of TB propagation velocities in reservoirs for different depths and bottom inclinations are found. It is demonstrated that the main factor that affects the TB lifetime is the reservoir depth. The influence of the relative air humidity and solar radiation flux on the spring TB propagation velocity is estimated. Isolines of spacetime variability of the TB location in the water area of the reservoir are constructed using the simulations and the quantitative parameters of Lake Ladoga bottom relief. Satisfactory agreement between the simulated data and the field observations is achieved.																			0027-1349	1934-8460				JAN	2019	74	1					64	69		10.3103/S0027134919010065	http://dx.doi.org/10.3103/S0027134919010065													WOS:000466899000010

In the open ocean, algorithms can accurately estimate the surface POC concentration. However, no suitable POC-estimation algorithm based on MERIS bands is available for inland turbid eutrophic water. A total of 228 field samples were collected from Lake Taihu in different seasons between 2013 and 2015. At each site, the optical parameters and water quality were analyzed. Using in situ data, it was found that POC-estimation algorithms developed for the open ocean and coastal waters using remote sensing reflectance were not suitable for inland turbid eutrophic water. The organic suspended matter (OSM) concentration was found to be the best indicator of the POC concentration, and POC has an exponential relationship with the OSM concentration. Through an analysis of the POC concentration and optical parameters, it was found that the absorption peak of total suspended matter (TSM) at 665 nm was the optimum parameter to estimate POC. As a result, MERIS band 7, MERIS band 10 and MERIS band 12 were used to derive the absorption coefficient of TSM at 665 nm, and then, a semi-analytical algorithm was used to estimate the POC concentration for inland turbid eutrophic water. An accuracy assessment showed that the developed semi-analytical algorithm could be successfully applied with a MAPE of 31.82% and RMSE of 2.68 mg/L. The developed algorithm was successfully applied to a MERIS image, and two full-resolution MERIS images, acquired on August 13, 2010, and December 7, 2010, were used to map the POC spatial distribution in Lake Taihu in summer and winter.

A total of 222 Piping Plovers was observed on the Atlantic Coast (about 14% of the entire Atlantic Coast breeding population) and 1508 on the Gulf Coast (about 56% of the entire Great Lakes/Northern Great Plains breeding population). Highest Atlantic Coast estimates occurred in Georgia (N = 105; 47.5%), whereas the most plovers on the Gulf Coast occurred in Texas (N = 834; 55.3%). The survey included 1422 km of barrier beach on the Atlantic Coast (69% of the coast) and 1283 km on the Gulf Coast (50% of the coast). The greatest potential for locating more plovers in the United States is in South Carolina and Louisiana. However, a large percentage of the North American breeding population (particularly on the Atlantic Coast) probably winters outside the United States, thus future surveys should explore the Caribbean and Mexico.																			0043-5643					SEP	1990	102	3					400	412																WOS:A1990DY24700003
J	Gessner, MO				Gessner, MO			Mass loss, fungal colonisation and nutrient dynamics of Phragmites australis leaves during senescence and early aerial decay	AQUATIC BOTANY												This study examined the mass loss, fungal biomass, and nutrient dynamics of standing Phragmites australis leaf blades during senescence and early decay in littoral reed stands of two hardwater lakes. Green living leaves were tagged at defined canopy heights in early autumn (late August or early September) and periodically collected until all leaf blades had fallen off the parent shoot. Samples were analysed for leaf dry mass remaining, fungal biomass associated with leaves (ergosterol concentrations), and nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. Considerable mass loss of leaves occurred in the standing position (up to 28%). Nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations of leaves decreased substantially with time (by 39-77%), indicating that a major portion of these nutrients was translocated to the rhizome during senescence. Fungal biomass associated with leaves increased during the study period, reaching an estimated maximum of about 40 mg g(-1) of leaf dry mass. Fungal biomass was negatively correlated with leaf N and P concentrations. The observed patterns of leaf mass loss, nutrient dynamics, and fungal biomass were consistent with the successive senescence and death of leaves from the shoot base to its tip. The results of this study point to a notable mass loss of P. australis leaf blades in the standing position, which appears to be mediated by both plant and microbial processes. Nutrient dynamics, in contrast, appear to be largely governed by plant processes. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Highest number of species was present in pre-monsoon (29) and lowest in winter (23). Members of Chlorophyceae were present in a reasonable number throughout the year while being most abundant in pre-monsoon and monsoon. Bacillariophycae and Cyanophyceae populations did not show much seasonal variation. Percentage composition of Euglenophyceae showed clear seasonal change, being most dominant in post monsoon, moderate in pre-monsoon and winter and nearly absent in monsoon. Total phytoplankton density showed highly significant positive correlation with transparency (p < 0.01) and significant positive correlation with total suspended solids, total hardness and calcium (p < 0.05). Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H') value (2.66) was found to be the highest during pre-monsoon while the highest evenness (J') value (0.89) was recorded during winter Berger-Parker index of dominance (0.45) was highest in post-monsoon. Our study revealed that the growth of phytoplankton is governed by transparency, total suspended solids, calcium and total hardness. These types of studies are prerequisites for evolving fish culture programmes and management of water resources.																			0254-8704					NOV	2009	30	6					1007	1012											20329397					WOS:000271875700014

Withdrawal in excess of 10% of available under-ice volume can threaten fish habitat or other users. The Land and Water Boards (LWBs) of the Mackenzie Valley require water licences for water withdrawal beyond regulated thresholds. Applicants must provide information including identification and location of proposed water sources, timing and proposed volume of water and winter water withdrawal must be limited to <10% of available volume to protect fish habitat under the ice. Many applicants are at early project stages and the necessary information on bathymetry and volumes of water is not readily available or requires expertise and effort that may not be feasible at the early stages of smaller projects. This paper describes the alternative method for determining available winter water volumes from lakes to support small-scale projects. A simple formula of 'allowable volume (m(3)) = surface area (m(2)) * 0.1 m' was developed and tested to provide a conservative estimate of under-ice volumes from easily available data which is protective in spite of uncertainties inherent in limited data.					; Hutchinson, Neil/I-2306-2012	Walbourne, Rick/0000-0001-7008-7138; 													1998-9563	2224-7955				NOV	2023	54	11					1344	1356		10.2166/nh.2023.032	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/nh.2023.032		OCT 2023											WOS:001084330300001

Lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, harvested through the ice by spearfishers in the LakeWinnebago system in Wisconsin may bear silver lampreys or fresh lamprey wounds, and sturgeon with lamprey marks were significantly larger than sturgeon without them. Silver lampreys collected on paddlefish, Polyodon spathula, in the Wisconsin River in March were not significantly longer than silver lampreys collected previously in late October, but they were significantly heavier, an indication that they were feeding to at least some extent during the intervening period. Other large fish species, including northern pike, Esox lucius, and flathead catfish, Pylodictus olivaris, have been collected or observed during the winter with silver or chestnut lampreys attached. Although energy and nutrient intake by parasitic lampreys may be reduced during the winter, lampreys attached to hosts may also benefit from the hosts' mobility and ability to avoid potentially harmful situations.																			0378-1909					SEP	2003	68	1					65	71		10.1023/A:1026008400049	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1026008400049													WOS:000185646800008

The varves comprise couplets of detrital and organic sub-layers throughout the complete time-span. Based on their microfacies and stratigraphical position within a varve as well as comparisons with local discharge and meteorological data, thicker detrital layers are interpreted to reflect intensified snow-melt floods following more humid winters. Detailed comparisons with monthly to annually resolved North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) indices back to AD 1049 (901 a BP) suggest that multidecadal increases in snow-melt layer thickness tend to be connected with a more positive phase of the NAO and, consequently, warmer winters. In contrast, distinct centennial intervals of thicker snow-melt layers from -40 to 170, 280 to 460 and 1900 to 2300 a BP as well as around 2600 a BP do not consistently correspond to a particular NAO phase, but coincide with extended sea-ice margins and a colder North Atlantic climate, causing intensified and southward shifted westerly cyclones. Our results point to a differential modification of North Atlantic winter hydroclimate working on varying time scales.

Twenty-six years (1990-2015) of monitoring annual recruitment of the invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) in the Rideau River, a small river system in Eastern Ontario, Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												We monitored the recruitment of young-of-year zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas, 1771)) each autumn at 13 locations within four river reaches along the length (100 km) of the Rideau River, starting in 1990, the year of its discovery in that river, until 2015. Sampling was conducted on bottom structures of locks or on seasonally exposed substrate during autumn drawdowns conducted by Rideau Canal staff. Twenty-six years of monitoring zebra mussels in that river revealed a distinct and persistent upstream-downstream pattern, with highest densities occurring in the two downstream reaches. A "lake effect" was observed at Long Reach, where veligers have ideal conditions for larval development. Highest densities occurred in the mid-1990s, comparable with those reported in the Laurentian Great Lakes during peak invasion (200 000 to 500 000+ mussels/m(2)). Although the most upstream reaches of the river had low recruitment rates and low densities initially (0.01 to 10 mussels/m(2)), annual recruitment progressively increased to higher values (10 to 1000+ mussels/m(2)) because more veligers from the Rideau Lakes and the river headwaters were produced and drifted into the system. This study is unique because it provides a thorough understanding of the 26 years of invasion history of the zebra mussel in a small river system.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				OCT	2018	96	10					1071	1079		10.1139/cjz-2017-0360	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2017-0360													WOS:000446903100001

Larval gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum), crappie (Pomoxis spp.), sunfish (Lepomis spp.), carp (Cyprinus carpio), and goldfish (Carassius auratus) were the most abundant taxa in samples, collectively comprising over 94% of the total catch during both 1984 and 1985. Gizzard shad and crappie were collected most often from open water areas of the marsh during both years of sampling. Cyprinids (carp and goldfish) and sunfish were collected primarily from artificially vegetated habitats, usually floating vegetation in 1984 and emergent vegetation in 1985. Water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and transparency, measured concurrently with sampling did not seem to directly influence larval distribution. Higher abundance of some species of larvae in the artificial vegetation may reflect both the use of vegetation as spawning substrate and increased availability of food or shelter. Additional data collected from nearby undiked wetlands would help determine the function of diked wetlands as spawning and nursery habitat in terms of their importance to Great Lakes fish populations.																			0277-5212					JUN	1991	11	1					123	138		10.1007/BF03160844	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03160844													WOS:A1991FT72300008
J	Ali, J; Cheng, LY				Ali, Jahangir; Cheng, Linyin			Temperature forecasts for the continental United States: a deep learning approach using multidimensional features	FRONTIERS IN CLIMATE												Accurate weather forecasts are critical for saving lives, emergency services, and future developments. Climate models such as numerical weather prediction models have made significant advancements in weather forecasts, but these models are computationally expensive and can be subject to inaccurate representations of complex natural interconnections. Alternatively, data-driven machine learning methods have provided new dimensions in assisting weather forecasts. In this study, we used convolutional neural networks (CNN) to assess how geopotential height at different levels of the troposphere may affect the predictability of extreme surface temperature (t2m) via two cases. Specifically, we analyzed temperature forecasts over the continental United States at lead times from 1 day to 30 days by incorporating z100, z200, z500, z700, and z925 hPa levels as inputs to the CNN. In the first case, we applied the framework to predict summer temperatures of 2012, which contributed to one of the extreme heatwave events in the U.S. history. The results show that z500 leads to t2m forecasts with relatively less root mean squared errors (RMSE) than other geopotential heights at most of the lead time under consideration, while the inclusion of more atmospheric pressure levels improves t2m forecasts to a limited extent. At the same lead time, we also predicted the z500 patterns with different levels of geopotential height and temperature as the inputs. We found that the combination of z500, t2m, and t850 (temperature at 850 hPa) is associated with less RMSE for the z500 forecasts compared to other inputs. In contrast to the 2012 summer, our second case examined the wintertime temperature of 2014 when the upper Midwest and Great Lakes regions experienced the coldest winter on record. We found that z200 contributes to better t2m predictions for up to 7-days lead times whereas z925 gives better results for z500 forecasts during this cold event. Collectively, the results suggest that for long-range temperature forecasts based on the CNN, including various levels of geopotential heights could be beneficial.

Palaeoenvironmental reconstructions suggest that meromixis formed as a result of sea level rise prior to ca. 4000 cal. yr BP. Increased seawater inflow has progressively led to permanent water stratification, which caused the onset of anoxia, making the monimolimnion a harsh environment for biological life. Diatom floristic interpretations suggest a progressive upcore increase in salinity, which is paralleled by a reduction in cladocera remains. Diagenetic processes have not altered the sediment organic matter signature. Organic matter mainly derives from freshwater DOC and appears to be linked to the presence of peat bogs in the catchment as confirmed by the C/N ratio. Upcore variations in the C/N ratio with a ca. 800-year periodicity have been interpreted as the result of alternating dry and wet climatic phases during the late Holocene, which appear synchronous with the NAO and long-term solar cycles. The current hydrology is largely controlled by freshwater inflow, which determines permanent meromictic conditions. Overturns are rare, requiring a specific combination of factors such as exceptionally dry and warm summers followed by cool autumns. According to the climate projections for the next century in Ireland, permanent meromictic conditions will probably continue. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J	REY, P; ECKMANN, R				REY, P; ECKMANN, R			THE INFLUENCE OF LAKE TEMPERATURE ON GROWTH OF COREGONUS-LAVARETUS L LARVAE	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Larval coregonids were sampled in Lake Constance [Western Europe] in spring 1986. Length-frequency analysis revealed two growth phases: a period of slow growth lasting until the end of April, followed by a period of accelerated growth. The beginning of the second period coincided precisely with a drastic increase of surface water temperature and with a rise of zooplankton abundance. However, temperature is considered to be the trigger for onset of coregonid larval growth in Lake Constance. Otolith increments were not discernible prior to the beginning of thermal stratification, but thereafter daily growth rates could be calculated from otolith ring widths. Two groups of larvae could be distinguished: slowly growing specimens (low contrast rings of narrow width), and fast growing specimens (high contrast rings of increasing width). We suggest the first group comprised those larvae which were too weak to benefit from the improved conditions, and that an earlier onset of thermal stratification would possibly reduce the number of larvae falling into this group. The second group would definitely benefit from earlier thermal stratification because early onset of growth would reduce both predation risk and competition and, thus, improve their survival rate. These results support out concept of temperature influence on year-class strength of coregonids in Lake Constance.																			0003-9136					AUG	1989	116	2					181	190																WOS:A1989AM67200003

Range-Wide Piping Plover Survival: Correlated Patterns and Temporal Declines	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Geographically isolated breeding populations of migratory shorebirds may be demographically connected through shared nonbreeding habitats. We used long-term (1998-2008) mark-recapture data on piping plovers (Charadrius melodus) collected from 7 separate studies located throughout North America to conduct a range-wide analysis of after hatch year apparent survival (Phi(AHY)). Our objectives were to compare concurrent survival estimates from disparate breeding sites and determine whether estimates followed similar trends or were correlated among breeding populations with shared wintering grounds. Average survival estimates were higher for Great Plains populations (range 5 0.69-0.81) than for Great Lakes and Atlantic Coast populations (range = 0.56-0.71). Linear trend models indicated that apparent survival declined in 4 out of 7 populations, was unchanged in 3, and was generally highest among Great Plains populations. Based on a post hoc analysis, we found evidence of correlated year-to-year fluctuations in annual survival among populations wintering primarily along the southeastern United States Atlantic Coast and Gulf Coast. Our results indicate shared overwintering or stopover sites may influence annual variation in survival among geographically disparate breeding populations. Declines in piping plover survival are a cause for concern, and our results highlight the need for conservation efforts to include habitat used during the migratory and wintering periods.					; Cohen, Jonathan/ITW-1154-2023	Cohen, Jonathan/0000-0001-7075-077X; Catlin, Daniel/0000-0003-4637-0384; Fraser, James/0000-0002-8653-1333													0022-541X	1937-2817				NOV	2010	74	8					1784	1791		10.2193/2009-446	http://dx.doi.org/10.2193/2009-446													WOS:000284107000018
J	COMBRINK, S				COMBRINK, S			THE ZOOPLANKTON OF ZEEKOEVLEI AND PRINCESS-VLEI (WESTERN CAPE) - A PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT	WATER SA												This paper provides a 3-year record of the zooplankton composition and seasonality in Zeekoevlei and Princess Vlei, 2 coastal lakes situated on the Cape Flats of the Cape Peninsula, South Africa. Zeekoevlei (256 ha) is a poorly flushed, shallow hyper-eutrophic lake dominated year-round by cyanophyte algal species with underlying diatom and chlorophyte assemblages. Princess Vlei is smaller (35 ha), shallow and eutrophic with significant hydraulic flushing during winter resulting in a clear water phase. The zooplankton composition and relative abundance in Zeekoevlei and Princess Vlei were similar. In both lakes copepods contributed most to the total zooplankton standing stock. In Princess Vlei this was enhanced by the presence of the calanoid copepods Metadiaptomus purcelli and Lovenula simplex during the winter clear water phase. Cladocerans were poorly represented and present in low numbers in both lakes. It appears that the abundance of zooplankton in Zeekoevlei is controlled by factors other than phytoplankton resource availability. In Princess Vlei low algal densities during the winter clear water phase appear to be advantageous to filter-feeders such as Daphnia spp. as well as calanoid copepods.																			0378-4738					OCT	1994	20	4					299	306																WOS:A1994PP91700005

Surface water connectivity drives richness and composition of Arctic lake fish assemblages	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Surface water connectivity can influence the richness and composition of fish assemblages, particularly in harsh environments where colonisation factors and access to seasonal refugia are required for species persistence. Studies regarding influence of connectivity on Arctic fish distributions are limited and are rarely applied to whole assemblage patterns. To increase our understanding of how surface water connectivity and related hydrologic variables influence assemblage patterns, we investigated species richness and composition of Arctic lake fishes over a large region, 8500km(2), of the central Arctic Coastal Plain, Alaska. We collected fish presence/non-detection data from 102 lakes and used a hierarchical multispecies occupancy framework to derive species richness and inform species composition patterns. Our mean estimate of regional richness was 12.3 (SD 0.5) species. Presence of a permanent channel connection was an overriding factor affecting species richness (mean 3.6, 95% CI 3.1-4.9), presumably driving lake colonisation potential. In lakes without a permanent channel connection, data suggest richness (mean 2.0, 95% CI 1.7-3.3) increased with the availability of in-lake winter refugia and with the potential of ephemeral connections during spring floods. Fish species functional traits and environmental faunal filters contributed to patterns of richness and assemblage composition. Composition corresponded with richness in a coherent manner, where each successive level of richness contained several discrete assemblages that showed similar responses to the environment. Lakes with permanent channel connections contained both widespread and restricted species, while the species-poor lakes that lacked a connection contained mainly widespread species. This work provides useful baseline information on the processes that drive the relations between patch connectivity and fish species richness and assemblage composition. The environmental processes that organise fish assemblages in Arctic lakes are likely to change in a warming climate.					; Koch, Joshua/MZS-1086-2025; Rosenberger, Amanda/R-9578-2018	Zimmerman, Christian/0000-0002-3646-0688; Rosenberger, Amanda/0000-0002-5520-8349													0046-5070	1365-2427				JUL	2016	61	7					1090	1104		10.1111/fwb.12769	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12769													WOS:000377223300005

Evidence for the enhanced lability of dissolved organic matter following permafrost slope disturbance in the Canadian High Arctic	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Arctic landscapes are believed to be highly sensitive to climate change and accelerated disturbance of permafrost is expected to significantly impact the rate of carbon cycling. While half the global soil organic matter (SOM) is estimated to reside in Arctic soils, projected warmer temperatures and permafrost disturbance will release much of this SOM into waterways in the form of dissolved organic matter (DOM). The spring thaw and subsequent flushing of soils releases the highest contributions of DOM annually but has historically been undersampled due to the difficulties of sampling during this period. In this study, passive samplers were placed throughout paired High Arctic watersheds during the duration of the 2008 spring flush in Nunavut, Canada. The watersheds are very similar with the exception of widespread active layer detachments (ALDs) that occurred within one of the catchments during a period of elevated temperatures in the summer of 2007. DOM samples were analyzed for structural and spectral characteristics via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and fluorescence spectroscopy as well as vulnerability to degradation with simulated solar exposure. Lignin-derived phenols were further assessed utilizing copper(II) oxide (CuO) oxidation and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The samples were found to have very low dissolved lignin phenol content (similar to 0.07% of DOC) and appear to originate from primarily non-woody angiosperm vegetation. The acid/aldehyde ratios for dissolved vanillyl phenols were found to be high (up to 3.6), indicating the presence of highly oxidized lignin. Differences between DOM released from the ALD vs. the undisturbed watershed suggest that these shallow detachment slides have significantly impacted the quality of Arctic DOM. Although material released from the disturbed catchment was found to be highly oxidized, DOM in the lake into which this catchment drained had chemical characteristics indicating high contributions from microbial and/or primary productivity. The resulting pool of dissolved carbon within the lake appears to be more biologically- and photochemically-labile than material from the undisturbed system. These disturbances may have implications for projected climate warming; sustained elevated temperatures would likely perpetuate widespread ALDs and further affect carbon cycling in this environment.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the applicability of the test system to investigate biofilms and to rank the results of the biofilm and sediment sampling sites with regard to embryotoxic and genotoxic effects. We demonstrated that the zebrafish embryo toxicity test in combination with the comet assay with embryo primary cells is a tool that can basically be applied for investigating the bioavailable toxic potential of native biofilms. By ranking the results for embryo toxicity and genotoxicity, we found clear differences in the toxic potential of the biofilm from different sewage system sections. Significant genotoxicity was determined in all biofilm samples and the sediments revealed a lower genotoxic potential upstream of the SIP discharge compared to samples downstream and directly at the discharge. Temporal variability from samplings in autumn and spring were found for two of the five biofilm and for one of the three sediment samples. Based on the results of our study we suggest that ecotoxicological bioassays (such as the embryo toxicity test and comet assay with zebrafish) using biofilm can be a useful tool to assess (waste) water quality.

J	McKinley, S; Van Der Kraak, G; Power, G				McKinley, S; Van Der Kraak, G; Power, G			Seasonal migrations and reproductive patterns in the lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, in the vicinity of hydroelectric stations in northern Ontario	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												This study was conducted in order to evaluate seasonal migratory behaviour and reproductive pattern of lake sturgeon in a confined region of the Mattagami River system in northern Ontario where river flow is regulated by hydroelectric works. Radio tracking and the systematic sampling of lake sturgeon using gill nets indicated that the distribution of fish throughout the study site varied on a seasonal basis. This distribution was related to the migration of individuals to potential spawning sites in the spring, a post-spawning dispersal to feeding areas and late summer migration to an area of concentration on the Groundhog River which is a tributary of the Mattagami River. There was a high proportion of fish (about 50%), within the size range of reproductively active fish, found in the vicinity of suitable spawning habitat during early May. Measurement of the gonadosomatic index (GSI) and plasma sex steroid hormone levels revealed a divergent pattern of reproductive development between the sexes. Female sturgeon exhibited a prolonged period of ovarian regression following spawning. Resumption of ovarian development was not evident until September and was characterized by an increased GSI and plasma levels of testosterone and 17 beta-estradiol. In contrast, male lake sturgeon began testicular recrudescence within one month of spawning with the GSI reaching prespawning levels by September; reproductive hormones were at prespawning levels by the end of June. It seems that hydroelectric works has complex effects on sturgeon in the Mattagami system. The extensive migratory behaviour of lake sturgeon within the study area make it prone to impingement or entrainment whereas the altered river now appears to enhance reproductive development.																			0378-1909					MAR	1998	51	3					245	256		10.1023/A:1007493028238	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1007493028238													WOS:000072605800002

Microbes have been recognized as important symbionts to regulate host life. The animal gut harbors abundance and diverse bacteria. Numerous internal and external factors influence intestinal bacterial communities, including diet, seasonal fluctuations and habitat sites. However, the factors that influence the gut bacterial communities of wild bird is poorly characterized. Methods. By high-throughput sequencing and statistical analysis, we investigated the variations in gut bacterial communities of the hooded cranes at three wintering stages in Caizi (CZL) and Shengjin Lake (SJL), which are two shallow lakes in the middle and lower Yangtze River floodplain. Results. Our results revealed significant differences in gut bacterial community structure and diversity among different sampling sites and wintering stages. Seasonal changes have a significant impact on the gut microbe composition of hooded cranes in the two lakes. ANOSIM analysis demonstrated that the samples in CZL had greater differences in the gut bacterial composition than that in SJL. Our data showed strong evidence that the host's gut filtering might be an important factor in shaping bacterial community according to mean nearest taxon distance (MNTD). The PICRUSt analysis showed that the predicted metagenomes associated with the gut microbiome were carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism and energy metabolism over the entire wintering period at the two lakes. Conclusions. The results demonstrated that both seasonal changes and habitat sites have significant impact on the gut bacterial communities of hooded cranes. In addition, predictive function of gut microbes in hooded cranes varied over time. These results provide new insights into the gut microbial community of the cranes, which serves as a foundation for future studies.

The samples included a gradient of salinities ranging from 4270 mg Cl L-1 (Saline Spring) to 239 mg Cl L-1 (Lake Kinneret). Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and cloning of the 16 S rRNA gene, as well as cloning and sequencing of the psbA gene, were used to characterize cyanobacterial community composition. Despite the differences in salinity, similar cyanobacterial communities were observed in the lake and the saline spring, the only exception being the highest salinity sample (4270 mg Cl L-1). Both, DGGE patterns and results of the clone libraries revealed the dominance of cyanobacteria with colonial Gloeocapsa and unicellular Synechococcus as the closest known cultured relatives, independently of the salinity. These results suggest that cyanobacterial populations inhabiting this freshwater lake and its saline sources can adapt to a wide range of salinities.

The seasonal range of the contaminants' concentrations in water and sediment samples in spring season were Sigma PBDE 329 +/- 48.3 ng/L (25.32-785 ng/L) and Sigma PBDE 4.19 +/- 0.35 ng/g dw (1.91-6.57 ng/g), but Sigma PBDE 62.1 +/- 1.50 ng/L (30.1-110 ng/L) and Sigma PBDE 65.4 +/- 15.9 ng/g dw (1.98-235 ng/g) in summer, respectively. NH1 (first sampling point) was the most contaminated site with PBDE in the Estuary. The potential source of pollution is attributed to the stormwater runoff from a creek emptying directly into the Estuary. This study's dominant PBDE congener is BDE-17, ranging from below detection limit to 247 ng/L and 0.14-32.1 ng/g in water and sediment samples, respectively. Most detected at all the sites were BDE-17, 47, 66, and 100. Most BDE-153 and 183 are found in sediment in agreement with the fact that higher brominated congeners of PBDE adsorb to solid materials. There was no correlation between the congeners and organic carbon and organic matter. However, the human health risk assessment conducted revealed that the PBDE concentration detected in the estuary poses a low eco-toxicological risk. Nevertheless, constant monitoring should be ensured to see that the river remains safe for the users, as it serves as a form of recreation to the public and a catchment to some neighbourhoods.

Amongst these deserts, those proximal to the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) are especially important because of their role as sediment source areas. In order to investigate the formation history of the Badain Jaran Desert, the largest desert proximal to the CLP, a 310 m-long drill core was obtained from the desert centre, which reached the underlying basement rock. The lithology of the core consists of an upper layer of aeolian sand, with three intercalated layers of lacustrine sediments, overlying alluvial/fluvial deposits which are developed unconformably over red-coloured basement rock. A geological survey indicates that the lower red-coloured basement rock is of late Cretaceous age, and is cut by a Mesozoic erosion surface widely developed over the Badain Jaran area. On the basis of optically stimulated luminescence and electron spin resonance dating, and stratigraphic correlation, a preliminary chronological framework was established which was improved by tuning the aeolian sand proportion of the drill core to Earth orbital obliquity and precession. This final chronology suggests that: 1) the basal age of the desert strata is at least similar to 1100 ka, corresponding to the formation of the Badain Jaran Desert; and 2) that the formation of the erosion surface terminated and the surface had begun to subside by at least similar to 1200 ka. The formation of the desert can be summarized as follows: the alluvial/fluvial fan formed by the Heihe River draining the Qilian Mountains provided sufficient sedimentary material to form the desert under an arid climate, while the Asian winter monsoon and the Westerlies entrained the clastic sediments from the fan area which finally accumulated downwind. More distant sediment transport was prevented by the intervening mountainous terrain. These coupled processes were driven by Tibetan Plateau uplift and ongoing global climatic cooling. After initial formation of the-desert, three humid phases occurred, in MIS 13-15, MIS 5 and the Holocene, during which extensive lakes developed. The sequential drying out of the lakes may reflect inter-relationships between global climate and the intensity of the Asian summer monsoon and the Westerlies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Results confirmed that an early run entered the river in May and June and spawned in tributaries, and a late run entered the river from late June through Aug. and spawned in the main stem. Spawning peaked during Aug. in tributaries influenced by lakes, but during July in other tributaries. Lakes may have increased fall and winter temperatures of downstream waters, enabling successful reproduction for later spawning fish within these tributaries. This hypothesis assumes that hatching and emergence can be completed in a shorter time in lake-influenced waters. The time of upstream migration and spawning (mid-to late Aug.) of the late run is unique among chinook stocks in Cook Inlet. This behavior may have developed only because 2 large lakes (Kenai and Skilak) directly influence the main-steam Kenai River. If run timing is genetically controlled, and if the various components of the 2 runs are isolated stocks that have adapted to predictable stream temperatures, there are implications for stock transplantation programs and for any activities of man that alter stream temperatures.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1985	42	4					693	700		10.1139/f85-089	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f85-089													WOS:A1985AHD5400007

In inland waters, both nutrient loading from watersheds and warmer conditions promote phytoplankton growth and cause extensive cyanobacterial blooms. Certain bloom-forming cyanobacterial species can pose a health risk to humans and aquatic ecosystems through cyanotoxin production. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cyanobacterial composition and toxins in five reservoirs and two natural lakes in the Kucuk Menderes River Basin, all with varying trophic statuses. Within this scope, samples were collected in autumn 2017 and spring 2018. Cyanobacterial species were enumerated according to the Utermohl method. Cyanotoxin samples were analyzed using HPLC. To find the trophic status of the water bodies, the Trophic State Index (TSI) developed by Carlson (1977) was used and Total Phosphorus (TP), Secchi Depth (SD), and Chlorophyll-a (chl-a) measurements were performed. Cyanobacterial abundance, species composition, and cyanotoxin production differed significantly between the lakes and reservoirs. A total of 13 cyanobacteria species were identified including potential cyanotoxin producers such as Microcystis, Aphanizomenon, and Dolichospermum. According to the TSI, three reservoirs were mesotrophic and the other four waterbodies had eutrophic-hypereutrophic conditions. Microcystis is the most common bloom-forming freshwater cyanobacteria in the Kucuk Menderes River Basin. However, microcystin concentrations were relatively low and the highest microcystin concentration was detected in the Tahtali Reservoir at 9 mu g/L. The Kucuk Menderes River Basin is under water-stressed conditions and the cyanobacteria blooms in the region might pose another threat for wildlife and humans.					, reyhan/AAB-8612-2020; , merbay/AAB-9694-2020; Oğuz, Ayça/AAA-4929-2020; köker, latife/AAB-7634-2020; Oguz, Ayca/AAA-4929-2020	Oguz, Ayca/0000-0002-0711-2967														2602-473X					2022	37	3					129	136		10.26650/ASE20221088270	http://dx.doi.org/10.26650/ASE20221088270													WOS:000825204100002

This study introduces a novel model approach using 150 yr of limnological and paleolimnological data to evaluate the anthropogenic impacts on deep oxygen in Lake Geneva. Results highlight an increase in oxygen consumption rates due to cultural eutrophication, initially triggering historical hypoxia, subsequently exacerbated by reduced winter mixing induced by climate change. Simulations of pre-eutrophication conditions and future climate scenarios define safe operating spaces for the lake to thrive without severe hypoxia risk. Complete winter mixing and O(2 )recharge once every 3 yr can compensate the oxygen demand in Lake Geneva, even when exceeding 1.5 g O(2 )m(-2) d(-1). However, when complete winter mixing becomes less frequent, even consumption rates similar to those observed before eutrophication can cause persistent hypoxia, posing a significant threat to the survival of hypolimnetic aquatic life.

Analysis of the in-situ backscattering coefficients of the suspended particles (b(bp)) indicates that the accuracy becomes worse when the concentration of TSM (C-TSM) is higher than 20 mg/l. The accuracy of the b(bp) is improved by using a bio-optical model in which b(bp) is optimized with a non-linear least-square Levenberg-Marquardt method. The remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) is obtained by means of the optimization. The optimized R-rs for waters with C-TSM higher than 20 mg/l, together with the measured R-rs for waters with C-TSM lower than 20 mg/l, are used to establish the relationships between R-rs (748), R-rs (869) and R-rs (645), which are used in the iterative method for atmospheric correction. Two atmospheric correction algorithms are switched according to the water turbidity. The shortwave infrared wavelengths (SWIR) method is used for waters with high-turbidity, and the iterative method is used otherwise. Results of the atmospheric correction were then applied to the Tassan model modified in this paper to compute the C-TSM. Comparison between the retrieval results from MODIS imagery and the in-situ measurements indicates that the algorithms described in this paper can provide a reliable estimation of the C-TSM distributions in the YS and ECS.

Iron cycling and isotopic fractionation in a ferruginous, seasonally ice-covered lake	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Ferruginous conditions, defined by anoxia and abundant dissolved ferrous iron (Fe-aq(2+)), dominated the Precambrian oceans but are essentially non-existent in a modern, oxygenated world. Ferruginous meromictic lakes represent natural laboratories to ground truth our understanding of the stable Fe isotope proxy, which has been used extensively in interpreting the origins of Fe-rich sedimentary rocks like iron formations (IFs) and the interactions of early life with high-Fe-aq(2+) conditions. Here we report comprehensive geochemical and Fe isotopic analyses of samples collected in May and August 2022, and March 2023, from Deming Lake, Minnesota, a ferruginous meromictic lake that undergoes surface freezing in winter and never becomes euxinic. Through chemical and Fe isotopic analyses of different putative Fe sources to Deming Lake; including eolian input trapped in winter ice cover, nearby bogs, and regional groundwaters sampled at surface springs; we find that a groundwater source provides the best chemical and Fe isotopic match for Deming Lake and can support Fe-aq(2+)-rich waters at depth that maintain a permanent chemocline at 12 m. The ice-free Deming Lake water column can be split into three layers dominated by distinct Fe cycling regimes. Layer (I) extends from the lake surface to the base of the oxycline at 6 m, and its Fe cycling is dominated by isotopically light Fe uptake into biomass, likely from stabilized dissolved Fe3+, with variable eolian lithogenic influences. Layer (II) extends between the oxycline and the chemocline at 12 m and is dominated by partial Fe-aq(2+) oxidation on approach to the oxycline, with the formation of variably isotopically heavy Fe3+-bearing particles. Layer (III) underlies the chemocline and is defined by Fe2+ phosphate (vivianite) and carbonate saturation and precipitation under anoxic, Fe-aq(2+)-rich conditions with little Fe isotopic fractionation. The ice-covered winter water column features more homogenous Fe chemistry above the chemocline, which we attribute to seasonal homogenization of Layers (I) and (II), with suppressed ferric particle formation. Authigenic Fe minerals with non-crustal (light) Fe isotopic compositions only appreciably accumulate in sediments in Deming Lake underlying the chemocline. All sediments deposited above 12 m appear crustal in their Fe isotopic, Mn/Fe, and Fe/Al ratios, likely revealing efficient reductive dissolution of Fe3+-bearing lake precipitates and remineralization of Fe-bearing biomass. We find limited fractionation of Fe isotopes in the ice-covered water column and suggest this provides evidence that substantial delivery of oxidants is required to generate highly fractionated Fe isotopic compositions in Sturtian Snowball era IFs. By comparing Fe isotopic and Mn/Fe fractionation trends in the different Deming Lake layers, we also suggest that correlations between these two parameters in giant early Paleoproterozoic IFs requires the simultaneous deposition of multiple authigenic phases on the ancient seafloor. Finally, high-precision triple Fe isotopic analyses of dissolved Fe impacted by extensive oxidation near the Deming Lake oxycline reveal that the slope of the mass fractionation law for natural, O-2-mediated Fe-aq(2+) oxidation is identical to those previously defined for both UV photo-oxidation, and for an array of highly fractionated Paleoproterozoic IFs.

J	Nachtigall, S; Heim, C				Nachtigall, Solveig; Heim, Christine			Monitoring the Efficiency of a Catchment Restoration to Further Reduce Nutrients and Sediment Input into a Eutrophic Lake	WATER												The restoration of eutrophic river and lake ecosystems is an important task that has been conducted in numerous ways and at many locations around the world. However, such improvements of water quality are often temporary, as such ecosystems are dynamic, and restoration measures must be reassessed and modified. The restored catchment of a shallow eutrophic lake, Lake Seeburg, in central Germany, was monitored over a 13-month period. The restoration of the inflowing river a decade earlier included riverbed prolongation, gradient reduction, and the construction of wetlands upstream, which reduced the sediment input and silting up of the lake. As nutrient fluxes in the tributaries were still high, these restoration measures seemed to be insufficiently effective. This study aimed to locate nutrient hotspots and quantify the nutrient balances of the catchment. Nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations, river discharge, hydrochemical parameters (pH, temperature, oxygen concentrations) and turbidity, as a proxy for suspended particulate matter (SPM), were monitored monthly. Our data show that the lake functions as a nitrogen sink, whereas the phosphorous fluxes follow a seasonal trend with the negative balance in winter turning into a positive balance in summer with the onset of cyanobacterial blooms. The release of phosphorous from the wetland throughout the year indicates supersaturation and thus a permanent input of phosphorous into the lake. Consequently, phosphorus loading in the lake is quite high, fostering eutrophication. Furthermore, the very low precipitation rates during the study highlighted that the lake was not only controlled by external nutrient loads but rather was sustained by high internal phosphorous loading. Consequently, the remediation action of creating the wetland to restore the sedimentation trap and nutrient accumulation capacity was not sufficient.					; Heim, Christine/ABH-5629-2020	Heim, Christine/0000-0003-4716-9316; 														2073-4441				NOV	2023	15	21							3794	10.3390/w15213794	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15213794													WOS:001100193200001

Although between-year variation has been monitored, seldom has it been assessed rigorously by appropriate multifactorial analysis with potentially confounding factors taken into account. In this study we tested the null hypothesis that despite seasonal, host age and sex effects, helminth communities should show relative stability between years. Over a period of 3 years (1998-2000) we sampled bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) populations (total n = 250) at 2 points in the year: in spring, at the start of the breeding season, and in autumn, after the cessation of breeding. In spite of seasonal differences and strong age effects, the between-year effects were surprisingly small. Measures of component community structure (Berger-Parker dominance index, the dominant species, S. petrusewiczi) did not vary, or varied only slightly from year to year. The majority of measures of infracommunity structure [Brillouin's index of diversity, prevalence of all helminths combined, prevalence and abundance of H. mixtum (the most prevalent helminth), mean species richness] did not differ significantly between years when other factors such as age, sex and seasonal variation had been taken into account. Some between-year variations were found (at the component community level, Simpson's index of diversity; at the infracommunity level, prevalence and abundance of S. petrusewiczi and abundance of all helminths combined), but even these were modest in comparison to seasonal and age differences, and were primarily attributable to S. petrusewiczi. We conclude that despite dynamic within-year fluctuations, helminth communities in bank voles in this region of Poland show relative stability across years. The sporadic occurrence of individual platyhelminths at low prevalence, makes little difference to the overall structure, which is largely maintained by the key roles played by the dominant intestinal nematodes of bank voles and the rarer species collectively.					; Pawelczyk, Agnieszka/M-4934-2018; Behnke, Jerzy/L-6176-2015; Pawełczyk, Agnieszka/M-4934-2018	Bajer, Anna/0000-0001-6199-8458; Pawelczyk, Agnieszka/0000-0001-9336-8258; 													0031-1820	1469-8161				FEB	2005	130		2				213	228		10.1017/S0031182004006389	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0031182004006389								15727071					WOS:000227434200009

However, information on waterbirds coexistence in the entirely landlocked freshwater system of Poyang Lake is not well understood, especially when the available biomass of their food in the area decreases. In this study, we tested the ecological segregation mechanisms in the 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 wintering periods among eight herbivorous waterbirds (including the Siberian crane Grus leucogeranus, hooded crane Grus monacha, white-naped crane Grus vipio, common crane Grus grus, greater white-fronted goose Anser albifrons, bean goose Anser fabalis, swan goose Anser cygnoides, and tundra swan Cygnus columbianus) at Poyang Lake. Using field observations and species niche and foraging habitat selection models, we investigated the abundance, distribution, and food sources of these eight waterbird species to quantify and compare their habitat use and ecological niches. Our results showed that niche segregation among the waterbirds, with respect to food types, time, and spatial location, allow them to coexist and use similar resources. The water level gradually receded in the sub-lakes of the Poyang Lake, which could provide food sources and various habitats for wintering herbivorous waterbirds to coexist. We demonstrated that the differences in habitat use could mitigate interspecific competition, which may explain the mechanism whereby waterbirds of Poyang Lake coexist during the wintering period, despite considerable overlap in the dietary niches of herbivorous waterbirds.					; gao, bin/JYW-5418-2024	zhang, zhen/0000-0002-1173-9105; zhou, hongkang/0000-0001-5488-0275; 													2045-7758					DEC	2021	11	23					16835	16848		10.1002/ece3.8314	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.8314		NOV 2021						34938476					WOS:000718653400001
J	D'Amario, SC; Xenopoulos, MA				D'Amario, Sarah C.; Xenopoulos, Marguerite A.			Linking dissolved carbon dioxide to dissolved organic matter quality in streams	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Streams are typically supersaturated with carbon dioxide (CO2) thus playing a pivotal role in the global carbon cycle. To further our knowledge on stream CO2 dynamics, we tested the linkages between dissolved CO2 and dissolved organic matter quality during two time periods (spring and summer). We sampled 48 streams in Ontario, Canada that represent a range of catchment cropland cover (2-80 %), nutrients, dissolved organic carbon concentration (DOC), and dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality. For both sampling periods, DOM composition (quality) was found to be an important predictor of CO2 concentration in streams, more so than DOC concentration. In general, the more complex terrestrially-derived DOM was associated with elevated CO2 levels whereas microbial-like DOM had a poor relationship with CO2. The DOM characteristics associated with increased CO2 levels were related to wetlands rather than croplands. Nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) were also important predictors of CO2, however this relationship was not linear. Since the streams in the sampled network were of mixed land use, it appears that CO2 levels were affected by both land use types in a composite non-linear way. Overall, our findings suggest that DOM quality is a better predictor of stream CO2, however the relationship between DOM and CO2 is complicated by the presence of breakpoints in the data associated with non-linearity.																			0168-2563	1573-515X				NOV	2015	126	1-2					99	114		10.1007/s10533-015-0143-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-015-0143-y													WOS:000365868400007
J	Davies, JM; Nowlin, WH; Matthews, B; Mazumder, A				Davies, John-Mark; Nowlin, Weston H.; Matthews, Blake; Mazumder, Asit			Temporal discontinuity of nutrient limitation in plankton communities	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Ideas on how various measures of nutrient limitation relate to plankton biomass and species composition are re-examined. While long-term and multi-lake studies typically focus on determining overall biomass, seasonal studies are more focused toward understanding species composition. We use physiological assays to assess short-term nutrient deficiency of nitrogen and phosphorus in two moderately fertile lakes. While biomass in the lakes was considered to ultimately be limited by total phosphorus, nutrient assays were variable in time. Nutrient ratios (TN:TP, PN:PP, PC:PP and PC:PN) did not predict short-term deficiencies, notably that nitrogen deficiency occurred in these phosphorus-limited lakes. In one of our study lakes, there was a relaxation of phosphorus deficiency despite phosphate concentrations occurring below traditional detection limits. Following this period, there was an autumn bloom of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. This relationship corresponds with other studies that have found A. flos-aquae to be a poor competitor for phosphorus. In contrast, phosphorus deficiency remained high prior to the autumn diatom bloom in our other study lake. Deficiency measures remain an excellent means of assessing physiological status of plankton communities and provide greater insight into species compositional changes, especially when other potential indicators like dissolved nutrient concentrations are inconclusive. Regardless of the nutrient limitation indicator used for a given study, it is critical to consider the appropriate scale of the measure.

Populations of O. a. grahami were resident in pools at 42.8 degrees C and migrated into water reaching temperatures of 44.8 degrees C for short periods. The maximum respiration rates of mitochondria with pyruvate as substrate were 217 and 284natom0 mg(-1) mitochondrial proteinmin-l at 37 degrees C and 42 degrees C, respectively (Q(10) = 1.71). Fatty acyl carnitines (chain lengths C8, C12 and C16), malate and glutamate were oxidised at 70-80 % of the rate for pyruvate. In order to assess evolutionary temperature adaptation of maximum mitochondrial oxidative capacities, the rates of pyruvate and palmitoyl carnitine utilisation in red muscle mitochondria were measured from species living at other temperatures: Notothenia coriiceps from Antarctica(-1.5 to +1 degrees C); summer-caught Myoxocephalus scorpius from the North Sea (10-15 degrees C); and Oreochromis andersoni from African lakes and rivers (22-30 degrees C). State 3 respiration rates had Q(10) values in the range 1.8-2.7. At the lower lethal temperature of O. andersoni (12.5 degrees C), isolated mitochondria utilised pyruvate at a similar rate to mitochondria from N. coriiceps at 2.5 degrees C (30 natom O mg(-1) mitochondrial protein min(-1)). Rates of pyruvate oxidation by mitochondria from M. scorpius and N. coriiceps were similar and were higher at a given temperature than far O. andersoni. At their normal body temperature (-1.2 degrees C), mitochondria from the Antarctic fish oxidised pyruvate at 5.5% and palmitoyl-DL-carnitine at 8.8% of the rates of mitochondria from the hot-spring species at 42 degrees C. The results indicate only modest evolutionary adjustments in the maximal rates of mitochondrial respiration in fish living at different temperatures.

Despite their significance, there is a notable gap in research on protistan dynamics, particularly in the deeper strata of temperate lakes. This study aimed to address this gap by integrating protists into the well-described spring dynamics of & Rcaron;& iacute;mov reservoir, Czech Republic. Over a 2-month period covering transition from mixing to established stratification, we collected water samples from three reservoir depths (0.5, 10 and 30 m) with a frequency of up to three times per week. Microbial eukaryotic and prokaryotic communities were analysed using SSU rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and dominant protistan groups were enumerated by Catalysed Reporter Deposition-Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (CARD-FISH). Additionally, we collected samples for water chemistry, phyto- and zooplankton composition analyses.Results Following the rapid changes in environmental and biotic parameters during spring, protistan and bacterial communities displayed swift transitions from a homogeneous community to distinct strata-specific communities. A prevalence of auto- and mixotrophic protists dominated by cryptophytes was associated with spring algal bloom-specialized bacteria in the epilimnion. In contrast, the meta- and hypolimnion showcased a development of a protist community dominated by putative parasitic Perkinsozoa, detritus or particle-associated ciliates, cercozoans, telonemids and excavate protists (Kinetoplastida), co-occurring with bacteria associated with lake snow.Conclusions Our high-resolution sampling matching the typical doubling time of microbes along with the combined microscopic and molecular approach and inclusion of all main components of the microbial food web allowed us to unveil depth-specific populations' successions and interactions in a deep lentic ecosystem.

The distribution of in-lake PON did not show a seasonal trend. Total nitrogen input flux ranged from 1.23 to 4.83 g N m(-2) day(-1), 71-76% of which is nitrate while PON represents 6-10%. PON sedimentation rates ranged from 9 to 90 mg N m(-2) day(-1) and fluctuated on a seasonal basis, reaching a minimum in winter and early spring and a maximum after thermal turnover had occurred. 3. This fluctuation was not related to either autochthonous planktonic production or allochthonous inputs. Since charophyte populations in Colgada Lake underwent a seasonal pattern of growth and decomposition, and (15)delta N values of settling material peaked at the end of that decomposition process, we suggest that PON sedimentary flux could be partly driven by decomposed charophyte particles. 4. However, the picture of PON sedimentation in this lake was more complex than anticipated because water residence time partly explained PON variability, albeit with a I month lag. Water residence time explained 40% of the overall variance of yearly averaged PON sedimentary flux in a meta-analysis of 13 lakes worldwide. However, the factors such as phytoplankton composition, trophic structure, bottom communities, nutrient loading or productivity levels may also be influential on PON settling dynamics.					; Delgado Huertas, Antonio/F-6866-2011; Rodrigo, Maria/K-9079-2014; Rojo, Carmen/L-5358-2014	Delgado Huertas, Antonio/0000-0002-7240-1570; Rodrigo, Maria/0000-0003-4106-0643; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				DEC	2006	51	12					2228	2239		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01645.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01645.x													WOS:000242487400004

The Lake Mead region constitutes the eastern portion of this domain and has been the site of numerous mapping and detailed structural studies, which have led to several models explaining the complex faulting and folding of the region, as well as the tectonic drivers of this deformation. The syntectonic basin fill of the Oligocene-Miocene Horse Spring Formation records a considerable portion of this deformation. A more detailed understanding of the Horse Spring Formation is important to determining the deformation history of the area and to constraining regional tectonic reconstructions. In this study, we present results of detailed mapping and stratigraphic analyses of the Lower Horse Spring Formation in the Longwell Ridges area, Nevada. Detailed measured sections combined with 1:5,000 scale mapping allow us to recognize and document lithofacies and their detailed architecture within the Lower Horse Spring Formation and highlight the extreme lateral and vertical facies changes within this portion of the formation. New 40Ar/39Ar ages and volcanic ash geochemical data support these analyses. These data record deposition within a range of environments, including alluvial-fan, lacustrine, and fluvial settings. Deposition occurred within an asymmetric basin with a main bounding fault lying east of the modern Overton Arm of Lake Mead. Activity on this fault began around 17 Ma and increased significantly at ca. 15.5 Ma.

J	ENG, LL; DANIELS, RA				ENG, LL; DANIELS, RA			LIFE-HISTORY, DISTRIBUTION, AND STATUS OF PACIFASTACUS-FORTIS (DECAPODA, ASTACIDAE)	CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME												The life history and distribution of P. fortis were studied during 1978, 1979 and 1980. Crayfish were collected by snorkeling, then sexed, measured and returned to the water unharmed. Surveys supported earlier findings that P. fortis occurs only in the midreaches of Pit River and its tributaries in northeastern Shasta County, California [USA]. The preferred habitat of P. fortis is among rocks on clean, firm sand or gravel substrate in cool, spring-fed lakes and streams with relatively little annual temperature fluctuation. The sex ratio of P. fortis is approximately 1:1. Copulation and egg extrusion occur in the fall and young are released the following July. Fecundity is low with only 10-70 eggs extruded per female. The growing season for P. fortis is from April to October. P. fortis grows slowly, is only 8-10 mm total carapace length (TCL) at the end of the 1st growing season and probably does not reach reproductive maturity (at about 28 mm TCL) until its 5th yr. Circumstancial evidence suggests that P. fortis is a carnivore or browser rather than an omnivorous scavenger like P. leniusculus. P. fortis is nocturnal and tolerant of the proximity of other crayfish. Commensal oligochaetes (Branchiobdellidae) and ostracods (Entocytheridae) are common on P. fortis, P. fortis is threatened by competition with the exotic crayfishes, Orconectes virilis and P. leniusculus which are expanding their range within the area, agricultural and water development and an increasing human population. Because of these threats and its restricted distribution P. fortis was designated a rare species by the California Fish and Game Commission.																			0008-1078	2331-0405					1982	68	4					197	212																WOS:A1982QV94600001

Equilibrium line altitudes of alpine glaciers in Alaska suggest Last Glacial Maximum summer temperature was 2-5 <mml:msup>°</mml:msup>C lower than during the pre-industrial	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												The lack of continental ice sheets in Alaska during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 26-19 ka) has long been attributed to extensive aridity in the western Arctic. More recently, climate model outputs, a few isolated paleoclimate studies, and global paleoclimate synthesis products show mild summer temperature depressions in Alaska compared to much of the high northern latitudes. This suggests the importance of limited summer temperature depressions in controlling the relatively limited glacier growth during the LGM. To explore this further, we present a new statewide map of LGM alpine glacier equilibrium line altitudes (ELAs), LGM Delta ELAs (LGM ELA anomalies relative to the Little Ice Age, LIA), and Delta ELA-based estimates of temperature depressions across Alaska to assess paleoclimate conditions. We reconstructed paleoglacier surfaces in ArcGIS to calculate ELAs using an accumulation area ratio (AAR) of 0.58 and an area-altitude balance ratio (AABR) of 1.56. We calculated LGM ELAs (n= 480) in glaciated massifs in the state, excluding areas in southern Alaska that were covered by the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. The data show a trend of increasing ELAs from the southwest to the northeast during both the LGM and the LIA, indicating a consistent southern Bering Sea and northernmost Pacific Ocean precipitation source. Our LGM-LIA Delta ELAs from the Alaska Range, supported with limited LGM-LIA Delta ELAs from the Brooks Range and the Kigluaik Mountains, average to -355 +/- 176 m. This value is much greater than the global LGM average of ca. -1000 m. Using a range of atmospheric lapse rates, LGM-LIA Delta ELAs in Alaska translate to summer cooling of < 2-5 C-degrees. Our results are consistent with a growing number of local climate proxy reconstructions and global data assimilation syntheses that indicate mild summer temperature across Beringia during the LGM. Limited LGM summer temperature depressions could be explained by the influence of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets on atmospheric circulation.					; Evans, Stuart/HQY-9538-2023; briner, jason/JDM-4641-2023	Walcott, Caleb Kazunari/0000-0003-4754-9466; 													1814-9324	1814-9332				JAN 11	2024	20	1					91	106		10.5194/cp-20-91-2024	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-20-91-2024													WOS:001173381900001
J	Hren, MT; Sheldon, ND				Hren, Michael T.; Sheldon, Nathan D.			Temporal variations in lake water temperature: Paleoenvironmental implications of lake carbonate δ18O and temperature records	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												delta O-18 and "clumped isotope" measurements of lacustrine carbonates provide important records of past terrestrial climate and paleoelevation. However, one of the primary challenges interpreting these data is constraining the relationship between mineral formation temperature and seasonal and mean annual climate. We examined surface water temperature records from 88 lakes across the globe to develop transfer functions that relate seasonal water surface temperature to mean annual air temperature. These transfer functions provide a means of reconciling proxy measures of water temperature with annual climatic conditions. Mean annual surface water temperature is related to mean annual air temperature (MAAT= -0.0318 x T-Water(2) + 2.195 x T-Water - 12.607; R-2 = 0.96) independent of lake size, with consistently higher mean water temperatures than air. N. Hemisphere Spring (April-June) mean lake surface temperatures (MAAT= -0.0097 x T-Water(2) +1.379 x T-Water 8.227; R-2=0.94) are only slightly warmer than MAAT for lakes in all climate zones, while summer water temperatures (JJA) (MAAT= -0.0055 x T-Water(2)-i- 1.476 x T-Water -18.915; R-2=0.90) may be 10-20 degrees C warmer than MAAT for cold climate lakes. Comparison of carbonate stable isotopic data from sites with different timescales of carbonate formation, such as found along latitude or elevation gradients, can lead to large over- or underestimates of past temperature. Accurate paleoclimatic interpretation of isotopic proxies or use of temperature proxy constraints (i.e., fossil leaves) to estimate lake temperature and calculate water delta O-18 thus requires appropriate application of water temperature-air temperature transfer functions, particularly when considering ancient cool, high elevation lake systems.

Daily transport estimates calculated from the current, temperature, and wind data, show temporal and spatial variability. Net summer transport during stratification west of Chambers Island was out of the lower bay (350 m3 s-1) in the epilimnion, into the lower bay (900 m3 s-1) in the hypolimnion, and out of the lower bay (320 m3 s-1) through the passage east of the island. The residence time for the lower bay is reduced to less than 1 year using the above transport compared to a water balance estimate of over 3 years. During the mid-September to May isothermal period, a horizontal transport gradient existed. Under the solid ice cover of winter, transport variability was significantly reduced and was uniformly out of the lower bay (500 m3 s-1). Fluctuations in daily transport were often large (up to 2 x 10(4) m3 s-1). The temporal and spatial variability of the water volume transport suggests that material mass fluxes between lower and upper Green Bay will be similarly dependent.																			0380-1330						1993	19	2					361	367		10.1016/S0380-1330(93)71224-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(93)71224-1													WOS:A1993LN30700016

Both occurred during periods of warm weather which weakened and thinned the ice sheet so that moderate winds were able to drive part of the ice cover offshore. Soon after, onshore winds drove the ice back where it piled in shallow water along the islands. In both cases the volume of ice pile-up exceeded 10(4) m3, but was very limited in extent and had little geomorphic effect on the coasts.																			0705-7199						1991	45	2					241	244		10.7202/032863ar	http://dx.doi.org/10.7202/032863ar													WOS:A1991GG73100009
J	Wilkins, PD; Marsden, JE				Wilkins, Pascal D.; Marsden, J. Ellen			Spatial and seasonal comparisons of growth of wild and stocked juvenile lake trout in Lake Champlain	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												After 42 years of stocking in Lake Champlain, recruitment of wild juvenile lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) was first observed in 2015. Abundance of wild lake trout juveniles was spatially heterogeneous. Recruitment of wild fish to age-1 and subsequent survival are likely related to growth including overwinter growth. We hypothesized that growth potential or growth-related mortality of wild and stocked fish may explain spatial differences in abundance. We collected juvenile (age-0 to 3) lake trout by bottom trawling in the central, north, and south Main Lake every 2-4 weeks during the ice-free season, 2015- 2018. The percentage of wild juveniles increased from 27.8% of the total catch in 2015 to 65.7% in 2018. Rates of growth in length and change in condition were compared in wild versus stocked lake trout, among sampling areas, and between seasons (sampling season relative to winter). Wild juveniles grew equally or faster in length than stocked juveniles at the same age, but changed more slowly in condition. There was a higher percentage of wild juveniles in the central sampling area than the north and south, but no differences in growth among sampling areas. Wild and stocked fish grew in length over winter, but most cohorts (6 of 7) maintained or increased condition. Results indicate high growth potential of wild juvenile lake trout and progress toward population restoration. (C) 2020 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Bacterial (free living and particle bound) cell-size in the surface waters of river Cauvery and its upstream tributaries in Karnataka state, India	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Cell-size here refers to mean length, as only the lengths of bacterial cells were measured in this study. Cell breadths were not measured, hence calculation of biovolume and biomass was not possible. In this study, the mean cell-lengths of heterotrophic bacterioplankton as well as their relation with environmental (water-quality) variables were analyzed for two years in the main river Cauvery and its four important upstream tributaries from February 2000 to January 2002. The initial hypothesis that all the five water courses have similar bacterial mean cell-lengths was rejected, because mean cell-lengths of free living and particle bound planktonic bacteria was more and was also significantly different in the river Lakshmanatheertha, when compared to the other four water courses studied. Season-wise grouped data revealed that, the mean cell-length of free-living bacteria was significantly less in winter season as compared to rainy and summer seasons during the second year of study only in the river Lakshmanatheertha. A correlation (r) analysis between the mean cell-lengths of heterotrophic bacteria and environmental (water-quality) variables revealed significant relations. Also with the help of regression analysis (r(2)) the effect of some important environmental variables on the mean cell-length of heterotrophic bacteria has been discussed in the light of recent investigations in the field of fresh water microbial ecology.					; T.S., Dr. Harsha/ABG-5418-2021	T S, Dr. Harsha/0000-0003-0538-3920; 													1589-1623	1785-0037					2008	6	1					29	47																WOS:000259019300002

The distributions of denitrification activity and N2O evolution were highly skewed, and could not be log-transformed to yield normal distributions. Consequently, ordinary statistical procedures (i.e., those based on a normal distribution) were considered inappropriate for this study, and nonparametric statistics were used to describe the data. Denitrification activity and N2O evolution exhibited similar temporal and landscape-scale patterns and were highly correlated, suggesting that denitrification was the main source of N2O evolution. In general, N2O evolution accounted for almost-equal-to 41% of the denitrification activity. Maximum rates of denitrification were low prior to spring tillage and seeding, increased during the first half of the growing season (following the addition of fertilizer N), and decreased toward the end of the growing season; denitrification had essentially ceased by the fall sampling. Statistical outliers for denitrification activity, i.e., hotspots of activity, occurred predominantly at low levels of denitrification activity and were completely absent when denitrification activity was at its maximum. Therefore, the importance of hotspots of activity for estimating seasonal rates of denitrification appears to be limited. Soil water content was the most dominant factor controlling denitrification activity, followed by the concentration of NH4+, total soil respiration, and NO3-. The intensity of denitrification was controlled largely by hydrologic processes, which, in turn, were influenced by the topography of the landscape. Nevertheless, the landscape-scale patterns of denitrification and N2O evolution were intensity-independent and remained consistent throughout the season.					; Pennock, Dan/LFS-7868-2024	Farrell, Richard/0000-0001-6365-3939; 													0361-5995					JUL-AUG	1993	57	4					988	995		10.2136/sssaj1993.03615995005700040018x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1993.03615995005700040018x													WOS:A1993LW04400018

Both the rate of light-limited (alpha(B)) and light-saturated (P(max)B) photosynthesis per unit chlorophyll a showed distinct and similar temporal trends in each year. Seasonal trends were especially evident for P(max)B, which increased in value for several weeks following the onset of thermal stratification, and then declined in the presence of the large colonial blue-green alga, Gloeotrichia echinulata. By late summer, when the biomass of G. echinulata had decreased, P(max)B again rose to its early summer value. The covariation of biomass-specific photosynthesis with the blooming of G. echinulata was the one clear seasonal (week-month) pattern which emerged in each of 3 years. Over short (day-week) time scales, changes in alpha(B) were related to changes in irradiance exposure on the day of sampling. However, the relationship between these two parameters was variable in time, since it was superimposed upon longer term trends controlled by changes in phytoplankton species composition. Increases in G. echinulata biomass corresponded with a deepening of the thermocline, which both increased internal phosphorus loading and the transport of resting G. echinulata colonies into the epilimnion. The timing and magnitude of the yearly G. echinulata bloom was as a result related to the seasonal development of thermal stratification. These results illustrate the importance of seasonal changes in the phytoplankton community as a factor regulating rates of biomass specific photosynthesis, particularly when the successional changes involve species with very different life strategies.

Retrieval of aerosol optical and physical properties from ground-based measurements for Zanjan, a city in Northwest Iran	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												A ground-based sun and sky scanning radiometer, CIMEL CE 318-2 sunphotometer, has been used to study the atmosphere of Zanjan, a city in Northwest Iran (36.70 degrees N, 48.51 degrees E, and 1800 m above the mean sea level) in the periods of October 2006-October 2008, and January-September 2010. Direct sun and solar principal plane sky radiance measurements by the sunphotometer have been used to retrieve the optical and physical properties of atmospheric aerosols, such as aerosol optical depth (ADD). Angstrom exponent (alpha), single scattering albedo (SSA), refractive index, and volume size distributions. About 50 dusty days (daily averaged AOD (870)>0.35, alpha<0.5) have been recorded during the mentioned periods. Considering the different values obtained for SSA, real part of refractive index, and volume size distributions, it has been found that just dust and anthropogenic aerosols are making the atmospheric aerosols in this region. In these recordings it has been observed that AODs (Angstrom exponents) were increasing (decreasing) during spring and early summer. This was accompanied by increase of SSA, real part of refractive index, and coarse mode part of volume size distributions of aerosols. This behavior could be due to transport of dust, mostly from Tigris-Euphrates basin or sometimes with lower probability from the region between Caspian and Aral seas and rarely from sources inside the Iran plateau like the Qom dry lake, especially in dry seasons. In this work NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, HYSPLIT model back trajectories, and MODIS Deep Blue AODs have been used to track the air masses and dust plumes during the recorded dust events.

A period of warmer climate corresponding to the Holocene Optimum between 9 ka and 5 ka is evident in greater alteration of n-alkanoic acids and n-alkanols and in the appearance of biomarkers indicative of greater microbial activity. Concomitant increases in local precipitation that raised the water level of the peat bog are recorded by increases in the proportions of C-23 and C-25 n-alkanes that are mainly derived from submerged/floating plants. Alternations in submergent and emergent plant n-alkane proxies reveal multi-decimeter scale rises and falls in the bog water level that relate to variation in precipitation on the Tibetan Plateau during the Holocene. Major low water level events occurred around 12.6, 11.3, 10.7, 9.4, 8.3, 6.0, 4.5, 3.1, 2.1 and 1.0 ka. These events correlate well with cold dry events recorded in same region from other climatic proxies that reflect millennial-scale Holocene instability in the Asian monsoon system. Our biomarker results also indicate that peat accumulation and preservation on the Tibetan Plateau are more sensitive to variability in monsoonal precipitation than in annual temperature.

Microbial biogeochemistry of Boiling Springs Lake: a physically dynamic, oligotrophic, low-pH geothermal ecosystem	GEOBIOLOGY												Boiling Springs Lake (BSL) in Lassen Volcanic National Park, California, is North America's largest hot spring, but little is known about the physical, chemical, and biological features of the system. Using a remotely operated vessel, we characterized the bathymetry and near-surface temperatures at sub-meter resolution. The majority of the 1.2ha, pH 2.2 lake is 10m deep and 50-52 degrees C, but temperatures reach 93 degrees C locally. We extracted DNA from water and sediments collected from warm (52 degrees C) and hot (73-83 degrees C) sites separated by 180m. Gene clone libraries and functional gene microarray (GeoChip 3.0) were used to investigate the BSL community, and uptake of radiolabeled carbon sources was used to assess the relative importance of heterotrophic vs. autotrophic production. Microbial assemblages are similar in both sites despite the strong temperature differential, supporting observations of a dynamic, convectively mixed system. Bacteria in the Actinobacteria and Aquificales phyla are abundant in the water column, and Archaea distantly related to known taxa are abundant in sediments. The functional potential appears similar across a 5-year time span, indicating a stable community with little inter-annual variation, despite the documented seasonal temperature cycle. BSL water-derived DNA contains genes for complete C, N, and S cycles, and low hybridization to probes for N and S oxidation suggests that reductive processes dominate. Many of the detected genes for these processes were from uncultivated bacteria, suggesting novel organisms are responsible for key ecosystem services. Selection imposed by low nutrients, low pH, and high temperature appear to result in low diversity and evenness of genes for key functions involved in C, N, and S cycling. Conversely, organic degradation genes appear to be functionally redundant, and the rapid assimilation of radiolabeled organic carbon into BSL cells suggests the importance of allochthonous C fueling heterotrophic production in the BSL C cycle.					; Wardman, Colin/S-8924-2019; Zhou, Jizhong/ACC-8029-2022; He, Zhili/OCL-4904-2025	Carey, Clayton/0000-0002-9458-649X; Zhou, Jizhong/0000-0003-2014-0564; Wardman, Colin/0000-0002-1067-213X; He, Zhili/0000-0001-8225-7333; 													1472-4677	1472-4669				JUL	2013	11	4					356	376		10.1111/gbi.12041	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gbi.12041								23679065					WOS:000320552800005

Mortality and Movements of Paddlefish Released as Bycatch in a Commercial Fishery in Kentucky Lake, Tennessee	PADDLEFISH MANAGEMENT, PROPAGATION, AND CONSERVATION IN THE 21ST CENTURY: BUILDING FROM 20 YEARS OF RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT	American Fisheries Society Symposium				Symposium on Paddlefish Conservation and Management	DEC 05, 2006	Omaha, NE	Amer Fisheries Soc				We present information on delayed mortality of commercially exploited paddlefish Polyodon spat-hula released as bycatch in Kentucky Lake, Tennessee-Kentucky, an impoundment on the lower Tennessee River. Minimum size limits enacted in 2002 (864 mm eye-to-fork length [EFL]) and 2005 (914 mm EFL) sought to protect paddlefish from overfishing. In 2005, bycatch of sublegal paddlefish represented 75% of the total catch, and releasing undersized fish will not reduce fishing mortality unless those fish survive. Paddlefish caught and released by commercial fishers in 2005 and 2006 were externally tagged with radio transmitters and tracked a minimum of 2 weeks to estimate delayed mortality Four of the 104 tagged paddlefish died following release, 94 survived, and 6 were censored because their fate could not be determined. Paddlefish that survived moved rapidly from release locations. Net movements of the 94 fish that survived averaged 12.0 km (SE = 5.3) upriver and ranged from 91.5 km down-river to 390.0 km upriver. Fish that died could not be distinguished from fish that lived on the basis of mean water temperature, fish length, net-soak time, or handling time. Given the low delayed mortality of discarded paddlefish, imposing minimum size limits is a reasonable approach to reduce fishing mortality of juveniles and reduce the likelihood of overfishing. Efforts to reduce fishing mortality should focus on avoiding fishing gear and seasons (e.g., early fall and late spring) that cause high initial bycatch mortality																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-12-7				2009	66						329	+																WOS:000278471300020

Here, we present a high-resolution hydroclimate reconstruction over the past 3110 years in northwestern Yunnan Province, southwestern China, based on grain size analysis using the End-member modeling algorithm and other environmental proxies. The results indicate that the temperature in northwestern Yunnan Province generally decreased since 3110 cal. yr BP, aligning with other temperature records on regional and global scales. Precipitation in the study area remained relatively stable before 1000 cal. yr BP, but exhibited an obvious out-phase change compared with the temperature records over multidecadal to centennial timescale. While after 1000 cal. yr BP, the precipitation steadily increased, revealing the hydroclimate pattern of notably dry Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and relatively wet Little Ice Age (LIA) in the study area. The decoupling combination of temperature and precipitation spanning the MWP and LIA in southwestern China contrasts with that in the East Asian summer monsoon area and the Indian subcontinent which is also controlled by the Indian summer monsoon, indicating the spatial heterogeneity of precipitation in the Asian summer monsoon region. The discussion about dynamic mechanisms points out that solar activity emerges as a significant factor influencing regional temperature changes, and El Ni & ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation and Intertropical Convergence Zone migration jointly impact the precipitation change in the study area and the hydroclimate discrepancy in the Asian summer monsoon region. Knowledge of the Indian summer monsoon evolution over the past millennium is vital for addressing the challenges posed by global warming. In this study, we present a high-resolution hydroclimate reconstruction covering the last 3110 years in northwestern Yunnan Province, southwestern China. Using the End-member Modeling Algorithm and multiple environmental proxies, we found a general temperature decrease since 3110 cal. yr BP, consistent with global and regional trends. Before 1000 cal. yr BP, precipitation in the study area remained stable but showed a distinct antiphase pattern with temperature variations over multidecadal to centennial timescales. After 1000 cal. yr BP, precipitation steadily increased, revealing a notably dry Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and a relatively wet Little Ice Age (LIA). The decoupling of temperature and precipitation during the MWP and LIA in southwestern China contrasts with the East Asian summer monsoon and the Indian subcontinent, highlighting the spatial heterogeneity of precipitation in the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) region. Our discussion on dynamic mechanisms highlights the significant role of solar activity in regional temperature changes and the joint impact of El Ni & ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation and Intertropical Convergence Zone migration on precipitation in the study area and the broader ASM region.

To understand the mechanisms behind phytoplankton growth in shallow lakes (resource and grazing effects) under contrasting N loading scenarios, we conducted a 70-days mesocosm experiment in summer. The mesocosms contain natural plankton communities deriving from a 10-cm layer of lake sediment and 450 L of lake water. We also added two juvenile crucian carp (Carassius carassius) in each mesocosm to simulate presence of the prevailing omni-benthivorous fish in subtropical lakes. Our results showed that N addition increased not only water N levels but also total phosphorus (TP) concentrations, which together elevated the phytoplankton biomass and caused strong dominance of cyanobacteria. Addition of N significantly lowered the herbivorous zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio and promoted the phytoplankton yield per nutrient (Chl-a: TP or Chl-a: TN ratio), indicating that summer N addition likely also favored phytoplankton growth through reduced grazing by zooplankton. Accordingly, our study indicates that summer N loading may boost eutrophication via both changes in resource and grazing control in shallow lakes. Thus, alleviation of eutrophication in shallow eutrophic lakes requires a strategic approach to control both nutrients (N and P) appropriately.

In Western Asia, however, these ecosystems are still wide and ecologically intact, and support highly biodiverse communities of species, including some highly threatened taxa. Here, we studied the spatio-temporal community dynamics of semi-aquatic reptiles in a wide reed bed biotope in Azerbaijan, and present conservation considerations for its optimal management for the survival of the authochtonous reptile species. Three reptile species (two snakes,Natrix natrixandNatrix tessellata, and one turtleEmys orbicularis persica) were found in the study area. Activity intensity was not even throughout the years, and was significantly more related to ambient temperatures in 2016 than in 2017. Interestingly, amphipod abundance was also significantly different between years, and correlated well with the differences in activity patterns observed in a turtle species. There were complex spatio-temporal patterns exhibited by the reptile species at the study area, with an excess of reptile individuals in the high density reed bed habitat during summertime whereas there was an excess of individuals in the open reed bed habitat in spring and autumn. This evidence suggests that there should be seasonal interhabitat movements of reptiles at the study area, and that the reed beds are not perceived as a homogeneous habitat by reptiles. Several hypotheses are presented to explain these unexpected spatio-temporal patterns by reptiles in reed beds. Our study clearly shows that, in order to enhance the conservation of reptiles, it is important to keep a mosaic of areas with dense reed stands (high density of young stems) and of open reed stands (lower density of older stems), thus increasing habitat heterogeneity and favouring small-scale ecological key-structures.

Effects of Common Carp on Trophic Dynamics of Sport Fishes in Shallow South Dakota Water Bodies	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The Common Carp Cyprinus carpio is one of the most common freshwater fish invaders worldwide, creating adverse effects on water quality and impacting ecosystem structure and function. To assess how Common Carp impact food web dynamics, we compared the trophic dynamics of Bluegills Lepomis macrochirus and Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides in three lakes containing Common Carp populations with the trophic dynamics in three lakes without Common Carp. All six lakes were located in eastern South Dakota. Stable isotope analysis was used to estimate trophic positions and indicate energy sources utilized by adult and age-0 fish. Additionally, diets of age-0 Bluegills were analyzed to assess whether Common Carp were inhibiting ontogenetic diet shifts, and bomb calorimetry was used to evaluate differences in energy density of age-0 fish prior to winter. Age-0 fish and adult Bluegills derived significantly more energy from pelagic sources in the systems populated with Common Carp. Adult Bluegills in Common Carp systems remained at a relatively constant trophic position across their entire size range, whereas in non-Common Carp systems, the trophic positions of adult Bluegills tended to increase with size. Even though age-0 fish relied more heavily on pelagic-derived energy in the systems with Common Carp, significant differences were not observed in the autumn energy densities of age-0 fish or in the age-0 Bluegills' diet. Given our results, Common Carp are unlikely to impact overwinter survival of age-0 fish in these shallow systems. The present study illustrates the value of using stable isotopes for food web investigations and demonstrates that Common Carp do alter trophic dynamics of other fishes in the systems they invade, but responses differ depending upon the species and life stage.

Monitoring energetic status of Lake Michigan Chinook salmon using water content as a predictor of whole-fish lipid content	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Monitoring health indicators of fish populations can be an expensive and time consuming process. This study analyzed energy dynamics of Lake Michigan Chinook salmon using proximate composition analysis with the goal of determining an efficient method for monitoring the nutritional status of the population. Condition factor performed poorly as an indicator of whole-fish lipids (r(2) = 0.07). Water content in a dorsal muscle plug was found to be correlated with whole-fish lipids (r(2) = 0.50) for all samples. For the subset of samples that included small fish collected in the spring, the strength of the relationship between water content in a dorsal muscle plug and whole-fish lipids increased (r(2) = 0.70). The metric of water content in a dorsal muscle plug was determined to provide an adequate surrogate of whole-fish lipid content and, therefore, overall nutritional status. We propose a monitoring program that involves collecting small individuals in the spring and reporting the proportion of samples with over 78% water content in muscle tissue. Small individuals collected in the spring had the lowest whole-fish lipid levels of any segment of the population and would be the most prone to nutritional stress; therefore we recommend focusing on them for monitoring.

The model currently comprises differential and algebraic equations describing processes and forcing functions most important for a freshwater ecosystem. These include seasonal changes of solar radiation and water temperature, processes of algal and cyanobacterial population dynamics and nutrient uptake, water and chemical budgeting, stratification of the water column and sedimentation of suspended particles, and dynamics of detritus and its chemical constituents. Although it was shown previously for some years that a reasonable simulation of changes in most state variables could be achieved without accounting for fish and zooplankton, in other years, consideration of these compartments improved the fit between observations and model simulations dramatically. This was particularly true for the year 1998, when the high zooplankton numbers in spring appeared to prevent any significant development of the diatom population. The latter, however, bloomed during the first part of the summer (following a decrease in zooplankton counts) causing an unusually delayed major drop in ambient Si levels. As biogoechemical cycles of Si. P and N are interconnected through the dynamics of the primary producers, such a delay has serious implications for the functioning of an aquatic ecosystem model. Since changes in zooplankton dynamics are heavily dependent on the variability in fish recruitment, simultaneous consideration of the two components is helpful both for modelling overall dynamics of the lake ecosystem and for implementation of the biogeochemical regulation proposed previously.

J	Yu, KH; Du, S; Cao, YC; Zhang, T				Yu, Kuanhong; Du, Shuo; Cao, Yingchang; Zhang, Tao			Opaline silica precipitations in the Permian Fengcheng Formation indicate hot spring environments in north Mahu Sag, NW China	MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY												The Permian Fengcheng Formation represents a series of deposits formed in an alkaline saline lake, characterized by high proportions of cherts, located in the Northwestern Junggar Basin in China. While discussions on silicarich hot springs as sources of silica for brine and subsequent chert deposition have been extensively conducted for Quaternary and Mesozoic-Cenozoic alkaline saline lakes worldwide, investigations into Paleozoic alkaline saline lakes are scarce due to challenges associated with identifying evidences of hot spring environments. In this study, we present detailed SEM-EDS analyses and examine silica isotope compositions as well as oxygen isotope compositions to discuss hydrothermal-associated silica precipitation processes. Our findings suggest that migrating silica-rich hot springs along deep-rooted faults released silica into the brine, leading to chert deposition during cooling periods and induction of thermophilic microorganism degradation. Microorganismassociated siliceous precipitates primarily consist of opal-A spheres adhered by extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), while numerous microorganism spheres have undergone silicification. Opal-A spheres within these structures were partially transformed into well-crystallized quartz through multiple stages of dissolutionprecipitation processes during prolonged burial history. Furthermore, our results indicate that deep-rooted fault-related hot springs can occur both in marginal and subaqueous areas within alkaline saline lakes, with chert formations observed in shallow-marginal saline lake settings as well as deeper regions. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the paleoenvironmental conditions, which can be further explored in investigating the accumulation of organic matter in chert-rich successions formed within an alkaline saline lake.																			0264-8172	1873-4073				AUG	2024	166								106924	10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2024.106924	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2024.106924		JUN 2024											WOS:001252087500001

Air temperature and relative humidity (h) data from meteorological stations and global climate grids (GMAO-MERRA) were used as input to the model. A second model of the volume of inflow during snow-melt constrained the magnitude of seasonal variability in isotopic composition. Similar to other areas of the Himalaya, elevation was a strong determinant of isotopic composition of stream water, suggesting that heavier isotopes rain out at lower elevations. Deuterium excess (d) in stream water suggests that summer precipitation originating from the Bay of Bengal rather than winter precipitation from Central Asia is the dominant source of precipitation. For the largest and deepest lakes (>15 m), E/I was 77-87%, and 18-50% for two shallow lakes (<2 m). Modelled E/I was sensitive to h; ground-level measurements of h are needed to constrain E/I estimates in arid mountain regions, though h from GMAO also produced reasonable E/I values. The results suggest that some lakes in closed basins in the Himalaya lose a significant fraction of their inflow to groundwater, particularly shallow lakes with a low ratio of lake volume to watershed area. Isotopic values from the mainstem of the Indus River suggest that evaporatively enriched waters have limited impact on both wet and dry season discharge at the basin scale. Lakes with a high evaporative fraction may be uniquely sensitive to climate, and isotopic analysis can help identify lakes that may be vulnerable to climate fluctuations and change.

The discovery of modern naturally-occurring C-4 plant species at elevations up to 4500 m in Tibet and 3000 m in Africa and South America, however, suggests that C-4 plants are present in a wider range of environments than previously thought. Environmental conditions on the Tibetan Plateau, including high irradiance, rainfall focused in summer, and saline soils, can favor C-4 plants by offsetting the deleterious effects of low growing season temperature. We present evidence based on leaf wax carbon isotope ratios from Lake Qinghai that C-4 plants accounted for 50% of terrestrial primary productivity on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau throughout the Lateglacial and early Holocene. Despite cold conditions, C-4 plants flourished due to a combination of factors, including maximum summer insolation, pCO(2) ca 250 ppmv, and sufficient summer precipitation. The modern C-3 plant-dominated ecosystem around Lake Qinghai was established ca 6 thousand years ago as pCO(2) increased and summer temperature and precipitation decreased. C-4 plants were also intermittently abundant during the Last Glacial period; we propose that C-4 plants contributed a significant portion of local primary productivity by colonizing the exposed, saline Qinghai Lake bed during low stands. Our results contrast with state-of-the-art ecosystem models that simulate <0.5% C-4 plant abundance on the Tibetan Plateau in modern and past environments. The past abundance of C-4 plants on the Tibetan Plateau suggests a wider temperature range for C-4 plants than can be inferred from modern distributions and model simulations, and provides paleoecological evidence to support recent findings that C-4 plant evolution and distribution was determined by a combination of climatic and environmental factors (temperature, irradiance, precipitation amount and seasonality, and soil salinity). Moreover, this finding highlights the exceptional sensitivity of high-elevation ecosystems to environmental change, and provides critical benchmarks for ecosystem model validation.

Here we employed the extraordinarily long observational records of river ice breakup dates and air temperatures in northern Fennoscandia to examine their interrelations since 1802. Historical observations, along with modern data, comprise the informational setting for this analysis carried out using t-test. Temperature history of April-May season was used as climatic counterpart for the breakup timings. Both records (temperature and breakup) showed seven sub-periods during which their local means were distinctly different relative to preceding, and subsequent sub-periods. The starting and ending years of these sub-periods occurred in temporal agreement. The main findings of this study are summarized as follows: (1) the synchrony between the temperature and river ice breakup records ruled out the possibility that the changes would have occurred due to quality of the historical series (i.e. inhomogeneity problems often linked to historical time-series); (2) the studied records agreed to show lower spring temperatures and later river ice breakups during the 19th century, in comparison to the 20th century conditions, evidencing the prevalence of cooler spring temperatures in the study region, in agreement with the concept of the Little Ice Age (1570-1900) climate in North-West Europe; (3) the most recent sub-period demonstrate the highest spring temperatures with concomitantly earliest river ice breakups, showing the relative warmth of the current springtime climate in the study region in the context of the past two centuries; (4) the effects of anthropogenic changes in the river environment (e.g. construction and demolition of dams) during the 20th century should be considered for non-climatic variations in the breakup records; (5) this study emphasizes the importance of multi-centurial (i.e. historical) cryophenological information for highly interesting viewpoints of climate and environmental history.

Originally, their water tables were regulated by natural processes such as evapotransporation, precipitation, drainage and seepage (up and downwards). These lakes used to be oligo to mesotrophic, and the phytoplankton consisted mainly of diatoms and green algae. However, 30 years ago filamentous cyanobacteria were also present. Owing to the intensification of agriculture in the surroundings of the lakes, their management developed more and more towards a man-made reservoir function. This management resulted in inflow of eutrophic water from the agricultural areas in winter. In summer the lakes were increasingly used as a water supply. This supply is compensated by water imported mainly from the River Rhine. The impacts of this reservoir function on the limnology of the Dutch fen lakes are discussed with the Tjeukemeer, the Loosdrechtse Plassen and the Reeuwijkse Plassen as examples. All these lakes have become typical eutrophic waters with high turbidity, dominance of filamentous cyanobacteria and bream and complete loss of submerged macrophytes. Finally, methods and results of manipulation procedures to restore these waters are discussed.					van Donk, Ellen/B-7272-2008	van Donk, Ellen/0000-0003-3279-4936													0018-8158					AUG 13	1993	265	1-3					155	177		10.1007/BF00007266	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007266													WOS:A1993LZ11600008

In this study, we examined the fluxes, elemental compositions (18 elements including silicon, sulfur, and aluminum but not carbon) and sizes of dry-deposited SCPs in the atmosphere at Cape Hedo (the northernmost part of Okinawa Island) to assess the temporal variation. The study site at Cape Hedo is suitable for investigating atmospherically deposited SCPs, particularly for evaluating their long-range transportation, because Cape Hedo is situated in an outflow region of East Asian pollutants. High SCP fluxes mostly occurred in autumn and winter when air masses came from the Asian continent. Additionally, we determined the temporal variations in the elemental compositions and the sizes of the SCPs during four week-long sampling periods and these results suggest that the high SCP fluxes were due to the transportation of the particles from the Asian continent to the study site. The potential source regions of the particles during respective periods are very consistent with the backward air mass trajectories. Results of our study would imply that sources of the SCPs deposited in the area changed temporarily, and that coarse particulate-pollutants such as SCPs were transported from the eastern Asian continent to Okinawa Island during the periods under specific meteorological conditions. Our findings suggest that the examination of SCPs from atmospheric deposition can contribute to the assessment of atmospheric transportation, specifically for particulate pollutants in the atmospheric boundary layer.

A.; Antunes, Carlos			Invasive dynamics of the crayfish Procambarus clarkii (Girard, 1852) in the international section of the River Minho (NW of the Iberian Peninsula)	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												Procambarus clarkii (Girard, 1852) is a well-established invasive species in many worldwide aquatic ecosystems and is responsible for several ecological and economic impacts. This study examines the major factors responsible for its invasive dynamics in the international section of the River Minho (north-west Iberian Peninsula). Data collected from June 2007 to May 2011 showed that abundance and biomass increased in the first 3years of sampling, but suffered a decrease in the fourth year. Higher abundance and biomass were always found from May to October. These higher values have a clear relationship with water temperature and probably reflect higher activity and mobility. The sex-ratio was 1.08:1 in favour of females; eggs start to appear in May/June and the majority of juveniles in August/September. Information collected in this study is extremely important for future management actions that could be applied to this invasive species. Accordingly, we propose that control actions to minimize P. clarkii impacts in this system, such as intensive trapping, should be applied during late spring/early summer, when the catches are higher, the females are dominant, and before juvenile recruitment.

J	Fang, X; Stefan, HG				Fang, X; Stefan, HG			Potential climate warming effects on ice covers of small lakes in the contiguous US	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												To simulate effects of projected climate change on ice covers of small lakes in the northern contiguous U.S., a process-based simulation model is applied. This winter ice/snow cover model is associated with a deterministic, one-dimensional year-round water temperature model. The lake parameters required as model input are surface area, maximum depth, and Secchi depth as a measure of radiation attenuation. The model is driven by daily weather data. Weather records from 209 stations in the contiguous U.S. for the period 1961-1979 were used to represent past climate conditions. The projected climate changes due to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 were obtained from the output of the Canadian Climate Center Global Circulation Model. To illustrate the effect of projected climate change we present herein winter ice cover characteristics simulated, respectively, with inputs of past climate conditions (1961-1979), with inputs of a projected 2 X CO2 climate scenario as well as differences of those values. The dependence of ice cover characteristics on latitude and lake characteristics has been quantified by making simulations for 27 lake types at 209 locations across the contiguous U.S. It was found that the 2 X CO2 climate scenario is projected to delay ice formation on lakes by as much as 40 days and melt ice by up to 67 days earlier. Maximum ice thicknesses are projected to be reduced by up to 0.44 m (Sault Ste. Marie, MI), and the ice cover periods will be shorter by up to 89 days (Rock Springs, WY). The largest changes are projected to occur east of Idaho from the Canadian border down to the states of Colorado, Nebraska, and Iowa and the northern parts of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. These changes would reduce fish winterkill in most shallow lakes of the northern states of the contiguous U.S. but may endanger snowmobiles and ice fishermen. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Seasonal and Spatial Diversity of Picocyanobacteria Community in the Great Mazurian Lakes Derived from DGGE Analyses of 16S rDNA and cpcBA-IGS Markers	JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY												The seasonal and spatial diversity of picocyanobacteria (Pcy) in lakes of the Great Mazurian Lakes (GLM) system was examined by DGGE analysis of molecular markers derived from the 16S-23S internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of the ribosomal operon and the phycocyanin operon (cpcBA-IGS). The study of nine lakes, ranging from mesotrophy to hypereutrophy, demonstrated seasonal variance of Pcy. The richness and Shannon diversity index calculated on the basis of both markers were higher in spring and lower in early and late summer. No statistically significant relationships were found between the markers and trophic status of the studied lakes or Pcy abundance. There were, however, statistically significant relationships between the diversity indices and sampling time. The analysis pointed to a different distribution of the two markers. The ITS marker exhibited more unique sequences in time and space, whereas a greater role for common and ubiquitous sequences was indicated by the cpcBA-IGS data. Examination of the Pcy community structure demonstrated that communities were grouped in highly similar clusters according to sampling season/time rather than to the trophic status of the lake. Our results suggest that time is more important than trophic status in shaping the diversity and structure of Pcy communities. The seasonal changes in picocyanobacteria and differences in diversity and community structures are discussed in the context of well-established ecological hypotheses: the PEG model, intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH), and horizontal gene transfer (HGT).

J	Zhao, P; Chen, LX; Zhou, XJ; Gong, YF; Han, Y				Zhao, P; Chen, LX; Zhou, XJ; Gong, YF; Han, Y			Modeling the East Asian climate during the last glacial maximum	SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES D-EARTH SCIENCES												Using the CCM3 global climate model of National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), this paper comparatively analyzes the characteristics of East Asian monsoon and surface water condition and the expansion of glacier on the Qinghai-Xizang (Tibetan) Plateau (QXP) between the present and the last glacial maximum (LGM). It is found that the winter monsoon is remarkably stronger during the LGM than at present in the north part of China and the western Pacific but varies little in the south part of China. The summer monsoon remarkably weakens in South China Sea and the south part of China during the LGM and has no remarkable changes in the north part of China between the present and the LGM. Due to the alternations of the monsoons during the LGM, the annual mean precipitation significantly decreases in the northeast of China and the most part of north China and the Loess Plateau and the eastern QXP, which makes the earth surface lose more water and becomes dry, especially in the eastern QXP and the western Loess Plateau. In some areas of the middle QXP the decrease of evaporation at the earth surface causes soil to become wetter during the LGM than at present, which favors the water level of local lakes to rise during the LGM. Additionally, compared to the present, the depth of snow cover increases remarkably on the most part of the QXP during the LGM winter. The analysis of equilibrium line altitude (ELA) of glaciers on the QXP, calculated on the basis of the simulated temperature and precipitation, shows that although a less decrease of air temperature was simulated during the LGM in this paper, the balance between precipitation and air temperature associated with the atmospheric physical processes in the model makes the ELA be 300-900 m lower during the LGM than at present, namely going down from the present ELA above 5400 m to 4600-5200 m during the LGM, indicating a unified ice sheet on the QXP during the LGM.																			1006-9313					OCT	2003	46	10					1060	1068		10.1360/03yd0350	http://dx.doi.org/10.1360/03yd0350													WOS:000185354300010

VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY												The article revolves around the problem of locating the principal stavka of Eushta knyaz Toyan. Despite the great role played by this archaeological monument in Tomsk history, there is no precise topography data. Scientists of 18th - 19th centuries provided contradictory information on Toyan's Town location. For example, Gerhard Friedrich Muller located the stavka on the left bank of the river Tom in one of his works and on an island in another. Besides, no researcher made a topographical plan or at least a sketch of Toyan's Town in the 19th - 20th centuries, which complicates the problem of locating the monument. Although several hill forts existed around today's Timiryazevo village, people associated the name of Toyan with a particular object. Actually, this hill fort was named Toyan's Town, just as the nearby burial site. Some researchers have found it inappropriate to associate the object with the name of the Eushta knyaz. Andrei Dulson argued that this erroneous association was only inspired by local Eushta Tatar legends. The situation is complicated by the fact that the alleged location of Toyan's Town is almost completely developed with buildings today, so no fortifications can be traced in the land relief. To solve this problem, we use archaeological, historical, ethnographical, mapping and toponymic data. A fragment of Tomsk suburbs archaeological map made by Alexander Adrianov in late 19th century is published for the first time in this article. This is the only map today that shows the defense line shielding the hill fort in the Middle Ages. The integrated research we conducted allows for locating Toyan's Town on the only cape in the left-bank area of the river Tom, opposite Tomsk, close to the anabranch known as Toyan's Lake. This place was the winter settlement of Eushta Tatars. In summer, the population moved to a floodplain a few kilometers north of Toyan's Town and used floodplain meadows and the island on the river Tom for farming. The archaeological surveys carried out on the abovementioned cape in summer 2015 confirmed our hypothesis. In the excavations found many artifacts dated XVI-XVII centuries, relating to Eushta Tatars culture. The artifacts are presented mostly ceramic dishes and bones of horses. Also a silver coin dated 1631and a cannonball of early XVII century were found. Certainly, Toyan's Town located in such a convenient location, opposite the city of Tomsk, played an important role in the politics and economy of the region in the early XVII century. We can only hope that one day the stationary archaeological research of preserved cultural layer will be held and we can put an end to the history of the destruction of the Town and start new history of its scientific study and conservation.

Vegetation diversity in a large Neotropical wetland during two different climatic scenarios	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												We aim to analyze the spatial patterns of the vegetation at local and landscape scale during a scenario characterized by abnormally dry period (2007-2008) and a reference scenario (1976-1977). We used the frequency occurrence of the species and the number of species belonging to five life forms to compare the two temporal scenarios. In five water bodies of Esteros del Ibera we surveyed vascular aquatic macrophytes and the wetland plants during spring-summer with up to three samples of 20 m(2) each. A total of 161 species were found during the two study periods (120 and 117 species respectively). Cyperaceae and Poaceae were the most species-rich families at both periods. At waterbody scale, beta diversity showed a high spatial heterogeneity and at wetland scale, the turnover rate of S is low. At both scenarios, the vegetation composition showed relevant differences between the sub-rounded lakes and the elongated waterbodies. The floristic composition and the life forms spectra were affected by the change in the water supply. The knowledge of the baseline of the spatial and temporal variability of this particular wetland is key to support future assessments of the ecosystem response to the global change.

This selectivity falls in the range of that achieved using the aromatic ketones benzophenone (BP), 3'-methoxyacetophenone (3'-MAP), and 2-acetonaphthone (2-AN) as model photosensitizers. For both natural and model sensitizers, the photooxidation at pH 8 is not controlled by singlet oxygen. Deuterium isotope effects (k(H)/k(D)) of different phenols are 0.7-1.3 for humic and fulvic acids and 1.1-1.7 for BP, suggesting an electron transfer mechanism. In contrast, the isotope effect for 2-AN of approximate to 4 indicates an H-atom abstraction reaction. The results show that reactive excited triplet states are important photooxidants in natural waters and should be considered for assessing the abiotic degradation of chemicals. The reactive triplet state concentration is estimated to be approximate to 10(-14) M in the top meter of Lake Greifensee under summer noon sunlight, and this leads to a half-life of approximate to 7 h for 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. Further still uncharacterized photooxidants derived from the dissolved organic material are also involved in the phototransformation of the phenols.					; Jans, Urs/AAG-7758-2019	Jans, Urs/0000-0001-8686-3787; 													0013-936X					JUL	1995	29	7					1822	1831		10.1021/es00007a020	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es00007a020								22176456					WOS:A1995RG46700031

Seasonal Behavior of the CO2 Gas Exchange Process in the "Atmosphere-Water" System of the Littoral Zone of Southern Baikal. 1. Hydrological Spring	ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS												Analysis of the mechanisms determining the direction and intensity of CO2 fluxes in the "atmosphere-water" system seems to be important in the context of studying the problem of present-day increase in the content of one of the greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide) in the atmosphere. This paper starts a series of publications devoted to the analysis of seasonal features of the CO2 gas exchange process in the littoral zone of southern Baikal and presents the results obtained in the spring period. It is shown that the greatest transformation of all components of the carbon dioxide gas exchange process between the water surface and the atmosphere is observed during "hydrological spring" period in the littoral zone of Lake Baikal. The amplitude of the diurnal behaviors of the CO2, O-2, and NO3- concentrations in water increases from May to June. The diurnally average CO2 flux, which is directed to the atmosphere in mid-May, changes its direction as soon as June, and a distinct CO2 sink to the water surface becomes evident. The tendency toward increase in the amplitude of the diurnal CO2 behavior in water and enhancement of the carbon dioxide sink from the atmosphere to the water surface continues; that the sink, on average, may reach 70 mg CO2 m(-2) day(-1) by mid-July.

Seasonal variation observed in microplastic deposition rates in boreal lake sediments	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS												Purpose The sediment trap method allows measurements of vertical microplastic flux rate into sediments and provides comparable information of the spatial microplastic deposition rates. Such data are essential for comparison of the microplastic pollution rates in different sedimentary systems and for future risk assessments. Materials and methods We monitored microplastic fluxes using sediment traps in a boreal lake seasonally during 1 year. The sites represent different level of exposure to anthropogenic activities, from construction work to the open water site. Microplastic fluxes were compared to sediment characteristics (organic content) and sediment accumulation rates. Results and discussion The highest annual microplastic deposition rate (2300 items m(-2) year(-1)) was recorded at snow disposal site, a location where the snow collected from the city streets during winter is transported. The lowest rate was observed at the control site (660 items m(-2) year(-1)) upstream from the city. Our results reveal the seasonal variation in microplastic deposition rates. In general, the highest microplastic flux rates were measured during growing season, accompanied with higher sedimentation rate. The low microplastic deposition rate during winter is likely explained by ice cover, frozen soil, and snow cover in the catchment. In contrast, microplastic concentration was higher in winter samples due to ceased sediment transport from catchment to lake. The sediment accumulation rate did not predict microplastic accumulation rate. Conclusion Our data suggest seasonal variation in microplastic deposition rates. The microplastic flux rates compared to their concentrations indicates that sites with high sedimentation rates can lead to underestimation of microplastic deposition and hence hamper recognition of hot spots.					; Koistinen, Arto/GLR-0659-2022	Saarni, Saija/0000-0003-2050-3062; Soininen, Tuomo/0000-0002-9490-6289; Koistinen, Arto/0000-0001-7601-9806													1439-0108	1614-7480				APR	2023	23	4					1960	1970		10.1007/s11368-023-03465-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-023-03465-3		FEB 2023											WOS:000938080700001

INHABITING TWO WATER BODIES IN COASTAL ALGERIA	REVUE D ECOLOGIE-LA TERRE ET LA VIE												Analysis of the spatiotemporal variation of the biological parameters of European eels (Anguilla anguilla) inhabiting two aquatic systems in coastal Algeria revealed no significant differences in length, gonadosomatic index, hepatosomatic index, or condition coefficient between non-parasitized (NPT) and parasitized (with the nematode Anguillicoloides crassus) (PT) sub-populations at Lake Tonga. However, there were significant differences in these parameters between the two Lake Tonga sub-populations and a non-parasitized population at Bou Haroun port (NPT). There were no significant differences in weight among these three sub-populations. The highest values of the condition coefficient were observed in eels at Lake Tonga. Parasite numbers >= 10 per swim bladder had a negative effect on all measured biological parameters. At both stations, the condition of the eels was lowest in the spring and summer. Principal components analysis distinguished two groups of eels. The first comprised the Lake Tonga individuals, separated by parasitic indices and dissolved oxygen. The second group comprised the Bou Haroun eels, separated by pollution parameters. In fact this parasite was not present at Bou Haroun, presumably because it is unable to develop in this environment. Both Anguillicoloides crassus and Anguilla anguilla, prefer non-polluted environments with low salinity, as found in Lake Tonga.																			0249-7395						2017	72	3					293	302																WOS:000413090300005

The goal of this study was to optimize P application rate for commercial snap bean production in south Florida. This study was conducted on muck soil in Lake Harbor in winter 2011 and on fine sandy soil in Belle Glade in spring 2012. Prior to planting 'Caprice' snap bean, plots were fertilized with 0, 40, 80, 120, 160, 200, and 240 lb/acre P2O5 (0, 45, 90, 134, 179, 224, and 269 kg.ha(-1) P2O5) using triple superphosphate (0-45-0). Each plot consisted of eight 30-ft rows (4 replicates each), of which the central 20 ft of the two middle rows was harvested. In both of the trials, an increase in P2O5 application rates produced significant increases in marketable bean yields up to the 120 lb/acre P2O5, at which point significant gains measured from further increasing application rates ceased. At 120 lb/acre P2O5, measured bean quality was the best among all of the treatments.

On the Role of Spatial Snow Distribution on Alpine Catchment Hydrology	WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER RESOURCES CONGRESS 2019: GROUNDWATER, SUSTAINABILITY, HYDRO-CLIMATE/CLIMATE CHANGE, AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING					World Environmental and Water Resources Congress / 19th Annual Congress of the Environmental-and-Water-Resources-Institute (EWRI) / EWRI History and Heritage Symposium	MAY 19-23, 2019	Pittsburgh, PA	Environm & Water Resources Inst, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Environm & Water Resources Inst, Amer Soc Civil Engineers				The spatial distribution of alpine snow is largely governed by topographic complexity through shading of solar radiation and wind redistribution. While radiative shading is relatively consistent between years, wind redistribution is more variable, capable of producing anomalous areas of deeper snow that can persist into the late-summer and early-fall months. In a warmer future climate, we hypothesize that snow will become wetter and heavier than in the current climate, leading to less wind redistribution and a more homogeneous snowpack. This study seeks to investigate how the relative degree of snow redistribution will impact total streamflow generation in an alpine environment. A distributed hydrologic model is applied together with remotely sensed spatial estimates of snowpack in order to quantify the impact of spatial variability of snow water equivalent on streamflow. Preliminary findings for the Green Lakes Valley within the headwaters of the Boulder Creek watershed in Colorado, 2001-2014, show that more uniform snow distributions lead to earlier melt-out of 47 days on average and tend to produce less overall streamflow, with maximum decreases as large as 9.5% relative to the natural case. Overall, this analysis aims to provide insight into how warming-mediated changes in snow distribution will impact water resources in critical streamflow generating headwaters catchments.

Age at sexual maturity was expressed as the proportion of grilse (fish with one sea winter) in the nominal salmon catch. No general temporal trend was found in the proportion of grilse in the catches. However, grilse proportion declined significantly in 10 rivers and increased significantly in 11 rivers Out of the 55 rivers with data for all 18 years. There were no short-term cycles in grilse proportion within rivers. We found coherence and similarity in the temporal variation in grilse proportion for rivers draining into large fjord systems. Reasons for the temporal variation in grilse proportions must be sought at a river-specific or regional scale. River-specific factors (water discharge, river steepness, and presence of lakes) explained a large percentage of the spatial variation in grilse proportion. Grilse proportion increased with decreasing river size (measured as mean annual water discharge) and with increasing proportion of water discharge occurring during summer (i.e., the migration season). Grilse proportion was higher in rivers located nearer to the open ocean, probably indicating an effect of early feeding on growth and maturation. Even after accounting for environmental variation at the local scale, we found large regional differences in grilse proportion. Region captured this variation more efficiently than latitude, but grilse proportion was higher in the northern part of Norway than in the more southerly part. This variability may indicate large-scale differences in, for example, oceanic migration routes for fish originating from different regions.

This research was conducted at the Cinergy-PSI Gibson County Power Generating Station in Gibson County, IN, USA. This site is characterized by a high density of power transmission lines with a 1214-ha cooling lake and numerous small wetlands in close proximity. Large numbers of waterfowl and other wetland-associated avian species utilize this area in the fall and winter. Bird flight observations were conducted along with corresponding ground searches to determine the species specific reactions of birds to the power lines. The birds most likely to react to power lines were those that approached the lines at a height between the conductor and ground wires. No relationship between flock size and the proportion of birds reacting to the lines was found; however, a significant difference was found in the reaction distances between flocks >10 birds and single birds. Species were grouped into four categories according to wing morphology, and it was determined that species at the greatest risk for collisions were those that showed high wing loading and low wing aspect ratio.

J	Xing, QG; Hu, CM				Xing, Qianguo; Hu, Chuanmin			Mapping macroalgal blooms in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea using HJ-1 and Landsat data: Application of a virtual baseline reflectance height technique	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Several methods have been proposed in previous studies to map macroalgal blooms (MABs) in the Yellow Sea (YS) and East China Sea (ECS), yet some of the required spectral bands are not available on the new HJ-1 satellite sensors although they do provide optimal resolution and temporal coverage (30-m resolution with 2-day revisit frequency) for bloom mapping. In this study, an index of Virtual-Baseline Floating macroAlgae Height (VB-FAH) is proposed to use the green and red bands as the baseline to measure the height of the near-infrared (NIR) reflectance. Cross-sensor comparison with Landsat TM and ETM + data suggests that for several images evaluated here VB-FAH appears to be comparable to the previously proposed Floating Algae Index (FAI) even in the absence of a shortwave-infrared (SWIR) band. VB-FAH is applied to 30-m resolution TM and ETM + data for the YS during 1995-2006 and to HJ-1 data for the ECS during 2009-2014 to map MABs. Results show bloom history in the YS back to 1999 and early bloom occurrence in the ECS in winter and spring (e.g., February and March 2013). MABs are also found to extend to the ECS as far south as 26 degrees N near Fujian Province and Taiwan, and as far east as the Kuroshio Current. These new findings provide important information for exploring the origins, causes, and consequences of MABs in the YS and ECS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

No ephippial females were recorded and no ephippia were released in the control treatment during 45 days of the experiment. When exposed to fish water, the fraction of ephippial females reached a maximum of 3.7%,a value comparable to that registered in summer in the Grosser Binnensee (Northern Germany), a hypertrophic lake inhabited by fish, which was the source lake for our experimental clone. The number of ephippia released within 45 days was on average 34 +/- 22. Ephippia formation could not result from the between-treatment differences in population density, and related patterns of food depletion, since no substantial difference between control and fish treatment was observed. Instead, specific information on the presence of a predator provided a cue which induced the formation of resting eggs in Daphnia. Under heavy predation and very low survival probability of parthenogenetic females, ephippia formation in summer can be adaptive, i.e. higher fitness can be achieved through survival in the diapausing state than through the immediate reproductive gain via parthenogenesis.

Ace Lake: three decades of research on a meromictic, Antarctic lake	POLAR BIOLOGY												Ace Lake (Vestfold Hills, Antarctica) has been investigated since the 1970s. Its close proximity to Davis Station has allowed year-long, as well as summer only, investigations. Ace Lake is a saline meromictic (permanently stratified) lake with strong physical and chemical gradients. The lake is one of the most studied lakes in continental Antarctica. Here, we review the current knowledge of the history, the physical and chemical environment, community structure and functional dynamics of the mixolimnion, littoral benthic algal mats, the lower anoxic monimolimnion and the sediment within the monimolimnion. In common with other continental meromictic Antarctic lakes, Ace Lake possesses a truncated food web dominated by prokaryote and eukaryote microorganisms in the upper aerobic mixolimnion and an anaerobic prokaryote community in the monimolimnion, where methanogenic Archaea, sulphate-reducing and sulphur-oxidizing bacteria occur. These communities are functional in winter at subzero temperatures, when mixotrophy plays an important role in survival in dominant photosynthetic eukaryotic microorganisms in the mixolimnion. The productivity of Ace Lake is comparable to other saline lakes in the Vestfold Hills, but higher than that seen in the more southerly McMurdo Dry Valley lakes. Finally, we identify gaps in the current knowledge and avenues that demand further investigation, including comparisons with analogous lakes in the north polar region.																			0722-4060	1432-2056				NOV	2014	37	11					1685	1699		10.1007/s00300-014-1553-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00300-014-1553-3													WOS:000343141300011

What, How, When, and Where: Spatiotemporal Water Quality Hazards of Cyanotoxins in Subtropical Eutrophic Reservoirs	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Though toxins produced during harmful blooms of cyanobacteria present diverse risks to public health and the environment, surface water quality surveillance of cyanobacterial toxins is inconsistent, spatiotemporally limited, and routinely relies on ELISA kits to estimate total microcystins (MCs) in surface waters. Here, we employed liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to examine common cyanotoxins, including five microcystins, three anatoxins, nodularin, cylindrospermopsin, and saxitoxin in 20 subtropical reservoirs spatially distributed across a pronounced annual rainfall gradient. Probabilistic environmental hazard analyses identified whether water quality values for cyanotoxins were exceeded and if these exceedances varied spatiotemporally. MC-LR was the most common congener detected, but it was not consistently observed with other toxins, including MC-YR, which was detected at the highest concentrations during spring with many observations above the California human recreation guideline (800 ng/L). Cylindrospermopsin was also quantitated in 40% of eutrophic reservoirs; these detections did not exceed a US Environmental Protection Agency swimming/advisory level (15,000 ng/L). Our observations have implications for routine water quality monitoring practices, which traditionally use ELISA kits to estimate MC levels and often limit collection of surface samples during summer months near reservoir impoundments, and further indicate that spatiotemporal surveillance efforts are necessary to understand cyanotoxins risks when harmful cyanobacteria blooms occur throughout the year.

Cyclops vicinus fed selectively on Synchaeta spp.; Keratella and Polyarthra spp. were not selected for. Predation rates increased with prey density up to a maximum of 37 Synchaeta day(-1) at a density of 1.6 x 10(6) Synchaeta m(-2), i.e. at similar to 1200 Synchaeta l(-1). Calculation of cropping rates suggests that Cyclops alone can control the abundance of Synchaeta in spring, i.e. that mainly Cyclops is responsible for the decline of Synchaeta species in Lake Constance in May.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				AUG	1997	19	8					1069	1079																WOS:A1997XT70200008

Assessing changes in millennial-scale effective moisture in mountain-basin systems can provide a valuable reference for understanding how climate change and human activities affect terrestrial water resources and drylands. Here, a continuous pollen record from Genggahai Lake on the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau exhibited detailed changes in regional vegetation and effective moisture since similar to 15.3 ka. The pollen sequence suggests that steppe vegetation developed in the basin and that sparse forest vegetation developed in the surrounding mountain areas during 15.3-11.7 ka and 6.3-0 ka, and that desert steppe vegetation developed in the basin and denser forest vegetation developed in the surrounding mountain areas during 11.7-6.3 ka. Based on comparison of regional palaeoclimatic records, the pollen assemblage results suggest antiphase moisture changes between mountains and the basin and imply that the low Artemisia/Chenopodiaceae (A/C) ratio during 11.7-6.3 ka in the basin likely indicates that the low effective moisture conditions likely resulted from the high permeability of loose and porous sediments and the high evaporation in the basin induced by high summer solar insolation. In contrast, the high A/C ratio during 15.3-11.7 ka and 6.3-0 ka indicates a high level of effective moisture during these periods, possibly in response to less evapotranspiration loss in the basin caused by the strong water-binding capacity of palaeosols, ameliorated vegetation conditions, and low summer solar insolation. Our results also suggest that both climatic conditions and anthropogenic activities may have altered the natural vegetation in the late Holocene and that change in the percentage of tree pollen from Genggahai Lake were synchronous with changes in the intensity of the Indian summer monsoon.

J	Feng, YY; Yang, XP				Feng, Yingying; Yang, Xiaoping			Moisture sources of the Alashan Sand Seas in western Inner Mongolia, China during the Last Glacial Maximum and mid-Holocene Interpretation from modern analogues, paleoclimatic simulations and geological records	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES												Knowledge of moisture sources is of great significance for understanding climatic change and landscape evolution in desert environments. In this paper, we aim to clarify moisture origins for the Alashan (Alxa) Sand Seas (ALSS) in western Inner Mongolia and their transport pathways during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the mid-Holocene using modern analogues and paleoclimatic simulations. Precipitation data for the period 1959-2015 from meteorological stations in the study area and wind and specific humidity data from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) daily re-analysis were adopted to determine the moisture sources of summer precipitation in the ALSS. In addition paleoclimate simulations under PMIP3/CMIP5 protocols were used to detect the atmospheric circulation and precipitation at 21 ka BP and 6 ka BP over the ALSS. We also reviewed paleoclimate records from the ALSS to acquire a semi-quantitative re-construction of the moisture history during the late Pleistocene and Holocene. Our results suggest that the summer monsoon transported water vapor from the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea to the ALSS during July and August, causing increased precipitation. The dominant moisture source was from the southwest monsoon, while the East Asian summer monsoon also partly contributed to precipitation in the ALSS. The increased humidity during the period 8.2-4.2 ka BP in the ALSS, as derived from both climate simulation outputs and sedimentary records, was caused by monsoons according to the outputs of simulations. At 21 ka BP, the moisture sources of the ALSS were greatly associated with the prevailing westerlies.

The Fall (United Kingdom, 2013-) and Top of the Lake (United Kingdom/Australia/New Zealand/United States, 2013-) are two striking examples of TV crime dramas that frame their self-conscious interrogation of rape culture through digital media.

Since 1988, larger-than-usual flocks of eight species of diving ducks were observed at Point Pelee during autumn migration. Maximum one-day counts of the principal species, Lesser Scaup, Aythya affinis, were up to 90 times historical counts. The ducks also remained in the area for a longer-than-normal period. Examination of gizzard contents of eight specimens and observations of feeding behaviour indicated that the ducks actively feed on Zebra Mussels. The availability of a new food source has led to this recent change in autumn migratory behaviour by several species of diving ducks. Distribution patterns of diving ducks in other areas of the Great Lakes may change as the Zebra Mussel expands its range.																			0008-3550					JUL-SEP	1992	106	3					376	380																WOS:A1992LJ94200014

Habitat requirements and development optima are different for species belonging to the commonly recorded genusCladophora. The majorityCladophoraspecies are distributed throughout the world, in both the moderate and tropical zones. Of the species noted from Europe, only 15 are characterized for freshwaters, both flowing and standing. In small water bodies, these green algae are very common and occur almost everywhere: in lakes, dam reservoirs, large rivers occur mainly in the coastal littoral zone. A commonly occurring species of macroscopic green algae isCladophora glomerata. Habitat parameters have shown that the distribution pattern of filamentous green algae taxa is determined by two different gradients: (i) depth-temperature, light availability, oxygen concentration; and (ii) trophy-nitrate and orthophosphate concentration. A fast growth rate ofCladophorais very effective under good light condition and high concentration of nutrients. Species of the generaCladophorahave been determined to be early spring or summer organisms. The biomass ofCladophoracan be successfully applied as a raw material for production of value-added products. In this review,Cladophoraspecies are discussed in terms of their chemical composition, as well as potential applications in many areas, for example human and animal health, agriculture (organic fertilizers, biostimulants of plant growth, feed additives), environmental protection (bioindicator of pollution/contamination, sorbent of pollutants from wastewater), renewable source of energy (biogas, bioethanol), and high-tech composite materials.					; Michalak, Izabela/P-3770-2015	Messyasz, Beata/0000-0002-4371-3591; Michalak, Izabela/0000-0001-8084-9642													0921-8971	1573-5176				FEB	2021	33	1			SI		133	166		10.1007/s10811-020-02211-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-020-02211-3		SEP 2020											WOS:000565838800001

A 1-year intensive study of nutrient flows in Airthrey Loch, central Scotland, a small eutrophic [mean total phosphorus (TP) = 61.1 mu g Pl(-1)] well-flushed freshwater body (area, 6.9 ha; mean depth, 1.85 m; volume, 1.274 X 10(5) m(3); retention time, 0.44 yr), was undertaken. 2. The nutrient budget was dominated by large allochthonous P inputs, equivalent to an areal load to the loch of 8.56 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1), which occurred predominantly during winter. In the summer, when TP inputs were low, water column levels of TP still increased, as a result of aerobic P release from sediments. 3. Sorption experiments indicated potential for sediment P release at water P concentrations of up to 200 CLg Pl(-1) 4. Aerobic release rate of P from sediments to the water column of Airthrey Loch was estimated to be of the order of 1 mg P m(-2) day(-1), and occurred during periods of elevated water column pH. 5. Straw bales placed in the loch to retard algal blooms were found not to have any demonstrable impact on algal concentrations observed during the study.																			0046-5070					OCT	1996	36	2					411	418		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1996.00059.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1996.00059.x													WOS:A1996VM61200016
J	Woo, MK; Thorne, R				Woo, Ming-ko; Thorne, Robin			Summer Low Flow Events in the Mackenzie River System	ARCTIC												Most northern rivers experience recurrent low flow conditions in the summer (June to September), and rivers of the Mackenzie Basin are no exception. Low flow affects water supply, poses problems for river traffic, and can adversely affect aquatic ecology. Factors that affect summer low flow, which encompasses flows below specified discharge thresholds of concern, include evapotranspiration that leads to water loss from flow-contributing areas, antecedent high flow in which peak discharge is followed by gradual recession to low flow, rainfall and local glacier melt events that interrupt low discharge, replenishments of flow from upstream drainage networks, and arbitrary termination of summer low flow at the end of September. The storage mechanism of large lakes and the regulation effect of reservoirs can produce low flow regimes that differ from those exhibited by rivers without such storage functions. For most rivers, low flow events of longer duration cause larger deficits, and events with large deficits are accompanied by lower minimum discharge. The deficit-to-demand ratio measures the extent to which river flow fails to satisfy water needs. Applying this index to rivers of the Mackenzie drainage shows the hazard of streamflow drought in the basin. Low flow attributes can be summarized by their probability distributions: Gumbel distribution for minimum discharge of events and generalized exponential distribution for event duration. By fitting theoretical distributions to recorded events, one can estimate the probability of occurrence of low flow events that did not occur in the historical past.																			0004-0843	1923-1245				SEP	2016	69	3					286	304		10.14430/arctic4581	http://dx.doi.org/10.14430/arctic4581													WOS:000384994300007
J	Elliott, JE; Martin, PA				Elliott, JE; Martin, PA			Chlorinated hydrocarbon contaminants in grebes and seaducks wintering on the coast of British Columbia, Canada: 1988-1993	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Grebe and seaduck species were collected during late winter at industrial and reference sites along coastal British Columbia, and during spring migration in the Yukon Territory, from 1988 to 1993. Liver and/or breast muscle were analyzed for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), dibenzofurans (PCDFs), biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine (OC) pesticides, and chlorophenol-related compounds. Piscivorous species, including western grebes (Aechmophorus occidentails) and common mergansers (Mergus merganser), contained highest levels of all contaminants. DDE and PCBs were detectable in all species analyzed, but were at low levels (<50 and 100 mu g/kg [sum PCBs] wet weight, respectively) in all but some grebe and merganser samples. Highest DDE concentration (229 mu g/kg) was in liver of common mergansers collected at Port Alberni in 1989, and that of PCB (2300 mu g/kg) in breast muscle of western grebes collected in 1992 from the same site. The interspecific PCDD/PCDF pattern was similar to that of the OC pesticides and PCBs, with the fish-eating species containing highest concentrations. The only congener detected in all samples was 2,3,7,8-TCDF, although 2,3,7,8-TCDD was regularly present. Generally, of all samples collected in 1989, those from the bleached-kraft pulp mill (BKPM) site at Port Alberni were the most contaminated with PCDDs and PCDFs. Of the chlorophenolic compounds measured, only pentachlorophenol was routinely detected, typically at levels below 5 mu g/kg. Traces of 3,4,5,6-tetrachloroguaiacol, 5-chloroguaiacol and 4,5-dichloroguaiacol were also detected in a few samples, mainly from a BKPM site at Prince Rupert. By 1992, after changes to pulp mill bleaching processes and restrictions in chlorophenolic anti-sapstain use, PCDD and PCDF concentrations were substantially lower compared to 1989 in all species sampled and no longer posed a concern for human consumers. International TCDD-toxic equivalents (I-TEQs) in some western grebe samples were within the range of concentrations associated with sublethal effects in waterbird species (200-400 ng/kg).																			0167-6369					NOV	1998	53	2					337	362		10.1023/A:1005858800029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1005858800029													WOS:000076267400006

In late February and early March an overlapping succession of spawning runs, consisting of fish of different origins and ages, spawned in cool (8-12 degrees C) spring-fed tributaries of lakes Ohau and Benmore. The size, age, and sex compositions of the runs were highly variable. Mature fish ranged in age from 2 to 5 years and in length from 138 to 462 mm. Redds were constructed in gravel (15-30 mm diam.) in water 0.15-0.50 m deep, flowing at 0.20-0.50 m s(-1). Runs increased during the 1970s, reaching a peak number of over 18 000 in 1979. Dam construction that was completed in late 1979 blocked spawning migrations from Lake Benmore to Lake Ohau; spawning runs are now fewer than 100 fish per annum and may be insufficient to maintain the wild stock. Attempts to increase the spawning runs by liberating hatchery-reared juveniles and by the transfer of mature fish into warm (14-19 degrees C) rain-fed streams have failed, possibly because of the premature emergence of fry in mid winter.																			0028-8330					JUN	1995	29	2					257	269		10.1080/00288330.1995.9516659	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1995.9516659													WOS:A1995RQ16000011
J	AOKI, I				AOKI, I			MONTHLY VARIATIONS OF ENTROPY PRODUCTION IN LAKE BIWA	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Monthly entropy fluxes in the northern basin of Lake Biwa are calculated from the corresponding energy data of the lake. Net entropy flows into the lake are negative in all months. That is, the lakes absorbs ''negative entropy'' from its surroundings according to the terminology by Schrodinger: the lake is structured by its surroundings. From the net entropy flow and the change of entropy content, entropy production in the lake is estimated. Entropy production, which is positive in all months, is larger in summer and smaller in winter. The monthly entropy production (Sprod in units of MJ m-3 month-1 K-1) increases linearly with the monthly solar radiation energy absorbed by the lake (Esolar in units of MJ m-2 month-1); Sprod = a + bEsolar, a = 0.002 [MJ m-3 month-1 K-1], b = 0.60 .times. 10-4 [m-1 K-1]. The values (a,b) are holistic indices characterizing the lake from an entropy point of view. Another index (b'') simsilar to b is also introduced. Comparison of these indices in the northern basin of Lake Biwa (oligo-mesotrophic) with those in Lake Mendota (eutrophic) shows that processes of euthrophication or succession are accompanied by the increase of these entropy production indices.																			0304-3800	1872-7026				JUN	1990	51	3-4					227	232		10.1016/0304-3800(90)90067-Q	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3800(90)90067-Q													WOS:A1990DR11800005

Future conservation planning should be driven by an understanding of how cranes respond to environmental factors at degraded wetland sites and the changes in their spatio-temporal distribution. In recent years, the spatial and temporal distribution of waterbirds and determinant factors have become a research focus. However, research on the specific factors influencing the relative abundance of Hooded Cranes from multiple perspectives in the different habitat patches at Shengjin and Caizi Lakes is lacking. Therefore, from 2021 to 2022, we investigated the quantity and distribution of Hooded Cranes in the upper part of Shengjin and Baitu Lake part of Caizi Lakes. We considered multiple habitat variables, including patch size, food biomass, food availability, and human disturbance, and analyzed the dynamic changes in the distribution of the population in different wintering periods. We used model selection and averaging to select the best model and identify key variables. During different wintering periods, the spatio-temporal distribution of the crane population differed in the upper part of Shengjin Lake, but the crane was mainly distributed in the northern part of the Baitu Lake part of Caizi Lake. The model that included food biomass and patch size was the best for predicting the relative abundance of Hooded Cranes. Cranes foraged in areas with large patches and abundant food resources. Therefore, we suggest reserving patch integrity and availability in the current habitats and protecting and restoring the main food resources to provide high-quality habitat patches and plentiful food resources for wintering populations of Hooded Cranes.					; Zhou, Lizhi/AAF-4535-2021	Meng, Lei/0000-0002-5178-7611; 														1424-2818				DEC	2022	14	12							1091	10.3390/d14121091	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d14121091													WOS:000901041600001

Steelhead return rates and relative costs: A synthesis of three long-term stocking programs in two Minnesota tributaries of Lake Superior	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Hatchery augmentation of steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss was evaluated over 20 years in Minnesota tributaries of Lake Superior using three approaches - stocking fry or yearlings of a naturalized strain (STT), and yearlings of a domesticated strain (KAM). The SIT strain was introduced over 100 years ago and became naturalized to Lake Superior and its tributaries, unlike KAM, which has not been shown to reproduce successfully in streams. We compared smolt-adult return rates to anglers and in-river traps, and production costs per adult for these three programs in the French and Knife rivers. SIT smolts derived from stocked fry in the French River resulted in the highest smolt-adult return rates to traps and anglers (13.3%), and lowest cost per returning adult ($46). SIT stocked as yearling smolts produced the lowest return rate (1.5%) and highest cost per returning adult ($192) for both rivers combined. KAM stocked as yearling smolts were intermediate in return rate (2.6%) and cost per adult ($90). Differences in return rates of the three strains were attributable to the extent of domestication selection, size at stocking, season of stocking, and summer lake temperatures. Smolts derived from fry-stocked STT were strongly influenced by summer lake temperatures in their first lake year. Yearling-stocked SIT were influenced by size at stocking and summer lake temperatures. KAM yearlings benefitted from summer stocking at larger sizes. Based on poor survival and fiscal constraints, the SIT yearling program was discontinued. Stocking programs will continue to evolve according to changing biological, financial, social, and political pressures. (C) 2012 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

S	Brasier, AT		Dilek, Y; Furnes, H		Brasier, Alexander T.			Archaean Soils, Lakes and Springs: Looking for Signs of Life	EVOLUTION OF ARCHEAN CRUST AND EARLY LIFE	Modern Approaches in Solid Earth Sciences											Microbial life in Archaean non-marine settings like soils, lakes and springs would have faced several challenges. These would have included exposure to UV light; aridity, salinity and temperature changes; and nutrient availability. Current understanding is that none of these challenges would have been insurmountable. Microbial organisms of Archaean marine environments are likely to have been similar in their lifestyles and habits to those of the Archaean terrestrial world. Non-marine stromatolites, microbial filaments, microbial borings and microbially-induced sedimentary structures might therefore have been preserved. But Archaean subaerial surfaces would have been very prone to erosion by wind and rain, so the oldest fossil 'soils' of subaerially weathered surfaces (up to 3.47 Ga) are mostly identified using geochemistry. However, some ancient duricrusts like calcretes have been reported. Archaean lacustrine microbial life may have included stromatolites of the Tumbiana Formation of Western Australia. The case that these were lacustrine rather than marine is critically assessed, with the conclusion that the stratigraphy provides the strongest supporting evidence here. Archaean terrestrial hot springs, though often mentioned in origin of life studies, are not yet known from the rock record. In the Palaeoproterozoic to present these silica and carbonate-precipitating environments are commonly found in proximity to volcanic sediments and faults, where the deposits form terraced mounds, fissure ridges and hydrothermal lakes. It remains plausible that life could have existed and even evolved in these hypothesised Archaean hot-spring settings, and there is cause for optimism that the evidence for this might one day be found.

In this study, five ARGs and one mobile genetic element (intI1) and their relation with antibiotics, microbial communities and water quality were investigated in Ebinur Lake Basin, a typical salt-lake of China. Quantitative PCR analysis indicated that ARGs decreasing order in both surface water and sediment was sul1 sul2 >tetW>ermB>qnrS, which means sulfonamide resistance genes were the main pollution ARGs. Macrolide antibiotics were the predominant antibiotics in the surface water and sediment in winter, while sulfonamides and quinolones accounted for a high proportion in summer. There was a non-corresponding relationship between ARGs and antibiotics. Moreover, the relationship between ARGs and microbial communities were defined. Sulfonamide resistance genes were carried by a greater diversity of potential host bacteria (76 genera) than other ARGs (9 genera). And their positive correlation with intI1 (p < 0.05) which promotes their migration and provides possibility of their co-occurrence in bacterial populations (e.g., Nitrospira). Bacterial genera were the main driver of ARGs distribution pattern in highly saline lake sediment. Environmental factors like salinity, total nitrogen and organic matter could have a certain influence on the occurrence of ARGs by affecting microorganisms. The results systematically show the distribution and propagation characteristics of ARGs in typical inland salt-lakes in China, and preliminarily explored the relationship between ARGs and antibiotics, resistance genes and microorganisms in lakes in ecologically fragile areas.

GLOBAL WARMING WILL CHANGE THE THERMAL STRUCTURE OF LOUGH FEEAGH, A SENTINEL LAKE IN THE IRISH LANDSCAPE, BY THE END OF THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY	BIOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT-PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL IRISH ACADEMY												Recent developments in impact modelling of global warming on lakes have resulted in a greater understanding of how these vital ecosystems are likely to respond. However, there has been little quantitative analysis of this in an Irish context, despite the importance of lakes in the island's landscape. Here, we explore the impact of global warming on the hydrodynamics and thermal structure of a sentinel Irish lake under future climate scenarios. A 1D lake model, Simstrat, was calibrated and validated using water temperature data collected from Lough Feeagh, a site of long-term ecological research in the west of Ireland. Once validated, the model was then driven by daily climate model projections to generate informative thermal metrics for the time period of 2006-2099. Despite the moderating influence of the Atlantic, projections indicate that global warming will have a marked effect on the thermal structure of Feeagh, with surface water temperatures set to warm by 0.75 degrees C under a more stringent mitigation pathway (RCP 2.6) and 2.42 degrees C under a non-mitigation pathway (RCP 8.5).While warming was projected to be greatest in summer in the epilimnion, winter warming was greater than in other seasons in the hypolimnion. Stratification is projected to become more stable and earlier, and the growing season to be longer by 11 to 47 days, depending on mitigation pathways. Future studies could use a similar modelling workflow to investigate the possible implications of global warming on other Irish lakes, particularly those of specific societal importance or those of conservation interest.

Heavy cyanobacterial blooms occur in this highly turbid and shallow lake during summer and early autumn months, and excessive fish kills were observed after the blooms. The purpose of the present study was to characterize the zooplankton fauna of the pelagic food web to its relationship with selected water quality variables, and to evaluate its contribution to the food chain namely as abundance and diversity in a hypereutrophic shallow lake. Zooplankton and water samples were collected bimonthly at five stations from the open water of the lake between July 2010 and February 2012. During the study period a total of 48 taxa were recorded (3 taxa for Copepoda, 6 taxa for Cladocera, and 39 taxa for Rotifera). Rotifera was the most abundant group of the zooplankton community, comprising 81.2% of all samples, followed by Copepods 10.3% and Cladocerans 8.5%. Zooplankton community of the lake was dominated by eurytopic euplanktonic species Keratella cochlearis (21.8%). According to the Q(B/T) index, Lake Manyas showed a eutrophic character (Q(B/T)=2.3). The outcome of the statistical analysis showed that zooplankton fauna and its abundance were influenced mainly by water temperature, suspended particulate matter, and Secchi disk depth (transparency), respectively. The dense turbidity of Lake Manyas may be responsible for the elimination of sensitive organisms (larger sized cladocerans and copepods) over time, and also allow the dominancy of rotifers. Moreover cyanobacterial blooms affected crustaceans negatively, through poor food quality and harmful toxins. Temperature had a positive effect on rotifers as a result of population growth rates and available food. Consequently, the main factors that altered the composition and abundance of zooplankton in Lake Manyas were determined to be physical variables and favorable food availability.					köker, latife/AAB-7634-2020; , reyhan/AAB-8612-2020; Dorak, Zeynep/AAD-4903-2020; , merbay/AAB-9694-2020														1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	1A					834	845																WOS:000395724300033
J	Wen, LW				Wen, Liwei			EVALUATION THE PERFORMANCE OF LAKE WATER USED AS HEAT SOURCE FOR HEAT PUMP SYSTEM IN A TYPICAL JAPANESE RESIDENT BUILDING	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE												The surface water, such as lake-water, sea-water, reservoir-water is considered as one kind of unutilized energy because that they own higher temperature in winter and lower temperature in summer than the ambient air. The energy saving is expectable when the surface water is employed as the heat source of heat pump system. This study examines the potential of lake water used as heat source of heat pump system in a residential building. Annual heating and cooling loads of a typical Japanese residential building were calculated using thermal net-work model of SMASH. The load calculation results indicate that the heating load dominates in the residential building. In addition, the heating load tends to decrease and cooling load minimally varies with the rise in insulation level. The air conditioning is generally operated at low load level in exception of the occasional high load level at the starting running stage. In comparison with the air source heat pump and air conditioner, the predicted energy saving effect for lake water heat pump could attain 60-70% and 30-45% during the cooling and heating periods in different locations, respectively.

Total dissolved and bioavallable elements in water and sediment samples and their accumulation in Oreochromis mossambieus of polluted Manchar Lake	CHEMOSPHERE												The concentrations of 15 elements were determined in water, sediment and tissues of fish (Oreochromis mossambicus) collected from five sampling stations of Manchar Lake in 2005 for two successive seasons, winter (WS) and summer (SS). Elements analysis was performed by atomic absorption spectrometry with flame (FAAS) and electrothermal (ETAAS) modes, using multielement standard solution. The obtained results show that, the trace and toxic elements (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) and macronutrients (Al, Ca, K, Mg and Na) concentrations in lake water were above the recommended drinking water standards by WHO. Concentrations of Na detected in lake water in WS and SS, were in the range of 445.5-562.7 and 420.6-643.5 mg l(-1), respectively. While among toxic elements As concentration in both seasons, have been found in the range of 60.4-88.9 and 64.9-101.8 mu g 1(-1) respectively, these values are 6-10 times higher than the permissible limit of WHO. The mean concentrations of elements understudy in muscles of fish were found as 2.35, 1.39, 0.46, 2.3, 1517.9, 2.2, 2.4 and 188.9 mg kg(-1) for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb and Zn, respectively. High accumulation of toxic elements in fish tissues is indicating that some of the metal contaminants are entering the food chain. Correlations among the variables were identified by multivariate analysis. The extraction of elements from sediments with EDTA, to predict the bioavailability of trace and toxic elements, has shown that among them As, Cd and Zn were the most bioavailable elements in lake sediment.

Anticyclonic atmospheric circulation as an analogue for the warm and dry mid-Holocene summer climate in central Scandinavia	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Climate reconstructions from central Scandinavia suggest that annual and summer temperatures were rising during the early Holocene and reached their maximum after 8000 cal yr BP. The period with highest temperatures was characterized by increasingly low lake-levels and dry climate, with driest and warmest conditions at about 7000 to 5000 cal yr BP. We compare the reconstructed climate pattern with simulations of a climate model for the last 9000 years and show that the model, which is predominantly driven by solar insolation patterns, suggests less prominent mid-Holocene dry and warm period in Scandinavia than the reconstructions. As an additional explanation for the reconstructed climate, we argue that the trend from the moist early Holocene towards dry and warm mid-Holocene was caused by a changing atmospheric circulation pattern with a mid-Holocene dominance of summer-time anticyclonic circulation. An extreme case of the anticyclonic conditions is the persistent blocking high, an atmospheric pressure pattern that at present often causes long spells of particularly dry and warm summer weather, or "Indian summers". The argument is tested with daily instrumental temperature and precipitation records in central Sweden and an objective circulation classification based on surface air pressure over the period 1900-2002. We conclude that the differences between the precipitation and temperature climates under anticyclonic and non-anticyclonic conditions are significant. Further, warm and dry combination, as indicated by mid-Holocene reconstructions, is a typical pattern under anticyclonic conditions. These results indicate that the presented hypothesis for the mid-Holocene climate is likely valid.

A day in the life of winter plankton: under-ice community dynamics during 24 h in a eutrophic lake	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Although diel vertical migration (DVM) in aquatic systems may account for the largest daily migration of biomass globally, our understanding of this process under ice cover is limited, particularly in fresh water. The date of lake ice onset and duration of ice cover is declining globally, therefore determining the extent of plankton migrations under ice is imperative to inform our baseline understanding of seasonal differences in community structure and function, and how conditions may change over time. We investigated whether plankton exhibit DVM under ice and explored interactions between phytoplankton and zooplankton at highly resolved space-time scales across 24 h in a eutrophic system. Despite the dominance of motile taxa, phytoplankton remained vertically segregated based on morpho-functional groups throughout the sampling period. Daphnia mendotae exhibited size-structured DVM with an upward migration at sunset and sunrise, and midnight sinking, presumably to avoid the rise of predatory Chaoborus. We hypothesize that because overwintering daphnids require rich lipid stores, D. mendotae migrated to access small, lipid-rich phytoplankton that were limited to surface waters. Given our study took place during an unusually warm winter in a eutrophic system, our results may represent future under-ice dynamics under increasing eutrophication pressure and climate warming in shallow lakes.					; O'Malley, Brian P./O-9764-2018; Stockwell, Jason/HSC-4786-2023	Chiapella, Ariana/0000-0002-5043-2405; O'Malley, Brian P./0000-0001-5035-3080; 													0142-7873	1464-3774				NOV-DEC	2021	43	6					865	883		10.1093/plankt/fbab061	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbab061		SEP 2021											WOS:000729961900010

Samples of the water-bloom were found to be toxic using the mouse bioassay. No toxin was found free in the water as detected by HPLC and mouse bioassay. The toxic cells (minimum lethal dose 8-15 mg/kg body weight in mice) and purified toxin (minimum lethal dose 50 .mu.g/kg body weight in mice) showed signs of poisoning in laboratory rats and mice identical to that of other hepatotoxin-producing M. aeruginosa blooms and strains reported from other parts of the world. The toxin has chemical properties similar to the cyclic heptapeptide reported for a South African M. aeruginosa toxin. The toxin from Lake Akersvatn bloom material has a molecular weight of 994. The toxic bloom of M. aeruginosa persisted from August to November in 1984 and reappeared in July in 1985. While water from Lake Akersvatn was not used for municipal water supply during this period, the presence of toxic blue-green algae in a drinking water reservoir indicates the need to develop monitoring and detection methods for toxic cells and toxin(s).																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN 20	1987	144	2					97	103		10.1007/BF00014522	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00014522													WOS:A1987G013500001

In one study, five stations in the southern region of the lake were sampled monthly or bimonthly over a 6 year period (1994-1999). A distinct seasonal pattern was observed, with maximum biomass occurring in summer and early fall. Charophyte abundance was positively related to irradiance and negatively related to water depth. A second study took place in 1999-2000, before and after a managed lake drawdown in April, 2000. This whole-ecosystem experiment was designed to lower lake stage by similar to12.5% (0.6 m). We compared charophyte biomass at 42 stations throughout the lake prior to and after this managed recession and evaluated the influence of various environmental variables on growth. This analysis indicated that the recession resulted in increased transparency/bottom irradiance and greater charophyte biomass at nearshore stations. The data are consistent with prior studies, both in Lake Okeechobee and other lakes around the world, which indicate charophyte growth and abundance are strongly influenced by irradiance. We hypothesize that a positive feedback loop resulted in Lake Okeechobee when water levels were lowered, whereby shallower water allowed greater light penetration to the bottom, resulting in increased growth of submerged charophytes. Chara, in turn, probably stabilized sediments, leading to greater transparency and a further improvement of environmental conditions for plant recruitment and growth. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Jenkins, TM Jr; Diehl, S; Kratz, KW; Cooper, SD				Jenkins, TM Jr; Diehl, S; Kratz, KW; Cooper, SD			Effects of population density on individual growth of brown trout in streams	ECOLOGY												Some studies suggest that lotic populations of brown trout (Salmo trutta) are regulated through density-dependent mortality and emigration to the extent that mean growth rates of resident survivors are unrelated to trout densities. To test this, we studied the relationship between density and growth, mortality, and emigration of brown trout in two alpine streams and a set of stream channels in eastern California. We sampled trout at the scale of "segments" (5-31 m long riffles, runs, and pools) and "sections" (340-500 m in length) of Convict Creek over a 3-yr period. Trout were also sampled during 6 yr in seven 90-m sections of Mammoth Creek. For 2 yr, we manipulated trout densities in Convict Creek by removing trout from two sections and adding trout to two other sections. We also manipulated densities in seven 50-m stream channels, using a natural size distribution of trout in one year and underyearlings only in a second year. In both streams, average size (body length or mass) of underyearlings in fall was negatively related to trout density and was furthermore affected by sampling location and year. The strong, negative relationship between individual mass and density of trout could be detected at the spatial scale of whole sections, but not at the scale of individual segments. The Convict Creek and stream channel experiments also revealed strong negative effects of density on average mass of underyearlings in fall, and on proportional mass increase of yearling and older trout from spring to fall. In contrast, mortality and emigration were unrelated to initial stocking densities in the channels. In all our data, the negative effects on growth were most pronounced at densities <1 trout/m(2) and the growth-density relationships were well described by negative power curves. Large individuals were always less affected by increasing trout density than were small individuals, suggesting a competitive advantage of large over small trout that increased with density. We conclude that individual growth of brown trout in streams can be affected by trout density to an extent that suggests a substantial influence on population regulation. Results from our multiyear, multiscale, and experimental study indicate that density dependence in the growth of stream salmonids will be difficult to detect in purely observational data, especially in systems with relatively high fish densities (where the growth-density relationship has a flat slope), when data are collected and analyzed at small spatial scales, and when insufficient information is collected to assess the contribution of interannual variation in growth.

J	Wagner, T; Falter, CM				Wagner, T; Falter, CM			Response of an aquatic macrophyte community to fluctuating water levels in an oligotrophic lake	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												This study compares the species composition, biomass, and the influence of substrate composition on an aquatic macrophyte community in the meso-oligotrophic Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho under two winter drawdown regimes. Mean dry aquatic macrophyte biomass (AMB) in the drawdown zone (1.4 - 3.5 m) significantly increased from 39.9 g(.)m(-2) in 1990 to 99.2 g(.)m(-2) and 103.7 g(.)m(-2) with 2.1 m drawdowns in 1998 and 1999. Mean AMB deeper than 3.5 in did not significantly increase, suggesting the increased biomass in the drawdown zone can at least partially be attributed to increased winter survival. Myriophyllum sibiricum, Chara spp., and Potamogeton richardsonii were the most abundant aquatic macrophytes under the 3.5 in winter drawdown regime, while Chara spp., P berchtoldii, and P. crispus were most abundant under higher winter water levels. The exotic M. spicatum was present at one sample station and most prevalent in depths between 3.9-5.1 m. M. spicatum attained mean maximum densities in excess of 900 g(.)m(-2) by August, 1999 (one year after it was first observed in the lake). Logistic regression indicated a higher probability of finding clay and cobble substrates in the drawdown zone. On the clay substrates, there were significantly lower AMB (17.9 g(.)m(-2)) than on sand (86.6 g(.)m(-2)) or silt (129.0 g(.)m(-2)) substrata with no plants observed on gravel or cobble substrata.

To evaluate exposure rates in Catahoula Lake waterfowl 5 years after a ban on use of lead shot, we determined the prevalence of ingested shot and diets of canvasbacks (Aythya valisineria) and lesser scaup (A. affinis) salvaged from commercial fishing nets in winter 1992-93. Plant material composed >77% of the midwinter diet of canvasbacks. Consumption of belowground plant material (e.g., chufa flatsedge [Cyperus esculentus] and arrowhead [Sagittaria spp.] tubers) exceeded 47% in 1992-93, but was lower than in 1987-88. Male lesser scaup fed almost exclusively on plant material, especially bearded sprangletop (Leptochloa fascicularis) and millet (Echinochloa spp.). Prevalence of ingested lead or steel shot was similar in canvasbacks (38%) and lesser scaup (34%) in spite of differences in foraging behavior, suggesting that ducks actively selected shot as sit. Shot (lead or steel) prevalence in diving ducks at Catahoula Lake was similar in winters 1987-88 and 1992-93, but the proportion of birds with lead in their gizzards was greatly reduced in 1992-93 (6%) compared to 1987-88 (27%). Because ingestion of lead shot deposited in wetlands prior to steel shot regulations remains a problem at some sites, we suggest that provision of nontoxic grit may serve to reduce lend shot prevalence in waterfowl at contaminated sites.																			0022-541X					APR	1998	62	2					564	569		10.2307/3802330	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3802330													WOS:000073175200013
J	LAFONTAINE, N; MCQUEEN, DJ				LAFONTAINE, N; MCQUEEN, DJ			CONTRASTING TROPHIC LEVEL INTERACTIONS IN LAKE ST-GEORGE AND HAYNES LAKE (ONTARIO, CANADA)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Two small, adjacent kettle lakes in southern Ontario were sampled during spring and summer 1987. The data comprised weekly samples of zooplankton and water chemistry, monthly diel assessments of the densities of pelagic fish and zooplankton found at 1-m depth intervals in the water column, and an annual mark and recapture assessment of the entire fish population. The two lakes had very different community structures. Haynes Lake was characterized by high piscivore numbers, few planktivores, a relatively large assemblage of large bodied zooplankton, low chlorophyll a concentrations, and clear water. Lake St. George had a lower piscivore to planktivore ratio, smaller zooplankton, more chlorophyll a, and murkier water. Comparisons of trophic level biomasses for the two lakes suggested that in both communities, the relationships between piscivores and planktivores and between planktivores and zooplankton were strongly correlated with predator abundances. In the more oligotrophic community (Haynes Lake) this influence extended weakly to the phytoplankton, but in the more eutrophic system, little of the variability in chlorophyll a with respect to total phosphorus could be explained by total zooplankton (or Daphnia) abundance. This suggests that for freshwater pelagic communities, top-down effects may be stronger in more oligotrophic systems.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				MAR	1991	48	3					356	363		10.1139/f91-047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f91-047													WOS:A1991EZ78800002

This work presents the results of the first integrated assessment in the Inle Lake catchment aimed at understanding the surface and groundwater dynamics and the impact of agriculture and tourism on water quality. Results of an investigation performed in winter 2015, targeting the water chemical and isotopic (delta O-18(H2O) and delta O-18(H2O)) composition, and soil mineralogy, confirmed that Inle is an alkaline lake, where carbonate equilibria dominate its hydrochemistry. The high resilience of the lake to external perturbations is due to calcite precipitation, that represents an effective mechanism of P removal and, combined to the low residence time of water, prevents the accumulation of nutrients in lake waters. The investigation also permitted the first characterization of groundwater in the region, highlighting the dominance of Mg(Ca)-HCO3 facies. Two deep groundwater circulations could be evidenced: one of high temperature, Na-HCO3 type (Khaung Daing Hot Spring) and one in equilibrium with the dolomitic rocks of the basement, upwelling along a fault zone oriented N-S in the Northern part of the basin. The latter groundwater contributes to Inle lake by mixing with local recharge in the aquifer and by feeding the network of artificial channels created for reclamation purposes. Evidencing recharge mechanisms of both surface and groundwater makes it possible to highlight the impact of seasonal fluctuations of the water levels, and the associated flooding of some sectors of the catchment, on the Inle Lake agroecosystems and to evaluate possible scenarios for the future sustainable development of the region.					; Re, Viviana/O-1540-2019; Sacchi, Elisa/F-1293-2014	Re, Viviana/0000-0001-6002-0159; Sacchi, Elisa/0000-0003-2144-2927													0883-2927	1872-9134				MAY	2018	92						82	93		10.1016/j.apgeochem.2018.03.005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2018.03.005													WOS:000432195100008
J	Haglund, AL; Hillebrand, H				Haglund, AL; Hillebrand, H			The effect of grazing and nutrient supply on periphyton associated bacteria	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												The effects of nutrient additions and grazing by macro-invertebrates on periphyton-associated algae and bacteria were studied by performing an enclosure experiment on three occasions from early spring to summer at mesotrophic Lake Erken and Vaddo, at the Swedish Baltic coast. There were significant interactions between nutrient additions and grazing on bacterial biomass and specific activity in Lake Erken. Thus, the importance of either bottom-up or top-down effects could not be singled out. Bacterial biomass increased with enrichment only in the absence of grazers. Grazer presence tended to increase bacterial biomass in ambient nutrient conditions, but to decrease bacterial biomass under enrichment. For specific activity the positive response to enrichment was restricted to grazer presence. Hence, grazing by macro-invertebrates may have an indirect positive effect on bacterial activity by enhancing nutrient conditions through their feeding activities and/or fecal pellets production. In addition, we found a significant relationship between bacterial production and chlorophyll a at both sites. This relationship weakened in the presence of macro-invertebrates. Thus, the importance of internal nutrient regeneration by bacteria and algae decreased, possibly due to increased nutrient availability, in the presence of macro-invertebrate grazers.

J	Olson, MH				Olson, MH			Ontogenetic niche shifts in largemouth bass: Variability and consequences for first-year growth	ECOLOGY												The ontogeny of many size-structured organisms is marked by a series of niche shifts that divides a population into ecologically distinct stages. Consequently, overall population dynamics are affected both by processes operating within individual stages and by factors that influence transitions between stages. In largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), there is a diet shift from littoral invertebrates to fish that typically occurs sometime in their 1st yr. I examined factors that influenced this shift by tracking diet and growth trajectories of young-of-year (YOY) bass cohorts in several Michigan lakes over 2 yr. Cohorts differed in consumption rates of invertebrate prey, which led to an early divergence in bass growth among lakes. This variation in early growth had dramatic consequences for the timing of the shift to piscivory. In lakes with rapid growth in the invertebrate feeding stage, bass were able to gain a size advantage over YOY bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), their primary fish prey, which facilitated a shift to piscivory as soon as these bluegill became available as food. In contrast, slow growth during the invertebrate feeding stage reduced the size advantage of bass over bluegill and delayed or even prevented the shift to piscivory in the ist yr. Niche shifts in bass were also sensitive to environmental conditions ear ly in the growing season. In 1992, low temperatures caused a reduction in growth rates that prevented the establishment of a size advantage over bluegill in all but one lake. Bass grew much faster after switching to piscivory; thus the shift from invertebrates to fish strongly influenced sizes attained by YOY bass by autumn. Because survivorship of YOY bass is strongly size dependent (particularly through the first winter), the timing of the shift to piscivory may be important in determining survival and recruitment rates. Therefore, processes that operate on bass in the invertebrate feeding stage can influence the shift to piscivory, and this can potentially have important effects on the dynamics of the population as a whole.																			0012-9658	1939-9170				JAN	1996	77	1					179	190		10.2307/2265667	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2265667													WOS:A1996TR07900020
J	Merk, M; Goeppert, N; Goldscheider, N				Merk, Markus; Goeppert, Nadine; Goldscheider, Nico			Processes controlling spatial and temporal dynamics of spring water chemistry in the Black Forest National Park	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Spring water chemistry is influenced by many factors, including geology, climate, vegetation and land use, which determine groundwater residence times and water-rock interaction. Changes in water chemistry can have a profound impact on their associated ecosystems. To protect these ecosystems and to evaluate possible changes, knowledge of the underlying processes and dynamics is important. We collected water samples at 20 locations during 5 campaigns within the water catchment area of the upper Schonmunz river in the Black Forest National Park, Southwest Germany and analyzed them hydro-chemically for their contents of inorganic constituents, organic carbon content, fluorescence properties as well as several physicochemical field parameters and spring discharge. Results show that water chemistry is strongly dependent on geology and that the response of dissolved organic carbon to changes in hydraulic conditions is highly dynamic. Due to increased flow through the upper soil layer during and after rain events, more organic carbon is extracted from the soil and transported with the water. Fluorescence EEM measurements indicate an allochthonous source of this organic carbon. This study can be used as baseline to assess future changes and serve as a supplement to ongoing studies of the spring ecosystems. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

J	Xu, YY; Cai, QH; Ye, L; Shao, ML				Xu, Yaoyang; Cai, Qinghua; Ye, Lin; Shao, Meiling			Asynchrony of spring phytoplankton response to temperature driver within a spatial heterogeneity bay of Three-Gorges Reservoir, China	LIMNOLOGICA												The increased air temperature is expected to have important driver on spring phytoplankton dynamics. To test whether spatial heterogeneity modifies the synchronous responses of phytoplankton to regional temperature driver, we evaluate temporal coherences for physical factors (temperature, water stability and non-algal light extinction), nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and silicon), and biomass and density of phytoplankton by Pearson correlation analysis and synchrony for phytoplankton community dynamics by Mantel test and nonmetric multi-dimensional scaling (NMS), during spring bloom (February 23-April 28, 2005) within Xiangxi Bay, a high spatial gradient bay of Three-Gorges Reservoir (China). The high level of temporal coherences for surface water temperature (r=0.946, p<0.01) and relative water column stability (r=0.750, p<0.01) were found between pair sites (A and B), in which the increase trends occurred with increase in regional air temperature during the study period. However, the low synchrony for phytoplankton dynamics were indeed observed between Site A and B, especially for the density of common dominant taxa (Cyclotella spp.: r=0.155, p = 0.388) and community structure (Mantel test: r=0.351). Moreover, the local habitat characteristics such as nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) and non-algal light extinction showed low levels of temporal coherence. It indicated that local community of phytoplankton varies rather independently within the single lentic bay with high spatial heterogeneity and that dispersal of algal organisms among locations cannot overwhelm out these local dynamics. Contrary to many studies, the present results argued that, in a small geographic area (i.e., a single reservoir bay of approximately 24 km length), spatial gradients also may influence spring phytoplankton response to regional temperature driver.

We collected a single set of zooplankton and water chemistry data during a one-month time window (synchronized from south to north across the state) from an open water site in each basin as a means to minimize and standardize sampling effort and to minimize cascading effects arising from predator-prey interactions with resident and immigrant aquatic insect communities. We identified 53 taxa of zooplankton from 54 sites sampled across Wisconsin. There was an average of 6.83 taxa per site. The zooplankton species were distributed with a great deal of independence. We did not detect significant correlations between number of taxa and geographic region or waterbody size. There was a significant inverse correlation between number of taxa and the concentration of calcium ion, alkalinity and conductivity. One pair of taxa, Lynceus brachyurus and Chaoborus americanus, showed a significant difference in average duration of sites of their respective occurrence. All other pairs of taxa had no significant difference in average latitude, waterbody surface area, total phosphorus, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, alkalinity, conductivity, calcium ion, sulfate, nitrate, silicate or chloride. Taxa were distributed at random among the sites - there were no statistically significant pairs of taxa occurring together or avoiding each other. Multivariate analysis of zooplankton associations showed no evidence of distinct associations that could be used to distinguish lakes from wetlands. Zooplankton community structure appears to be a poor tool for distinguishing between lakes and wetlands, especially at the relatively large scale of Wisconsin (dimension of about 500 km). The data suggest that a small body of water in Wisconsin could be classified as a wetland if it persists in the spring and summer for only about 4 months, and if it is inhabited by Lynceus brachyurus, Eubranchipus bundyi, and if Chaoborus americanus and Chydorus brevilabris are absent.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					2001	445	1-3					37	50		10.1023/A:1017574316867	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017574316867													WOS:000169330700004
J	Qiao, BJ; Wang, JB; Huang, L; Zhu, LP				Qiao, Baojin; Wang, Junbo; Huang, Lei; Zhu, Liping			Characteristics and seasonal variations in the hydrochemistry of the Tangra Yumco basin, central Tibetan Plateau, and responses to the Indian summer monsoon	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												This study focuses on the characteristics, seasonal variations, and controlling mechanisms of the ionic composition of the Tangra Yumco basin for lake water, river water, and rainfall, which is located in the central Tibetan Plateau. The results showed that Na+ is the major cation in the lake water, Ca2+ is the major cation in the river water and rainfall, and HCO3- is the major anion in all the water samples. A comparison of the concentrations of calcium in the river water, lake water, and lake sediments reveal significant carbonate precipitation within the lake. The chemical composition of the lake water is mainly controlled by evaporation and crystallization, whereas the compositions of river water and rainfall are mainly controlled by carbonate weathering. Because the TDS content of the river water is lower than the lake water, the TDS content of the lake water is diluted, forming a decreasing trend during the beginning of the Indian summer monsoon. The lake water TDS content then increases rapidly from August to early September due to enhanced evaporation of the lake surface water and the introduction of a large amount of material carried by surface runoff. It then decreases slightly until December due to precipitation in the lake water and less input from the surroundings of the lake.					; Zhu, Liping/AAC-4284-2022; Wang, Junbo/IVH-8446-2023	Wang, Junbo/0000-0003-2335-519X; Zhu, Liping/0000-0002-4234-8748; 													1866-6280	1866-6299				FEB	2017	76	4							162	10.1007/s12665-017-6479-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-017-6479-y													WOS:000394965100024

There was considerable daily variation in the number of algae. Species [diversity] and abundance of members of the phyla Cyanophyta and Chlorophyta increased over the 3 yr. Chlorophyll-a content showed closer correlation with seston content than with the number of algae. Some phenomena connected with the eutrophication of Lake Balaton are discussed. The phasic nature of seasonal succession is pointed out and some effects of the wind on the shallow lake are mentioned.

Limnological changes and chironomid-inferred summer air temperature from the Late Pleniglacial to the Early Holocene in the East Carpathians	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Here we provide the first chironomid record and associated summer air-temperature (T-VII) reconstruction between ca. 16,800-9100 cal yr BP from Lake Saint Anne (SZA), situated in the Eastern Carpathians. SZA was formed by the youngest volcanic eruption of Ciomadul volcano at ca. 29,600 cal yr BP. Our main goals in this study are to test whether warming after Heinrich event 1 (H1; ca. 16,200 cal yr BP) had similar amplitude to the late glacial warming, while Younger Dryas (YD) summers remained relatively warm in this region of Europe. We found the most remarkable chironomid assemblage change with a T-VII increase of similar to 3.5-3.8 degrees C at ca. 16,350 cal yr BP at SZA, followed by another slight T-VII increase of similar to 0.8-1.0 degrees C at ca. 14,450 cal yr BP. Only very minor temperature variations were recorded between 14,450 cal yr BP and 11,700 cal yr BP, with an unexpected T-VII decrease in the Early Holocene. Variations in water depth together with increasing analogue problems and paludification from ca. 14,200 cal yr BP onwards may have influenced the reliability of our paleotemperature record obtained from SZA. In addition, Sphagnum-indicated decreasing pH, and hence decreasing nutrient level, likely overrode the effect of summer air-temperature changes during the Early Holocene, and this may explain the bias in the chironomid-inferred summer air-temperature reconstruction in the Early Holocene section.					; Vincze, Ildiko/AAB-1276-2019; Magyari, Eniko/I-5568-2017; Heiri, Oliver/JCE-4598-2023	Heiri, Oliver/0000-0002-3957-5835; Magyari, Eniko/0000-0002-2844-8937; 													0033-5894	1096-0287				JAN	2022	105						151	165		10.1017/qua.2021.36	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/qua.2021.36													WOS:000749708100011

Synoptic observation reports from the two countries confirmed that spring 2012 had the lowest number of dust events in 2000-2012. The monthly dust frequency (DF) in March 2012 over the dust source regions, i.e., deserts in northern China and Mongolia, indicated a significant decrease compared to the 12 year (2000-2011) March climatology. The DF in April 2012 was comparable to the 12 year climatology values, but in May 2012 it was slightly lower. The daily Ozone Monitoring Instrument Aerosol Index and the Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System simulations revealed stagnant dust movement in March and May 2012. Anomalous anticyclones north of the source regions decreased the dust outbreaks and enhanced the southeasterly winds, resulting in few dust events over the downwind countries (i.e., South Korea and Japan). By contrast, in April 2012, a strong anomalous cyclone east of Lake Baikal slightly increased the dust outbreaks over northeastern China. However, the major dust outbreaks were not transported downwind because of exceptional dust pathways, i.e., the southeastward pathway of dust transport was unusually blocked by the expansion of an anomalous anticyclonic circulation over the Sea of Okhotsk, with dust being transported northeast.

C. Pat, III			Multi-proxy record of Holocene paleoenvironmental conditions from Yellowstone Lake, Wyoming, USA	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												A composite 11.82 m-long (9876--67 cal yr BP) sediment record from Yellowstone Lake, Wyoming was analyzed using a robust set of biological and geochemical proxies to investigate the paleoenvironmental evolution of the lake and its catchment in response to long-term climate forcing. Oxygen isotopes from diatom frustules were analyzed to reconstruct Holocene climate changes, and pollen, charcoal, diatom assemblages, and biogenic silica provided information on terrestrial and limnological responses. The long-term trends recorded in the terrestrial and limnic ecosystems over the last 9800 years reflect the influence of changes in the amplification of the seasonal cycle of insolation on regional climate. The early Holocene (9880-6700 cal yr BP) summer insolation maximum and strengthening of the northeastern Pacific subtropical high-pressure system created warm dry conditions and decreasing summer insolation in the middle (6700-3000 cal yr BP) and late (3000--67 cal yr BP) Holocene resulted in progressively cooler, wetter conditions. Submillenial climate variation is also apparent, with a wetter/cooler interval between 7000 and 6800 cal yr BP and warmer and/or drier conditions from 4500 to 3000 cal yr BP and at ca. 1100 cal yr BP. These data show that the Yellowstone Lake basin had a climate history typical of a summer-dry region, which helps to better define the spatial variability of Holocene climate in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.

J	STAUFFER, RE; WITTCHEN, BD				STAUFFER, RE; WITTCHEN, BD			ALKALINITY REGULATION IN MAINE HEADWATER LAKES - TERRESTRIAL VS LACUSTRINE CONTRIBUTIONS IN SUMMER	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Twenty-seven Maine lakes in felsic terrane were sampled in May and October 1986, bracketing the summer interval of minimum flushing, in order to statistically test a hydrogeochemical process model that separates Gran alkalinity (ANC) production into terrestrial vs lacustrine components. Significant ANC increases over the 5 mo were restricted to relatively shallow lakes with large contiguous watersheds, and/or lakes where contact zones in the local bedrock offered increased potential for summer groundwater inflow. Summer ANC increases depended mainly on terrestrial contributions; in-lake alkalinity generation was 16 +/- 5 meq m-2 over 5 mo, of which ca. 11 meq m-2 resulted from biological assimilation of directly-deposited nitrate-N. The remaining 5 +/- 5 meq m-2 cannot be assigned with confidence, but is thought to reflect lacustrine sulfate reduction. The over-summer changes in ANC and conductance of Maine headwater lakes in upland granitic terrane approached statistical detection limits resulting from pure analytical and sampling error. This convergence highlights the importance of even small analytical biases when analyzing limnological time series, and confirms the utility (statistical efficiency) of the one-time, comparative sampling design adopted during the U.S. EPA's Eastern Lake Survey (ELS).																			0049-6979					MAR	1992	62	1-2					57	73		10.1007/BF00478453	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00478453													WOS:A1992HE15900005

Variations of its level are indicative of the climate variations in the region. Here, we present the decadal- to centennial-resolution Holocene lake-level curve of the Dead Sea. Then we determine the regional hydroclimatology that affected level variations. To achieve this goal we compare modem natural lake-level variations and instrumental rainfall records and quantify the hydrology relative to lake-level rise, fall, or stability. To quantify that relationship under natural conditions, rainfall data pre-dating the artificial Dead Sea level drop since the 1960s are used. In this respect, Jerusalem station offers the longest uninterrupted pre- 1960s rainfall record and Jerusalem rains serve as an adequate proxy for the Dead Sea headwaters rainfall. Principal component analysis indicates that temporal variations of annual precipitation in all stations in Israel north of the current 200 mm yr(-1) Average isohyet during 1940-1990 are largely synchronous and in phase (similar to70% of the total variance explained by PC1). This station also represents well northern Jordan and the area all the way to Beirut, Lebanon, especially during extreme drought and wet spells. We (a) determine the modem, and propose the past regional hydrology and Eastern Mediterranean (EM) climatology that affected the severity and length of droughts/wet spells associated with multiyear episodes of Dead Sea level falls/rises and (b) determine that EM cyclone tracks were different in average number and latitude in wet and dry years in Jerusalem. The mean composite sea level pressure and 500-mb height anomalies indicate that the potential causes for wet and dry episodes span the entire EM and are rooted in the larger-scale northern hemisphere atmospheric circulation. We also identified remarkably close association (within radiocarbon resolution) between climatic changes in the Levant, reflected by level changes, and culture shifts in this region.

In this study, a 2.65 m high palaeo lake sedimentary profile from the Kumaun Lesser Himalaya, Uttarakhand State, India was pollen analysed to reconstruct the variability in the monsoonal precipitation during the Middle Holocene. The study revealed that between similar to 7522 and 7216 cal yr BP, conifers dominated mixed broad-leaved forests occurred around the landscape of the study area, indicating a less cold and dry climate with decreased monsoon precipitation. Broad-leaved taxa during this phase show increased values considerably, indicating amelioration in climatic condition, which could be, in global perspective, broadly falling within the time-interval of the Holocene Climate Optimum (HCO; 7000-4000 BP). Between similar to 7216 and 6526 cal yr BP, dense conifers-dominated mixed broad-leaved forests transformed the conifers-dominated broad-leaved forests around the study area under a cold and drier climate with further reduction in monsoon precipitation. Subsequently, between similar to 6526 and 5987 cal yr BP, conifers-dominated broad-leaved forests continued to grow, but with lesser frequencies, around the study area under a comparatively less cold and dry climate with reduced monsoon precipitation. Finally, between similar to 5987 and 5817 cal yr BP, the frequencies of conifers-dominated broad-leaved forests further decreased around the landscape of the study area under a comparatively lesser cold and dry climate, probably indicating decreased monsoonal precipitation. Hence, the present study mainly showed the dominance of conifers forests around the study area between similar to 7522 and 7216 cal yr BP, similar to 7216 and 6526 cal yr BP, similar to 6526 and 5987 cal yr BP and between similar to 5987 and 5817 cal yr BP; however, broad-leaved forests also demonstrated increasing tendency between similar to 7522 and 7216 cal yr BP in the milieu of cold and dry climates. Moreover, the study also revealed that a lake was formed around 7522 cal yr BP along the Kulur River, a tributary of Saryu River around the study area and existed until 5817 cal yr BP.

J.; Chenwei, Su			Spatial and temporal variability in dissolved inorganic nitrogen fluxes at the sediment-water interface in lake illawarra, Australia	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												In this study, benthic flux measurements of inorganic nitrogen (i.e., NH4+, NO2- + NO3-) were made using a batch incubation system at different stations (i.e., shallow sandy macrophyte and unvegetated beds, and deep central mud) over four seasons in Lake Illawarra, NSW, Australia, to study the influence of different primary producers (i.e., seagrasses, micro-phytobenthos (MPB) and macroalgae) and/or different sediment types (i. e., sand or mud) on the benthic fluxes. In general, nutrient fluxes displayed typical diel variations, with lower flux out of sediments (release) or enhanced uptake by the sediment in the light, due to the photosynthetic activities of the plant-MPB- sediment community in Lake Illawarra during photosynthetic periods. A distinct seasonal pattern of inorganic-N fluxes was also observed (e. g., the marked difference between summers 2002 and 2003). This may be explained by the seasonal variations in the biomass and activity (growing or decay phases) of MPB, sea-grass and macroalgae, which may influence their nutrient assimilation and alter the chemical conditions of surface sediments that influence the benthic geochemical processes and thus benthic nutrient fluxes. On an annual basis, unvegetated sediments displayed net DIN effluxes, while seagrass beds showed a net DIN uptake, and the highest DIN uptakes coincided with the largest standing crop of seagrass and/or macroalgae and the highest levels of benthic community production. This may be due to the enhanced denitrification and/or assimilation activity by rooted plants and macroalgae, and the effect is most efficient during periods of net growth (e. g., in Spring 2002).

Even though our ability to locate meteorite falls continues to improve, the recovery of meteorites remains a challenge due to large search areas with terrain and vegetation obscuration. To improve the efficiency of meteorite recovery, we have tested the hypothesis that meteorites can be located using machine learning techniques and an autonomous drone. To locate meteorites autonomously, a quadcopter drone first conducts a grid survey acquiring top-down images of the strewn field from a low altitude. The drone-acquired images are then analyzed using a machine learning classifier to identify meteorite candidates for follow-up examination. Here, we describe a proof-of-concept meteorite classifier that deploys off-line a combination of different convolution neural networks to recognize meteorites from images taken by drones in the field. The system was implemented in a conceptual drone setup and tested in the suspected strewn field of a recent meteorite fall near Walker Lake, Nevada.					; Devillepoix, Hadrien/MHQ-1632-2025	Devillepoix, Hadrien/0000-0001-9226-1870; Citron, Robert/0000-0001-8920-0356													1086-9379	1945-5100				JUN	2021	56	6					1073	1085		10.1111/maps.13663	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/maps.13663		JUN 2021											WOS:000659252800001

The results of an Atmosphere Global Circulation Model (AGCM) sensitivity experiment show that the repeated occurrence of mega-lake phases during the Pleistocene, and the strong monsoon flow that this implies, can be related to Milankovitch insolation forcing. The AGCM experiment is centred on the Southern Hemisphere low-latitude, summer insolation high of 115,000 years ago. The details of the results indicate a strong response of the Australian monsoon to the higher insolation at that time, with a longer monsoon season, increased precipitation and higher resultant runoff than at present.					; Valdes, Paul/T-2004-2019	Valdes, Paul/0000-0002-1902-3283; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				DEC 26	2003	30	24							2279	10.1029/2003GL018486	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2003GL018486													WOS:000187864900003

'Living-tree' chronologies were extended using 'subfossil' samples extracted from nearshore lake sediments resulting in a composite chronology > 800 years in length. The North Cairngorms (NCAIRN) reconstruction was developed from a set of composite blue intensity high-pass and ring-width low-pass filtered chronologies with a range of detrending and disturbance correction procedures. Calibration against July-August mean temperature explains 56.4% of the instrumental data variance over 1866-2009 and is well verified. Spatial correlations reveal strong coherence with temperatures over the British Isles, parts of western Europe, southern Scandinavia and northern parts of the Iberian Peninsula. NCAIRN suggests that the recent summer-time warming in Scotland is likely not unique when compared to multi-decadal warm periods observed in the 1300s, 1500s, and 1730s, although trends before the mid-sixteenth century should be interpreted with some caution due to greater uncertainty. Prominent cold periods were identified from the sixteenth century until the early 1800s-agreeing with the so-called Little Ice Age observed in other tree-ring reconstructions from Europe-with the 1690s identified as the coldest decade in the record. The reconstruction shows a significant cooling response 1 year following volcanic eruptions although this result is sensitive to the datasets used to identify such events. In fact, the extreme cold (and warm) years observed in NCAIRN appear more related to internal forcing of the summer North Atlantic Oscillation.

Therefore, its riparian forest is considered an area of permanent preservation, which aims to protect the water, as well as the spring, from consequences of disordered population growth, added to deficient basic sanitation systems, climate change, agricultural activities, inappropriate land uses, unplanned urbanization, and diffuse sources of pollution. In addition to compromising water quality, many of these factors affect the permanence of water upwelling at the source, compromising the formation and continuity of streams, lakes, and rivers. In this context, the objective of the present research was to carry out a bibliographic review on water springs, approaching adjacent themes to the main axis of the study that are fundamental for a deep understanding of their importance for the maintenance of water resources and ensuring biodiversity in the search for the sustainability of life for present and future generations.

Carbonate isotopes from high altitude Tso Moriri Lake (NW Himalayas) provide clues to late glacial and Holocene moisture source and atmospheric circulation changes	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												High resolution isotopic (delta O-18 and delta C-13) investigations on endogenic carbonates (calcite/aragonite) from Tso Moriri Lake, NW Himalaya show dramatic fluctuations during the late glacial and the early Holocene, and a persistent enrichment trend during the late Holocene. Changes in this lake are largely governed by the [input (meltwater + monsoon precipitation)/evaporationj (WE) ratio, also reflected in changes in the carbonate mineralogy with aragonite being formed during periods of lowest I/E. Using new isotopic data on endogenic carbonates in combination with the available data on geochemistry, mineralogy, and reconstructed mean annual precipitation, we demonstrate that the late glacial and early Holocene carbonate delta O-18 variability resulted from fluctuating Indian summer monsoon (ISM) precipitation in NW Himalaya. This region experienced increasing ISM precipitation between ca. 13.1 and 11.7 cal ka and highest ISM precipitation during the early Holocene (11.2-8.5 cal ka). However, during the late Holocene, evaporation was the dominant control on the carbonate delta O-18. Regional comparison of reconstructed hydrological changes from Tso Moriri Lake with other archives from the Asian summer monsoon and westerlies domain shows that the intensified westerly influence that resulted in higher lake levels (after 8 cal ka) in central Asia was not strongly felt in NW Himalaya.

Warming trend in winter and wetting trend in summer are most remarkable, at rates of 0.44 degrees C/ decade and 6.44mm/decade respectively. The warming-wetting change is most remarkable in the southern mountain region of the LBB. The change of precipitation had a great impact on runoff The temperature variation can influence evaporation and glacial melting, which in turn leads to runoff change. Using the method of slope change ratio of cumulative quantity(SCRCQ), we calculated the contributions from precipitation, evaporation, and human activities to the entire runoff change in all river sections, and the contributions were 51.22 %, -9.07 %, and 57.85 %, respectively. The water level in the Balkhash Lake has been affected by climatic and hydrologic variables (including air temperature, precipitation, and runoff), human activity, and combinations of the two.

J	Musicz, L; Faragó, S				Musicz, Laszlo; Farago, Sandor			Significance of the local anthropogenic effects in the dynamics of wild geese wintering on the Ramsar Site Lakes by Tata (Wetland City Tata)	ORNIS HUNGARICA												The Old Lake of Tata, an important wild goose roosting site in Central Europe, is unique in its location being in the middle of a city with a population of 24,000. Consequently, the site is subject to intensive human disturbances. Goose migration and wintering on the lake was studied for over 37 years (1984-2021). In addition to weather, hydrological, and feeding conditions, particular attention was focused on human influences (which were deemed generally disruptive, but also beneficial in some cases) that can induce significant changes in the population dynamics of the 30,000-50,000 wild geese from 13 species wintering here. Almost without exception, the largest observed changes in the abundance of wild geese roosting overnight on the Old Lake are due to anthropogenic effects. In the majority of cases, the most significant population changes are due to impacts associated with the operation and upkeep of the lake and the New Year's Eve fireworks. As a result, the winter operation of the Old Lake has been regulated by the Wild Goose Preference Mode since 2011, and the City of Tata has banned the use of fireworks during the winter period since 2018. Consequently, the conditions for wild goose migration have improved significantly. However, the situation of the Old Lake is still quite fragile and more conservation measures are needed to protect it further.																			1215-1610	2061-9588				DEC	2021	29	2					1	24		10.2478/orhu-2021-0016	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/orhu-2021-0016													WOS:000729450000001

Comparing the response of a catchment-lake model chain to climate predictions	CLIMATIC CHANGE												We constructed a model chain into which regional climate-related variables (air temperature, precipitation) and a lake's main tributary hydrological indicators (river flow, dissolved inorganic carbon) were employed for predicting the evolution of planktonic blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) and zooplankton (rotifer) biomass in that lake for the mid-21st century. Simulations were based on the future climate predicted under both the Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios which, combined with three realistic policy-making and basin land-use evolution lead to six scenarios for future water quality. Model outputs revealed that mean annual river flow is expected to decline between 3 and 20%, depending on the scenario. Concentration of river dissolved inorganic carbon is predicted to follow the opposite trend and might soar up to twice the 2005-2014 average concentration. Lake planktonic primary producers will display quantitative changes in the future decades whereas zooplankters will not. A 2 to 10% increase in mean cyanobacteria biomass is accompanied by a stagnation (-3 to +2%) of rotifer biomass. Changes in cyanobacteria and rotifer phenology are expected: a surge of cyanobacteria biomass in winter and a shortening of the rotifer biomass spring peak. The expected quantitative changes on the biota were magnified in those scenarios where forested area conversions to cropland and water abstraction were the greatest.

J	Stockwell, JD; Johnson, BM				Stockwell, JD; Johnson, BM			Field evaluation of a bioenergetics-based foraging model for kokanee (Oncorhynchus nerka)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES					Symposium on Space, Time, and Scale - New Perspectives in Fish Ecology and Management held at the 127th Annual Meeting of the American-Fisheries-Society	AUG, 1997	MONTEREY, CALIFORNIA	Amer Fisheries Soc				We used a bioenergetics-based foraging model to determine if bioenergetic and foraging constraints could explain kokanee (Oncorhynchus nerka) diel vertical migration in Blue Mesa Reservoir, Colorado. We compared model predictions of daily growth and migration strategies with observed growth and diel vertical distributions on three dates during the summer. Results suggest that bioenergetic and foraging constraints were not sufficient to explain diel vertical migration early in the summer, when thermal stratification was weak. However, these constraints could explain observed patterns later in the summer, when optimal thermal habitat for kokanee was spatially segregated from food-rich surface waters. The onset of a strong thermocline, and its exclusion of piscivorous lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) from surface waters, appeared to determine the relative importance of predation risk for kokanee diel vertical migration patterns. Our observations and modeling results suggest that the relative importance of various factors driving diel vertical migration changes seasonally. Furthermore, the relative importance of each factor likely varies from system to system and may have caused the variety of single-factor hypotheses proposed to explain kokanee diel vertical migration. The model provides a framework for studying diel vertical migration across systems of differing thermal regimes, productivity, and predation pressures.

Bi-weekly collections were made at 20 stations in the lake and 16 in the reservoir. Water temperature and dissolved O2 were measured at each station. On 1 occasion, samples of water and sediment were collected from each habitat. Glyptotendipes paripes, Chironomus crassicaudatus and C. decorus predominated among the collected species. G. paripes represented 63% and C. crassicaudatus 18% of the total collections made in the lake. The monthly compositions ranged from < 1-97% for the former and < 1-87% for the latter species. Their density in the lake varied from < 100-6000/m2 and < 10-1800/m2, respectively. Tanypodinae constituted 15% of the total larvae; their density fluctuated between 20 and 500/m2 over the study period. In the reservoir, G. paripes formed 80% of the total collections with monthly compositions of 40-97% and density ranging from 300-8000/m2. C. decorus composed 16% of the total larvae. Its density fluctuated from 5-2000/m2. The spring and summer increases of G. paripes demonstrate significant correlations (r = +0.78 lake and +0.72 reservoir) with changes in water temperature. The consistently higher number of G. paripes in the resorvoir than in the lake may have been due to a higher (3.degree.-5.degree. C) water temperature in the reservoir. Significant spatial variations existed in the N, P and C concentrations in water and substrates in each habitat.

Phosphorus Cycling and Burial in Sediments of a Seasonally Hypoxic Marine Basin	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Recycling of phosphorus (P) from sediments contributes to the development of bottom-water hypoxia in many coastal systems. Here, we present results of a year-long assessment of P dynamics in sediments of a seasonally hypoxic coastal marine basin (Lake Grevelingen, the Netherlands) in 2012. Sequential phosphorus extractions (SEDEX) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) indicate that P was adsorbed to Fe-(III)-(oxyhydr) oxides when cable bacteria were active in the surface sediments in spring. With the onset of summer hypo x i a, sulphide-induced dissolution of the Fe-(III)-(oxyhydr) oxides led to P release to the pore water and overlying water. The similarity in authigenic Ca-P concentrations in the sediment and suspended matter suggest that Ca-P is not formed in situ. The P burial efficiency was <= 32%. Hypoxia-driven sedimentary P recycling had a major impact on the water-column chemistry in the basin in 2012. Water-column monitoring data indicate up to ninefold higher surface water concentrations of phosphate in the basin in the late 1970s and a stronger hypoxia-driven seasonal P release from the sediment. The amplified release of P from the sediment in the past is attributed to the presence of a larger pool of Fe-bound P in the basin prior to the first onset of hypoxia. Given that P is not limiting, primary production in the basin has not been affected by the decadal changes in P availability and recycling over the past 40 years. The changes in P dynamics on decadal time scales were not recorded in sediment profiles of total P or organic C/total P.

Elucidating controls on cyanobacteria bloom timing and intensity via Bayesian mechanistic modeling	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The adverse impacts of harmful algal blooms (HABs) are increasing worldwide. Lake Erie is a North American Great Lake highly affected by cultural eutrophication and summer cyanobacterial HABs. While phosphorus loading is a known driver of bloom size, more nuanced yet crucial questions remain. For example, it is unclear what mechanisms are primarily responsible for initiating cyanobacterial dominance and subsequent biomass accumulation. To address these questions, we develop a mechanistic model describing June-October dynamics of chlorophyll a, nitrogen, and phosphorus near the Maumee River outlet, where blooms typically initiate and are most severe. We calibrate the model to a new, geostatistically-derived dataset of daily water quality spanning 2008-2017. A Bayesian framework enables us to embed prior knowledge on system characteristics and test alternative model formulations. Overall, the best model formulation explains 42% of the variability in chlorophyll a and 83% of nitrogen, and better captures bloom timing than previous models. Our results, supported by cross validation, show that onset of the major midsummer bloom is associated with about a month of water temperatures above 20 degrees C (occurring 19 July to 6 August), consistent with when cyanobacteria dominance is usually reported. Decreased phytoplankton loss rate is the main factor enabling biomass accumulation, consistent with reduced zooplankton grazing on cyanobacteria. The model also shows that phosphorus limitation is most severe in August, and nitrogen limitation tends to occur in early autumn. Our results highlight the role of temperature in regulating bloom initiation and subsequent loss rates, and suggest that a 2 degrees C increase could lead to blooms that start about 10 days earlier and grow 23% more intense.

J	Borduqui, M; Ferragut, C				Borduqui, Murilo; Ferragut, Carla			Factors determining periphytic algae succession in a tropical hypereutrophic reservoir	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of cyanobacterial blooms on periphyton algal succession and to identify the factors determining community dynamics in a tropical hypereutrophic reservoir. A variety of factors affecting periphytic community structure were identified at two different sites with domestic sewage and spring water inflows and two climatic periods. Microscope glass slides were used to assess periphyton growth. Sampling was carried out at short regular intervals (3-5 days) over 30 days. Climatic periods were limnologically distinct. The rainy period was characterized by an intense cyanobacterial bloom and the dry period by a less intense bloom. Periphyton biomass and growth tended to increase with colonization time during the dry period. Cyanobacteria and Bacillariophyceae were the most representative groups in the rainy period whereas Bacillariophyceae was dominant in the dry period. Community species had successional patterns in both climatic periods. The successional trajectory for sites 1 (domestic sewage) and 2 (spring water) was different in the dry period but similar in the rainy period. We concluded that the community structure over 30 days of colonization under hypereutrophic conditions was primarily determined by seasonal scale (bloom intensity), followed by successional scale (autogenic), and, finally, by the local scale (spring water and sewage inflow). Positive periphyton biological response (higher biomass and algal growth, dominance of diatoms, Cyanobacteria reduction) during small variations of bloom intensity may indicate rapid re-establishment of the community during recovery of the ecosystem.

They are usually small lakes but often displaying a high relative depth, located in active gypsum karst areas, with a high saturation of Ca2+ and SO42- in its waters. These lakes can usually stratify from spring to early autumn when the depth is high enough, then a sulphide-rich anoxic hypolimnion can develop in deep layers. So far, neither a comprehensive scientific definition of their ecological characteristics nor an exhaustive catalogue of their occurrence in a particular territory are available. This paper delves on their biotic and abiotic features needed for their identification as an ecosystem type. A proper methodology was also designed and applied for the evaluation of their conservation status, with the definition of reference values and assessment methods following the criteria of the Habitats Directive. The Spanish karstic lakes on gypsum (THCI 3190) were here identified, statistically representative sites were selected, and spatial GIS methods and multimetric indices were applied to assess the range, area, structure and function, and future prospects of this Habitat Type, as requested for the reporting according to Article 17 of the Habitats Directive. Results showed a favourable conservation status of this habitat type in the Alpine and Atlantic regions of Spain, but unfavourable-inadequate status in the Mediterranean, due to the pressures and impacts acting on some specific sites. A critical analysis of the methodologies and the values obtained for its conservation status was carried out.

High levels of sulfate can cause adverse effects on aquatic organisms. In this study we explored the effects of sulfate on the reproduction of two coregonine species, whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus (L.)) and vendace (Coregonus albula (L.)), in Baltic Sea brackish water and soft boreal freshwater. The chronic toxicity tests lasted from fertilization to hatching of the larvae, endpoints being embryonic and larval survival, and size of newly hatched larvae. The chronic 196-214-day tests were conducted in different sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) solutions at water temperatures simulating natural conditions during the egg incubation from autumn to spring. The separate fertilization tests were carried out to measure fertilization success (%). The fertilization and early embryonic phase were found to be the most sensitive periods for sulfate toxicity. The survival in late embryonic phase, hatching and 5-day larval phase was high (>80%). In the acute fertilization tests with brackish water populations, the LC50-values were between 2554 and 2575 mg/L and with freshwater populations between 1107 and 1230 mg/L of sulfate. In the chronic experiments from fertilization to hatching the LC10-values for brackish water populations were between 1800 and 1820 mg/L and for freshwater populations between 335 and 624 mg/L of sulfate. The tolerance for sulfate in freshwater coregonines was significantly lower than brackish water coregonines, but it was in similar range as to what has been observed in other freshwater species.

J	Scheffer, M; Rinaldi, S; Kuznetsov, YA				Scheffer, M; Rinaldi, S; Kuznetsov, YA			Effects of fish on plankton dynamics: a theoretical analysis	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We present an expansion of a classical minimal Daphnia-algae model to account for effects of fish as a top predator. Our analyses suggest that in most situations, the plankton should show hysteresis in response to predation pressure by fish. Thus, there exist two distinct regimes, one in which Daphnia is controlled (overexploited) by fish and phytoplankton biomass is high and another in which Daphnia is relatively unaffected (underexploited) by planktivores and algae are controlled by Daphnia. Switches from one regime to the other occur abruptly at a critical fish density. This is in line with field observations and experimental results. Our model predicts that the critical fish density for Daphnia collapse is higher in systems with higher ambient nutrient concentrations. The model also shows how intrinsic predator-prey oscillations in the planktonic system can facilitate the switch to the algal-dominated regime where Daphnia is controlled by fish. In terms of dynamical systems theory, this switch happens through a homoclinic bifurcation. In biological terms, Daphnia collapses due to food limitation and is subsequently overexploited by fish. This is indeed the sequence of mechanisms observed at the end of the spring clearwater phase in lakes where Daphnia is absent during the summer when the biomass of young-of-the-year planktivorous fish becomes high.

It is difficult, however, to measure melt production on glaciers directly, while subglacial water storage is not directly observable. Therefore, we document temporal changes in seismicity from a dry-based polar glacier (Taylor Glacier, Antarctica) during a melt season using a synthesis of seismic observation and melt modeling. We record icequakes using a dense six-receiver network of three-component geophones and compare this with melt input generated from a calibrated surface energy balance model. In the absence of modeled surface melt, we find that seismicity is well-described by a diurnal signal composed of microseismic events in lake and glacial ice. During melt events, the diurnal signal is suppressed and seismicity is instead characterized by large glacial icequakes. We perform network-based correlation and clustering analyses of seismic record sections and determine that 18% of melt-season icequakes are repetitive (multiplets). The epicentral locations for these multiplets suggest that they are triggered by meltwater produced near a brine seep known as Blood Falls. Our observations of the corresponding p-wave first motions are consistent with volumetric source mechanisms. We suggest that surface melt enables a persistent pathway through this cold ice to an englacial fracture system that is responsible for brine release episodes from the Blood Falls seep. The scalar moments for these events suggest that the volumetric increase at the source region can be explained by melt input.					; Carmichael, Joshua/AAQ-1452-2020	Pettit, Erin Christine/0000-0002-6765-9841; 													2169-9003	2169-9011				JUL 10	2012	117								F03004	10.1029/2011JF002221	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2011JF002221													WOS:000306462800001

Links between annual surface temperature variation and land cover heterogeneity for a boreal forest as characterized by continuous, fibre-optic DTS monitoring	GEOSCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTATION METHODS AND DATA SYSTEMS												A fibre-optic DTS (distributed temperature sensing) system using Raman-scattering optical time domain reflectometry was deployed to monitor a boreal forest research site in the interior of Alaska. Surface temperatures range between -40 degrees C in winter and 30 degrees C in summer at this site. In parallel experiments, a fibre-optic cable sensor system (multi-mode, GI50/125, dual core; 3 4 mm), monitored at high resolution, (0.5 m intervals at every 30 min) ground surface temperatures across the landscape. In addition, a high-resolution vertical profile was acquired at one-metre height above the upper subsurface. The total cable ran 2.7 km with about 2.0 km monitoring a horizontal surface path. Sections of the cable sensor were deployed in vertical coil configurations (1.2 m high) to measure temperature profiles from the ground up at 5 mm intervals. Measurements were made continuously over a 2-year interval from October 2012 to October 2014. Vegetation at the site (Poker Flat Research Range) consists primarily of black spruce underlain by permafrost. Land cover types within the study area were classified into six descriptive categories: relict thermokarst lake, open moss, shrub, deciduous forest, sparse conifer forest, and dense conifer forest. The horizontal temperature data exhibited spatial and temporal changes within the observed diurnal and seasonal variations. Differences in snow pack evolution and insulation effects co-varied with the land cover types. The apparatus used to monitor vertical temperature profiles generated high-resolution (ca. 5 mm) data for air column, snow cover, and ground surface. This research also identified several technical challenges in deploying and maintaining a DTS system under subarctic environments.					; Iwahana, Go/I-3500-2018; Nagano, Hirohiko/K-8145-2012	Ikawa, Hiroki/0000-0002-4984-8067; Iwahana, Go/0000-0003-4628-1074; Nagano, Hirohiko/0000-0002-3090-7709													2193-0856	2193-0864				JUL 31	2018	7	3					223	234		10.5194/gi-7-223-2018	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/gi-7-223-2018													WOS:000440327800001
J	Qiu, XT; Liu, HR; Yin, XA; Qin, JL				Qiu, Xintian; Liu, Hongrui; Yin, Xinan; Qin, Jinglan			Combining the management of water level regimes and plant structures for waterbird habitat provision in wetlands	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The survival of waterbirds depends heavily on habitat, particularly aquatic plants. For each kind of aquatic plant, there are specific water level regime requirements to meet its germination and growth. Previous studies usually focused on the use of water level management to achieve protection and restoration of aquatic plants. However, the water level regimes in many wetlands have been greatly changed and their ecological objectives usually cannot be achieved by water level management alone. Accordingly, this study combined water level management and artificial planting for waterbird habitat provision in wetlands. The Hongze Lake National Wetland Nature Reserve was taken as the research area. In this study, we considered the needs of waterbirds for nesting and foraging, and determined the aquatic plant species to be planted. According to the seasonal water level requirements of these plants, we simulated the plantable areas of different aquatic plants under different water level regimes. We then further optimized the water level regimes according to the needs of waterbirds, and determined the optimal water level management scheme. In addition, we formulated planting principles, explored the planting structure under each water level regime, so that the plant structure can better serve the waterbirds. The results showed that the current water level regime of Hongze Lake is not consistent with the growth rhythm of aquatic plants. Because of the human regulation, the water level of the wetland is high in winter and low in summer, which is contrary to the requirements of aquatic plant growth. A combination of water level regimes and plant structure management, however, could effectively expand the area for waterbird habitat. The results of this study will help wetland managers to make informed decisions about how to restore the waterbird habitat in other similar regulated wetlands.

J	Warrillow, JA; Josephson, DC; Youngs, WD; Krueger, CC				Warrillow, JA; Josephson, DC; Youngs, WD; Krueger, CC			Differences in sexual maturity and fall emigration between diploid and triploid brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) in an Adirondack lake	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												High levels of emigration coincident with maturity and spawning have been reported from brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) populations in Adirondack lakes. These lakes typically had few spawning areas and required stocking to maintain populations. We compared diploid and triploid brook trout to identify differences in gonadal development and emigration. Age 1+ and 2+ diploid and triploid brook trout held in captivity were examined internally for gonadal development. More diploid trout were mature than triploid fish (p < 0.01). Of triploid brook trout that matured, all were males. Yearling diploid and triploid brook trout were also stocked into a lake that had an outlet but no spawning areas. During the fall spawning season, only mature yearling triploid males, diploid males, and diploid females were caught in an outlet trap. No triploid females were caught. A greater proportion of diploids emigrated than triploids (p < 0.01). Triploidy in females arrested emigration by preventing sexual maturation. Triploid male brook trout should not be stocked because they can pose a reproductive risk to wild brook trout downstream from lakes. Stocking triploid females could reduce fall emigration and thus reduce the loss of catchable brook trout from Adirondack lakes with outlets and little spawning habitat.																			0706-652X					AUG	1997	54	8					1808	1812		10.1139/cjfas-54-8-1808	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-54-8-1808													WOS:A1997YC67500012

The quantitative identifications of the Li sources and their dynamic behavior shed light on the formation mechanism of the brine Li deposits in closed-basin of arid regions. This study presents Li and Sr isotope ratios (delta 7Li, 87Sr/86Sr) and other hydrogeochemical parameters for river waters, springs, spring river waters, shallow groundwaters, surface brines, and intercrystalline brines around the Nalenggele River Basin (NRB) and its adjacent small watersheds. The results indicate that the Nalenggele River water is a mixing product of hot springs and regional surface meltwater, and the source of dissolved Li in the NRB is mainly supplied by the hot springs. With multi-tracer models, it is confirmed that around 84.9 %-93.4 % of dissolved Li is provided by the Li-rich hot spring waters, which account for only 3-5 % of the total water input. Furthermore, the dissolved Li in the streams of different hydrological regions shows various isotopic fractionation behavior. In general, the lower average delta 7Li values (average of +5.6 %o) with more enriched Li with respect to Na in the waters of the piedmont Gobi region indicates a significant additional input of dissolved Li from bedrock and sediments. The second-stage alluvial fan of the NRB produces 7Li enrichments and Li-depleted waters (compared with Na), which can be explained by the adsorption of clay or Fe (Mn) oxide phases that fractionate Li isotopes. The highest average delta 7Li values (+12.76 %o) are observed when Li is not adsorbed by the scarce fine clastic sediments in the hypersaline environment of the salt lake region. It can be concluded that the continuous halite precipitation during the brine evolution not only causes the abnormal enrichment of Li in the brine (compared with Na) but also continuously sequesters the 6Li from the brines, resulting in a significant 7Li enrichment. Overall, these findings advance the understanding of the lithium sources of Li-rich brines and its enrichment and metallogenic process during water migration in hyper-arid regions and have crucial indicative significance for lithium cycling under a strong evaporation environment.

A snowfall climatology of the Ohio River Valley, USA	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												Snowfall in the Ohio River Valley, USA, presents a relatively unique challenge due to the large gradient of event frequency and magnitude, and subsequent levels of preparation within local communities. Even relatively small magnitude events can cause widespread impacts due to available infrastructure. Here we present a climatology of snowfall conditions and events over a 74-year period using a network of daily observational stations across the region. Snowfall totals and event frequencies both exhibit a southwest to northeast gradient of increasing snowfall, where the majority of snowfall (> 80%) occurs during the core winter months of December through February. There is a clear influence of Lake Erie on snowfall conditions in the northeast corner of the domain, where snowfall frequency, totals, and trends are substantially higher within the lake belt relative to areas further inland. Over time, snowfall significantly increased downwind of Lake Erie by as much as 42%, while significant decreases of over 55% occurred in central Tennessee and eastern Ohio. Intra-seasonally, snowfall totals trended significantly less during November and March for much of the domain, suggesting a compression of the snowfall season to more core winter months. Trends in snowfall frequency were apparent for many sub-regions, however evidence here suggests the trends in snowfall totals were primarily driven by trends in snowfall magnitude per event.																			0177-798X	1434-4483				AUG	2024	155	8					7691	7701		10.1007/s00704-024-05092-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-024-05092-5		JUL 2024											WOS:001263318000003
J	Chong, S; Park, C; Lee, KR; An, KG				Chong, Suna; Park, Chunhong; Lee, Ka Ram; An, Kwang-Guk			Modeling Summer Hypoxia Spatial Distribution and Fish Habitat Volume in Artificial Estuarine Waterway	WATER												This study analyzes the dissolved oxygen (DO) depletion or hypoxia formation affecting the ecological vulnerability of Gyeongin-Ara Waterway (GAW), an artificial estuarine waterway. The physical, chemical, and biochemical factors affecting the summer hypoxia dynamics and distribution are simulated and the habitat volumes of major fish species are calculated. CE-QUAL-W2, a two-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model, is applied for the simulation. Comparison with observation reveals that the salinity stratification, vertical DO gradient, and summer hypoxia characteristics are realistically reproduced by the model. Comprehensive analysis of the spatial distributions of the residence time, salinity, and DO concentration reveal that the residence time is longest at the bottom of a freshwater inflow zone. Accordingly, residence time is identified as the physical factor having the greatest influence on hypoxia. It is also clear that a hypoxic water mass diffuses towards the entire waterway during neap tides and summer, when the seawater inflow decreases. Based on the modeling results, the DO depletion drivers are identified and the hypoxic zone formation and distribution are sufficiently explained. Finally, fish habitat volumes are calculated. In particular, the survival habitat volume of Mugil cephalus is found to decrease by 32-34% as a result of hypoxia from July to August. The model employed in this study could be utilized to establish an operational plan for the waterway, which would increase fish habitat volumes.

J	Lepori, F; Capelli, C; Foresti, D				Lepori, Fabio; Capelli, Camilla; Foresti, Danilo			Changes in phytoplankton composition hinder the recovery from eutrophication in a perialpine lake (Lake Lugano, Switzerland and Italy)	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												We investigated the factors shaping the response of summer phytoplankton biomass to declining phosphorus (P) concentrations in a lake undergoing restoration (South basin of Lake Lugano, Switzerland and Italy). During 1989-2019, summer P concentrations declined from values typical of eutrophic lakes (>30 mu g L-1) to values typical of mesotrophic lakes (10-30 mu g L-1). Contrary to expectations, this decline was not followed by a decline in phytoplankton biomass. Instead, phytoplankton biomass showed the highest values in summers with lowest P concentrations. This paradoxical effect was associated with a change in phytoplankton composition. Higher P concentrations were associated with higher relative biomass of green algae, lower P concentrations with higher biomass of cyanobacteria and diatoms. We interpreted this change as a shift from edible and P-demanding phytoplankton to inedible and P-efficient phytoplankton, leading to different trophic structures. The pattern observed may be prompted by the particular conditions of deep lakes approaching mesotrophy, including occurrence of deep-water P reserves and high N concentrations, which can benefit inedible metalimnetic cyanobacteria. To attain reductions in summer phytoplankton biomass, restoration efforts may need to further reduce P concentrations and, possibly, address N enrichment.

J	Bundschuh, J; Maity, JP				Bundschuh, Jochen; Maity, Jyoti Prakash			Geothermal arsenic: Occurrence, mobility and environmental implications	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS												Arsenic (As) contamination in geothermal systems has been identified in many areas of the world. Arsenic mobilization from rocks and mineral phases into geothermal fluids depends on available As sources, geochemical conditions and microbiological activity. In deep geothermal reservoirs As mobilization is predominantly from As-bearing pyrite at temperatures of 150-250 degrees C, and at higher temperatures also from arsenopyrite. Highest As concentrations, mostly in the range of thousands to tens of thousands of mu g/L and in case of Los Humeros (Mexico) even of up to 162,000 mu g/L are found in volcanic geothermal systems whereas in low- and high-enthalpy sedimentary geothermal systems they reach only about 2000 mu g/L. At many sites, uprising geothermal waters contaminate shallow water resources. From the geothermal springs, those with NaCl water type have the highest As concentrations; these waters correspond to original reservoir waters which were not significantly altered during its ascent. In the geothermal reservoir and deeper parts of hydrothermal system, As is predominantly present as neutral H3As(III)O-3 (arsenius acid) and under sulfidic conditions also as thioarsenites; close to the earth's surface oxidation through atmospheric oxygen to As(V) species may occur; however, this is a slow process. As(III) emerging in geothermal springs is oxidized quickly through microbial catalysis and often most As is present as As(V), at a distance of few meters from the spring outlet. This review highlights the occurrence and distribution of geothermal As worldwide, its sources and its mobilization and the presence of different As species in geothermal fluids considering different geological settings and processes involving geothermal fluids rising from deep geothermal reservoirs to the earth's surface where it may mix with shallow groundwater or surface waters and contaminate these resources. The microbial diversity of hot spring environments which plays an important role to mobilize the As by oxidation and reduction process in the geothermal system is also addressed.

Time Scale for Rapid Draining of a Surficial Lake Into the Greenland Ice Sheet	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME												A 2008 report by Das et al. documented the rapid drainage during summer 2006 of a supraglacial lake, of approximately 44 x 10(6) m(3), into the Greenland ice sheet over a time scale moderately longer than 1 hr. The lake had been instrumented to record the time-dependent fall of water level and the uplift of the ice nearby. Liquid water, denser than ice, was presumed to have descended through the sheet along a crevasse system and spread along the bed as a hydraulic facture. The event led two of the present authors to initiate modeling studies on such natural hydraulic fractures. Building on results of those studies, we attempt to better explain the time evolution of such a drainage event. We find that the estimated time has a strong dependence on how much a pre-existing crack/crevasse system, acting as a feeder channel to the bed, has opened by slow creep prior to the time at which a basal hydraulic fracture nucleates. We quantify the process and identify appropriate parameter ranges, particularly of the average temperature of the ice beneath the lake (important for the slow creep opening of the crevasse). We show that average ice temperatures 5-7 degrees C below melting allow such rapid drainage on a time scale which agrees well with the 2006 observations.

J	Liutkus, CM; Wright, JD				Liutkus, Cynthia M.; Wright, James D.			The influence of hydrology and climate on the isotope geochemistry of playa carbonates: a study from Pilot Valley, NV, USA	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Carbonates often accompany lake and lake-margin deposits in both modern and ancient geological settings. If these carbonates are formed in standing water, their stable isotope values reflect the aquatic chemistry at the time of precipitation and may provide a proxy for determining regional hydrologic conditions. Carbonate rhizoliths and water samples were collected from a playa lake in eastern Nevada. Pilot Valley (similar to 43 degrees N) is a closed-basin, remnant playa from the Quaternary desiccation of palaeo-Lake Bonneville. Water is added to the playa margin by free convection of dense brines to the east and forced convection of freshwater off the alluvial fan to the west. Both freshwater and saline springs dot the playa margin at the base of an alluvial fan. Water samples collected from seven springs show a range from -16 to -0.2 parts per thousand (Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water), and are consistent with published values. The delta(18)O(calcite) values from rhizolith samples range from -18.3 to -6.7 parts per thousand (Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite), and the average is -12 parts per thousand V-PDB (1 - sigma SD 2 parts per thousand). With the exception of samples from Little Salt Spring, the range in the delta(18)O(calcite) values collected from the rhizoliths confirms that they form in equilibrium with ambient water conditions on the playa. The initial geochemical conditions for the spring waters are dictated by local hydrology: freshwater springs emerge in the northern part of the basin to the east of a broad alluvial fan, and more saline springs emerge to the south where the influence of the alluvial fan diminishes. Rhizoliths are only found near the southern saline springs and their delta(13)C(calcite) values, along with their morphology, indicate that they only form around saltgrass (Distichlis sp.). As the residence time of water on the playa increases, evaporation, temperature change and biological processes alter the aquatic chemistry and initiate calcite precipitation around the plant stems. The range in delta(18)O(calcite) values from each location reflects environmental controls (e.g. evaporation and temperature change). These rhizoliths faithfully record ambient aquatic conditions during formation (e.g. geochemistry and water depth), but only record a partial annual signal that is constrained by saltgrass growth and the presence of standing water on the playa margin.

Microelement concentration in plants is presented. Original data regarding microelement content in medicinal plant species as well as description of the plant cover in the Dry Lake region in Vitosha Mountain are considered. Because the content of the bioelements in plants, especially microelements, is critical for the ecology Status of the mountains, monitoring of microelements is required. A case of erosion caused by building activities in Pirin Mountain was observed. The study proposes a new original technology for building ice sport structures. This technology is designed to subserve the usage of Dry Lake region of Vitosha Mountain for the aims of Sofia 2014 Winter Olympic Games. The ice structures are investigated by finite element method (FEM). The ice sport structure technology is ecologically clean, does not cause irreversible damages on nature, and is suitable for application in alpine zones. The ice structures can successfully play the role of snow accumulator. The gradual ice melting in spring supplies additionally with water the plants and their communities from the region. This water volume is sufficient and equally distributed over the whole area.																			1310-1331						2009	62	6					745	752																WOS:000267892700014

Avalanches are closely related to fast cryosphere changes and may cause major threats to human society. Here, we used the sedimentary archive of the Alpine Lake Lauvitel (Lac du Lauvitel; western French Alps) to establish the first long-term avalanche record in this Alpine region. For this purpose, we used a novel CT-scan methodology that allows the precise identification of coarse material - from sand to pebble - transported to the lake and embedded within the finer continuous sedimentation. We identified a total of 166 deposits over the last 3300 yr cal. BP. In parallel, a detailed pollen analysis gave an independent record of environmental changes. Based on modern observation, lake monitoring, seismic investigations and sedimentological evidences, coarse material deposits were attributed to wet avalanche events. Our results highlight the effect of vegetation cover on the avalanche hazard while a period of strong frequency increase occurred after 780 yr cal. BR. In Lake Lauvitel, this period corresponds to a major forest clearance induced by the rise of human land use. Climate forcing on the avalanche hazard was investigated before and after the vegetation shift. On a multicentennial scale, wet avalanches preferably occur during periods of larger glacier extent, in which higher winter precipitation probably generates a sufficiently thick snow cover. On a sub-centennial scale, avalanches are more frequent during periods of relative warming, resulting in a destabilization of the same snow cover in spring season. Our results high-light as well the role of forest cover in mitigating wet snow avalanches' occurrence. In the context of predicted warmer temperatures, this study raises the question of whether a wet avalanche hazard increase may be expected in the near future especially at higher altitudes.

Phytoplankton ecology of a culturally eutrophic embayment: Hamilton Harbour, Lake Ontario	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Hamilton Harbour is a chronically eutrophic embayment located at the western end of Lake Ontario that has experienced many decades of agricultural, industrial, and urban contamination. It has been identified as an Area of Concern under the terms of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement between Canada and the United States. This study examines the ecology of the phytoplankton communities at one centrally located station during the ice-free period (May-October) of three non-consecutive years: 2002, 2004 and 2006. This was the first comprehensive study to be conducted since the 1970s. It was found that the phytoplankton communities are diverse and fluctuate throughout the year, along with changing nutrient, physical and environmental conditions. No consistent patterns of seasonal succession were observed throughout the study. Phytoflagellates including Cryptophyceae and Dinophyceae had a tendency to outnumber and out-compete other phytoplankton since they are mobile and able to seek out optimal habitats within the water column. For a highly eutrophic water body, algal biomass (annual mean approximate to 2.0 g m(-3)) was lower than expected and more consistent with mesotrophic conditions-an observation first made by researchers in the 1970s and attributed to the highly variable physical environment. While our study supports these earlier results, we also conclude that zooplankton grazing likely has a significant role in limiting the size of the algal standing crop. Several algal bloom events were captured during our study. In addition to the somewhat predictable blooms of Diatomeae in the spring and Cyanophyta in the summer, we also observed blooms of Cryptophyceae and Dinophyceae. In one case we observed a bloom with no dominant taxon-it contained a diverse mixture of Cryptophyceae, Euglenophyta and Dinophyceae-challenging the commonly held notion that algal blooms are essentially monocultures. Our results show that such a variable and stressed ecosystem requires frequent sampling to capture the rapid changes that occur.

The light environment and mixing regime within the mesocosm were comparable to those in shallow lakes and coastal waters. Experiments showed no significant differences for 24-h mean and 7-day mean chlorophyll a and carbon-specific growth for mixed depths of 1 m and 3 m, and mixing times between 4 min and 65 min. Fluctuations in irradiance brought about by turbulent mixing had no significant effect on specific growth. The relationship between mixed depths and critical depths for S. costatum was therefore independent of fluctuations in irradiance in the turbulent mixed layer. The results indicated that to control growth of S. costatum mixed depths would have to exceed photic depths by a factor of 15, instead of the conventionally accepted factor of 5. Thus, it is likely that artificial mixing of shallow (< 10 m) eutrophic waters will be more effective in controlling 'slow-growing' summer biomass than 'fast-growing' spring blooms dominated by diatoms.					; Thornton, Daniel/AAT-3790-2020	Thornton, Daniel/0000-0001-5546-5161; 													0025-3162					MAR	2005	146	4					633	644		10.1007/s00227-004-1486-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-004-1486-4													WOS:000227442300001

Apart from increased connectivity between previously separated watersheds, the increasing temperature of the hydrosystems favors the spread of exotic species. The freshwater fauna of Central Europe is still shaped by the cold-adapted animal assemblages resulting from the last glaciation. It is less diverse, and the species are putatively less performant competitors, compared to the warm-adapted, species-rich fauna of the Ponto-Caspian realm, from which many current aquatic invaders are coming. Our study analyses potential mechanisms explaining the coexistence between one of the most impacting aquatic invaders of the past decades, the 'killer shrimp' Dikerogammarus villosus and the previously dominating amphipod Gammarus roeselii in Lake Constance, using laboratory predation experiments and field surveys. Our results indicate two key drivers for coexistence: low winter temperatures and the substrate structure of the alga Chara sp. At temperatures below 6 degrees C, the predation pressure on G. roeselii was strongly reduced; G. roeselii can therefore disperse throughout the littoral in winter, avoiding predation by D. villosus. Artificial heating of a section of the lake shore, however, resulted in local extinction of G. roeselii by D. villosus. The macroalga Chara sp. completely inhibited predation by D. villosus on G. roeselii. Climate change scenarios indicate that global warming might destroy this thermal refuge during winter until 2085. For the survival of G. roeselii it will then be crucial, which part of the Chara population will maintain epigeic plant parts during winter. The complex interplay between thermal and physical refuges for native species in the context of climate change and changing trophic status of freshwater systems, as disentangled by our study, shows that ecosystem management and restoration strategies need to better consider multiple stressors (and their rather complex mitigation strategies).

Associating Michigan climate with low-level airflow trajectories and atmospheric teleconnections	CLIMATE RESEARCH												The climate of Michigan is influenced by airflow circulation associated with atmospheric teleconnections. Previous studies have investigated mid-level airflow and atmospheric teleconnections, while low-level airflow has had less attention. Analyses of low-level airflow trajectories and atmospheric teleconnection associations are presented for a location in Lower Michigan. Airflow trajectories, which provide an important approach to monitoring changes in atmospheric circulation, are used to represent the low-level circulation during 1950-2011. A 5-day back-trajectory climatology for the 925 hPa pressure level was developed using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) reanalysis data archive. Low-level and mid-level circulation associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Pacific/North American pattern (PNA), and El Nino/La Nina (NINO3.4) highlighted advection of heat and moisture during particular times of the year and the presence of single or simultaneous strong atmospheric teleconnections. The results indicate that airflow associated with teleconnections often differs seasonally. Additionally, trajectory patterns vary, based on whether a single strong teleconnection is present or if 2 strong teleconnections are coexisting. Using low-level airflow anomalies assists in bridging the gap between local-scale climate anomalies, such as temperature and precipitation, and atmospheric teleconnections. While a climatological study is presented here, the knowledge obtained could be applied in modeling and contribute to improved medium-and long-range forecasts.																			0936-577X	1616-1572					2012	55	2					135	151		10.3354/cr01124	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/cr01124													WOS:000312249400004

Statistical evaluation of differences in phytoplankton richness and abundance as constrained by environmental drivers in transitional waters of the Mediterranean basin	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												1. This paper is focused oil the identification of patterns of variation in phytoplankton abundance and taxonomic composition at the eco-regional scale. In addition, these patterns were evaluated with respect to climatic, hydrological and physiographic drivers. 2. A hierarchial sampling design W Is used to integrate seasonal and spatial variations in taxonomic richness. abundance and taxonomic composition of phytoplankton guilds. Data were collected synoptically during two seasons (autumn and spring) in 12 transitional water bodies ill Italy, Albania and Greece. 3. The number of taxi and the cell density of phytoplankton guilds varied between seasons and across ecosystems. Overall, physiographic and hydrological components accounted for 61'% of the variation ill the number of taxa, but just 19%, of the variation in cell density. 4. At the univariate level, cell density varied significantly with temperature, whereas the number of taxa was found to vary significantly with depth, sinuosity index mid outlet structure, lagoon surface area and geographic location. 5. The taxonomic composition of phytoplankton guilds varied markedly among lagoons. More than 61% of the 243 taxa identified overall were detected ill only one of the lagoons. 6. The average similarity of phytoplankton taxonomic structure among ecosystems was 33.15 +/- 15.02. Taxonomic similarity varied substantially across both ecosystems and seasons. Overall, more than 70% of variance ill taxonomic similarity was explained by physiographic mid hydrological forcing factors. Specifically. differences ill taxonomic structure were found ill transitional ecosystems showing differences ill outlet structure. depth and salinity, as well as geographic location. A recurrent pattern of decreasing taxonomic Similarity with increasing Euclidean distance was observed for each factor. 7. The results obtained in this study suggest that certain large-scale driving forces can explain eco-regional scale patterns of species richness and taxonomic composition but not of cell abundance, which are probably more affected by local forcing factors.

J	Nettleton, S				Nettleton, Sarah			Fell runners and walking walls: towards a sociology of living landscapes and aesthetic atmospheres as an alternative to a Lakeland picturesque	BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY												This article draws on analysis of data generated by way of an ethnography of fell running in the English Lake District and suggests that participants who have lived and run in the area for many years experience a particular mode of aesthetic. The Lake District has long been valued for its outstanding scenery represented in the aesthetic of the picturesque comprising relatively static landscapes that should be conserved. Established fell runners who have run in the area for many decades apprehend and appreciate the landscape in more complex, rooted and situated ways. The anthropologist Ingold, distinguishes between landscape and landsceppan, and this insight is instructive for grasping the way in which the runners do not simply scope scenery but work with the land: they shape it and are shaped by it. Fell runners are elements within the living environment and along with walls, sheep, becks, sun, rain -what Ingold evocatively calls the 'weather-world' - are mobile. Movement is central to their aesthetic, they enjoy not so much the scenic but rather a fellsceppan and do so through their fast eye-gait-footwork and their lively, variable occupation with the terrain. The fells infiltrate and interpenetrate the runners and movement through the fells generates a somatic aesthetic. The pleasure in turn breeds existential capital an embodied gratification that serves as an attractor that binds those who appreciate feelings of being alive with and in the fells.																			0007-1315	1468-4446				DEC	2015	66	4					759	778		10.1111/1468-4446.12146	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1468-4446.12146								26399836					WOS:000368127600009

Historical records suggest that the establishment of western juniper is strongly associated with regional climatic variability. For example, the abundance of western juniper pollen and macrofossils measured in lake sediment cores increased rapidly in the mid-1500s, concurrent with a regional increase in winter precipitation. However, little is known about how climatic factors interact with landscape structure to control the spatial distribution of western juniper at fine scales and at lower treelines. We used tree rings to reconstruct a spatially distributed history of establishment for 421 western juniper trees across 130 ha on Horse Ridge in central Oregon. Establishment occurred between 845 and 1961 CE, but most trees established after the mid-1550s. The pronounced sixteenth century pulse of establishment represents a transition from more open wooded shrublands to persistent woodlands and coincides with an increase in cool-season moisture and generally cool summer temperatures. Ancient trees that established before this were limited to certain microsites, suggesting that local topoedaphic conditions influenced juniper woodland demography and distributions, although we could not identify consistent environmental drivers. In the future, warmer and drier growing season conditions and a potential increase in wildfire activity may broadly limit western juniper recruitment and its distribution across the region, but at finer scales landscape features that buffer climate change impacts or provide fire safe niches may serve as refugia.

Iron and manganese fluxes across the sediment-water interface in a drinking water reservoir	WATER RESEARCH												The development of low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in the hypolimnion of drinking water reservoirs during thermal stratification can lead to the reduction of oxidized, insoluble iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) in sediments to soluble forms, which are then released into the water column. As metals degrade drinking water quality, robust measurements of metal fluxes under changing oxygen conditions are critical for optimizing water treatment. In this study, we conducted benthic flux chamber experiments in summer 2018 to directly quantify Fe and Mn fluxes at the sediment-water interface under different DO and redox conditions of a eutrophic drinking water reservoir with an oxygenation system (Falling Creek Reservoir, Vinton, VA, USA). Throughout the experiments, we monitored DO, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), water temperature, and pH in the chambers and compared the metal fluxes in the chambers with time-series of fluxes calculated using a hypolimnetic mass balance method. Our results showed that metal fluxes were highly variable during the monitoring period and were sensitive to redox conditions in the water column at the sediment-water interface. The time-series changes in fluxes and relationship to redox conditions are suggestive of "hot moments", short time periods of intense biogeochemical cycling. Although the metal concentrations and fluxes are specific to this site, the approaches for examining relationships between metals, oxygen concentrations and overall redox conditions can be applied by water utilities to improve water quality management of Fe and Mn.

This water browning or brownification has been attributed to the increased organic carbon concentrations due to climate change and decreased add atmospheric deposition. Given that iron (Fe) may also increase water colour, the contribution of Fe to water brownification has received small attention. Our aim was to study the temporal trends of Fe in forested headwater catchments in eastern Finland, where an increasing air temperature and total organic carbon (TOC) trend had been observed in an earlier study. We found a statistically significant increasing trend also in stream water Fe concentrations and a strong correlation between the trends of TOC and Fe. The average increase in TOC and Fe concentrations between 1995 and 2006 was 0.5 mg l(-1) yr(-1) (2.5%), and 34.6 mu g 1(-1) yr(-1) (3.5%), respectively. These results indicate that the increased water colour or brownification in Northern Europe may not only be due to increased concentrations of organic matter but also increased concentrations of Fe. The change in precipitation and temperature conditions, particularly during late autumn and early winter periods, appeared to be the main environmental factor behind increasing Fe trends. The strong correlation between the trends of Fe and TOC indicated that the increased Fe-organic matter complexation is the mechanism behind increasing Fe trends, but further research is needed to assess the chemical forms of increased Fe that coupled with increased TOC concentrations would enhance water brownification.

Regarding heterotrophic eukaryotes, the only known species was the thermophilic amoeboflagellate Tetramitus thermacidophilus (class Eutetramitea, phylum Heterolobosea), which feeds on surrounding bacteria and archaea. In this study, we investigated three sulfuric hot springs (34.7 degrees C-50 degrees C, similar to pH 2.0) in Japan to determine whether other heterotrophic eukaryotes inhabit these environments. As a result, we isolated and identified cultures of four species capable of surviving at pH 2.0 and 40 degrees C: Allovahlkampfia sp. (Eutetramitea, Heterolobosea); Nuclearia sp. and Parvularia sp. (Nucleariidea, Cristidiscoidea); and Vannella sp. (Discosea, Amoebozoa). Phylogenetic analyses suggest that these four species independently evolved from mesophilic and neutrophilic ancestors, separate from each other. Additionally, Platyophrya sp. (Colpodea, Ciliophora) and two species of Neobodo (Euglenozoa, Kinetoplastea) were also found in the same environment, while their maximum survival temperatures were 35 degrees C and 30 degrees C, respectively. Among these, all species except Neobodo were confirmed to grow exclusively by feeding on Cyanidiococcus sp., a dominant species of Cyanidiophyceae in the environment. Thus, various lineages of heterotrophic unicellular eukaryotes have independently developed acidophilic and thermotolerant traits, allowing them to colonize sulfuric hot springs. Seven cultures of unicellular eukaryotes belonging to various lineages and feeding on the unicellular red alga Cyanidiococcus sp. were isolated and identified from geothermal sulfuric hot springs, some of them were acidophilic and thermotolerant species thriving at pH 2.0 and 40 degrees C.

The supply system is controlled by runoff, which depends on rainfall, seasonal snow melt and ablation of glaciers. River flows tend to be lowest in winter, when the demand for electricity is largest, and rise in spying and summer as snow and glacier melt make significant contributions. Long-term estimates of the water balance show that average seasonal snow storage is 2500 GWh (or 330 mm). This is equivalent to 15% of total annual runoff and is similar to controlled lake storage, which is 17% of annual runoff. However, there is much inter-annual variability in runoff. The amount of water stored as snow is a major component of this variability and has been simulated with a snow mass balance model for each year from 1930. Sustained periods of low, or high runoff are the product of large-scale forcing by anomalous atmospheric circulation patterns. Some examples of these are briefly presented. Sensitivity of the hydro-electricity supply system to changes in precipitation and temperature is simulated. Results show that for the climates likely to be experienced with greenhouse warming, the seasonal distribution of runoff will be strongly modified. Sensitivity of electricity demand to climate change is determined by statistical modelling using temperature. These simulations and sensitivity studies demonstrate that climate change will produce important changes in both electricity supply and demand and have implications for future growth and operation of the hydro-electric system.																					0-643-05688-2				1996							263	280																WOS:A1996BG79Y00015

The aim of this review is to provide a synopsis of climate characteristics over the last 2 kyr, clarifying mechanisms for the diverse trend with Northern Hemisphere Summer Insolation (NHSI) records. Here, we initially review proxy-based climate reconstructions for the last 2 kyr, and then compare them with records from the last five interglacial periods. Finally, we examine potential physical mechanisms responsible for the "2 kyr shift." Findings from this review indicate that the "2 kyr shift" is a representative pattern of Holocene climate change within the core area of the ASM, and the "2 kyr shift" could be mainly controlled by changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration. In addition, suggestions to address a more humid condition dominating the Asian monsoonal margin zones are offered.

Summer ('light') and winter ('dark') laminae were identified according to their predominantly autochthonous and allochthonous structure, respectively. Algal sublayers within the light laminae were subject to marked changes in thickness and in algal species composition. Diatoms were the dominant algal class throughout the record. However, chrysophytes played a substantial role in varve formation between ca. 5300 and 3660 cal yr BP. Autecological characteristics of the dominant algal species and algal succession allowed to infer shifts of the prevailing water circulation type and relative changes in nutrient concentration and ratios (phosphorus and silica). Based on the combination of all results, the palaeolimnological development was reconstructed and split into three distinct lake periods (6340-5300 cal yr BP; 5300-3660 cal yr BP; 3660-2220 cal yr BP). The palaeolimnological characteristics in turn allowed to make suggestions upon the palaeoclimatological development in consideration of relevant studies from other sites in Western Europe. With the beginning of the Iron Age (ca. 2660 cal yr BP), climatic interpretation remains unclear though, because anthropogenic activity sharply increased.

Although the region is naturally fishless, many of the lakes were stocked with trout, bearing uncertainty about the possible effects on the ecosystem. The main objective of this study was to analyze the characteristics of planktonic autotrophic communities of lakes differing in regime (phytoplankton turbid, clear vegetated, and clear unvegetated) and presence/absence of fish. During late spring and summer, 14 water bodies were sampled in 2011 and 2013 considering different regimes and presence/absence of fish. Besides limnological variables, the autotrophic communities, from pico to microplankton, were also analyzed. Differences in physical and chemical characteristics observed among the lakes corresponded to their current regime and the presence/absence of trouts. Autotrophic picoplankton and phytoplankton>20 mu m abundances differed among lake types being highest in fish-stocked lakes. Although the three type of lakes presented phycoerythrin-rich picocyanobacteria and picoeukaryotes, only fish-stocked lakes hosted phycocyanin-rich picocyanobacteria. Moreover, fish-stocked lakes were dominated by cyanobacteria, while chlorophytes abounded in fishless systems. Evidences that lake regime and fish occurrence influence planktonic autotrophic communities of Strobel plateau is here provided, highlighting the intra- and interannual dynamism of the aquatic systems.					; Saad, Juan Francisco/KHY-4593-2024; Porcel, Sol/ABF-6997-2021	Saad, Juan Francisco/0000-0002-4482-8892; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2019	831	1			SI		133	145		10.1007/s10750-018-3660-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-018-3660-6													WOS:000458372800011

Natural events of anoxia and low respiration index in oligotrophic lakes of the Atlantic Tropical Forest	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Hypoxia is a well-recognized condition reducing biodiversity and increasing greenhouse gas emissions in aquatic ecosystems, especially under warmer temperatures of tropical waters. Anoxia is a natural event commonly intensified by human-induced organic inputs in inland waters. Here, we assessed the partial pressure of O-2 (pO(2)) and CO2 (pCO(2)), and the ratio between them (represented by the respiration index, RI) in two oligotrophic lakes of the Atlantic Tropical Forest, encompassing dry and rainy seasons over 19 months. We formulated the hypothesis that thermal stratification events could be coupled to natural hypoxia in deep waters of both lakes. Our results indicated a persistence of CO2 emissions from these tropical lakes to the atmosphere, on average +/- standard error (SE) of 17.4 mg C m(-2) h(-1) probably subsided by terrestrial C inputs from the forest. Additionally, the thermal stratification during the end of the dry season and the rainy summer was coupled to anoxic events and very low RI in deep waters, and to significantly higher pO(2) and RI at the surface (about 20 000 mu atm and 1.0, respectively). In contrast, the water mixing during dry seasons at the beginning of the winter was related to a strong destratification in pO(2), pCO(2) and RI in surface and deep waters, without reaching any anoxic conditions throughout the water column. These findings confirm our hypothesis, suggesting that lakes of the Atlantic Tropical Forest could be dynamic, but especially sensitive to organic inputs. Natural anoxic events indicate that tropical oligotrophic lakes might be highly influenced by human land uses, which increase organic discharges into the watershed.

J	Whiticar, MJ; Suess, E				Whiticar, MJ; Suess, E			The cold carbonate connection between Mono Lake, California and the Bransfield Strait, Antarctica	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Ikaite is a rare form of carbonate - calcium carbonate hexahydrate (CaCO3. 6H(2)O) and is the precursor to thinolites. Metastable 'ikaite' crystals, discovered in unconsolidated marine sediments in the King George Basin in the Bransfield Strait, Antarctica, are related to diagenetic remineralization reactions of organic matter. Stable C, O, and H-isotopes track the response of ikaite crystals, during growth, to changing interstitial fluid conditions as a result of bacterial sulphate reduction and methanogenesis. Ikaites form in preference over calcite or aragonite at the prevailing surface sediment conditions of -1.6 degrees C and 200 bar in the King George Basin. The calcareous tufa towers of the terrestrial, hypersaline Mono Lake of northern California are CaCO3-precipitates formed by the influx of submerged springs of calcium-rich freshwaters entering the alkaline lake (Sigma CO2 = 0.5 m, pH = 9.8). Under current climatic conditions the mineral calcite precipitates, but during the colder Tioga glacial period of Late Wisconsian age (12,000 to 9,000 years BP), and possibly present day during the winter season, the monoclinic calcium carbonate hexahydrate (ikaite) was the dominant phase formed. These paleo-ikaites have since recrystallized to form the calcitic pseudomorph 'thinolites'. They are found elsewhere in recent and ancient sediments of polar regions, e.g., as 'glendonites'. The environmental occurrence of ikaites and their pseudomorphs deem them as potential paleoclimatic indicators of cold environments. The larger crystals are typically restricted to colder, deeper organic-rich sediments or in moderately evaporitic basins. In these cases, the ikaite formation and decomposition may be influenced by additives such as phosphate or amino acids.																			1380-6165						1998	4	3-4					429	454		10.1023/A:1009696617671	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1009696617671													WOS:000082329100009

Both mean length and year-class strength of age 0 pikeperch in November were highly correlated with mean summer temperature. Depending on the environmental conditions, especially water temperature and availability of food, the initially unimodal length frequency distribution of age 0 pikeperch developed into a positively skewed, bimodal or negatively skewed distribution towards the end of the summer. Strong year-classes were characterised by larger mean lengths and a negatively skewed frequency distribution, while weak year-classes were smaller and positively skewed. Stomach contents consisted of zooplankton and macrofauna for the smaller specimens and of age 0 smelt (Osmerus eperlanus) for the larger pikeperch (> 10 cm). Body energy content increased with fish length, and differences in proximate analysis were more pronounced later in the season. The condition of nonpiscivorous age 0 pikeperch was low and decreased over time, while that of piscivorous pikeperch increased. The onset of piscivory, favoured by high temperatures during summer, has a direct positive effect on the growth and survival of age 0 pikeperch.

For the analysis, we chose under-ice and late spring periods of the year as the most productive for Lake Baikal. These periods show the maximum seasonal biomass of phytoplankton and bacterioplankton, which are targets for viruses, including bacteriophages. At that time, the main group of viruses were tailed bacteriophages of the order Caudovirales that belong to the families Myoviridae, Siphoviridae and Podoviridae. Annotation of functional genes revealed that during the under-ice period, the "Phages, Prophages, Transposable Elements and Plasmids" (27.4%) category represented the bulk of the virome. In the late spring period, it comprised 9.6% of the virome. We assembled contigs by two methods: Separately assembled in each virome or cross-assembled. A comparative analysis of the Baikal viromes with other aquatic environments indicated a distribution pattern by soil, marine and freshwater groups. Viromes of lakes Baikal, Michigan, Erie and Ontario form the joint World's Largest Lakes clade.

J	Willey, JD; Kieber, RJ; Lancaster, RD				Willey, JD; Kieber, RJ; Lancaster, RD			Coastal rainwater hydrogen peroxide: Concentration and deposition	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY												Correlation analysis between rainwater component concentrations (hydrogen peroxide, hydrogen ion, nitrate, nonseasalt sulfate and chloride ion) was used to investigate patterns of variation in hydrogen peroxide concentrations in rain collected in Wilmington, North Carolina, a coastal southeastern United States location, between October 1992, and October 1994. Rainwater hydrogen peroxide concentrations in general correlated positively with the pollutant components (hydrogen ion, nitrate and non-seasalt sulfate). This pattern suggests that destruction of hydrogen peroxide by sulfur dioxide is not the dominant factor controlling the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in this rainwater, with the possible exception of winter rain from coastal storms where an inverse correlation between hydrogen peroxide and nonseasalt sulfate was observed. Sequential sampling indicates rapid production of hydrogen peroxide and incorporation into rain within time periods of hours during summer daytime rains. Rain is an important transport mechanism for removal of atmospheric hydrogen peroxide, which may affect the oxidizing capacity of surface waters that receive the rain. During this study time, the annual deposition of hydrogen peroxide by rain was 12 mmole m(-2) yr(-1). An average rain event added approximately half of the resident amount of hydrogen peroxide to the shallow lakes typical of eastern North Carolina; extreme rain events can triple the amount normally present. The episodic nature of rain contributes to the variability in hydrogen peroxide concentration in surface waters. Higher hydrogen peroxide concentrations and greater rainfall amounts cause wet deposition of hydrogen peroxide to be approximately seven times greater during the warm season than the cold season.																			0167-7764					OCT	1996	25	2					149	165		10.1007/BF00053789	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00053789													WOS:A1996VW64000002

In these streams, incubation habitats (redds) were primarily composed of downwelling surface waters with variable but minor mixing of upwelling groundwater. The resulting incubation temperatures were cold (<1°C) and surface water temperatures were accurate predictors of redd temperatures. Both treatment streams displayed evidence of warming in the fall and spring of the 2 years beginning the year of initial harvesting. The increase was most pronounced in the stream without a riparian buffer strip. Clear-cut harvesting with and without a riparian buffer strip altered the thermal regime of surface water and the hyporheic zone in this northern temperate forest where, in addition to salmonid incubation, many biological processes take place. The potential for impacts on stream ecosystems is estimated to be high for the managed forests of this region. Future studies should strive to enhance our understanding of the hydrological connections between forests and streams on this landscape to determine the full effects of timber harvesting on the hydrology and biology of a watershed and its streams.					; Curry, R./ABG-3515-2020	Curry, R.

J	Dubuc, RA; DeVries, DR				Dubuc, RA; DeVries, DR			An exploration of factors influencing crappie early life history in three Alabama impoundments	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Although black crappie Pomoxis nigromaculatus and white crappie P. annularis represent important sport fisheries in North America, we still know little about what influences their variable recruitment. Several abiotic (e.g., water level fluctuations) and biotic (e.g., prey abundance and size structure) factors have been suggested as important to crappie recruitment, but results have not been consistent among studies. We quantified adult characteristics, larval abundance, growth, diet, and postlarval juvenile abundance of crappies in three Alabama impoundments to determine factors consistently affecting crappie life stages across systems. Although adult condition (relative weight, W-r), fecundity, egg diameter, gonadosomatic index, and ovary weight differed among the three impoundments, the differences were not consistent with among-lake differences in chlorophyll-a concentration. Larval density was highest in the least productive system (Lake Martin), and larval production was not related to either adult condition or fecundity. Diet analysis indicated that larvae 4-14 mm in total length strongly selected the smallest prey available in all lakes but that larvae in Lake Martin consumed greater numbers and a higher biomass of crustacean zooplankton than those in Weiss and Jones Bluff lakes, probably because of the higher density of large zooplankton in Lake Martin. Despite the generally earlier presence in spring of crappie larvae in Lake Martin during both years, age-0 crappies, in that lake were not larger than those in the other two lakes in summer. This is probably attributable to cooler early-spring water temperature.,, in Lake Martin. The catch of postlarval juvenile crappies was higher in the more productive lakes than in Lake Martin. Collectively, our results were not consistent with our expectation that lake productivity would positively influence the density of both zooplankton and age-0 crappies. The lack of a positive relationship between larval crappie density and system productivity or zooplankton size was an unexpected result that is probably important to the early life survival and eventual recruitment of crappies and that warrants further investigation.																			0002-8487					MAY	2002	131	3					476	491		10.1577/1548-8659(2002)131<0476:AEOFIC>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(2002)131<0476:AEOFIC>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000175453300010

The unicellular green alga Dunaliella parva is the sole primary producer in the water column of the Dead Sea. The dynamics of the Dunaliella population and the interrelationships between the alga and the physical and chemical parameters in the lake are now well understood. Although cyanobacteria have occasionally been encountered in the Dead Sea as well, they are not known to contribute significantly to the microbial activities in the lake. Dense growth of cyanobacteria is found in various freshwater and saline, cold and warm springs in the Dead Sea area. Abundant cyanobacterial communities develop in the hot (up to 63 degrees C) freshwater springs of Zerka Ma'in and Zara near the eastern shore of the lake. We here report data on the diversity of these communities, based both on in microscopic observations and on molecular phylogeny techniques, and on their content of UV-absorbing pigments (mycosporine-like amino acids. scytonemin), which is of interest in view of the lowered levels of UV light reaching the Dead Sea shores.

J	Imberger, KT; Chiu, CY				Imberger, KT; Chiu, CY			Topographical and seasonal effects on soil fungal and bacterial activity in subtropical, perhumid, primary and regenerated montane forests	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												This study was conducted in subtropical, perhumid, montane forests of north-eastern Taiwan. The study sites were located along a slope from the 2100 in summit to the 1670 m lakeshore of a primary coniferous forest ecosystem and at three nearby regenerated forests. Soil ergosterol content, fungal and bacterial contributions to CO2 production (respiration rate) after glucose addition and hence ratios of fungal to bacterial respiration were evaluated. In the primary forest surface soils (depth 0-10 cm), ergosterol content and respiration rate increased from the summit to the lakeshore site, with the steep sloping shoulder site having the lowest level. At these sites, ergosterol content and CO2 production, calculated on a per grain basis, declined sharply with depth, being 10-1000 fold less in the deepest mineral horizon (>50 cm) as compared to the surface horizon. The soil total respiration rate was found to be significantly higher in summer than winter in the surface soil, but the fungal respiration rate and ergosterol content showed no significant difference between these two seasons. The primary coniferous forest had both a significantly higher respiration rate and ergosterol content than the regenerated Japanese cedar and regenerated broadleaf forest ecosystems, but not the regenerated false cypress forest. Ratios of fungal to bacterial respiration showed no significant differences between sites or soil layers. However, a significant positive correlation (r(2) = 0.746) was exhibited between soil fungal ergosterol content and soil fungal respiration rate for all sampling sites. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This study describes the evolution of part of the Morava River and the Kenicky meander in the Litovelske Pomoravi protected area near the city of Olomouc. The research describes the historical development of the study area using aerial photos, UAV images and geodetic measurements. Long-term measurements and imaging using UAV technologies have allowed a large amount of information to be collected. This information was used to study the Kenicky meander and the Morava River. Significant lateral channel changes in the banks have occurred in the past and generated the Kenicky meander. A significant event occurred in the spring of 2012, when high water levels were caused a rupture of a meander-natural cutoff. The water level was monitored in the Kenicky wood accumulation, which formed in the Kenicky meander, before and after the rupture. Monitoring the movement of wood in the river basin is particularly important because the movement of ice in the winter can cause blockage of the channel and subsequent flooding of water over the banks and into the surrounding communities.

One site was in an open, weakly minerotrophic peatland dominated by M. gale and the other was on the lakeshore. Nitrogenase activity appeared in late May when the leaves unfolded, reached a peak in July when the maximum number of leaves was present, and declined until it was no longer measurable in late Oct. several days after all leaves had fallen. Summer activities were substantially higher at the peatland site than the lakeshore. Maximum activities were 19.8 .+-. 1.9 and 8.1 .+-. 0.7 .mu.mol/h .times. g dry weight (.hivin.x .+-.

The maximum soil temperature measured was 20.degree. C, and no significant diurnal fluctuation in activity was detected. Annual N fixation calculated from the seasonal nitrogenase activity curve was 34 kg N/ha .times. yr at the peatland site with mean dry weight nodule biomass of 104 kg/ha, and 24 kg N/ha .times. yr at the lakeshore with 111 kg/ha nodule biomass. These rates of N fixation are equivalent to 4-5 .times. the amount of N contained in bulk precipitation and are major components in the N budgets of the M. gale plants and wetlands in which they grow.																			0029-8549	1432-1939					1979	43	3					283	294		10.1007/BF00344955	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00344955								28309885					WOS:A1979JA01100004

In Romania has been described in 1993. In our climatic conditions develops 3-4 generations per year. Adult moths are transported by wind anthropogenic transport by vehicles in infested leaf fragments or infested nursery stocks. The most important damage is esthetical, because of fallen foliage but also ecological do to the effect of the reduced active surface of photosynthesis, and progressive decline of frees. Also causes economic losses due to the costs of protect or heal the affected frees. As a consequence different techniques have been adopted in the recent years to control the moth like collection and destruction of fallen leaves where the pupae over-winter or spray of systemic insecticides. They native natural enemies are insufficiently adapted and not able to regulate the leaf miner's population density, even after two decades of moth infestation typical parasitism rates are merely around 0-10%.The chemical control is difficult especially through the application of insecticides; the aerial spraying to treat trees in urban areas requires specialized expensive equipment. Moreover the systemic insecticides may cause side effects on non-target species. The endoterapy technique by introducing pesticides directly inside the frees can be the best solution. Microinjection is a type of trunk injection where small amounts of therapeutic chemicals are introduced directly into the trees body without any contact with the environment. During our experiment a total number of 84 chestnut threes where identified from which 38 were treated with two different active chemical agents: abamectin and imidacloprid. Treatment applications were made in May 2011. A plot of 46 threes where used as control without treatment. The analysis of the collected results shows, that the treated trees of up to 90% are protected with endoterapy against horse chestnuts leaf miner (Cameraria ohridella).

Forced-regressive deposits are a component of the falling-stage systems tract. They are recognized by a basal unconformity which records erosion during the seaward facies shift, and are in turn capped by another unconformity due to subaerial exposure or wave ravinement during subsequent transgression. In wave-dominated settings, the basal "regressive surface of marine erosion" is a scoured surface cut by wave action, because erosion is needed to maintain the seaward-sloping bathymetric profile in equilibrium with the wave energy. The response to falling sea level in tide-dominated settings has not been as thoroughly discussed. The stratal architecture of the Lower Cambrian Cog Group of the southern Canadian Rocky Mountains reveals a new mechanism for the formation of this surface landward of the lever point of balance between sedimentation and erosion in the subtidal environment. Subtidal parasequences of the Lake O'Hara Member are typically composed of thin-bedded mudstone and ripple cross-laminated sandstone, followed by Skolithos pipe rock and thin- to medium-bedded cross-stratified sandstone overlain by thick-bedded cross-stratified sandstone. However, at the top of the Lake O'Hara Member, an erosional surface truncates a pipe-rock interval and the expected capping cross-stratified sandstones are absent. Overlying this surface, the Lake Oesa Member comprises tidal-flat deposits composed mainly of thinly interbedded mudstone and sandstone. This jump in facies at the erosional surface can be explained as a response to a fall in sea level. As the shoreline is forced to regress, the laterally continuous tidal flats advance and the pre-existing shallow-subtidal compound dunes are scoured by strong tidal currents, along with waves, that gradually carve a new equilibrium profile. We argue that the accretion of intertidal flats on top of subtidal sands is an overlooked yet predictable component of falling-stage systems tracts in tide-dominated settings.																			1527-1404	1938-3681				MAR-APR	2012	82	3-4					149	162		10.2110/jsr.2012.18	http://dx.doi.org/10.2110/jsr.2012.18													WOS:000304287200002
J	Mikheev, VN; Pasternak, AF; Valtonen, ET				Mikheev, VN; Pasternak, AF; Valtonen, ET			How do fish ectoparasites Argulus spp. (Crustacea: Branchiura) match with their hosts at the behavioural and ecological scales?	ZHURNAL OBSHCHEI BIOLOGII												Features of the Argulus foliaceus and A. coregoni life cycles including spatial distribution and hatching patterns of the resting eggs as well as their host searching behaviour were analyzed on the basis of field and experimental data obtained in lakes and a fish farm in the Central Finland. Published data on behaviour and ecology of these parasites were also used. The main point of this analysis was an ecological adjustment of the life cycles of parasites to that of their fish hosts at different spatial and temporal scales. Due to different spatial distribution of overwintering eggs, the newly hatched larvae of A. coregoni are more likely to attach to salmonids, which are their main hosts, while A. foliaceus to percids and cyprinids. The main peak of argulid hatching occurs in late spring-early summer and coincides with the period when most of freshwater fishes concentrate close to the shore, either for spawning, or, foraging. Nevertheless, despite the general coincidence, the parasite-host encounter rate could still be very low. The main peak of hatching is followed by a long "tail". We suggest that under fluctuating and uncertain environmental conditions characterised by both abiotic stochasticity and poor predictability of the hosts, an optimal recruitment strategy is to hedge a bet, with a proportion of eggs synchronously hatching and a proportion remaining dormant and hatching at much lower rate during an extended period. One of the main behavioural adaptations to match with the hosts is all-over-the-day searching activity of argulids. The boreal A. coregoni relies primarily on vision, which is most effective in transparent waters during long polar days in summer. Vision is also important in the behavioural repertoire of the temperate A. foliaceus in the light, but olfaction and mechanoreception in the dark provide the highest host searching rate. The two generally sympatric species of argulids segregated on the finer habitat scale. Partially overlapping on salmonid hosts, they prefer ecologically distinct categories of fish, and use different microhabitats for egg laying and searching for hosts.

Geologically, they belong to the formations Flysch and Kalkalpin (Hauptdolomit). The research was directed at finding and quantifying interrelations between forest conditions, soil conditions, runoff and erosion. Therefore, different stages of forest decline were simulated by forest cuts. In autumn of 1992 about 40% and 30% of the growing stock on the Flysch sonnseite 1 and Flysch Schattseite rest sites respectively were cut, while Flysch Sonnseite 2 was maintained unchanged as control plot. With the installation of hydrologic and climatic measuring stations 4 to 5 years' data series have become available. Studies prior to cutting show that in particular the catchment areas in the Flysch zone are very similar as regards natural fastors such as geology, soil, precipitation and forest stands. After cutting, the output of solid matter on the Flysch Sonnseite 1 rest site was twice as large as that on the control plot. On account of a lesser portion of steep areas the sediment yield of Flysch Schattseite is below that of the control, even after cutting. In the very wet year of 1993 the output of solid matter, amounting to about 9 t/hectare on the clear-cut area of Flysch Sonnseite 1, was clearly not tolerable, while in the arid summer of 1994 only about a fifth of this amount was recorded. Solid matter output occurs predominantly in summertime with the largest portions attributed to merely a small number of events.																			0015-8003					SEP	1995	114	4-5					232	249		10.1007/BF02742227	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02742227													WOS:A1995TA92300003
J	Field, JH; Boles, WE				Field, JH; Boles, WE			Genyornis newtoni and Dromaius novaehollandiae at 30,000 bp in central northern New South Wales	ALCHERINGA												Fossil remains of Genyornis newtoni and Dromaius novaehollandiae recovered from horizons at Cuddie Springs, in central northern New South Wales, are securely dated to greater than 30,000 b.p. Genyornis newtoni and D. novaehollandiae were found in sequential layers in association with artefacts of human occupation and other species of megafauna. Palaeoenvironmental information indicates the specimens of G. newtoni were deposited when the region supported an arid vegetation community, principally chenopod shrubland with scattered Eucalyptus and Acacia species. The appearance of Dromaius and disappearance of Genyornis coincided with a local shift to grasslands and the drying of the Cuddie Springs lake. New evidence is presented for the persistence of Genyornis in the arid zone during the lead up to the Last Glacial Maximum.					; Field, Judith/C-7677-2011	Field, Judith/0000-0001-6807-1858; 													0311-5518	1752-0754					1998	22	1-2					177	188		10.1080/03115519808619199	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03115519808619199													WOS:000076932100010

Co-ordinated censuses made during the breeding season each year from 2011-2015 inclusive estimated that there are 15-25 breeding pairs (15-34 according to the number of drakes counted) involving at least 77 individuals at Prespa Lakes, although numbers vary between years. The maximum number of young reared per pair in May June 2011-2015 was estimated at 6.4 +/- 3.5 (mean +/- s.d., n = 35). During the period 1988-2013 the Prespa Lakes have also been the most important wintering site for this population, holding 4.8-100% (mean +/- s.d.= 46.5 +/- 29.5%; n = 21) of the total numbers of Goosanders wintering in the southwest Balkans (i.e. in Albania, the FYR of Macedonia and Greece). Up to 130 birds overwinter in the region, where numbers have increased during the last 30 years, including at Prespa and Ohrid Lakes. The 2014 census provided first evidence of 3-4 pairs of Goosander nesting at Lake Ohrid, the second most important wintering site in the region. Conservation of this isolated population is of utmost importance, at least in a European context.																			0954-6324	2052-6458					2016	66						159	175																WOS:000389171700011

Trophic state decrease after lanthanum-modified bentonite (Phoslock) application to a hyper-eutrophic polymictic urban lake frequented by Canada geese (Branta canadensis)	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Urban lakes are important assets to highly populated regions; however, extensive usage and other influences degrade their water quality, which then requires rehabilitation and maintenance. Hyper-eutrophic Swan Lake, Greater Toronto, Canada (5.5 ha, 4.4 m maximum depth) was a gravel pit that became degraded by elevated total phosphorus (TP) concentrations, mostly from internal P sources. Because Swan Lake is a terminal lake with limited flushing and small external load, a phosphate adsorbing and sediment capping agent, lanthanum-modified bentonite (Phoslock), was applied in spring 2013 to intercept the internal load. Average TP concentration decreased from 0.247 to 0.099 mg/L in the first and 0.060 mg/L in the second post-treatment year. A TP mass balance model adequately predicted post-treatment annual average TP concentration by not including the pre-treatment internal load estimate of 650 to 1100 mg/m(2)/yr. Phytoplankton biomass decreased only in the second post-treatment year, when Secchi transparency (highly correlated with chlorophyll concentration) increased to a growing season average of 1.4 m (range 0.7-2.7) compared to 0.5 m (0.37-0.63) before treatment. We explain the lack of response in the first treatment year with a relatively late application (29 Apr-1May 2013), when P released from the winter bottom sediments had already been taken up by phytoplankton. Recently, a growing population of waterfowl (mostly Canada goose, Branta canadensis) were the highest contributors of nutrients (75%), as indicated by a mass balance based on literature-derived goose P export and biweekly bird census. We recommend waterfowl management or repeated treatment to further improve water quality.					; Nurnberg, Gertrud/AFM-9725-2022	Nurnberg, Gertrud/0000-0003-1752-6562; 													1040-2381	2151-5530					2016	32	1					74	88		10.1080/10402381.2015.1133739	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2015.1133739													WOS:000372472200007
J	Rafat, A; Kheyrollah Pour, H				Rafat, Arash; Kheyrollah Pour, Homa			Interannual variability in air temperature and snow drives differences in ice formation and growth	CRYOSPHERE												Recent warming of northern high-latitude regions has raised critical concerns regarding the safety and reliability of frozen lakes for winter transportation and recreation. This issue is particularly significant in Canada's Northwest Territories (NWT), where seasonally constructed roads over lakes, rivers, and land (winter roads) span thousands of kilometers and act as vital links to isolated communities and resource development projects. Current climate change and weather variability are altering the evolution of lake ice, challenging predictions of freeze-up, ice growth, and ice decay. The accurate simulation of ice evolution is imperative for safe and efficient planning, operation, and maintenance of winter roads under a changing climate and heightened weather variability. This is particularly significant in the early winter period when ice road planning and design are undertaken. Here, we investigate the effects of weather variability on ice formation, growth, and evolution in a small lake near Yellowknife, NWT, Canada. High-resolution measurements of air, snow, ice, and water temperatures were collected continuously from a floating research station between October and December in 2021, 2022, and 2023 and variability in ice evolution and weather examined. Combinations of above- and below-average snowfall and winter air temperatures resulted in variability of up to 17 d in freeze-up dates (FUDs) and 8 d in freeze-up durations. By the end of December, ice thicknesses (hi) varied up to 12 cm, while the duration between the FUD and hi=30 cm varied up to 10 d. Ice thickness was effectively simulated (RMSE=1.11-2.33 cm) using empirical relationships developed using cumulative freezing degree days (CFDDs) and seasonally cumulative snowfall (ST), while snow ice thicknesses was simulated (RMSE=0.83-1.21 cm) using CFDD and daily snowfall. Developed relationships between air temperatures, snow, and ice thicknesses can be used for predicting the minimum ice thicknesses required for commencing ice road planning and construction management under increasingly variable climatic conditions.																			1994-0416	1994-0424				OCT 7	2025	19	10					4335	4353		10.5194/tc-19-4335-2025	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-19-4335-2025													WOS:001587741800001

The Impact of Incongruous Lake Temperatures on Regional Climate Extremes Downscaled from the CMIP5 Archive Using the WRF Model	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												The impact of incongruous lake temperatures is demonstrated using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model to downscale global climate fields. Unrealistic lake temperatures prescribed by the default WRF configuration cause obvious biases near the lakes and also affect predicted extremes hundreds of kilometers from the lakes, especially during winter. Using these default temperatures for the Great Lakes in winter creates a thermally induced wave in the modeled monthly average sea level pressure field, which reaches southern Florida. Differences of more than 0.5 K in monthly average daily maximum 2-m temperature occur along that wave during winter. Noteworthy changes to temperature variability, precipitation, and mesoscale circulation also occur when the default method is used for downscaling. Consequently, improperly setting lake temperatures for downscaling could result in misinterpreting changes in regional climate and adversely affect applications reliant on downscaled data, even in areas remote from the lakes.					; Nolte, Christopher/H-4345-2012	Spero, Tanya/0000-0002-1600-0422; Bowden, Jared/0000-0002-1677-4292; Nolte, Christopher/0000-0001-5224-9965													0894-8755	1520-0442				JAN	2016	29	2					839	853		10.1175/JCLI-D-15-0233.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-15-0233.1													WOS:000368639900002
J	Johnson, JH; McKenna, JE				Johnson, James H.; McKenna, James E., Jr.			Habitat use by juvenile salmonids in Lake Ontario tributaries-species, age, diel and seasonal effects	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Understanding the habitat needs offish and how these requirements may change seasonally over a 24-h period is important, especially for highly managed sport species. Consequently, we examined the diel and seasonal habitat use of four juvenile salmonid species in streams in the Lake Ontario watershed. For juvenile Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and juvenile rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, differences in day versus night habitat use were more profound than seasonal differences. Observed differences in day versus night habitat for all species and age classes were mainly due to the use of less object oriented cover at night and to a lesser extent to the use of slower velocities and smaller substrate at bight. Seasonal differences in habitat use were also observed, likely due to increased fish size, and included movement to deeper and faster water and the use of larger substrate and more cover from summer to winter. Different habitat variables were important to individual species. Juvenile Atlantic salmon were associated with higher water velocities, juvenile rainbow trout with larger substrate and more cover, and subyearling Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha and subyearling coho salmon O. kisutch with small substrate and less cover. Our observations demonstrate that habitat partitioning occurs and likely reduces intraspecific and interspecific competition which may increase the potential production of all four species in sympatry. Consequently, these findings provide important information for resource managers charged with managing, protecting, and enhancing Great Lakes tributaries where all or some of these species occur.

Evaluating Climate Change Impacts on Soil Moisture and Groundwater Resources Within a Lake-Affected Region	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The impact of climate change on surface water resources is reasonably well studied. However, the impact on groundwater resources has only been considered by a few studies worldwide. Here we present an analysis of climate change impacts on groundwater resources in a well-instrumented 6,800-km(2) watershed in the Laurentian Great Lakes Basin. We employ a physics-based modeling pipeline consisting of an ensemble of high-resolution regional climate model projections based on the Weather Research and Forecasting model and the fully integrated three-dimensional hydrologic model HydroGeoSphere. The Weather Research and Forecasting model is run at a resolution as fine as 10 km using two different physics configurations, while HydroGeoSphere simulates the terrestrial hydrosphere at subkilometer scale, from deep groundwater to surface water, including surface water-groundwater interactions. The two Weather Research and Forecasting model physics configurations exhibit opposite climate change responses in summer precipitation. The hydrologic simulations follow the climate forcing, but due to the memory of the subsurface, differences in summer affect the entire seasonal cycle. In the drier climate scenario groundwater levels and recharge decline, while in the wetter scenario groundwater levels rise (recharge remains unchanged). Soil moisture changes accordingly, but primarily in late summer. It is also shown that the magnitude of climate change impacts on groundwater is strongly modulated by local physiographic features. In particular, regions where the groundwater table is deep (below 2 m; 15% of the area) show a high sensitivity to changes in climate forcing. Furthermore, changes in groundwater levels, recharge, and soil moisture typically occur in the same regions, suggesting potentially compounding impacts.

Among these variations, a weak summer monsoon event occurred approximately at 4 ka, the so called "4.2 ka event". This event is considered to have been a relatively sustained and widespread phenomenon at regional scales across southern Asia to eastern Africa. However, little is known about the impact of such variations in the Himalayas, a key location for understanding the monsoon system. Here we present a record of changes in summer monsoon strength during the Holocene from Lake Rara, western Nepal, using redox sensitive elements (Mn/Ti and Mn/Fe) measured by Xray fluorescence (XRF) core-scanner. In addition, organic matter properties (TOC, delta C-13, and C/N) and changes in the C-14 age offset between bulk organic matter and leaf matter - namely the old carbon offset - are used to augment the environmental reconstruction. Collectively, the data indicate a period of prolonged weak monsoon interval at around 4 ka. The timing of onset and recovery from the event observed at Lake Rara exhibits particular similarity with changes in the Indus River discharge. This is the first record of the "4.2 ka event" from the Himalayas based on a relatively well-constructed age model using 14C dates that are not influenced by reservoir effects. These findings provide an important step towards better understanding the spatial and temporal variability in the Holocene Indian Monsoon. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

We developed multiple regression models to relate daily surface water temperatures in lakes of the conterminous United States to 8-day average air temperatures, latitude, elevation, and sampling month and year using data from 5723 lake samples in the months of June-September during the period 1981-2018. Our model explained 79% of the variation with a root-mean-square error of 1.69 degrees C. We predicted monthly average near-surface water temperatures for 1033 lakes for each year from 1981 through 2018. Lakes across the conterminous United States have been warming for the period 1981-2018 at an average heating rate of 0.32 degrees C per decade for the summer months (June-September). The average summer warming from 1981-2018 would be the equivalent of a lake decreasing 259 m in elevation or moving 233 km south. On the basis of national air temperatures starting in 1895, it was inferred that lake water temperatures are variable from year to year and have been steadily increasing since 1964, but that maximum temperatures in the 1930s were just as warm as those in 2008-2018.					; Lecours, Vincent/J-5514-2019	Sharma, Sapna/0000-0003-4571-2768; Lecours, Vincent/0000-0002-4777-3348; 														2073-4441				DEC	2020	12	12							3381	10.3390/w12123381	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12123381													WOS:000602795700001

Heavy geomorphological changes have taken place in lakes with a raised water level, and a lowering of the ice cover during the winter causes rapid changes in the littoral benthos and vegetation. The scale of the harmful effects depends on both the range of regulated water level fluctuations and the water quality; clear water lakes are more resistant to water level regulation than humic lakes, The regulated lakes in northern Finland were subjected to intensive ecological research during the 1980s. Most of the studies were conducted by the water authorities and power companies. As a result of these studies, the principles of so-called ecologically based regulation practices (ERP) have been applied to several lakes under hydropower production. This procedure is based on under water light climate and water level fluctuation data, which make it possible to calculate the proportion of the frozen littoral to the total littoral area. Another procedure calculates the biomass of the benthic fauna from data on water level fluctuation and Secchi depth. The ERP offers a simple way to illustrate to the regulation-permit owners differences between various regulation practices. In the first case study on Lake Kostonjarvi, the new regulation practice was developed in 1991. The new practice included a higher water level target during the winter and a well-defined target for the spring flood water level. During the open water period, high water levels should be avoided. The ERP was successfully put into effect with the exception of 1994, although the annual mean loss for hydropower production was US $0.14 million, In the second case study on Lake Oulujarvi, interest was focused on the higher summertime water level, which should prevent the spread of emergent vegetation, Owing to the high costs of the ERP (US $5 million) a new plan with a lower summertime water level target (122.5 m) and other complementary rehabilitation methods, including removal of shore vegetation, was applied in Oulujarvi.

Possibilities to achieve high results have both tall and shorter as well as light and heavier skiers. Though body mass of men skiers and especially of women should be not heavy comparing with their height. Age, somatic indices of ski-racers women and men, Olympic medal winners. may be estimated as modeling and they may be used to make models for training high mastery ski-racers.																			0860-021X	2083-1862					2006	23	1					55	72																WOS:000236493900005
J	Nishri, A; Brenner, IB; Hall, GEM; Taylor, HE				Nishri, A; Brenner, IB; Hall, GEM; Taylor, HE			Temporal variations in dissolved selenium in Lake Kinneret (Israel)	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Selenium is an essential micronutrient for the growth of the dinoflagellate Peridinium gatunense that dominates the spring algal bloom in Lake Kinneret (LK). The relationship between the levels of dissolved selenium species and the occurance of algal blooms in this lake was studied. During algal blooms of P. gatunense in spring and of the blue-green Aphanizomenon ovalisporum in fall (in 1994) the concentration of epilimnetic dissolved organic Se (Se-org) increased whereas that of selenite (SeIV) decreased, to levels below the limit of detection: 5 ng/l. The disappearance of SeIV during these blooms is attributed to algal uptake and it is suggested that the growth of both algae may have depended on Se-org regeneration. A budget performed for selenate (SeVI) suggests that this species is also consumed by algae but to a lesser extent than SeIV (in 1994 similar to 40% of the epilimnetic load). During the stratification period the hypolimnion of Lake Kinneret becomes anoxic, with high levels of dissolved sulfide. The affects of this environment on the distribution of Se oxy-anions, selenite (SeIV) and selenate (SeVI), were also studied. At the onset of thermal stratification (March) about 35% of the lake inventory of both Se oxidized species are entrapped in the hypolimnion. During stages of oxygen depletion and H2S accumulation, SeIV is completely and SeVI partially removed from this layer. The removal is attributed to reduction followed by formation of particulate reduced products, such as elemental selenium Se(o). The ratio between SeVI to total dissolved selenium (Se-T) in water sources to the lake is similar to 0.84, about twice the corresponding ratio in the lake (similar to 0.44, during holomixis). In the lake about 75% of annual SeVI inflow from external sources undergoes reduction to selenide (Se-II)and Se(o) through epilimnetic algal assimilation and hypolimnetic anoxic reduction, respectively. It is suggested that the latter oxidation of the dissolved organic selenide released from biogenic particles and of Se(o) only to the tetravalent species is the cause for the lower ratio of SeVI/Se-T in the lake.																			1015-1621						1999	61	3					215	233		10.1007/s000270050063	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s000270050063													WOS:000082088400003

We compared macrophyte vegetation and NPP records with data for authigenic carbonate deposition estimated from concentrations of total inorganic carbon. We estimated saline and variable trophic conditions during the last glacial. An association indicative of higher salinity conditions characterized by NPP and diatom assemblages characteristic of alkaline and saline environments is documented. Changes in hydrophyte taxa and microalgae assemblages were related to trophic level fluctuations. Higher salinity environments were contemporary with arid intervals reconstructed based on abundances of inorganic carbonate. Two main periods were evident in this record: (i) 85-29 k cal a BP [Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5b-MIS 3] characterized by saline conditions with high abundance of Type-TXA, and variable high carbonate content, and (ii) 29-10.8 k cal a BP (MIS 2-MIS 1) when conditions changed to higher trophic levels and lower salinities, characterized by extremely low values of Type-TXA and carbonate content. Spring and summer insolation and latitudinal position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone over the last glacial were considered as possible controllers of the recorded paleoenvironmental changes.

Average weight based on 50-1600 fish approximated 0.5 lb. for sauger and 0.7 for walleye in most areas. Fishing success declined during the study period. A sample of the sauger catch revealed mainly age-groups III, IV and V. Fish catches appeared unrelated to either water temperatures or dissolved oxygen. Increased use of nylon nets had no apparent effect on annual production.																									1959	16	1					131	145		10.1139/f59-014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f59-014													WOS:A1959WZ51700014

Water sources and composition of dissolved gases and bubbles in a saline high Arctic spring	PLOS ONE												We investigate the water sources for a perennial spring, "Little Black Pond," located at Expedition Fiord, Axel Heiberg Island in the Canadian High Arctic based on dissolved gases. We measured the dissolved O-2 in the likely sources Phantom Lake and Astro Lake and the composition of noble gases (He-3/He-4, He-4, Ne,Ar-36, Ar-40, Kr, Xe), N-2, O-2, CO2, H2S, CH4, and tritium dissolved in the outflow water and bubbles emanating from the spring. The spring is associated with gypsum-anhydrite piercement structures and occurs in a region of thick, continuous permafrost (400-600 m). The water columns in Phantom and Astro lakes are uniform and saturated with O-2. The high salinity of the water emanating from the spring, about twice sea water, affects the gas solubility. Oxygen in the water and bubbles is below the detection limit. The N-2/Ar ratio in the bubbles and the salty water is 89.9 and 40, respectively, and the relative ratios of the noble gases, with the exception of Neon, are consistent with air dissolved in lake water mixed with air trapped in glacier bubbles as the source of the gases. The Ne/Ar ratio is similar to 62% of the air value. Our results indicate that about half (0.47 +/- 0.1) of the spring water derives from the lakes and the other half from subglacial melt. The tritium and helium results indicate that the groundwater residence time is over 70 years and could be thousands of years.

Thermodynamic energy yield for the oxidation reactions with various electron acceptors decreases in the order of O-2> NO3- > Mn-4(+)> Fe-3(+)> SO42- > CO2. The predominant terminal electron accepting (TEA) process has an influence on the biogeochemical cycles of nutrients as well as the production of important greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide and methane from estuarine sediments. The research questions of this study were (1) what are the environmental factors (pH, salinity, organic carbon, sulphate, redox potential) explaining variability in TEA activities such as nitrate reduction rate (NRR), iron reduction rate (IRR), sulphate reduction rate (SRR) and methane production rate (MPR) and (2) which is the predominant TEA process during degradation of organic matter. To determine the TEA activities, sediment samples collected from 13 sampling stations of Ashtamudi estuary during monsoon 2014 and summer 2015 were incubated with sulphate depleted artificial seawater, under anaerobic conditions for 72 h, in microcosms. Spatial variations dominated temporal variations for environmental variables. Nevertheless, biogeochemical processes showed a distinct seasonal variation. Total TEA activity was higher during summer than monsoon, indicating the higher heterotrophic microbial activity favored by high temperature. Individually, SRR was the maximum during summer, while NRR, IRR and MPR were the maximum during monsoon. Sulphate reduction was observed to be the predominant electron accepting process in all sampling stations with cumulative values of 3125.79 and 4046.07 nmol cm(-3) day(-1) during monsoon and summer respectively. This was followed by NRR, IRR and MPR. Although thermodynamically more favorable, NRR could not predominate due to scarcity of nitrate in sediments. Nevertheless, two-fold and five-fold increase in methanogenesis and denitrification were observed respectively during monsoon in sampling stations, which cannot be ignored, owing to the importance of methane and nitrous oxide as a potent greenhouse gas.

Aquatic insect assemblages associated with subalpine stream segment types in relict glaciated headwaters	INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY												Aquatic habitats and biotic assemblages in subalpine headwaters are sensitive to climate and human impacts. Understanding biotic responses to such perturbations and the contribution of high-elevation headwaters to riverine biodiversity requires the assessment of assemblage composition among habitat types. We compared aquatic insect assemblages among headwater stream segment types in relict glaciated subalpine basins in Mt. Rainier National Park, Washington, USA. Aquatic insects were collected during summer and autumn in three headwater basins. In each basin, three different stream segment types were sampled: colluvial groundwater sources, alluvial lake inlets, and cascade-bedrock lake outlets. Ward's hierarchical cluster analysis revealed high diversity in aquatic insect assemblages, and non-metric multidimensional scaling indicated that spatial and temporal patterns in assemblage composition differed among headwater stream segment types. Aquatic insect assemblages showed more fidelity to stream segment types than to individual basins, and the principal environmental variables associated with assemblage structure were temperature and substrate. Indicator species analyses identified specific aquatic insects associated with each stream segment type. Several rare and potentially endemic aquatic insect taxa were present, including the recently described species, Lednia borealis (Baumann and Kondratieff). Our results indicate that aquatic insect assemblages in relict glaciated subalpine headwaters were strongly differentiated among stream segment types. These results illustrate the contribution of headwaters to riverine biodiversity and emphasise the importance of these habitats for monitoring biotic responses to climate change. Monitoring biotic assemblages in high-elevation headwaters is needed to prevent the potential loss of unique and sensitive biota.																			1752-458X	1752-4598				MAY	2013	6	3					422	434		10.1111/j.1752-4598.2012.00210.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-4598.2012.00210.x													WOS:000319406400022
J	Wang, Q; Hamilton, PB; Xu, M; Kattel, G				Wang, Qian; Hamilton, Paul B.; Xu, Min; Kattel, Giri			Comparison of boosted regression trees vs WA-PLS regression on diatom-inferred glacial-interglacial climate reconstruction in Lake Tiancai (southwest China)	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Quantitative paleoclimate reconstructions based on biological fossils over glacial-interglacial timescales are a major source of information on long-term climate variability. However, such reconstructions can present major methodological challenges, as calibration methods based on modern climatic and biological patterns may yield biased results, especially when data are particularly sensitive to the influence of secondary environmental variables in the training set or fossil assemblage. A machine-learning technique, boosted regression tree (BRT), is compared with a weighted averaging-partial least squares (WA-PLS) regression in a diatom-based summer (mean July) temperature transfer function with a calibration set of 273 samples collected from China. Using these calibration methods and a fossil diatom sequence from Lake Tiancai (southwest China; 3898 m a.s.l.), the summer temperatures covering the last glaciation and entire Holocene (18000 cal yr BP to present) are reconstructed. The record is validated by applying several statistical reconstruction diagnostics and compared with pollen and diatom records from the same sediment core. The results suggest that the BRT-based calibration model, which produced a coefficient of determination (r(2) = 0.85) and root-mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP = 1.65 degrees C) offers substantial improvements over WA-PLS. The record shows that the summer temperature varies by-2.5 degrees C across the entire period. The temperature evolution inferred by diatom-based BRT model is characterized by an early cool phase (with a MJT of 9.3 degrees C) prior to 10000 cal yr BP, followed by a clear mid Holocene thermal maximum (-1.1 degrees C above the present-day temperature) from 6000 to 3500 cal yr BP and a subsequent cooling that ended at 1500 cal yr BP. This contrasts with the chironomid-based temperature transfer function in the same sequence showing a warmer period between 8500 and 6000 cal yr BP. The overall pattern of diatom-based summer temperature reconstructions broadly matches the climate change inferred from pollen records from Tiancai Lake and other records from the surrounding regions, suggesting that summer temperatures respond to insolation forcing and the variability of the southwest monsoon. We argue that the BRT-based climate model potentially outperforms the other models in southwest China when using a large and non-linear calibration set of diatoms for reconstructing long-term temperature.					; Xu, Min/HHY-9228-2022; Kattel, Giri/AAV-3298-2020	Wang, Qian/0000-0002-7562-258X; Hamilton, Paul/0000-0001-6938-6341; Kattel, Giri/0000-0002-8348-6477													1040-6182	1873-4553				APR 10	2021	580						53	66		10.1016/j.quaint.2021.01.010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2021.01.010		MAR 2021											WOS:000632047700005
J	COX, RR; KADLEC, JA				COX, RR; KADLEC, JA			DYNAMICS OF POTENTIAL WATERFOWL FOODS IN GREAT-SALT-LAKE MARSHES DURING SUMMER	WETLANDS												Changes in biomass of potential waterfowl foods were investigated in Great Salt Lake marshes during. July and August of 1988-89. In freshwater habitats, biomass of midge (Chironomidae) larvae and pupae and water boatman (Corixidae) nymphs declined from early to late summer. Biomass of mayfly (Ephemeroptera) and damselfly (Zygoptera) nymphs increased over the same time interval. Seeds of horned pondweed (Zannichellia palustris), widgeongrass (Ruppia maritima), and sage pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus) increased during summer. In saline habitats, brine fly (Ephydridae) larvae and water boatman biomass declined from early to late summer. In late June and early July, animal items made up 51% of total potential foods measured in the study area, but by mid July, plant items made up 91% of total potential foods. Changes in densities of food resources, particularly relative biomass of animal and plant foods, are probably an important determinant of dietary consumption in postbreeding adult ducks and ducklings in these marshes. For many duck species, midsummer may mark an important transition between differential animal and plant consumption.																			0277-5212					MAR	1995	15	1					1	8		10.1007/BF03160674	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03160674													WOS:A1995QP67900001

Here we assess the skill of seasonal forecasting tools for lakes and reservoirs set up at four sites in Australia and Europe. These tools consist of coupled hydrological catchment and lake models forced with seasonal meteorological forecast ensembles to provide probabilistic predictions of seasonal anomalies in water discharge, temperature and ice-off. Successful implementation requires a rigorous assessment of the tools' predictive skill and an apportionment of the predictability between legacy effects and input forcing data. To this end, models were forced with two meteorological datasets from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), the seasonal forecasting system, SEAS5, with 3-month lead times and the ERA5 reanalysis. Historical skill was assessed by comparing both model outputs, i.e. seasonal lake hindcasts (forced with SEAS5), and pseudo-observations (forced with ERA5). The skill of the seasonal lake hindcasts was generally low although higher than the reference hindcasts, i.e. pseudo-observations, at some sites for certain combinations of season and variable. The SEAS5 meteorological predictions showed less skill than the lake hindcasts. In fact, skilful lake hindcasts identified for selected seasons and variables were not always synchronous with skilful SEAS5 meteorological hindcasts, raising questions on the source of the predictability. A set of sensitivity analyses showed that most of the forecasting skill originates from legacy effects, although during winter and spring in Norway some skill was coming from SEAS5 over the 3-month target season. When SEAS5 hindcasts were skilful, additional predictive skill originates from the interaction between legacy and SEAS5 skill. We conclude that lake forecasts forced with an ensemble of boundary conditions resampled from historical meteorology are currently likely to yield higher-quality forecasts in most cases.					; Clayer, Francois/I-6670-2015; Herrera García, Sixto/GNP-0189-2022; Marcé, Rafael/H-5147-2012; Frias, Maria/F-4874-2012; Mercado-Bettin, DANIEL/HPF-6131-2023; Clayer, François/I-6670-2015; Sample, Jane/E-2403-2019; French, Andrew/M-4734-2014; Rinke, Karsten/E-6163-2016; Jennings, Eleanor/ISU-1018-2023; Herrera Garcia, Sixto/A-2573-2015; Marce, Rafael/H-5147-2012	Shikhani, Muhammed/0000-0003-3558-4328; Frias, Maria Dolores/0000-0001-5148-1156; Clayer, Francois/0000-0001-6939-400X; Norling, Magnus/0009-0000-1172-5398; Sample, James/0000-0002-0861-3982; Jackson-Blake, Leah/0000-0002-4915-8779; Mercado-Bettin, Daniel/0000-0003-4572-3029; Herrera Garcia, Sixto/0000-0002-5384-179X; Marce, Rafael/0000-0002-7416-4652													1027-5606	1607-7938				MAR 29	2023	27	6					1361	1381		10.5194/hess-27-1361-2023	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1361-2023													WOS:000960439800001

Intraspecific and seasonal variations in fruit consumption by Didelphis albiventris, and its contribution to dispersal and germination of endozoochorous seeds were analyzed in a Semideciduous seasonal forest. The study was conducted at Morro do Coco, which is a hilly area in the municipal district of Viamao, RS, Brazil, bordering the shore of Guaiba lake (30 degrees 16'15"S, 51 degrees 02'54"W), between June 2013 and May 2014, with a total sampling effort of 2992 trap-nights. A total of 18 individuals were captured and 24 fecal samples were collected. Fruits were identified in 96% of the samples, corresponding to 18 plant species, belonging to 10 families. The most common species were Ficus cestrifolia and Syagrus romanzoffiana, which occurred in 66% of the samples, followed by Banara parviflora and Cecropia pachystachya, both with a 25% rate of occurrence. There were no differences between the richness of fruit consumed by males and females (t = 0.083; DF = 32; p = 0.934) and there were no seasonal variations (H = 3.165; p = 0.367). The greatest breadth of dietary niche occurred during the summer, when twice as many fruit species were recorded in the diet than during the autumn, which was the season with the smallest breadth. Both germination percentage and germination velocity of Ficus cestrifolia and Psidium sp. seeds increased after passage through the animals' digestive tracts (percentage germination increased more than 40%) and velocity was up to 7 times highest). Didelphis albiventris can be considered a frugivorous-omnivorous species, since fruit are an important item of its diet, and it contributes to dispersal of a large quantity of small endozoochorous seeds, increasing both germination percentage and germination velocity of some species.

Forced regressive deposits of a deglaciation sequence: Example from the Late Quaternary succession in the Lake Saint-Jean basin (Quebec, Canada)	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Differentiating between forced regressive deposits from deglacial periods in high latitude domains and forced regressive deposits from the onset of glacial periods in low latitude domains is fundamental for the accurate interpretation of glacial cycles within the geological record and then for the reconstruction of palaeogeography and palaeo-climate. A forced regressive deglacial sequence is documented from the Lake Saint-Jean basin (Quebec, Canada). In this area, the Late Pleistocene to Holocene sediments have recorded the Laurentide ice sheet retreat accompanied by the invasion of marine waters (Laflamme Gulf) from ca 129cal kyr bp. Subsequently, fluvio-deltaic and coastal prograding wedges were deposited; they followed the base-level fall due to glacio-isostatic rebound. This succession, representing a transition from glacial to post-glacial periods within a previously glaciated area, was investigated through recent mapping, preserved landforms, facies analysis, and new optical stimulated luminescence and radiocarbon dates. Three basin-scale geological sections share a common lower part made of isolated ice-contact fan deposits overlying bedrock. Throughout the entire basin, ice-contact fans are capped by glacimarine muds. Above, fluvial and coastal prograding systems were deposited and evolved through four steps: (i) deltaic systems progressively increased in width; (ii) coastal influence on sedimentation increased; (iii) hydrographic drainage systems became more organised; and (iv) deltas graded from steep (Gilbert delta) to low-angle foresets (mouth-bar delta). Deposited during the base-level fall from glacio-isostatic rebound, the complete succession has been designated as a single falling stage system tract referred to as a deglacial falling stage system tract. It is representative of a deglaciation sequence in areas previously covered by ice during glacial periods (i.e. medium to high latitude domains). Diagnostic criteria are provided to identify such a deglacial falling stage system tract in the geological record, which may aid identification of previously unknown glacial cycles.					; Alexis, Nutz/AAG-3534-2019; Bouchette, Frédéric/E-9825-2010	Nutz, Alexis/0000-0002-8224-5639; Hay, Murray/0000-0002-6850-8842; Schuster, Mathieu/0000-0002-4412-8685; Ghienne, JF/0000-0002-9448-5285													0037-0746	1365-3091				OCT	2015	62	6					1573	1610		10.1111/sed.12196	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sed.12196													WOS:000362555200003

Bygholm (58 ha) is a shallow eutrophic reservoir and Ring (22 ha) is a natural mesotrophic lake. The positions of the tagged fish were recorded through weekly trackings and a number of 3-day tracking sessions during a 9-month period. Diel activity patterns, home range sizes and habitat utilization by pike was compared between the reservoir and the lake. The pike in the lake occupied larger areas than the pike in the reservoir and were less associated with vegetation. In both waters pike were found more often in, or close to, vegetation during summer than during winter. No difference in average movement of pike was seen between the waters, but pike were more stationary in the reservoir than in the lake. There was no difference in the level of movement between different times of the day, but the diel rhythm of the pike changed significantly over the year. There were large behavioral differences between pike in the lake and in the reservoir and even more variation between individuals within each population.

Doughnut in the desert: Late-winter production pulse in southern Lake Michigan	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Contrary to expectations of fairly uniform and unstratified waters, sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor (SeaWiFS) and moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery revealed a spatially complex chlorophyll a pattern, termed the "doughnut," in southern Lake Michigan during March to April. Phosphorus-rich coastal waters and sediments are entrained along gyre convergence zones and moved into deeper waters, stimulating a ring of production. Cross-lake surveys (April 2001 and April 2006) with two separate profiling instruments (vertical Seabird CTD casts, horizontal Acrobat tows) uncovered columnar patterns for Chl a, temperature, and other variables (colored dissolved organic matter, transmissivity) consistent with a spatially complex, rotating gyre structure. Optical plankton counter transects, plankton net tows, and sonar documented that the spatial heterogeneity extends to higher levels of food webs (zooplankton). The horizontal and vertical patterns suggest a previously unrecognized coupling between late-winter storm-induced gyre formation, coastal water plus sediment capture, and deep-water productivity. The pulse may explain how certain zooplankton species characteristic of the Great Lakes can successfully overwinter through what was previously perceived as a very unproductive and resource-stressful period. The magnitude of the winter pulse may be linked to climate change, as higher temperatures and more frequent winter storms suppress coastal ice formation and encourage movement of nutrient-enriched waters and sediments into deeper waters.

J	Riis, T; Sand-Jensen, K				Riis, T; Sand-Jensen, K			Development of vegetation and environmental conditions in an oligotrophic Danish lake over 40 years	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Oligotrophic 'Lobelia-lakes' are rare in Denmark. The few that have survived widespread eutrophication are in uncultivated sandy regions and are threatened by acidification and increased nutrient deposition from the atmosphere. Grane Langso was considered the dearest lake in Denmark in the 1950s, when isoetids grew to 5.5 m depth and characeans covered the deepest part of the lake bottom at 11.5 m. The goal of the study reported here was to examine whether the lake has maintained this high quality by studying the development of macrophyte distribution and composition in relation to the changes in pH, nutrient conditions and transparency over the past 40 years. 2. Aquatic mosses now dominate the vegetation rather than rooted isoetids, probably as a result of acidification (summer median pH was 5.60 in 1958-1963 compared to 5.07 in 1976-1994). Along with a reduced median pH, annual pH fluctuations have increased from about 0.3 units 40 years ago to 0.9 units today. 3. The depth limit of isoetid species has declined markedly and Nitella flexilis, which previously dominated the dense bottom vegetation in the hypolimnion, has disappeared. These changes can be accounted for by reduced light penetration and an increased cover of filamentous green algae and mosses on the isoetid species. 4. The decline in light penetration was mainly caused by increased humic content following storm falls in 1981-84, but increased nutrient deposition may also have stimulated the growth of phytoplankton and filamentous green algae. The restricted macrophyte growth in the hypolimnion during summer can account for the change from oxygen supersaturation 40 years ago to anoxia today. The reduced light penetration has resulted in cooling of the hypolimnion, thereby increasing the stability and duration of thermal stratification. This increases the likelihood of anoxia in August-September. Profound changes in the plant community and in oxygen conditions have occurred, even though the decline of pH has been small and long-term changes in nutrient concentration have been difficult to detect.

Seasonal habitat use of yellow perch Perca flavescens in a north-temperate lake	AQUACULTURE, FISH AND FISHERIES												Knowledge of species-specific fish biology, ecology, and habitat use is critical for informing science-based management. Yellow perch Perca flavescens are an ecologically and recreationally important fish species. Yet, for many north-temperate systems (e.g. inland lakes of Wisconsin), little is known about yellow perch seasonal habitat use and ecology. We characterised yellow perch seasonal spatial distribution, size-structure, and condition between littoral and pelagic habitats in Crystal Lake (Vilas Co., WI) during the open water period of 2021. Seasonal spatial distribution and population size-structure were characterised by contemporaneous sampling in littoral and pelagic habitats using mini-fyke nets and vertical gill nets, respectively. Relative abundance estimates for yellow perch in the littoral zone were greatest during early spring and declined throughout the open water season. Yellow perch pelagic relative abundance estimates were lowest in spring, peaked at the onset of stratification, and then declined and remained relatively consistent throughout the open water season. In general, yellow perch population size-structure and condition were greatest in the pelagic zone. Our findings suggest that after spring spawning, larger yellow perch prefer/select pelagic habitats, while sub-adults and juveniles prefer/select littoral habitats, potentially resulting from increased predator refugia and(or) resource availability. Our results emphasise the importance of evaluating gear and fishery assessment bias, particularly when the target species may use a range of habitat types within a system.					; Mrnak, Joseph/ABH-1130-2020	Mrnak, Joseph/0000-0003-0909-7390; 													2693-8847					AUG	2023	3	4					380	387		10.1002/aff2.123	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aff2.123													WOS:001124922700003
J	Hirst, CN; Cyr, H; Jordan, IA				Hirst, CN; Cyr, H; Jordan, IA			Distribution of exopolymeric substances in the littoral sediments of an oligotrophic lake	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Bacteria and algae release exopolymeric substances (EPS) that perform a wide range of important functions in aquatic and terrestrial systems. in this study we measured EPS in sediments at nine littoral sites around a shallow oligotrophic basin, and tested whether the concentration and composition of EPS was related to sediment characteristics. The concentrations of both loosely bound (colloidal) and tightly bound (capsular) EPS carbohydrates ranged up to similar to800 mug glucose equiv. cm(-2) and were well within the range of concentrations reported from marine intertidal flats, where EPS play an important role in stabilizing sediments, affecting nutrient exchanges between sediments and the water column, feeding benthic invertebrates, and sequestering and increasing the transfer of contaminants to food webs. Proteins were an important component of the EPS in these littoral sediments, with protein:carbohydrate ratios of similar to0.4. In summer, the concentrations of most EPS fractions were positively related (P < 0.05) to the porewater and organic matter content of the sediments. Capsular EPS concentrations were lower in the fall, with a simultaneous increase in colloidal proteins but not in colloidal carbohydrates. This suggests that the carbohydrates in this colloidal EPS may be more labile than the proteins. Our results suggest that exopolymeric substances could be an important, but neglected, component of littoral sediments in lakes.																			0095-3628	1432-184X				JUL	2003	46	1					22	32		10.1007/s00248-002-1064-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-002-1064-6								12754660					WOS:000184639000003

Scientifically uncovering the response mechanisms of water environments under complex hydrological conditions has become a challenging research objective, in the interdisciplinary of environmental science and hydrology. This study delved into the unstable response process between water level and quality of Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake as well as one of the most intense hydrological variability water bodies in China. We developed a non-steady state identification approach incorporates Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) and Wavelet Correlation (WTC) methods. The results showed that there were remarkable alterations in the hydrological regime and water quality at both seasonal and long-term scale of Poyang Lake over the past nine years. These alterations were accompanied by significant non-steady state characteristics, reflecting the changes in the response between water level and quality. The employment of the STL-WTC method revealed a significant nonlinear response between the long-term trends of water level and quality, in both the 4-month and 12-month frequency bands. In particular, our findings showed an intriguing shift towards in-phase behavior between water level and quality in the 12-month frequency band, rather than the anti-phase pattern observed previously. This correlation changed more significantly in seasons where the fluctuation pattern of water level varied sharply, such as summer and winter in Poyang Lake. Our study underscored the hydrological conditions and water quality of large lakes connected to rivers do not exhibit a long-term stable unidirectional response state, alterations in hydrological rhythms may induce a transition in the relationship from negative correlation towards nonlinear positive correlation between water level and water quality. Finally, this non-steady state fluctuation of water conditions can further exacerbate long-term and seasonal degradation of water quality.																			0043-1354	1879-2448				AUG 15	2023	242								120247	10.1016/j.watres.2023.120247	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2023.120247		JUN 2023						37354845					WOS:001028514500001

Here, we investigate the multi-decadal variation of the water levels and outflows of Lake Garda, the largest in Italy, where the dam operational rules and the related basin water needs heavily altered the annual and seasonal trend of the lake regime since its regulation in 1951. Daily lake levels and outflows were first collected and digitized for the period 1888-2020, thus providing a unique database of 133 years that allowed a consistent comparison between natural and regulated periods. Statistical analyses highlighted a significant change of the inter-annual trend of the lake outflows, which passed from upward to downward after regulation, against a constant increasing trend of the water levels. Conversely, water levels showed a more remarkable shifts on a seasonal scale if compared to the outflows, revealing the influence of summer and winter basin water needs. Additional analyses on the inter-annual variation of the main downstream water demands regulated by the dam, i.e. the irrigation, hydropower and fluvial ecosystem requirements, outlined their relevance in changing the lake regime, influencing dam operational policies, which progressively limited the share of water released for ecosystem integrity. A comparison between the lake levels and outflows recorded for the pre-regulation and post-regulation periods of some selected European perialpine lakes finally highlighted different effects on the lake regime, drawing attention to the importance of defining the role of the dam operational policies within the current scenario of climate change and changing water demands.					; Tubino, Marco/JCE-3568-2023; Adami, Luca/JRW-3056-2023; Zolezzi, Guido/E-9476-2013	Adami, Luca/0000-0003-2645-8725; Zolezzi, Guido/0000-0003-2807-7387; Hinegk, Luigi/0000-0001-8801-2003; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				JAN 1	2022	301								113893	10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113893	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113893		OCT 2021						34634725					WOS:000711394000005

Thermal Imagery of Groundwater Seeps: Possibilities and Limitations	GROUNDWATER												Quantifying groundwater flow at seepage faces is crucial because seepage faces influence the hydroecology and water budgets of watersheds, lakes, rivers and oceans, and because measuring groundwater fluxes directly in aquifers is extremely difficult. Seepage faces provide a direct and measurable groundwater flux but there is no existing method to quantitatively image groundwater processes at this boundary. Our objective is to determine the possibilities and limitations of thermal imagery in quantifying groundwater discharge from discrete seeps. We developed a conceptual model of temperature below discrete seeps, observed 20 seeps spectacularly exposed in three dimensions at an unused limestone quarry and conducted field experiments to examine the role of diurnal changes and rock face heterogeneity on thermal imagery. The conceptual model suggests that convective air-water heat exchange driven by temperature differences is the dominant heat transfer mechanism. Thermal imagery is effective at locating and characterizing the flux of groundwater seeps. Areas of active groundwater flow and ice growth can be identified from thermal images in the winter, and seepage rates can be differentiated in the summer. However, the application of thermal imagery is limited by diverse factors including technical issues of image acquisition, diurnal changes in radiation and temperature, and rock face heterogeneity. Groundwater discharge rates could not be directly quantified from thermal imagery using our observations but our conceptual model and experiments suggest that thermal imagery could quantify groundwater discharge when there are large temperature differences, simple cliff faces, non-freezing conditions, and no solar radiation.

The decrease pH was accompanied by an increase in nitrate whereas the other strong acid anion, SO42- remained relatively constant. Chemical mass-balance calculations, using data from the Integrated Lake-Watershed Acidification Study, indicate that the peak in acidification observed in the Adirondack Mountains in the spring is caused by (1) a dilution of base cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, and K+) and associated alkalinity by snowmelt, (2) an increase in NO3- concentration in the acidified portion of the lakes, and (3) the constant elevated concentration of SO42-. At Woods Lake, the NO3- that accumulated in the snowpack plus that deposited from the atmosphere during snowmelt was sufficient to account for the increased NO3- in and transported from the lake. At Panther Lake, an additional source of NO3- was needed and was believed to be contributed by nitrification in the upper soil horizons. If atmospheric deposition of sulfur is reduced, low-alkalinity systems like Woods and moderate-alkalinity systems like Panther will be less likely to develop strong acidity during spring acidification.

Endolithic microorganisms from spring mound evaporite deposits (southern Tunisia)	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												This paper investigates endolithic microorganisms in modern gypsum crusts located in arid and saline areas of southern Tunisia. In arid regions, the endolithic mode of life facilitates the survival of the microorganisms and protects them from extreme environmental conditions. The gypsum crusts are the product of evaporite precipitation atop spring mounds developed at the margins of the Chott el Jerid, a saline lake close to the Algerian border. The early mineral precipitation has prevented the complete degradation of these microorganisms and their metabolic products because of the rapid sealing provided by the gypsum crusts. The spring mound structures of the Chott el Jerid offer an opportunity to study the endolithic communities in evaporite and arid environments. An understanding of where and how life survives in such extreme conditions, and how life signal prints in the rocks may help in search for life in the geological record and for astrobiological purposes.

From 21 to 15 cal kyr BP, nearshore and swamp/marsh environments are evidenced from clastic deposition, macrophytes debris and Ca-Mg carbonate enrichments. A transgressive sequence, starting around 15 cal kyr BP, lead to the humid lacustrine optimum between 15 and 7 cal kyr BP. From 12 to 10 cal kyr BP, anoxic lake bottom environments were favored by the concomitant effects of high primary productivity, increased subsidence and inputs of volcanic ash in the lake. The Middle Holocene (7-3 cal kyr BP) is characterized by high concentrations of silt, carbonates, and low organic content, which indicate the occurrence of relatively oxic, shallow and saline depositional environments, especially around 7 and 3.4 cal kyr BP. Although grainsize and TOC profiles suggest that shallow environments likely persisted in the Upper Holocene, low Mg concentration values for the last 3 kyr may indicate a trend toward relatively more dilute environments. The two main Lake Rukwa low-stand periods, at 21-15 and 7-3 cal kyr BP, correspond remarkably well with the insolation maximum at the Equator, which occurred at 17 kyr BP for the spring equinox, and at 6 kyr BP for the autumn equinox, respectively. We suggest that, during these periods of minimum inter-hemispheric insolation gradients, monsoon circulation weakened in south equatorial regions, and the ITCZ was located north of 8degreesS in east Africa.

The Lake Abhe geothermal system occurs within a rift basin filled with Pliocene-Quaternary volcanic (mainly basalt) and lacustrine sediments. The thermal water in Lake Abhe geothermal field discharges as hot springs at the bottom of hydrothermal carbonate chimneys distributed along the main faults. Hot springs of Lake Abhe geothermal field as well as ground- and surface waters were sampled and major elements, trace elements, and isotopic (O-18/O-16, H-2/H-1, H-3, S-34/S-32, Sr-82/Sr-86) compositions were analyzed. Hydrochemical features of the hot springs are dissimilar from those of warm waters: the former are mainly Na-Cl dominated whereas the latter were mostly Na-HCO3-Cl-SO4 and Na-HCO3-Cl. The isotopic composition of sulfur and oxygen in dissolved sulfates suggests equilibrium with anhydrite as the major source of sulfates in the thermal waters. Chemical (mainly Na/K and SiO2), isotope (bisulfate- and anhydrite-water), and multiple mineral equilibrium approaches were applied to estimate the reservoir temperature of the hot springs in the Lake Abhe geothermal field. These different geothermometric approaches estimated a temperature range of the deep geothermal reservoir of 120-160 degrees C. In spite of the relatively wide range, the three different approaches led to a same mean of about 135 degrees C. The hot spring and warm borehole waters from the southwestern part of the Republic of Djibouti showed a possible mixing with hydrothermal waters from the local rift. The negligible tritium content and the low deuterium values (delta H-2 < -10 parts per thousand) suggest a deeper circulation and an old age for geothermal water, in comparison with surface waters and the local aquifers recharged by modem precipitations (delta H-2 > -10 parts per thousand).

Very low strengths of interplanetary meteoroids and small asteroids	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE												We have assembled data on 13 cases of meteorite falls with accurate tracking data on atmospheric passage. In all cases, we estimate the bulk strength of the object corresponding to its earliest observed or inferred fragmentation in the high atmosphere, and can compare these values with measured strengths of meteorites in the taxonomic class for that fall. In all 13 cases, the strength corresponding to earliest observed or inferred fragmentation is much less than the compressive or tensile strength reported for that class of stony meteorites. Bulk strengths upon atmospheric entry of these bodies are shown to be very low, 0.1 to approximately 1 MPa on first breakup, and maximal strength on breakup as 1-10 MPa corresponding to weak and "crumbly" objects, whereas measured average tensile strength of the similar meteorite classes is about 30 MPa. We find a more random relation between bulk sample strength and sample mass than is suggested by a commonly used empirical power law. We estimate bulk strengths on entry being characteristically of the order of 10(-1)-10(-2) times the tensile strengths of recovered samples. We conclude that pre-entry, meter-scale interplanetary meteoroids are typically highly fractured or in some cases rubbly in texture, presumably as a result of their parent bodies' collisional history, and can break up under stresses of a few megapascals. The weakness of some carbonaceous objects may result from very porous primordial accretional structures, more than fractures. These conclusions have implications for future asteroid missions, sample extraction, and asteroid hazard mitigation.					; Spurný, Pavel/X-9268-2019; Gnos, Edwin/AAI-7477-2020; Trigo-Rodríguez, Josep/L-3870-2014; Popova, Olga/K-1885-2012; Trigo-Rodriguez, Josep M./L-3870-2014; Borovicka, Jiri/F-4257-2014	Popova, Olga/0000-0003-4874-6701; Gnos, Edwin/0000-0003-0940-8435; Spurny, Pavel/0000-0001-5944-3090; Trigo-Rodriguez, Josep M./0000-0001-8417-702X; Borovicka, Jiri/0000-0002-5569-8982													1086-9379	1945-5100				OCT	2011	46	10					1525	1550		10.1111/j.1945-5100.2011.01247.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1945-5100.2011.01247.x													WOS:000296247400007

HYDROBIOLOGIA												Common pochard Aythya ferina are rapidly declining globally, partly due to water quality change at breeding habitats. Lake restoration at two southern Danish lakes (external nutrient loading reduction, bream Abramis brama and roach Rutilus rutilus removal and stocking of pike Esox lucius) improved water clarity and submerged macrophyte cover. Nesting pochard on one lake increased from 2.3 females per annum pre-treatment to 13.9 afterwards and from 22.7 females to 99.6 post-treatment at a second. Numbers fell from 27.7 to 11.3 at a third untreated lake with consistently high water clarity, but which was colonised and became dominated by holly-leaved naiad Najas marina, which provides no food resources for breeding pochard. Linear modelling (controlling for serial autocorrelation) showed statistically significant effects of annual summer measurements of suspended solids (negative) and Secchi depth (positive) on pochard abundance at both restored lakes and chlorophyll (negative) at one of those lakes, but no effects at the third. Breeding pochard numbers also correlated positively with submerged macrophyte cover at one restored lake with adequate data. Results support the hypothesis that lake restoration to improve water quality enhances conditions for locally breeding pochard, as long as restored conditions secure appropriate submerged macrophyte communities for nesting pochard.

J	LETARTE, Y; PINELALLOUL, B				LETARTE, Y; PINELALLOUL, B			SPATIOTEMPORAL VARIATIONS IN ABUNDANCE AND PRODUCTION OF BACTERIOPLANKTON IN A CANADIAN SHIELD HUMIC LAKE	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY												We followed the diel and summer variations of bacterioplankton production (estimated from [H-3]thymidine incorporation) and abundance (direct count with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining) at four depths in a Canadian Shield humic lake. We found production to be highest and most variable in the epilimnion, but the differences between production estimates made at different times were statistically significant in only 5 out of 16 cases. Production differed significantly among depths in 14 out of 18 trials. The renewal time of the bacterial community varied between 1 and 20 days. Bacterioplankton production and primary production were uncorrelated (r = 0.225; p > 0.2), but bacterial production and chlorophyll a concentration were positively correlated (r = 0.816; p < 0.005). Small coccis (approximately 0.3 - approximately 0.8-mu-m) represented between 52 and 80% of the bacterial cells in all the samples. There was no correspondence between bacterial production and frequency of dividing cells. Bacterial production and abundance varied inversely throughout the season, bacteria being two to three times less concentrated in the spring, whereas production was two to three times higher. We found no correlation between bacterioplankton production and abundance (r = 0.012; p > 0.5). Our results demonstrate the importance of small-scale sampling and the difficulty with which bacterioplankton production, its spatiotemporal variations, and the relationships between bacteria and phytoplankton can be predicted.

In different districts of this city, the water from 15 lakes were collected continuously from June 2020 to May 2021, and the sediments from 9 lakes were collected in 2015 and 2021. The seasonal changes of Hg concentration (Hg-C) in the water were found to be high in winter and low in summer The spatial distribution of Hg-C in sediments showed that it was high in urban central areas and low in suburbs. The Nemero index and geological accumulation index showed that there were uncontaminated of Hg in the collected lake water, and above moderately contaminated in the lake sediments in urban center, respectively. The Hg pollution potential ecological risk index showed that there was low risk in the collected water, high and extremely high risk in the lake sediments in urban center, respectively. The principal component analysis (PCA) and correlation analysis (CA) of Hg and meteorological factors showed that precipitation, temperature, and vapor pressure had negative effects on the seasonal changes of Hg-C in water, and air pressure and wind direction had positive effects. The PCA and CA of Hg and other geochemical elements showed that anthropogenic emissions may be the main sources of Hg in sediments, which was also supported by the data of population density, road density, and motor vehicles per 1000 people. This study provided a reference for urban lake pollution treatment, resident health, and ecological environment protection.

J	Chen, Y; Bonzongo, JC; Miller, GC				Chen, Y; Bonzongo, JC; Miller, GC			Levels of methylmercury and controlling factors in surface sediments of the Carson River system, Nevada	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Spatial and temporal distribution of methylmercury (MeHg) was determined in surficial sediments collected from a river-reservoir system impacted by Hg-contaminated mine wastes. Despite the fact that total mercury concentrations (Hg-T) in surface sediments of the Carson River system were in the mu g.g(-1) range, levels of MeHg varied from about 2 to 28 ng Hg.g(-1) dry weight, representing less than 3% of Hg-T. Concentrations of MeHg were well correlated with both the biotic (r = 0.95) and abiotic activity (r = 0.85) of the sediment, determined as the ability of each compartment to specifically reduce an alternative electron acceptor. However, the positive relationship between the two measured activities suggests that the abiotic activity may be due to reductant substances produced by micro-organisms. When sediments collected from the Carson River were used in laboratory assays for the determination of potential rates of MeHg production, the addition of inorganic Hg (added as HgCl2) resulted in increased rates of methylation when the spike concentration was lower or equal to 15.3 mu g.g(-1) dry weight. This trend was reversed for spike concentration of inorganic Hg above 15.3 mu g.g(-1). The reduction of methylation rate was associated with an inhibition of microbial activity. These observations suggest that seasonal inputs into the river of significant amounts of inorganic Hg eroded from mill tailings during winter and spring flooding events could have an inhibiting effect on Hg-methylating micro-organisms. This observation could explain the low [MeHg]/[Hg-T] ratios previously documented in waters of the Carson River system.

To show the biological importance of these habitats, samples were randomly collected from 173 different wetland sites in the Ankara region during the summer of 2011. 31 ostracod taxa belonging to 14 genera were identified, including two species (Eucypris elliptica and Cavernocypris subterranea) that are new reports for the Turkish ostracod fauna and 19 taxa that are new reports for the region. Canonical Correspondence Analyses was able to show 58.9% of the correlation between species and environmental variables. Water temperature, moisture and dissolved oxygen were the most important (P = 0.05) factors influencing species occurrence. Increasing sampling size (number of sites) did not significantly increase the numbers of species collected at sites located at elevations between 442 and 1,520 m.a.s.l. This also implies that altitude may have a secondary role on species diversity. Unweighted Paired Group Mean Analyses illustrated four main clustering groups of ostracods, in which species are clustered according to their ecological preferences. Based on our results, suitability of habitats appears to drive ostracod distribution and diversity in these wetland sites. Results clearly showed that these habitats can harbor diverse ostracod communities that warrant conservation.					; Akdemir, Derya/B-2635-2019; KÜLKÖYLÜOĞLU, OKAN/A-6441-2018; UCAK, SAMET/MCJ-3177-2025	Akdemir, Derya/0000-0003-1253-3376; UCAK, SAMET/0000-0002-3461-2481; 													0277-5212	1943-6246				APR	2014	34	2					309	324		10.1007/s13157-013-0499-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-013-0499-5													WOS:000332825400011
J	HARDING, JS				HARDING, JS			PHYSICOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS AND INVERTEBRATE FAUNAS OF 3 LAKE INFLOWS AND OUTLETS IN WESTLAND, NEW-ZEALAND	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Selected physico-chemical factors and the composition of faunas in inflow and outlet streams of three South Westland lakes (Kaniere, Mapourika, and Wahapo) were investigated from December 1988 to January 1990. Three sampling sites were used in each river system, the first 1 km above the inlet, another immediately below the lake, and the third 1-5 km further downstream. Dissolved organic carbon concentrations, alkalinity, and conductivity were only slightly influenced by the presence of a lake. Summer and winter water temperatures were elevated at lake outlets, but generally declined again downstream. Substrate size, stability, and homogeneity were also greater at artificial lake outlets. Invertebrate taxonomic richness was lowest at lake outlets, intermediate in inlets streams, and greatest downstream sites. Inflow stream faunas were dominated by Deleatidium (Ephemeroptera: Leptophlebiidae), whereas lake outlets were dominated by Hydropsychidae, Simuliidae, and Mollusca; downstream Simuliidae, Chironomidae, and Hydfopsychidae remained dominant and plecopteran taxa increased. Species of Coleoptera, Ephemeroptera, and Plecoptera were poorly represented at lake outlets but numerous at inlet and downstream sites. Substrate heterogeneity and stability, mean depth, water velocity, and water temperature were implicated as important physical environmental factors affecting community composition in lake outlets.																			0028-8330						1992	26	1					95	102		10.1080/00288330.1992.9516505	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1992.9516505													WOS:A1992HR55400009

Group foragers typically receive information about food resources by monitoring external events and the behavior of neighbors. The Information Centre Hypothesis proposes that aggregations increase foraging activity levels as a result of social information provided by conspecifics. Increasing the foraging rate has as a result decreasing time devoted to anti-predator vigilance and may intensify competition among group members. Studies have shown that foraging activities are influenced by factors other than flock size, such as the number and foraging intensity of neighbors. To test these hypotheses, we examined the effect of number and foraging intensity of neighbors on the foraging activity levels (foraging rate, foraging effort, and foraging success rate) of the wintering Oriental Storks (Ciconia boyciana). In this study, we collected focal sampling data on the foraging behavior of storks at Shengjin Lake during winter from 2017 to 2019, controlling the effects of other variables (group identity, wintering years, and wintering periods). We found that foraging activity levels were higher in the presence of foraging neighbors than in their absence. Moreover, individuals adjusted their foraging activity levels according to social information gathered from the behavior of neighboring conspecifics. Focal individuals' foraging rate and foraging effort were positively correlated with the average foraging rate of neighbors. Their foraging success rate was not influenced by the average foraging rate and foraging success rate of neighbors; however, it was positively correlated with the average foraging effort of neighbors. In conclusion, foraging activity levels of individuals are primarily driven by the intensity of the foraging activity of neighbors. This result differs from the results of previous studies that suggested that flock size was the most important factor determining individual foraging activity levels.

Here we report on aspects of major ion (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, Aile, Cl-, SO42-) and several minor and trace element (Li isotopes, Sr isotopes, Ba, Al, V, Cr, Ni, Cu, Ge, Cd, Hg, U) cycles. Our riverine data for major ions generally concur with the more extensive, time-averaged Russian database; for the most part the homogeneously distributed major ions appear to be at steady state and dominated by riverine throughputs in the lake. Exceptions include Mg2+, which may be removed to a small extent (less than or equal to 15% of its riverine flux) by hydrothermal activity, and Na+ and Cl-, which seem to be impacted by pollution. Of the minor and trace elements, V also seems subject to anthropogenic disturbance. Other elements for which reliable data are available show conservative steady-state distributions (Li, Cr, Sr) or an subject to redistribution and removal within the lake (Ge, Al, Cu, Ni, Ba, U) as a result of involvement in a variety of particle cycling processes that tend to obscure non-natural influences. Chemical geothermometers for the four hot springs sampled (Smeyney, Khakuci, Kotelnikovski, Davsha) indicate subsurface reaction temperatures ranging from 70 to 150 degrees C and converging to smaller ranges (+/-15 degrees C) for a given spring. Both depletions (Mg, Ba, Cu, Ni, Sr, U) and enrichments (Na, K, Cl, Li, Al, Ge, Sr, U) with respect to lake water were observed. Ge levels in spring waters are sufficiently enriched over lake waters that Ge could serve as a useful tracer of subaquatic hydrothermal waters.

However, this view is at odds with the understanding of modern climate, which demonstrates an analogous "tripole precipitation pattern" in monsoonal China. Little is known about the spatial pattern of paleo-precipitation in monsoonal China, particularly during the past glacial-interglacial cycles. Here, we provide evidence for a potential tripole precipitation pattern in monsoonal China over the past 425 ka using climate modeling, and compare the results with paleoclimate records available from China. Our simulations illustrate that more (less) precipitation in North China and South China, and less (more) precipitation in the Central-East China during strong (weak) EASM periods associated with high (low) boreal summer insolation. Our results agree with the present understanding of modern East Asian climate, and furthermore confirm that the boreal summer insolation is the dominant forcing for the intensity of EASM and the response of subtropical high pressures is fundamental in modulating the precipitation pattern in monsoonal China on orbital timescales. This temporal and spatial variability of precipitation, as revealed in our simulations, shows the potential high complexities in hydroclimatic conditions in monsoonal China throughout the past glacial-interglacial cycles. Nevertheless, whether the tripole precipitation pattern in monsoonal China over the past 425 ka is robust enough still should be tested, preferable by taking advantage of existing and new well-dated and explicit indicative precipitation archives in Central-East China.

Forty-two species were identified and for the species that were found on both Florida streams and lakes similar densities and biomass were encountered. As with Florida lakes, stream bird abundance and species richness were higher in winter months than in summer months, a consequence of migratory bird populations. Total bird abundance, biomass per unit of phosphorus, and species richness per unit of area were similar to data collected on Florida lakes. Thus, Florida rivers are capable of supplying sufficient resources to maintain bird densities, biomass and species richness values similar to lakes of equal size and nutrient concentrations and are therefore important habitats for aquatic bird populations. An examination of individual habitat characteristics indicates that water depth was inversely correlated and submersed aquatic vegetation was positively correlated with bird density, biomass and species richness within the river systems. While both habitat characteristics are important they are also inversely related making it difficult to separate the individual significance of each characteristic.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2006	567						5	18		10.1007/s10750-006-0056-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0056-9													WOS:000239147500003

The survey has regarded 88 wetlands including 27 large dams, 25 hill dams and 36 hill lakes. We identified 42,840 individuals representing seven orders, eleven families, 37 species and six functional groups: dabbling ducks, grazing waterfowl, fish-eaters, deep-water foragers, shoreline foragers and waders. The population structure analysis showed an absolute dominance of the deep-water foragers with approximately 82% of observed waterbirds. The total abundance survey showed a fluctuation of population sizes and richness, from thousands to few individuals and from 1 to 25 species, respectively. Analysis results showed that the species distribution is governed by several ecological factors and there was a significant correlation between species abundance and richness and some habitat variables such as area, depth, age, plant cover and hunting disturbance. Investigated AW revealed a significant carrying capacity and refuge serving for the conservation of numerous wintering and endangered waterbird species of high nature conservation value, the White-headed Duck Oxyura leucocephala that has been observed with relatively high numbers representing more than 40% of the assessed TunisianAlgerian population.																			0141-6707	1365-2028				MAR	2013	51	1					154	163		10.1111/aje.12022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aje.12022													WOS:000314658200018
J	McGowan, HA; Sturman, AP				McGowan, HA; Sturman, AP			Short- and medium-term trends in the hydrometeorology of the central Southern Alps, New Zealand	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Short-and-medium term trends in the hydrometeorology of the central Southern Alps are examined with the aim of developing monthly and seasonal inflow forecasting models for alpine hydro lakes. Both ambient air temperature and precipitation are considered principal components in the generation of inflows. These two meteorological variables display both strong annual cycles and longer term fluctuations which are linked to the influence of different synoptic circulation systems and their regional impact, through such mechanisms as the ENSO phenomenon. Recent investigations have indicated that negative phases of ENSO tend to delay the onset of the spring melt season and to result in drought conditions within the central Southern Alps. Such conditions during 1991 and 1992 were compounded by a global increase in atmospheric turbidity following two large volcanic eruptions, and contributed to a national energy crisis in New Zealand during the 1992 winter. Both seasonal and monthly empirically derived inflow models are assessed incorporating temperature, precipitation and circulation parameters to predict inflows. Although inflows for these time-scales correlate strongly with precipitation, temperature and atmospheric circulation for the same period, predicted inflows one season or month in advance did not. This supports the need for much shorter term monitoring of meteorological conditions within such alpine catchments. In addition, there also appears to be a need for quantifying inflows generated from the present long-term retreat of major eastern alpine glaciers, which also make a significant contribution to lake inflows.

Kip; Fernandez, Diego P.			Springwater provenance and flowpath evaluation in Blue Lake, Bonneville basin, Utah	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Water in Utah and Nevada is important for agriculture, municipal use, solute transport, and ecosystem preservation. Large spring wetland systems occur on the playa margin of the Bonneville basin, including Blue Lake, 15 km south of the Bonneville Salt Flats on the Utah-Nevada state border. Large spring systems have historically been studied as water budgets don't apparently balance from direct mountain front recharge (Nelson and Mayo, 2014; Gardner and Heilweil, 2014; and others). Blue Lake is no exception; prior studies here have suggested discharge rates 0.04 - 0.05 km(3)/yr (Louderback and Rhode, 2009), greater than expected for modelled recharge in the surrounding mountain range (0.03 km(3)/yr). Three hypothesized recharge mechanisms for Blue Lake are tested: mountain-front recharge, interbasinal groundwater flow, and infiltration from historic Lake Bonneville. Remote sensing suggests that a conservative estimate of Blue Lake discharge constitutes 50-64% of modelled mountain-front recharge (Flint et al., 2011). Major ions, delta O-18, delta H-2, dissolved gases (C-14, He-3, He-4, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) and trace elements (Sr and Sr-87/Sr-86 isotopes) comprehensively constrain recharge conditions, water-rock interactions, flowpaths, and groundwater provenance of this large spring system. C-14 signatures suggest that Blue Lake discharge has a transit time between 5,600 and 12,200 years, older than that of Fish Springs. Noble gas concentrations in Blue Lake water suggest an elevated recharge temperature greater than 19 degrees C and low salinity, indicating a deep water table and high geothermal gradient in the recharge area. Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of playa-margin springs are elevated from that of mid-playa groundwaters, springwaters from the adjacent mountain range, and alluvial fill groundwater from the valley directly south of Blue Lake. Playa-margin spring Sr isotope values (0.713-0.714) are most similar to direct runoff from the Deep Creek Range granodiorite outcrop (> 0.713). Interbasinal groundwater flow in combination with mountain-front recharge is best supported by chemical data rather than mountain-front recharge alone or the slow discharge of regional aquifers recharged by lacustrine infiltration from Lake Bonneville.

Status and Distribution of Wintering Waterfowl in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, 2005-2014	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												Surveys of wintering waterfowl can aid in both identifying estuarine habitats currently being used by species of conservation concern so that the sites can be targeted for protection and restoration, and in providing a baseline assessment from which the effects of future changes in wintering habitat can be assessed. In an effort to better understand the local distribution of wintering waterfowl during the period 2005-2014, we undertook a study of waterfowl abundance and distribution in Narragansett Bay, RI, a moderate-sized estuary located in the northeastern US within the Atlantic Flyway. Overall waterfowl abundance in the Bay ranged from 15,002 individuals in 2006 to 26,163 individuals in 2010 and averaged 20,062 +/- 3393 individuals over the 10-y period. Species richness ranged from 1.80 to 10.8 per site; most of the sites with high species richness were located in the Upper Bay. Based on our counts from 67 ground locations, the Narragansett Bay waterfowl community was dominated by Aythya affinis (Lesser Scaup) and A. marila (Greater Scaup), Branta bernicla (Brant), and Branta canadensis (Canada Geese) over the survey period. Waterfowl-community composition indicated that the Upper Bay, an environment characterized by low wave-energy, shallow coves, sheltered embayments, and salt marshes, supported mostly dabbling ducks, geese, and swans. The Lower Bay, an environment characterized by higher wave-energy, rocky shorelines, and deeper open-water habitats, supported mostly sea ducks and other diving-duck species. Abundance over the survey period was relatively stable, and observed patterns of waterfowl distribution suggest that conservation actions to maintain shallow-water habitats, including efforts to protect and restore salt marsh habitat, will help to maintain resources needed by many of the waterfowl species wintering in the Bay.																			1092-6194	1938-5307				DEC	2015	22	4					730	745		10.1656/045.022.0410	http://dx.doi.org/10.1656/045.022.0410													WOS:000370899000007

Differential Responses of Maximum Versus Median Chlorophyll-ato Air Temperature and Nutrient Loads in an Oligotrophic Lake Over 31 Years	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Globally, phytoplankton abundance is increasing in lakes as a result of climate change and land-use change. The relative importance of climate and land-use drivers has been examined primarily for mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes. However, oligotrophic lakes show different sensitivity to climate and land-use drivers than mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes, necessitating further exploration of the relative contribution of the two drivers of change to increased phytoplankton abundance. Here, we investigated how air temperature (a driver related to climate change) and nutrient load (a driver related to land-use and climate change) interact to alter water quality in oligotrophic Lake Sunapee, New Hampshire, USA. We used long-term data and the one-dimensional hydrodynamic General Lake Model (GLM) coupled with Aquatic EcoDyanmics (AED) modules to simulate water quality. Over the 31-year simulation, summer median chlorophyll-aconcentration was positively associated with summer air temperature, whereas annual maximum chlorophyll-aconcentration was positively associated with the previous 3 years of external phosphorus load. Scenario testing demonstrated a 2 degrees C increase in air temperature significantly increased summer median chlorophyll-aconcentration, but not annual maximum chlorophyll-aconcentration. For both maximum and median chlorophyll-aconcentration, doubling external nutrient loads of total nitrogen and total phosphorus at the same time, or doubling phosphorus alone, resulted in a significant increase. This study highlights the importance of aligning lake measurements with the ecosystem metrics of interest, as maximum chlorophyll-aconcentration may be more uniquely sensitive to nutrient load and that typical summer chlorophyll-aconcentration may increase due to warming alone.

The paleoenvironmental reconstruction identifies the MIS 6 as a wetter period with episodes of dry conditions, low forest cover and low fire activity. A sudden change from wetter to dry environments with low to high forest cover and fire activity episodes characterized the end of the MIS 6 (132-130 ka) coincident with high spring insolation. Variations in vegetation composition, with a tendency towards higher forest cover, fire-activity, runoff, and organic matter availability, are recorded during the MIS 5, MIS 4, and MIS 3. However, a reduction in the fire-activity was recorded for the cold and dry MIS 4. Spectral analysis based on the titanium concentration record of Lake Chalco suggests a precessional forcing on runoff variations. We explored the impact of the Intertropical Convergence Zone latitudinal migrations which have been related to the summer insolation at 65 degrees N by comparing runoff data with other sedimentary records from North and Central America. Our results highlight the sensitivity of the high altitude tropical basin to climate variations.					; Martinez-Abarca, Rodrigo/JTV-6001-2023	Ortega-Guerrero, Beatriz/0000-0002-3823-1926; Chavez Lara, Claudia Magali/0000-0001-6274-2366; Brown, Erik T/0000-0001-7154-2729; Martinez-Abarca, Rodrigo/0000-0002-8863-3907													0895-9811	1873-0647				AUG	2021	109								103231	10.1016/j.jsames.2021.103231	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsames.2021.103231		MAR 2021											WOS:000670295600001

Ecological niche modeling and diachronic change in Paleoindian land use in the northwestern Great Basin, USA	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS												The Great Basin underwent considerable environmental change during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, such as lower precipitation, increased temperatures, and the diminishment of lakes and wetlands. Archaeologists have long hypothesized that people responded by altering their settlement-subsistence strategies. Models outlining these responses feature predictions that generally fall into two categories: (1) people should have spent more time in remaining productive patches and expanded their diet breadth; and (2) people should have added new habitats to their settlement-subsistence regimes. These responses are not mutually exclusive, and both may have occurred, but they have been difficult to evaluate using empirical data because the region's archaeological record is predominantly comprised of open-air lithic scatters that lack food remains. Through ecological niche modeling, we test the hypothesis that early Holocene groups added new habitats. We develop two models-one for the Younger Dryas and one for the early Holocene-using recorded Paleoindian sites in Humboldt County, Nevada and a set of environmental variables. Our results show that Younger Dryas sites mostly occur around lowland and upland lakes and within ecotones, while early Holocene sites mostly occur around valley bottoms, riparian corridors, and upland springs. They demonstrate that people added new habitats, presumably in response to disappearing wetlands. This shift may be best explained using the patch choice model.

In this study, we present high resolution, seasonal variations in water temperature at different depths of a large deep lake on the central Tibetan Plateau. The results show that Nam Co is a typical dimictic lake whose thermal stratification begins and ends in early June and early November, respectively. Increases in the water temperature during spring and the establishment of thermal stratification in the eastern small sub-basin occur approximately one month prior to the main basin which is likely caused by the different morphometry, different water transparency during spring, and the possible presence of a spring thermal bar. The Schmidt stability of the water column is directly controlled by surface water temperature. During the ice-covered period, the homogeneous water temperature exhibits a continuous increasing trend from approximately 0.5 degrees C to 3.5 degrees C. The daily mean surface water temperature of the main open lake area is highly correlated to the air temperature but shows a hysteresis effect of approximately 38 days, which shows the significant heat storage in such a large deep lake. Nam Co is a typical lake in this area in terms of its altitude, water depth and climatic conditions, so our results have broader significance for limnological and paleolimnological studies of similar lakes on the Tibetan Plateau.

A fish-based index for the assessment of the ecological quality of temperate lakes	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												A fish - based index for the assessment of the ecological quality of natural temperate lakes was developed, in accordance to the requirements of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) 2000/60/EC. As a case study, 11 natural lakes located at northern and western Greece were selected. Fish surveys were conducted during mid summer to mid autumn in 2010, 2011 and 2012 using Nordic gillnets and electrofishing. Environmental parameters and anthropogenic pressures were assessed for each lake. Fish species richness, abundance, trophic, reproductive and habitat functional guilds were used for extracting a set of 107 metrics, meeting the requirements of the WFD. All metrics were initially tested as candidates for the index development. A stepwise linear regression of each metric against environmental parameters (lake area, altitude, maximum depth, alkalinity) and anthropogenic pressures (drainage area covered by non-natural land uses - NNLC, water total phosphorus concentrations - TP, Lake Habitat Modification Score - LHMS) was initially conducted for ensuring pressure-response relationships. Reference conditions for each lake were estimated by the hindcasting procedure and the ecological quality for each lake was expressed as the ecological quality ratio (EQR) by a value ranging from 0 (poor quality) to I (excellent quality). Two fish fauna metrics, the relative numerical abundance of introduced species (Introduced(a)) and the relative biomass of omnivorous species (OMNIb) were finally extracted as the most significant, responding to LHMS and TP, respectively. The final index was expressed as the mean values of the EQRs of these two metrics. The multimetric fish index presented herein could serve as a tool for assessing the ecological quality of natural lakes at broad geographical scale and generally, in the Mediterranean temperate lakes with similar hydromorphological characteristics.

Lake Karla's, a multi-service reservoir, re-establishment begun 60 years after the natural lake was dried. This research is aimed at linking a series of environmental drivers with the phytoplankton functional groups during a dry year after the lake's refilling period, to investigate seasonal and spatial dynamics, and to get an insight into lake's ecology for both monitoring and management purposes. In situ physical and chemical measurements, along with water and plankton sampling took place monthly from May 2014 till March 2015. A combination of direct ordination, multivariate statistical analyses and distance-based approaches were used to examine spatial and temporal patterns and to test dissimilarities among and within the stations. Phytoplankton was assorted in Reynolds' functional groups. The lake's hydrology was also modelled. The research results presented Karla lake as a homogeneously degraded system. The major environmental parameters affecting phytoplankton community were ortho-phosphates and temperature in a lake with long retention time. The five functional groups that were dominant during the survey were comprised by representatives of cyanobacteria, followed by chlorophytes and diatoms, many of them indicative of warm, shallow, turbid, nutrient-rich waters. Phytoplankton revealed a seasonal trend with prolonged summer, low differentiation among seasons and uninterrupted winter succession. The relations and patterns found are useful for monitoring, as for management purposes to enhance the reservoir's capacity.

J	Petrie, SA; Francis, CM				Petrie, SA; Francis, CM			Rapid increase in the lower Great Lakes population of feral mute swans: a review and a recommendation	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN												Mute swans (Cygnus olor) are an exotic species whose population has increased throughout the lower Great Lakes since their introduction during the mid-twentieth century. We used 3 independent data sources to estimate the rate of increase of mute swans on the lower Great Lakes: aerial surveys in spring and autumn at Long Point, Lake Erie, Ontario, Canada 1971-2000; midwinter waterfowl inventory of the north shore of Lake Ontario, 1980-2000; and Christmas Bird Counts on both the United States and Canadian shores of the lakes, 1980-2000. The average estimated population growth rate varied from 10 to 18% per year. The most conservative growth-rate estimate of 10% per year indicates a doubling of the mute swan population every 7-8 years. These high growth rates indicate that mute swans have found a favorable environment in the lower Great Lakes. That area is climatically somewhat similar to their native range in Europe, with low natural predation rates and minimal human interference (the birds are protected in Canada since and the United States under the Migratory Birds Convention of 1916). If the mute swan carrying capacity of the lower Great Lakes is similar to portions of the species' native European range and growth rates continue, the Canadian population could reach as many as 30,000 birds within 30 years. Given that the species is nonnative and its ecological impact potentially could be large, we suggest that control measures be implemented before the population grows much larger.																			0091-7648					SUM	2003	31	2					407	416																WOS:000184165500011
J	GANF, GG				GANF, GG			AN ECOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN APHANIZOMENON AND DAPHNIA-PULEX	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Colonies of A. flos-aquae dominated the phytoplankton of a polymictic lake during a clear-water, potentially productive phase, coincident with and following a dense population of D. pulex. Intermittent breakdown of thermal stratification was correlated with initiation of A. flos-aquae populations. A. elenkinii occurred as single filaments and was restricted to summer periods of high turbidity and the absence or low concentrations of D. pulex. Enclosure experiments showed that D. pulex was largely responsible for the decline of the spring phytoplankton and the resulting clear-water phase. In enclosures subjects to grazing, A. flos-aquae formed a substantial proportion of the phytoplankton biomass; in the absence of D. pulex, A. elenkinii and other small phytoplankton dominated. The final biomass was a function of both the number of D. pulex and time. The critical density of D. pulex (without any correction for net efficiency) was 12-15 l-1, above which the rate of loss from the phytoplankton community exceeded the apparent growth. Above this critical density, A. flos-aquae formed most of the phytoplankton biomass and was apparently immune to grazing because of its large size. There was strong circumstantial evidence to suggest that A. flos-aquae was recruited from the sediments, but attempts to demonstrate this failed. Instead, Anabaena spiroides was shown to be recruited.																			0067-1940						1983	34	5					755	773																WOS:A1983RM94700006

Capturing potential: Leveraging grass carp behavior Ctenopharyngodon idella for enhanced removal	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Effective management of invasive species benefits from a comprehensive understanding of the species' behavior and interactions with the invaded system. We investigated temporal dynamics of telemetry detections and the potential utility of a traitor approach for informing response efforts to the invasive grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) population in the Sandusky River, a major tributary to Lake Erie. Telemetered grass carp exhibited heightened activity at night and early morning, suggesting that capture and removal be more effective during these time periods. Analysis of catch per unit effort (CPUE) across different removal methods, trammel nets, electrofishing, and hoop nets. suggested that incorporating the traitor approach could improve capture. Low catchability values (<0.026), based on the number of telemetered grass carp present in the river on a weekly basis and the number of those telemetered fish captured, suggest the species is difficult to capture. Optimizing response effort efficiency is important and refining catchability estimates will lessen errors in population models and improve interpretation of low CPUE data. Results from generalized additive models suggest capture could be improved using telemetry data, night removals, and by attempting exploratory removal efforts in fall and winter months. By incorporating telemetry data and acknowledging the complexities of grass carp behavior and ecology, we found that a multifaceted and data-driven approach to invasive species control could be beneficial, ultimately promoting conservation and sustainability in dynamic ecosystems like Lake Erie.

The data provide a detailed history of variations in precipitation and temperature over the northeastern margin of the East Asian summer monsoon during the Holocene. A warm and dry climate prevailed over the lake region until c. 8000 cal. BP. During the period c. 8000-4400 cal. BP, precipitation increased markedly and temperature gradually declined. The interval between c. 4400 and 3350 cal. BP was marked by extremely dry and relatively cold conditions. Precipitation recovered from c. 3350 to 1000 cal. BP, with temperatures rising c. 3350-2050 cal. BP and dropping c. 2050-1000 cal. BP. During the last 500 years, the climate of the lake region displayed a general trend of warming and wetting. While Holocene temperature variations in the mid-high latitude monsoonal margin were controlled by changes in summer solar radiation in the Northern Hemisphere, they could also be related to the strength of the East Asian summer monsoon. The lack of precipitation during the early Holocene could be attributed to the weakened summer monsoon resulting from the existence of remnant ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere. Changes in the monsoonal precipitation during the middle to late Holocene would have been associated with the ocean-atmosphere interacting processes occurring in the western tropical Pacific.																			0300-9483	1502-3885					2010	39	2					262	272		10.1111/j.1502-3885.2009.00125.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1502-3885.2009.00125.x													WOS:000274953600007
J	Zhang, Y; Reedyk, S; Prepas, EE				Zhang, Y; Reedyk, S; Prepas, EE			Effects of Ca(OH)(2) additions on phytoplankton communities under ice cover in eutrophic hardwater lakes	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The effects of Ca(OH)(2) treatment during the open-water season on phytoplankton communities under ice cover were examined for up to three winters (Nov. Apr.) in three eutrophic hardwater lakes in central Alberta. Phytoplankton communities were compared between treated and untreated lakes, and between pre- and posttreatment periods within a treatment lake. In all study lakes, phytoplankton biomass tended to be high at ice-on, decrease after November, and remain low (< 2mg/L) from January to early March, when light conditions and water temperatures were also low. After late March to early April, phytoplankton biomass started to increase exponentially because of higher light conditions and water temperature. Most phytoplankton species that were common under ice also occurred during the open-water season. Although phytoplankton species composition was diverse under ice, the biomass of most species, except for flagellates, did not increase before mid-March. Species composition and biomass of some phytoplankton groups varied without clear trends among winters in treated and untreated lakes. Therefore, Ca(OH)(2) treatment during the open-water season did not appear to affect winter phytoplankton communities.																			0003-9136						1997	139	2					235	253																WOS:A1997XC27100008

Changes in surface salinity in Praia are directly linked to water security and regional ecological and economic health. This study aimed to explore the sensitivity of remotely sensed spectral indices to precipitation events. An ESTARFM was utilized to fuse daily (less than 10% cloudiness) MODIS and Landsat 8 imagery from April to September 2019 in the Ebinur Lake Wetland Reserve. Salinity was tested in the laboratory after soil collections in May (spring) and August (summer). The significantly correlated normalized difference vegetation and salinity indices were compared to the precipitation data and found to fluctuate in response to precipitation. The normalized difference vegetation and salinity indices decreased following precipitation events and increased during precipitation intervals, and the precipitation amount and evaporation intensities may have influenced the magnitudes of the decrease and increase. Following precipitation, the playa surface produces new puddles and a new spatial distribution pattern of soil salinity. This study determined that the spatiotemporal fusion technique is an effective method for observing the dynamics of playa surfaces, and precipitation and evaporation affect the spatial distribution of salt on the playa surface; however, the monitoring period should be short when utilizing remote sensing to monitor playa salinity.

We found that the pattern of latitudinal change of speleothem delta O-18 values from the Indian monsoon region to the East Asian monsoon region is almost identical to that of modern precipitation. This suggests that the modern moisture transport route from the Indian Ocean to the East Asian monsoon region has existed since at least the early Holocene. The delta O-18 records from both regions exhibit a remarkably similar trend of variation in that the values are more negative during the early Holocene, rapidly become heavy from the mid-Holocene, and are heaviest during the late Holocene. The stalagmite delta O-18 changes in the East Asian monsoon region are statistically well correlated with those in the Indian monsoon region, both over the entire Holocene and in detail over the last 2000 years. However, in contrast to the obvious consistency of the delta O-18 values in all of the speleothem records, both instrumental and historical climate records indicate significant spatial variations in rainfall over eastern China. The early-Holocene strong EASM pattern referred from speleothem delta O-18 in the East Asian monsoon region is quite different to that of other paleoclimatic records such as Holocene paleosol development in the Chinese Loess Plateau, eolian activity in the northern Chinese sandlands, and lake sediments in EASM-dominated region in China, in which the strongest EASM was documented during the mid-Holocene. These findings suggest that the speleothem delta O-18 record from the East Asian monsoon region may not record EASM variability, but rather that it is controlled by variations in the isotopic composition of precipitation, which is determined mainly by rainfall variability in the ISM region.

Moisture recycling from evaporation and transpiration can greatly contribute to local precipitation in some regions. This study selected four monitoring sites and used an isotope mixing model to investigate local moisture recycling in permafrost regions of the central Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). The results showed that the local water vapour flux in the summer and autumn were dominantly influenced by westerlies and the Indian monsoon. Moistures for precipitation in Wudaoliang (WDL) and Fenghuoshan (FHS) mainly came from the western QTP, eastern Tianshan Mountains, western Qilian Mountains, and the surrounding regions. In comparsion, more than half of precipitation at Tanggula (TGL) was mostly sourced from the Indian monsoon. Local moisture recycling ratios at the four sites ranged from 14% +/- 3.8% to 31.6% +/- 4.8%, and depended on the soil moisture and relative humidity. In particular, the higher soil moisture and relative humidity promoted local moisture recycling, but frozen ground might be a potential influencing factor as well. The moisture recycling ratios of the study area were consistent with the results from both the Qinghai Lake Basin and the Nam Co Basin, but differed from those of the northwestern QTP. This difference may indirectly confirm the great spatial variability in precipitation on the QTP. Moreover, the rising air temperature and ground temperature, increasing precipitation, higher soil moisture, higher vegetation cover, and expanding lakes in the study area may be conductive to enhancing future local moisture recycling by altering ground surface conditions and facilitating the land surface evaporation and plant transpiration.

First, these samples are separated into three different grain size fractions, i.e., total sediments, 77-20 pm and <20 mu m. Second, the chemical elements-Rb and Sr-of the grain size separation were tested and analyzed systematically in this paper. Then the elements compositions of these samples are measured using VP-320 mode fluorescence spectrum instrument, respectively. The magnetic susceptibility of these samples is measured using Kappabridge KLY-3 mode instrument made in Czech AGICO Company. The results showed the elements and the ratios varied regularly with the grain size. But the ratio of Rb/Sr in the sediments <20 pm correlates positively with the magnetic susceptibility of these samples. Therefore, the ratio of Rb/Sr in the fraction <20 pm from the lake sediments reflected the strengthening of the weathering in the deposition sites. It is a good indicator of the summer monsoon-induced weathering and pedogenesis fluctuations and can be used to reconstruct the conditions of the paleoclimate and paleoenvironment.

The study fields were Ozenuma lake and Senjougahara peatland, which snow covers for more than 5 months in winter. Iron concentration in water increased during snow-covered and thaw seasons with the synchronized decrease in Eh and pH for both stream water and groundwater. In snow-covered seasons, it is hypothesized that supply of melt water and/or coverage with ice layers during this period could cause the development of an anaerobic zone in underlying soil. This study suggests that change in the amount of snowfall or in the length of snow season may influence the geochemical cycle of iron.

Microbial community dynamics in Inferno Crater Lake, a thermally fluctuating geothermal spring	ISME JOURNAL												Understanding how microbial communities respond and adjust to ecosystem perturbation is often difficult to interpret due to multiple and often simultaneous variations in observed conditions. In this research, we investigated the microbial community dynamics of Inferno Crater Lake, an acidic geothermal spring in New Zealand with a unique thermal cycle that varies between 30 and 80 degrees C over a period of 40-60 days. Using a combination of next-generation sequencing, geochemical analysis and quantitative PCR we found that the microbial community composition was predominantly chemolithotrophic and strongly associated with the thermal cycle. At temperatures 465 degrees C, the microbial community was dominated almost exclusively by sulphur-oxidising archaea (Sulfolobuslike spp.). By contrast, at mesophilic temperatures the community structure was more mixed, comprising both archaea and bacteria but dominated primarily by chemolithotrophic sulphur and hydrogen oxidisers. Multivariate analysis of physicochemical data confirmed that temperature was the only significant variable associated with community turnover. This research contributes to our understanding of microbial community dynamics in variable environments, using a naturally alternating system as a model and extends our limited knowledge of acidophile ecology in geothermal habitats.					; McDonald, Ian/A-4851-2008	Stott, Matthew/0000-0002-2082-9460; Taylor, Michael/0000-0002-0463-7813; Power, Jean F./0000-0003-4250-8892; McDonald, Ian/0000-0002-4847-6492													1751-7362	1751-7370				MAY	2017	11	5					1158	1167		10.1038/ismej.2016.193	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ismej.2016.193								28072418					WOS:000399379500009

A synchronous pattern in DOC was found among lakes within each region; however, a synchronous pattern in DOC was not found among regions, except for Kejimkujik and Yarmouth. Long-term trends of increasing or decreasing DOC concentration were not evident except at the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA), where an increase in DOC correlated with a decrease in summer TSR and an increase in summer precipitation. Annual mean temperature increased at the Nova Scotia and Turkey Lakes Watershed regions (TLW) over the study period, but there was no corresponding change in DOC. TSR and precipitation were important explanatory variables across all regions, except for the TLW. Summer TSR, or annual TSR, had a negative relationship, while summer precipitation had a positive relationship with the temporal DOC pattern in all regions except TLW. TSR and precipitation explained 78%, 49%, and 84% of the variation in the long-term DOC patterns at Dorset, ELA, and Nova Scotia (NS) regions, respectively. In contrast, the long-term pattern in DOC at TLW was only weakly related to SOI and PDO.					; hudson, jeff/G-6171-2012	Hudson, Jeffrey/0000-0002-0256-3240; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2010	55	1					30	42		10.4319/lo.2010.55.1.0030	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2010.55.1.0030													WOS:000271164900003

Samples from 0.5 and 5 m showed a similar peroxidation pattern, which was maximal after the fall off in algal biomass. The rapid decline in Peridinium biomass coincided with ambient lake temperatures of 21-23 degrees C. Fatty acid composition profiles were similar at both depths, although after the peak of the bloom, a significant increase in polyunsaturated fatty acids and oleic acid was only found at 0.5 m, together with a decrease in the percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids. These effects were related to ambient light stress rather than a result of lipid peroxidation. Lake samples taken at different periods of the bloom and incubated at various temperatures showed differential peroxidation. Higher temperatures caused increased lipid peroxidation, but this appeared to be dependent on the sampling period. Samples withdrawn from the lake at the beginning of the bloom showed little peroxidation after a 5 day incubation at 14 degrees C, room temperature (25 degrees C) or ambient lake temperature (16 degrees C) compared to mid-bloom samples in which there was a significant increase in peroxidation when they were incubated at room temperature (25 degrees C) or ambient lake temperature (22 degrees C). Incubation at 14 degrees C inhibited peroxidation; however, samples from mid-bloom again showed enhanced peroxidation compared with those from the beginning of the bloom. These in situ results suggested a relationship between temperature, another environmental variable during the bloom and lipid peroxidation in Peridinium. As total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIG) concentrations fall significantly during the progress of the bloom and represent an important source of environmental stress, laboratory experiments were established to investigate the synergistic effect of temperature and carbon nutrition on lipid peroxidation in Peridinium cultures. Increased temperature alone caused a slight increase in lipid peroxidation, but this was greatly augmented by carbon limitation. Although carbon limitation induced increased catalase activity, at higher temperatures activity declined after 48 h, allowing for the substantial increase in lipid peroxidation.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				FEB	1998	20	2					355	369		10.1093/plankt/20.2.355	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/20.2.355													WOS:000072676300012

In an environment where light and temperature are held constant, the reaeration rate of the water below the mat is a linear function of mat thickness. In the light, the rate of O2 transfer into water through a 10.5 mm mat is 4.4 times higher for Wolffia and 2.9 times higher for L. minor than in the dark. In the light the rate of O2 transfer through Wolffia mats is significantly lower in Aug. and Sept. than in early summer. A seasonal shift in transport rates through L. minor mats was not conclusively established. The efficiency of gas transfer through washed Wolffia and L. minor mats 8-16 mm in thickness varies from 4.0-47.0% of the estimated gas exchange rate for a small protected lake. The rate of gas transfer through the mat is higher than might be expected considering the close packing of the component fronds. The shape of the O2 profile in the upper portion of a photosynthetically active mat indicates that much of the O2 produced by photosynthesis of the submerged fronds may be lost to the atmosphere. When the light intensity falls below the level required to exceed the compensation point, dissolved O2 levels in the water trapped between the fronds are quickly reduced to very low tensions despite the proximity of the entire mat to the O2-saturated air-water interface.																			0008-4026						1977	55	14					1926	1932		10.1139/b77-220	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b77-220													WOS:A1977DS69000006

Extreme variations in climate and topography as well as the multitude of diverse geochemical conditions since the early Paleocene allowed development of huge hypogenic and epigenic karst systems. The interplay between the surface and karst drainage systems resulted in an attractive fluvial morphology with large karst springs, travertine bridges, gorges, and valleys. All of the karst valleys spreading from the heights of the AMR-hosted valley glaciers that once flowed down to 1100 m elevation. With its diverse landscape, the AMR is a promising land for tourists, backpackers, trekkers, and mountaineers. Large hanging karst springs, long rafting routes along gorges, travertine bridges, U-shaped glacial valleys and lakes, and challenging peaks are the major landscape attractions.

Siliceous sublacustrine spring deposits around hydrothermal vents in Lake Taupo, New Zealand	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY												Chimneys around hydrothermal vents at a depth of c. 140 m in the Horomatangi Reefs area in Lake Taupo, New Zealand, are composed of amorphous silica (opal-A) with lesser amounts of Mn-, Fe-, and Hg-rich precipitates. Detrital quartz and feldspar grains are found in the surrounding sediments. The associated biota includes fish, bacteria, sponges, crayfish, amphipods, copepods, ostracodes, annelids, and other unidentified organisms. Much of this biota, however, is not preserved in the opal-A deposits. Instead, the silicified biota includes filamentous microbes and diatoms, scattered coccoid microbes, fungal hyphae and spores, rare sponge spicules, and rare worm(?) tubes. The diatoms, coccoid microbes, and fungi were brought into the area with the detrital sediment. In ancient successions, distinction between sublacustrine, terrestrial, and some marine hot spring deposits may be difficult because the precipitates share many similarities. Distinction based on the biota is viable only if palaeoecological information can be inferred from accurately identified organisms. Unfortunately, silicification commonly disguises microbes and precludes their accurate identification. Diagenetic transformation of opal-A to its more stable polymorphs also destroys many original depositional fabrics and silicified microbes. Distinction between the different types of spring deposit may therefore depend on the interpretation of their overall sedimentological and stratigraphic setting.

We know less about zero-flow periods in humid headwater catchments that experience seasonal snow cover. Our study characterised the temporal and spatial patterns of zero-flow periods for forested headwater streams in a snow-dominated landscape. We used 36 years of streamflow data from 13 headwater catchments within the Turkey Lakes Watershed located on the Canadian Shield in Ontario, Canada, near the eastern shores of Lake Superior. These headwater catchments differ substantially in their number of May-November zero-flow days (0-166 days per year) despite being clustered in a small geographical area with similar geology, physiography and vegetation cover. The catchments also experience similar continental climatic conditions with relatively even precipitation inputs throughout the year (mean annual precipitation of 1210 mm/year). Inter-annual variability in the number of zero-flow days was primarily associated with May-November precipitation and evapotranspiration. Despite the large seasonal snowpacks that form in this region, the amount of snow did not appear to influence the extent of zero-flow periods. We found that between-catchment variability in zero-flow occurrences was related to differences in catchment area and catchment properties typically associated with greater groundwater influence. Our study suggests that occurrences of zero-flows in headwater streams can be highly variable even over small geographical regions and that flow permanence may be more sensitive to spring to fall weather conditions than the influence of snow due partly to the shallow soils typically found on the Canadian Shield.					; Hudson, Danielle/GRE-6086-2022	Hudson, Danielle/0000-0003-2775-8236; Leach, Jason/0000-0001-6639-7993; 													0885-6087	1099-1085				DEC	2024	38	12							e70025	10.1002/hyp.70025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.70025													WOS:001372414200001

Carbonate 17Oexcess as a paleo-hydrology proxy: Triple oxygen isotope fractionation between H2O and biogenic aragonite, derived from freshwater mollusks	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Carbonates are common paleoclimate archives in a variety of environments with land carbonates recording both temperatures and hydrological conditions. Whereas delta O-18 has long been used for that purpose, triple oxygen isotopes (given as O-17(excess)) has only recently been analyzed in CaCO3. Carbonate O-17(excess) is expected to reflect the temperature, in which the carbonate formed, and the triple oxygen isotopic composition of its parent water. The reconstruction of past water O-17(excess) values from carbonate records requires characterization of the 17 0 fractionation between water and CaCO3. Here, we use freshwater mollusk shells grown in well constrained spring environments, at a temperature range of 15-28 degrees C, to derive the fractionation factor (17)alpha between CO2 extracted from CaCO3 and the carbonate habitat water. The spring water temperature and isotopic composition are constant year-round, avoiding uncertainty associated with seasonality. The derived (18)alpha and (17)alpha between CO2 extracted from mollusk aragonite and spring water are used to calculate the fractionation slope (=ln (17)alpha/ln(18)alpha), resulting in 0.5231 +/- 0.0003, with no discernible temperature dependence. Using this value, we evaluated the fractionation slope of the acid digestion of CaCO3 as 0.5170 +/- 0.0004. The minor difference between the fractionation slope between aragonite and parent water and the reference slope of 0.528, implies that (17)O(excess )in carbonates is only weakly temperature dependent. On the other hand, carbonate O-17(excess ) values directly record variability in O-17(excess) of the parent water, making it a useful paleo-hydrological proxy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Plerocercoids of the cestode Diphyllobothrium ditremum in brown trout Salmo trutta: substantial increase in infection after establishment of European minnow Phoxinus phoxinus	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												This study focuses on plerocercoids of the cestode Diphyllobothrium ditremum in brown trout Salmo trutta from the subalpine lake Ovre Heimdalsvatn in south-central Norway. Salmo trutta was the only fish species in this lake until European minnow Phoxinus phoxinus was registered in 1969. The P. phoxinus population increased substantially in the following years. In contrast with the 1969-1972 period, when plerocercoids of D. ditremum were practically absent in S. trutta, there was a high prevalence and intensity of infection in the 2013 S. trutta samples. Because the life cycle of D. ditremum involves two larval stages, in copepods and salmonids and mature worms in piscivorous birds, such as mergansers and loons, a change in feeding ecology of S. trutta or changes in population densities of copepods, fish or birds might have influenced the infection pattern. No relationships between D. ditremum infection and muscle-tissue N-15 signature or Hg concentration were found, indicating that infection is not a result of piscivory or cannibalism. Furthermore, consumption of copepods by S. trutta during summer and autumn was low. On the other hand, the number of piscivorous birds has increased, probably due to the presence of P. phoxinus as a new and numerous prey. An increased number of final D. ditremum hosts may have produced a higher output of cestode eggs, resulting in more infected copepods that in turn are consumed by S. trutta. Indirectly, P. phoxinus may therefore have caused the observed increased infection in S. trutta and thereby imposed further negative effects on S. trutta in high mountain areas.

J	Jones, B; Renaut, RW; Rosen, MR				Jones, B; Renaut, RW; Rosen, MR			Taphonomy of silicified filamentous microbes in modern geothermal sinters - Implications for identification	PALAIOS												Silicified microbes found on the discharge aprons around modern geysers and hot springs commonly appear to be preserved superbly. This can be attributed to their rapid silicification, which often begins while they are alive. In geological terms, therefore, they are silicified instantaneously. Thus, it might be expected that these microbes should be good replicas of the living organisms and, therefore, easy to identify in terms of extant taxa. Silicified microbes found on the discharge aprons around geysers and hot springs of North Island, New Zealand, are preserved through replacement and/or encrustation. Organic matter is typically absent, and examples of sheaths being partly replaced or coated by other minerals, such as iron oxide, have not yet been recognized. Accordingly, the cellular-level information needed for microbe identification must be gleaned from features preserved in the silica. Unfortunately, the silicification processes commonly destroy and/or disguise most of the taxonomic features that are necessary for reliable identification in terms of extant taxa. Silicification may, for example, obscure the presence of a sheath and/or significantly alter the size of the microbes.

Inflows needed to maintain ecosystem functionality can be assessed by observing how organisms sensitive to environmental change (bioindicators) respond to varying flow conditions. In Galveston Bay (Texas, U.S.A.), Rangia cuneata clams were proposed as bioindicators of ecological response to freshwater inflows. Rangia cuneata abundance has decreased and their distribution has retracted proximal to freshwater sources from 1983 to 2010. From 2010 to 2014, the highest mean shell lengths (Trinity River delta, 48.0 +/- 0.4 mm) and meat indexes (Clear Lake, 13.3% +/- 0.3%) of R. cuneata were observed in areas most influenced by freshwater inputs. In the Trinity River delta, clam biomass and density averaged 3.4 (+/- 0.3) kg m (3) and 25.6 (+/- 3.5) clams m (2), respectively. A general decreasing trend was observed in biomass and density between like seasons after the drought of 2011, which persisted throughout most of 2014. Sex ratios (62.8% +/- 2.4% male) and juvenile abundance (highest in winters and summers after spawning) were consistent with life-history observations. Life-cycle observations were not available before 2010 and are important to consider in future studies. Without them, long-term decadal declines in R. cuneata clams are difficult to explain when limited to terms of natural and anthropogenic stressors. Rangia cuneata's utility as bioindicators of the ecological functionality of an estuary affected by changing freshwater inflows requires further investigation for resource management.																			0749-0208	1551-5036				NOV	2019	35	6					1260	1270		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-18-00164.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-18-00164.1													WOS:000495365700010
J	Alam, MS; Zastepa, A; Dittrich, M				Alam, Md Samrat; Zastepa, Arthur; Dittrich, Maria			Phosphorus dynamics in an ice-covered lake: Insights from geochemical gradients in water and sediments	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Understanding the role of seasonally ice-covered lakes in biogeochemical cycling is important for predicting the effects of changing winter conditions. However, little is known about phosphorus (P) cycling and the mechanisms of internal P release in seasonally ice-covered lakes. We investigated under-ice P cycling in a large and temperate lake composed of several basins with significantly different water depths. We used a multifaceted approach, combining analyses of P and total iron (Fe) distributions in sediments, pore water, and the water column. During the winter period, steep gradients of redox-sensitive parameters (i.e., O2 and Eh) formed at the sediment-water interface (SWI) due to minimal water movement and water column hypoxia. P diffusive fluxes during winter are substantial (0.2-4.8 mg P/m2/day). Short-term P release in shallow basins is strongly influenced by Fe reduction. In contrast, decoupling of Fe from P in deep basins suggests that hypoxia does not play a major role in short-term P mobilization. The differences in short-term P release mechanisms can be interpreted in terms of basin depth, stability of thermal stratification and time of water mixing. This ultimately influences the behavior of Fe and P, as well as their speciation and concentration in the sediment and water column. The deep basins in LOW contained higher total phosphorus (TP) and total iron (Fe) in sediments and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) in deep water compared to shallow basins. In surface sediments, P bound to the redox-sensitive P binding form (BD-P) is the diagenetically reactive P phase, emphasizing strong coupling with ferric Fe. In contrast, calcium carbonatebound P in surface sediments indicates diagenetic sequestration of P with sediment burial. Overall, this study provides evidence that P cycling remains active in winter, and an understanding of its contribution to the overall ecosystem process is needed to predict how lake ecosystems will behave under climate change.

J	Sadro, S; Melack, JM; MacIntyre, S				Sadro, Steven; Melack, John M.; MacIntyre, Sally			Depth-integrated estimates of ecosystem metabolism in a high-elevation lake (Emerald Lake, Sierra Nevada, California)	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A series of vertical profiles of dissolved oxygen (DO) collected periodically over two consecutive ice-free seasons in an oligotrophic high-elevation lake (Emerald Lake, California) were used to investigate volumetric and areal rates of gross primary production (GPP), community respiration (CR), and net ecosystem production (NEP). Diel patterns in DO did not weaken with depth in this lake, where the entire 10-m water column was within the euphotic zone and where a deep chlorophyll a (Chl a) maximum was common during periods of thermal stratification. During stratification, both GPP and CR increased with depth, and heterotrophy (NEP < 0) tended to occur below the thermocline in association with higher Chl a and particulate matter concentrations. With the onset of autumn mixing each year, vertical gradients in metabolism weakened or disappeared and the entire water column was autotrophic. Net autotrophy over the growing season was confirmed using three methods of estimating whole-lake metabolism. During periods of stratification, flux across the thermocline, where eddy diffusivities were near molecular, was small (4% of total epilimnetic fluxes), while within the hypolimnion, where stratification was weaker and eddy diffusivities larger, fluxes between strata were more substantial (12% of total fluxes). For this lake and other small lakes with low wind speeds and Lake numbers near 10, mixing due to turbulence should be included in computations of metabolism within the hypolimnion. However, single-station measurements from within the epilimnion provide a reasonable estimate of seasonal metabolism, especially in the autumn when the lake is mixing on a diel basis.

Characterizing lentic freshwater fish assemblages using multiple sampling methods	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Characterizing fish assemblages in lentic ecosystems is difficult, and multiple sampling methods are almost always necessary to gain reliable estimates of indices such as species richness. However, most research focused on lentic fish sampling methodology has targeted recreationally important species, and little to no information is available regarding the influence of multiple methods and timing (i.e., temporal variation) on characterizing entire fish assemblages. Therefore, six lakes and impoundments (48-1,557 ha surface area) were sampled seasonally with seven gear types to evaluate the combined influence of sampling methods and timing on the number of species and individuals sampled. Probabilities of detection for species indicated strong selectivities and seasonal trends that provide guidance on optimal seasons to use gears when targeting multiple species. The evaluation of species richness and number of individuals sampled using multiple gear combinations demonstrated that appreciable benefits over relatively few gears (e.g., to four) used in optimal seasons were not present. Specifically, over 90 % of the species encountered with all gear types and season combinations (N = 19) from six lakes and reservoirs were sampled with nighttime boat electrofishing in the fall and benthic trawling, modified-fyke, and mini-fyke netting during the summer. Our results indicated that the characterization of lentic fish assemblages was highly influenced by the selection of sampling gears and seasons, but did not appear to be influenced by waterbody type (i.e., natural lake, impoundment). The standardization of data collected with multiple methods and seasons to account for bias is imperative to monitoring of lentic ecosystems and will provide researchers with increased reliability in their interpretations and decisions made using information on lentic fish assemblages.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL	2014	186	7					4461	4474		10.1007/s10661-014-3711-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-014-3711-z								24638937					WOS:000337030000039

Key factors influencing Hg levels and trends in unperturbed oligotrophic temperate and boreal lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Mercury (Hg) is a toxic metal that presents a major risk to ecosystems, biota, human health, and remains a priority concern. In temperate and boreal lakes Hg and methylmercury (MMHg) are expected to vary as a function of atmospheric Hg deposition, lake water chemistry, catchment characteristics and climate variables. The aim of this study was to quantify Hg and MMHg in unperturbed oligotrophic lakes and to identify the factors controlling their distribution. We first hypothesized that lake Hg (and MMHg to lesser extent) spatial variations are linked to atmospheric deposition, catchment characteristics, and terrestrial exportation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). We secondly examined if lake Hg concentrations have followed the decrease in atmospheric Hg emission observed between the mid-1990s to the end-2010s. We found that overall, atmospheric Hg has little impact on lake Hg and MMHg concentrations, which are both primarily influenced by DOC input originating from the forest catchment. The relationship between DOC and Hg differed between the spring and the fall, with a Hg-to-DOC ratio twice as high in spring. This seems related to snowmelt input of Hg (with a relatively reduced input of DOC) or the internal lake build-up of Hg during the ice-covered period. Of the 10 lakes intensively visited over a 20-year period, only 3 showed significant lake Hg decreases despite significant negative trends in atmospheric Hg concentrations, suggesting a lag between atmospheric and surface water temporal trends. Overall, terrestrial catchments retain around 80% of atmospheric Hg implying that large Hg pools have been built up in soils in the last decades. As such, the reduction of atmospheric Hg alone will not necessarily result in Hg decreases in lakes, since the Hg concentrations may be modulated by DOC export trends and catchment characteristics. This stresses the need to improve our understanding of the processes governing Hg transfers from catchments into lakes.

Observational Evidence for Summer Rainfall at Titan's North Pole	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Methane rain on Saturn's moon Titan makes it the only place, other than Earth, where rain interacts with the surface. When and where that rain wets the surface changes seasonally in ways that remain poorly understood. Here we report the discovery of a bright ephemeral feature covering an area of 120,000 km(2) near Titan's north pole in observations from Cassini's near-infrared instrument, Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer on 7 June 2016. Based on the overall brightness, spectral characteristics, and geologic context, we attribute this new feature to specular reflections from a rain-wetted solid surface like those off of a sunlit wet sidewalk. The reported observation is the first documented rainfall event at Titan's north pole and heralds the arrival of the northern summer (through climatic evidence), which has been delayed relative to model predictions. This detection helps constrain Titan's seasonal change and shows that the "wet-sidewalk effect can be used to identify other rain events."					; Barnes, Jason/B-1284-2009; Turtle, Elizabeth/K-8673-2012; Rodriguez, Sebastien/JAO-0156-2023; Nicholson, Philip/ABC-3366-2020; rodriguez, sebastien/H-5902-2016	Soderblom, Jason/0000-0003-3715-6407; Turtle, Elizabeth/0000-0003-1423-5751; Le Mouelic, Stephane/0000-0001-5260-1367; rodriguez, sebastien/0000-0003-1219-0641													0094-8276	1944-8007				FEB 16	2019	46	3					1205	1212		10.1029/2018GL080943	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018GL080943													WOS:000462072800010
J	Tas, B				Tas, Beyhan			Trophic state assessment based on summer phytoplankton community structure and trophic indices: a small tectonic lake in Turkey	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Lake Gokgol is a small lake with a tectonic origin located in Ordu, Turkey. Algal diversity and distribution as well as the trophic structure of the lake in the summer period were examined. It is a lake with poor acidic character, low dissolved oxygen content, high electrical conductivity, with very hard water characteristics, having nutritive elements particularly phosphorus, and high mineral concentration. In the phytoplankton, the highest diversity of species belongs to Bacillariophyta (33 taxa), followed by Cyanobacteria (6 taxa), Charophyta (5 taxa), Euglenozoa (3 taxa), Chlorophyta (3 taxa), Cryptophyta (1 taxa), and Miozoa (1 taxa), respectively. During the summer months, the biggest contribution to phytoplankton abundance is from Cyanobacteria (96%) and Bacillariophyta (4%). Of blue-green algae, Chroococcus dispersus and Dolicospermum affine, of the diatoms Cyclotella radiosa, Achnanthidium exile, Ampohora ovalis, of euglenoids Euglena gracilis are the taxa making a significant contribution to the phytoplankton abundance. The phytoplankton community was applied with various diversity, species richness, and evenness indices (Shannon, Pileou, Simpson, and Margaleff), and the environmental factors were applied with cluster analysis and correlation analysis. According to the correlation analysis results, the highest positive correlation is between NH4-N, TP, and Cyanobacteria (p < 0.01). To determine the trophic level, phytoplankton compound quotient (PCQ), Palmer's algal genus pollution index, dominant genus scores, Carlson's trophic state index, and Burns's trophic level index were used. In conclusion, when evaluated according to the average of all parameters during the summer months, the Gokgol Lake shows eutrophic character and clean to moderate water quality. Toxic Cyanobacteria bloom was not detected in the lake, which could pose a risk to human health. Gokgol Lake, which does not carry the risk of eutrophication, can be evaluated for health tourism because it contains high mineral salts.

Ash aggregate-rich pyroclastic density currents of the 431 CE Tierra Blanca Joven eruption, Ilopango caldera, El Salvador	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												The VEI 6, Tierra Blanca Joven pyroclastic sequence (30-90 km(3) DRE volume), erupted from Ilopango caldera, El Salvador, in 431 CE, is the product of one of the largest eruptions of the last two millennia. The eruption devastated Central America's Mayan civilization. The eruption began with a short-lived phase of ash and pumice fall deposition and transitioned to a 'wet' explosive phase during which pyroclastic density currents flowed >40 km from the caldera. Detailed field and sedimentological analyses are provided for the deposits of ash-aggregaterich pyroclastic density currents generated during early phases of the eruption. The first phase of pyroclastic density current inundation incinerated forests and deposited up to 30 m of, non-welded, ash-rich ignimbrite in proximal regions, along with ash fall layers of co-ignimbrite origin. Following fallout of a thin layer of pumice and lithic lapilli, a second phase of pyroclastic density current inundation and co-ignimbrite ash fall commenced. A range of ash aggregate types is present in the pyroclastic density current deposits and interbedded coignimbrite ash fall layers. Whole and broken concentrically layered ash aggregates (accretionary lapilli) reach >50 vol% in some horizons within some beds in the pyroclastic density current deposits. The evidence indicates that the ash aggregates grew within overriding co-ignimbrite ash plumes and subsequently fell into groundhugging currents. Our findings suggest that the aggregate-rich nature of the pyroclastic density current deposits originated through incorporation of lake water into eruptive plumes, which in turn triggered rapid, pervasive aggregation within ash clouds and co-ignimbrite plumes.

Despite this, the mechanisms influencing EASM-Westerlies variability are still a matter of considerable debate. This study presents three loess-paleosol sequences in the NE Tibetan Plateau (NETP) dated at high-resolution by 50 K-feldspar pIRIR and 37 quartz OSL ages to produce the most detailed chronology for any loess record within the plateau. Combined with this chronology are sedimentology, magnetic susceptibility and grain size analyses with TraCE-21ka climatic modelling to constrain atmospheric controls on climatic changes over the NETP during the past 130 kyr. Our results indicate that deposition initiated by similar to 130 ka with especially rapid rates during glacial periods, with maximum rates (140-180 g/cm(2)/ka) in early MIS 2. Over interglacial-glacial cycles, NETP climatic changes are consistent with warm-moist interglacial and cold-dry glacial conditions recorded in the monsoonal Chinese Loess Plateau and Westerlies-dominated Central Asia but anti-phase to Central Asia during interglacial and the Holocene substages. These results highlight how variation in EASM intensity strongly controls NETP moisture changes but that Holocene and last interglacial changes recorded in the NETP consistently lag 30 degrees N summer insolation by 2-6 kyr. This study suggests high-latitude forcing effectively modulates EASM intensity and that factors such as ice volume, greenhouse gases, and freshwater input to northern Atlantic and Southern oceans critically influence NETP paleoclimatic conditions.

J	Reavie, ED; Douglas, SV; Williams, NE				Reavie, ED; Douglas, SV; Williams, NE			Paleoecology of a groundwater outflow using siliceous microfossils	ECOSCIENCE												Paleoecological investigations of sediments deposited downstream of freshwater springs have the potential to reconstruct the environmental history of source aquifers and their catchments, thereby allowing for the study of long-term changes in these important hydrological systems. In an exploratory investigation, a 76-cm sediment column was obtained from a spring bed in Scarborough, southern Ontario, Canada, Thr column represents about 160 years of accumulated sediment. Siliceous microfossils, including diatoms, chrysophyte cysts, phytoliths and plates of testate amoebae (Rhizopoda), were identified and enumerated. Over the similar to 160-year period, siliceous remains track a gradual transition from a slow river environment in the early 1800s to a spring-fed pond environment by the late-1800s, hurricane-induced flooding, and the eventual slowing and drying of thr spring in the latter half of the twentieth century. Basal, pre settlement sediments contain a cosmopolitan assemblage of diatom taxa and testacean plates of the genus Lesquereusia. Between similar to 1880 and similar to 1954, fossils of aquatic species occur only in trace amounts, indicating increased deposition of elastic material and poor conditions for survival. but unbroken microfossils indicate that preservation of opaline remains was not a problem. Despite low concentrations of microfossils in this interval, chrysophyte and testacean survival was favoured over diatoms. In 1954, a thick layer of sediment was deposited by hurricane-induced flooding, confirmed by high phytolith concentrations from terrestrial sources. Since similar to 1960, epiphytic diatoms, reflecting dense macrophyte growth and higher productivity, dominate the diatom assemblage. Some of the recent diatom ta,va are also salinity-tolerant, reflecting possible groundwater salinification. Chrysophyte cysts are relatively abundant at thr op of the sediment column. but recent concentrations are lower than pre-settlement levels, likely reflecting an increased nutrient load. Recent increases in vegetation in and around the spring are also inferred by high concentrations of testacean plates and phytoliths. These paleoecological data match historical records and data from previous investigations of fossil aquatic insect larvae. These approaches show promise for relating changes in siliceous microfossils to human impacts and natural changes in spring habitats, their catchments and the quality of groundwater.

J	Kumari, P; Hansdah, P				Kumari, Preeti; Hansdah, Puja			Sources and toxicological effects of metal and metalloids on human health through fish consumption in mineral-rich city, Ranchi, India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Ranchi is the administrative capital of Jharkhand and is located in the southern part of the Chhotanagpur Plateau. It is rich in forest and mineral resources and hence is suitable for the establishment of many large- and small-scale industries. The estimated population of Ranchi for the year 2023 is 3.54 million. These demographic characteristics make the capital more vulnerable to environmental degradation. Also, previous water quality research focused on river, water, and oceans separately; however, little or no work has been carried out on the comparison of metal or metalloid analysis in rivers, waterfalls, and lakes. Hence, the present study aims to assess the pollution status of mineral-rich and industrial hub city, Ranchi, through analysis of metals or metalloids in abiotic (water and sediment) and biotic (fish and human) components. The water, sediment, and fish (Labeo rohita and Catla catla) samples were collected from Subarnarekha river, Jumar river, Dassam fall, Getalsud dam, Hundru fall, Jonha fall, Kanke dam, and Sita fall. Samples were collected following standard methods and analyzed in inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Among three aquatic systems (rivers, dams, and falls), dams were highly polluted with metals or metalloids, which may be due to effluent discharge from different industries. Additionally, the high population in the city also contributed to metals or metalloids pollution. The reason may be the direct sewage disposal and agricultural and surface runoff in the water systems. It was observed that most of the aquatic systems in Ranchi were severely polluted with metals or metalloids. The fish also accumulated these metals or metalloids in their body and can be life-threatening to the human population consuming them. The THQ (above 1) and HI (2.95) values for As showed that children are more vulnerable to health risk through consumption of contaminated fish. Hence, proper planning and management are needed to overcome the metals or metalloids pollution in Ranchi.					; KUMARI, PREETI/JYQ-2543-2024	Kumari, Preeti/0000-0002-4352-5646; Hansdah, Puja/0000-0002-4947-9601; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				SEP	2023	195	9							1032	10.1007/s10661-023-11639-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-023-11639-2								37561244					WOS:001049227500001

Comprehensive analyses of stratigraphic sequences and climatic proxy data ha,,e been used to reconstruct a history of fluctuating dry and wet environmental conditions in these monsoon sensitive areas since the last deglaciation. These records have also been compared with Greenland ice core and Guliya ice core data. Four major events representing these climate fluctuations (E1-E4) are recognised. Among them, E3 indicates an abrupt cooling event after the Younger Dryas interval. This event has so far only been recognised in China and high latitude areas in the northern hemisphere. It is proposed that century to millenial scale global temperature changes affect the intensity of monsoon circulation through ocean/atmosphere interactions, hence producing dry and wet climate fluctuations in monsoon sensitive areas. In an era of global warming. the overall picture presented by the sequences of wet/dry periods recorded in Chinese monsoon affected areas during the last deglaciation can be used as an historical analogue for future predictions of medium to long term climate change within these areas.

Varves appear under a petrologic microscope as couplets of dark-silt and light-clay layers. The mechanism of varve formation is surmized as follows: each silt layer is the production of sediment inflow interpreted as mainly derived from snowmelt during summer; each clay layer was deposited in a stillwater environment during an ice-cover period. A light-clay layer provides an important index bed to identify the annual interface. The high accumulation rates, long period of ice cover, and topographically closed basin are probably all critical factors in forming and preserving varves. Varve thickness is known to be controlled mainly by summer temperature. The variation of varve thickness in Lake Bolterskardet can then be used to reconstruct summer temperature. The varve series show that there has been distinct decade-scale variability of summer temperature over the past 150 years. Warm periods occurred in the 1860s, around 1900, the 1930s, 1950s, and 1970s, and in the last 20 years. The varved sediments of Lake Bolterskarde preserve an ideal record for high-resolution paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental research in this data-sparse area.																			1000-9515					AUG	2006	80	4					557	563																WOS:000240249700012

However, the bacterial characteristics in these environments are obscure. Accordingly, we observed seasonal variations of arsenic species and the bacterial population decomposing dimethylarsinic acid (DMAA) in Lake Kahokugata from April 2002 to January 2003. Monitoring of bacterial biomass involving DMAA decomposition using the most probable number procedure showed that the bacterial cell densities ranged from 36 to 3600 ml(-1). On the other hand, methylated arsenic was not detected during the experimental period, although the inorganic arsenic concentration was over 4 nM. This suggests that bacteria remineralized methylated arsenic species to inorganic arsenic. Furthermore, the composition of bacterial communities involving DMAA decomposition was examined by restriction-fragment-length polymorphism analysis of the 16S rDNA nucleotide. As a result, a total of 49 isolates were classified into 10 type groups, and 32 of these isolates belonged to three dominant type groups. Phylogenetic analysis using 16S rDNA partial sequences (ca 320 bp) suggests that the representative isolates of the dominant type groups are specific to the summer or winter season. Moreover, as a result of the culture experiments to examine DMAA decomposition activity, the representative isolates decomposed 1 mum DMAA at a decomposition percentage of below 80%. In conclusion, some bacterial communities in a specific season can decompose DMAA to varying degrees, contributing to the annual cycle of arsenic species. Copyright (C) 2005 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

J	Barreto, S				Barreto, S			The silica-scaled chrysophyte flora of Hungary	NOVA HEDWIGIA					6th International Chrysophyte Symposium	AUG 02-07, 2004	Univ Helsinki, Lammi, FINLAND		Univ Helsinki			The silica-scaled chrysophytes have never been in the focus of Hungarian phytoplankton investigations. The aim of the present study is therefore to explore the occurrence and distribution of this alga group in Hungary. Thirty-three localities were sampled in the country in April, September and October 1999. Among the sampled sites there are fishponds, recreation lakes, reservoirs, swamps, forest ponds, etc. Physical and chemical parameters (temperature, pH, conductivity, total dissolved solids, total nitrogen, total phosphorous, chlorophyll-a content) were measured on the day of sampling. As a result a remarkably rich and diverse scaled-chrysophyte flora (45 Mallomonas, 8 Synura, 2 Chrysosphaerella, 5 Spiniferomons, 19 Paraphysomonas, 1 Polylepidomonas species) has been found. Of the eighty species 45 are new records to Hungary and 3 are new to the world (Mallomonas formosa, M. cucullata, M. tubulosa). Characterization of the Hungarian silica-scaled chrysophyte flora is established based on relative occurrences of the species. The most common species in Hungary (e. g. Paraphysomonas vestita, Synura petersenii, Mallomonas annulata, M. alata) are cosmopolitan or widely distributed ones. Some have globally scattered occurrence (e.g. M. insignis, M. lelymene, M. retifera, M. alata f. hualvensis, S. petersenii f. praefracta, S. mollispina), one was endemic for another continent (M. inornata). Most of the species prefer cool to cold water, or have no special preference for temperature, though some tropical elements also occur (e.g. Mallomonas mangofera f. foveata, M. peronoides). Seasonal differences are observed concerning the number and composition of species. Both the species number and the relative frequency of occurrences were much higher during spring than in the autumn period. The characteristic scaled-chrysophyte flora of some localities in protected areas (Hortobagy National Park, Pilis/Visegrad Mountains) is given, providing valuable information for the urgent need of nature conservation. A unique assemblage of species was found in the acidic temporary forest ponds of Pilis/Visegrdd Mountains (e.g. Mallomonas clavus, M. doignonii, Paraphysomonas undulata), the type localities of the 3 endemic species.

Radiocarbon dating indicates that the record spans the last 15,000 cal year BP. The principal magnetic mineral in the sediments is pseudo-single domain magnetite of detrital origin with minimal post-depositional alteration. Although the variations in the concentration of detrital magnetic minerals and their grain size throughout the core reflect inputs from both soil erosion and eolian dust, it is shown that their climatic and environmental significance changes with time. In the lowermost part of the core, similar to 15,000-11,500 cal year BP, the magnetic minerals were supplied mainly by bedrock erosion, soil erosion and dust input when climate ameliorated after the cold and dusty last glacial maximum. The increasing magnetic susceptibility (v) in this interval may indicate a combination of changes in the lake environment together with catchment-surface stabilization and a decreasing proportion of dust input. In the central part of the core, similar to 11,500-1,000 cal year BP, the detrital magnetic minerals mainly originated from dust inputs from outside the catchment when the lake catchment was covered by forest, and catchment-derived sediment supply (and thus the lake sediment accumulation rate) were minimal. The generally low concentration of magnetic minerals in this part of the core reflects the highest degree of soil stability and the strongest summer monsoon during the Holocene. In the uppermost part of the core, the last similar to 1,000 years, detrital magnetic minerals mainly originated from erosion of catchment soils when the vegetation cover was sparse and the sediment accumulation rates were high. Within this part of the core the high magnetic susceptibility reflects strong pedogenesis in the lake catchment, and thus a strong summer monsoon. This scenario is similar to that recorded in loess profiles. Overall, the results document three main stages of summer monsoon history with abrupt shifts from one stage to another: an increasing and variable summer monsoon during the last deglacial, a generally strong summer monsoon in the early and middle Holocene and a weak summer monsoon in the late Holocene. The results also suggest that different interpretational models may need to be applied to lake sediment magnetic mineral assemblages corresponding to different stages of environmental evolution.

C. vulgaris was shown to be a C3 plant with inducible photorespiration. Its photosynthetic productivity in Shoe Lake in early summer was maximal for submersed macrophytes. Subsequent seasonal declines and daily fluctations in productivity were correlated with presence of photorespiration, but the photorespiration represented a minor percentage of photosynthesis. In the shallow light-saturated water both nitrogen and carbon availability were limiting factors at times during mid- and late summer.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				DEC	1988	4	4					411	418		10.1080/02705060.1988.9665192	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1988.9665192													WOS:A1988R307500001

METHANE FLUX FROM MINNESOTA PEATLANDS	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Northern (>40 degrees N) wetlands have been suggested as the largest natural source of methane (CH4) to the troposphere. To refine our estimates of source strengths from this region and to investigate climatic controls on the process, fluxes were measured from a variety of Minnesota peatlands during May, June, and August 1986. Sites included forested and unforested ombrotrophic bogs and minerotrophic fens in and near the U. S. Department of Agriculture Marcell Experimental Forest and the Red Lake peatlands. Late spring and summer fluxes ranged from 11 to 866 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1), averaging 207 mg CH4 CH4 m(-2) d(-1) overall. At Marcell Forest, forested bogs and fen sites had lower fluxes (averages of 77 +/- 21 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) and 142 +/- 19 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) than open bogs (average of 294 +/- 30 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)). In the Red Lake peatland, circumneutral fens, with standing water above the peat surface, produced more methane than acid bog sites in which the water table was beneath the moss surface (325 +/- 31 and 102 +/- 13 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1), respectively). Peat temperature was an important control. Methane flux increased in response to increasing soil temperature. For example, the open bog in the Marcell Forest with the highest CH4 flux exhibited a 74-fold increase in flux over a three-fold increase in temperature. We estimate that the methane flux from all peatlands north of 40 may be on the order of 70 to 90 Tg/yr though estimates of this sort are plagued by uncertainties in the areal extent of peatlands, length of the CH4 producing season, and the spatial and temporal variability of the flux.

This is a first study focusing on the water mite species composition and zonation in a large Mediterranean lake, i.e. ancient Lake Skadar basin, and identifying the role of physical and chemical water parameters in their distribution. The Hydrachnidia community of Lake Skadar is composed of 53 species. The most diverse water mite assemblages were found in the littoral zone and in the sublacustrine springs. Our study revealed that water mites were most abundant in the deeper, open part of Lake Skadar. Typically sublacustrine species dominated in all zones and habitats of Lake Skadar. The rheobiontic and rheophilic species also had a substantial share, mainly in sublacustrine springs, but also in the open lake area. The unique feature of the Lake Skadar water mite community was an absence of many species typical for the vernal astatic waters and for the shallow phytolittoral zone, even if such habitats were present. We conclude that the structure of the water mite communities in Lake Skadar are associated with particular zones (sublacustrine springs, littoral, open lake area) of the lake and with local environmental conditions, predominantly temperature.

Cost-benefit analysis of different solutions for sustainable irrigation in Fucino Plain (Italy)	SUSTAINABLE IRRIGATION MANAGEMENT, TECHNOLOGIES AND POLICIES II	WIT TRANSACTIONS ON ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT				2nd Conference on Sustainable Irrigation Management, Technologies and Policies	2008	Univ Alicante, Alicante, SPAIN	Wessex Inst Technol, Univ Alicante, Inst Water & Environm Sci, Minis Educ & Ciencia, Inst Agua & Ciencias Ambientales, Univ Alicante, Grupo Invest Modelizac Matemat Sistemas	Univ Alicante			The Fucino Plain (200 km(2)) was the largest lake in Central Italy prior to the 1800s when it was reclaimed for agricultural use. In the past 15 years the original crops, mostly wheat, maize and sugar beet, have been progressively replaced with much more profitable (but more water demanding) horticultural crops. Increasing demand for water together with the actual irrigation techniques and the changes in the climate (decreasing precipitation and increasing temperatures) has caused a number of environmental and social-economical problems. These are mainly related to groundwater resource depletion, spring exhaustion, a decline in summer and annual surface water discharges, scarcity of irrigation water and conflict between different users. Based on a comprehensive study of water supply and demand, several measures for a sustainable use of water were considered. These were mainly related to the implementation of more efficient irrigation techniques, the increase of storage capacity and, subsequently, a reduction in the use of ground water. An accurate cost-benefit analysis showed a positive environmental impact (decline of 70% of ground water exploitation, reduction of energy consumption) and social benefits (increasing of quantity and quality of agricultural production) for the chosen solution.																			1746-448X		978-1-84564-116-0				2008	112						263	272																WOS:000257427600026
J	Simon, M; Tilzer, MM; Muller, H				Simon, M; Tilzer, MM; Muller, H			Bacterioplankton dynamics in a large mesotrophic lake: I. Abundance, production and growth control	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												We studied seasonal and spatial dynamics of bacterioplankton growth together with those of chlorophyll, phytoplankton primary production and zooplankton from spring 1990 to December 1991 in mesotrophic Lake Constance, Germany, on the basis of weekly to biweekly samplings at 7 depths between 1 and 50 or 120 m. Both years differed by the thermal structure of the lake. Whereas in 1990 a stable stratification established already in May, in 1991 the lake remained weakly stratified until mid-June. As a consequence of this the phytoplankton spring bloom and the dear-water phase in 1990 occurred two weeks earlier than in the following year. In both years the spring maximum of bacterioplankton growth occurred with a delay relative to phytoplankton growth. The maximum of bacterioplankton production (BP) preceded that of the abundance in both years by one week. A regression analysis showed that during the spring bloom BP was correlated best with the biomass of ciliates which explained 94 and 60% of the variability of BP during this period in 1990 and 1991, respectively. Significant correlations to phytoplankton parameters and temperature also existed in 1990 and 1991 (only to temperature) but were not as close. In July and August 1991 bacterioplankton abundance and production were 1.5- to 2.5-fold higher than in the previous year. This was a result of a much higher biomass and thus grazing of daphnids yielding a higher release of dissolved organic matter and substrate transfer to planktonic bacteria. Also abundances of heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) were enhanced during this period. After the decline of the daphnid population the biomass of ciliates increased and led to a reduction in bacterial abundance and production. This negative effect was also demonstrated by a significant inverse correlation between BP and the biomass of ciliates during the period June to October 1991. Bacterioplankton growth rates varied between <0.1 and 0.78 d(-1) with highest values during the spring bloom. As compared to bacterial abundance and production, growth rates did not continuously decrease with depth indicating that also at greater depth bacterioplankton growth and mortality were fairly tightly coupled. The abundance of HNF was significantly correlated to the bacterial growth rate in both years but not to BP indicating that the control of BP and the bacterial growth rate were different. Vertical profiles at all seasonal situations usually exhibited much closer correlations among bacterioplankton and phytoplankton parameters than seasonal dynamics.																			0003-9136					NOV	1998	143	4					385	407																WOS:000077260900001

We present quantitative summer temperature reconstructions from Lake Kharinei and lake Tumbulovaty, a previously studied lake in the same region, using a pollen-climate transfer function based on a new calibration set from northern European Russia. Our records suggest that the early-Holocene summer temperatures from 11,500 cal yr BP onwards were already slightly higher than at present, followed by a stable Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) at 8000-3500 cal yr BP when summer temperatures in the tundra were ca. 3 degrees C above present-day values. A Picea forest surrounded Lake Kharinei during the HTM, reaching 150 km north of the present taiga limit. The HIM ended with a temperature drop at 3500-2500 cal yr BP associated with permafrost initiation in the region. Mixed spruce forest began to disappear around lake Kharinei at ca. 3500 cal yr BP, with the last tree macrofossils recorded at ca. 2500 cal yr BP. suggesting that the present wide tundra zone in the Pechora region formed during the last ca. 3500 yr.

Here, we evaluated the abundance, diversity, and potential activity of denitrifying, anammox, and sulfide-dependent denitrifying bacteria in the sediments of the seasonally hypoxic saline Lake Grevelingen, known to harbor an active microbial community involved in sulfur oxidation pathways. Depth distributions of 16S rRNA gene, nirS gene of denitrifying and anammox bacteria, aprA gene of sulfur-oxidizing and sulfate-reducing bacteria, and ladderane lipids of anammox bacteria were studied in sediments impacted by seasonally hypoxic bottom waters. Samples were collected down to 5 cm depth (1 cm resolution) at three different locations before (March) and during summer hypoxia (August). The abundance of denitrifying bacteria did not vary despite of differences in oxygen and sulfide availability in the sediments, whereas anammox bacteria were more abundant in the summer hypoxia but in those sediments with lower sulfide concentrations. The potential activity of denitrifying and anammox bacteria as well as of sulfur-oxidizing, including sulfide-dependent denitrifiers and sulfate-reducing bacteria, was potentially inhibited by the competition for nitrate and nitrite with cable and/or Beggiatoa-like bacteria in March and by the accumulation of sulfide in the summer hypoxia. The simultaneous presence and activity of organoheterotrophic denitrifying bacteria, sulfide-dependent denitrifiers, and anammox bacteria suggests a tight network of bacteria coupling carbon-, nitrogen-, and sulfur cycling in Lake Grevelingen sediments.					; Damste, Jaap/F-6128-2011; Villanueva, Laura/N-3598-2014; Meysman, Filip/C-9585-2009; Sinninghe Damste, Jaap/F-6128-2011	Hopmans, Ellen/0000-0002-8209-1334; Meysman, Filip/0000-0001-5334-7655; Sinninghe Damste, Jaap/0000-0002-8683-1854														1664-302X				OCT 20	2016	7								1661	10.3389/fmicb.2016.01661	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2016.01661								27812355					WOS:000388535800001

Submerged macrophytes are considered refuge areas although they host potential predators for zooplankton. During spring: summer of 2000/2001, we carried out two mesocosm experiments in Los Padres Lake, a shallow macrophyte dominated lake of the Argentine Pampa plain. We investigated the effect of littoral fish predation on zooplankton and the role of submerged macrophytes and benthic macroinvertebrates in the zooplankton-fish relationship. Treatments differed in macrophyte cover (0-65 % PVI) and fish presence. In both experiments, we determined zooplankton abundance and body size distribution, as well as macroinvertebrate abundance. The addition of the small littoral fish Astyanax eigenmanniorum (Characidae, Tetragonopterinae) to the enclosures had either a positive or a negative effect on large zooplankton, especially on calanoid copepods, depending on macroinvertebrate densities and availability. Fish did not impact on small size Cladocera. Instead, littoral fish preferred macroinvertebrates to zooplankton, and thus, the impact of fish predation on plankton community depended largely on the macroinvertebrate abundance. Therefore, our results suggest that macrophyte-fish complex could enhance or depress zooplankton abundance and that the effect is related with predatory macroinvertebrates associated with vegetation.					; de los Angeles Gonzalez Sagrario, Maria/J-3052-2019; Balseiro, Esteban/Y-2743-2019	Gonzalez Sagrario, Maria de los Angeles/0000-0002-6882-8547; Balseiro, Esteban/0000-0002-5052-0587; 													0003-9136					DEC	2003	158	4					551	574		10.1127/0003-9136/2003/0158-0551	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2003/0158-0551													WOS:000187929900006
J	KENOYER, GJ; ANDERSON, MP				KENOYER, GJ; ANDERSON, MP			GROUNDWATERS DYNAMIC ROLE IN REGULATING ACIDITY AND CHEMISTRY IN A PRECIPITATION-DOMINATED LAKE	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The role of groundwater in regulating the hydrologic and chemical regime of an "acid-susceptible" lake situated in a sandy silicate aquifer in northern Wisconsin [USA] was determined by direct groundwater measurements using a network of 68 piezometers. Groundwater inputs were compared with precipitation and dryfall components of the hydrologic and chemical budgets for the lake. Groundwater contributed only 10% of the water to Crystal Lake in 1982 but was the major source of alkalinity, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, silicon, and chloride. Precipitation contributed 90% of the water and was the major source of hydrogen and sulfate ions. Continuing analyses suggest that groundwater consistently supplies the bulk of the inorganic constituents to the lake on an annual basis. The flux of groundwater and dissolved solids to the lake is highly seasonal, with large pulses of groundwater inflow occurring after the spring snowmelt and in the fall. For certain nonconservative elements such as silicon, the periodic influx of chemically concentrated groundwater can trigger significant changes in the chemical and biological balance in the lake. Despite the fact that the aquifer contains no carbonate minerals and the area experiences acid precipitation (pH = 4.6), the alkalinity of the small amount of groundwater entering Crystal Lake is more than enough to neutralize all of the acidity contributed by precipitation. In-lake sulfate reduction may generate an equal amount of alkalinity. This buffering of pH helps to regulate aluminum concentrations at low levels, thus minimizing potential aluminum toxicity in the lake. Most lakes in the region probably receive even larger amounts of alkalinity-rich groundwater than Crystal Lake, because most lie further downgradient in the regional flow system. This may help to explain why most lakes in this "acid-susceptible" area are no more acidic today than they were 50 years ago.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				AUG	1989	109	3-4					287	306		10.1016/0022-1694(89)90020-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-1694(89)90020-6													WOS:A1989AQ64200005

(THg) concentrations were measured in precipitation collected from five US sites in the Great Lakes region: three sites on the southern shore of Lake Superior (Brule River, WI, Eagle Harbor, MI, and Tahquamenon Falls, MI), one at Isle Royale National Park (MI), and one in southern Wisconsin (Devil's Lake), between May 1997 and December 2003. MeHg and THg concentrations at these sites were compared to MeHg and THg concentrations in precipitation collected at the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) in north-western Ontario, Canada. Detectable MeHg concentrations (> 0.01 ng L(-1)) were found in the majority of rain and snow samples collected from all sites (range = 0.01-0.85 ng L(-1)). In general, the lowest MeHg concentrations were observed in samples taken at Tahquamenon Falls and the ELA, and the highest MeHg concentrations in precipitation were observed in samples collected from Brule River and Eagle Harbor. Total Hg concentrations in precipitation were generally between 10 and 60 ng L(-1), exceeding 60 ng L(-1) in one precipitation event sampled from each of Brule River, Isle Royale, Tahquamenon Falls, and Devil's Lake. The proportion of THg that was MeHg (%MeHg), was less than 6% at all sites, with the exception of seven events at Tahquamenon Falls and two events at the ELA that were between 6% and 18% MeHg. Generally, the highest MeHg concentrations were found in low-volume precipitation events (< 100 mL). At Tahquamenon Falls, meteorological analysis indicated that events with higher MeHg concentrations and %MeHg exceeding 6% were generally associated with lake effect precipitation and weak local winds.

From land to lake: Contrasting microbial processes across a Great Lakes gradient of organic carbon and inorganic nutrient inventories	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Freshwater aquatic biota receive carbon and nutrients from within the system as well as from the terrestrial environment in varying proportions. During 2010-2011, we examined seasonal changes in carbon and nutrient inventories, plankton community composition and metabolism along a land-to-lake gradient in a major western Michigan watershed at four interconnected habitats ranging from a small creek to offshore Lake Michigan. In all seasons Lake Michigan had significantly lower concentrations of CDOM and DOC than any of the other sites. Lake levels of nitrate were not significantly lower than tributaries other than Cedar Creek, and SRP was not measurable in any of the sites other than Cedar Creek. Bacterial production as % of GPP revealed a distinct land-to-lake gradient from an average of 448% in Cedar creek to 5% in Lake Michigan. Microbial activity in Cedar Creek (bacterial production 3-93 mu g C/L/d, and plankton respiration 9-193 mu g C/L/d) was generally higher than other sites. Muskegon Lake dominated GPP among the sites reaching a peak of >1000 mu g C/L/d during a fall Microcystis bloom. Offshore Lake Michigan had less variation in GPP and R than other sites, with GPP:R ratio close to 1 in all seasons but spring. Aquatic metabolism appears to be substantially subsidized by terrigenous inputs in the creek/river ecosystem with heterotrophy dominant over autotrophy. Autotrophy was maximized in the coastal/estuary "Goldilocks Zone" with longer residence times, whereas both autotrophy and heterotrophy were minimal but in near-balance in offshore waters receiving little subsidy from the land.

Therefore, identifying 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB)-producing cyanobacteria and predicting the risks of 2-MIB are critical for managing 2-MIB-infected water sources. Previous studies on the potential producers and risks of 2-MIB have focused on reservoirs or have been limited by the ecosystems of phytoplankton-dominated areas. We investigated the producers, distribution, and occurrence of 2-MIB in East Taihu Lake-a drinking water source-oriented shallow lake with macrophyte- and phytoplankton-dominated areas-from August 2020 to November 2021. We observed that Pseudanabaena sp. produces 2-MIB in this lake, as determined by the maximum correlation coefficient (R=0.71, p<0.001), maximum detection rate, and minimum false positive/negative ratio exhibited by this genus. Extreme odor events occurred in this lake during late summer and early autumn in 2021, with the mean 2-MIB concentration increasing to 727 +/- 426 ng/L and 369 +/- 176 ng/L in August and September, respectively. Moreover, the macrophyte-dominated area, particularly the wetland area, exhibited a significant decrease (p<0.01) in bloom intensity and 2-MIB production during these extreme odor events. Pseudanabaena sp. outbreak was likely owing to eutrophication, seasonal gradients, and macrophyte reduction, considering that temporal trends were consistent with high water temperature, high total phosphorus levels, and low-light conditions. Moreover, 2-MIB production was sensitive to short-term hydrometeorological processes, with high water levels and radiant intensity enhancing 2-MIB production. The risk assessment results showed that the probability of 2-MIB concentration exceeding the odor threshold (10 ng/L) is up to 90% when the cell density of Pseudanabaena sp. reaches 1.8x10(7) cell/L; this risk is reduced to 50 and 25% at densities of<3.8x10(5) cell/L and 5.6x10(4) cell/L, respectively. Our findings support calls for shallow lake management efforts to maintain a macrophyte-dominated state and control odorous cyanobacteria growth.

Quantifying stochastic and episodic nature of gas ebullition is complicated especially when conventionally conducted by using coverage-limited gas traps. Current knowledge of seasonality in a reservoir's gas ebullition is lacking in the literature. For this reason, advanced acoustic surveying was intensively applied to determine spatiotemporal distributions of gas ebullition in a European water-storage reservoir for two years. Additionally, the sampling was accompanied with gas collecting for analyzing gas composition. The gas released from the reservoir was primarily composed of CH4 (on average 52%, up to 94%). The longitudinal distribution of gas ebullition was mainly determined by a proximity to the river inflow as a source of organic matter. A magnitude of ebullitive fluxes within the reservoir varied up to 1,300 mL m(-2) d(-1) (30 mmol CH4 M-2 d(-1)). The most significant period of ebullition has turned out to be in fall, on average reaching a sevenfold ebullitive flux (70 mL m(-2) d(-1), 1.6 mmol CH4 M-2 d(-1)) higher than in the rest of the season. A substantial contribution to the fall peak was induced by an expansion of gas ebullition into greater depths, covering two thirds of the reservoir in late fall. The study demonstrates that the ebullitive fluxes of the temperate water storage reservoir were correlated to season, depth, and inflow proximity.

Increased water salinity negatively affects charophytes from a spring created within the Albufera de Valencia Natural Park	LIMNETICA												In 2007, a rice field was transformed into a zone that simulates the different habitats which were typical before the environmental crisis that the current Albufera de Valencia Natural Park experienced in the 70's, in order to increase the species and habitat richness. One of these recreated habitats was a spring a pond fed by groundwater. The spring was spontaneously covered with charophytes shortly after being flooded, and a community dominated by Chara hispida and Nitella hyalina remained, which were responsible for the maintenance of the clear-water state the spring exhibited. However, in recent years, there has been a sharp reduction in charophyte coverage and biomass. The values of some variables, which could have influenced this reduction, changed substantially over time. One of these variables was water salinity, which almost tripled in less than four years. In this study, the effects of increased salinity on the growth of charophytes and on the germination of fructifications (oospores and gyrogonites) were analysed to unravel whether a change in this variable could explain at least a part of the observed reduction of charophyte stands. Laboratory experiments were performed by applying two treatments, based on the use of water with different salinity levels, to the charophyte cultures (water collected from the spring in 2009, "Lower salinity", and in 2013, "Higher salinity"). The increase in salinity caused both a decrease in the elongation of the charophyte's main shoots and a reduction in weight in the higher salinity treatment. The decrease in growth was more pronounced in the more stenohaline species, N. hyalina. The stoichiometric composition of charophytes was also affected, depending on the salinity conditions and the species. At the end of the experiment, the means of percentage of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus were significantly lower under the "Higher salinity" treatment only for N. hyalina. Although there were no statistically significant differences in fructification germination with the salinity treatments, qualitative differences in germling size were observed. Without rejecting other factors that might have negatively affected, in a synergistic manner or individually, the development of the charophytes in the spring, it seemed that the increase in salinity was one of the involved factors.

In floodplain wetlands, seed banks may display seasonal dynamics that are influenced by seasonal flooding and temperature; however, seasonal dynamics remain poorly understood. Location: Two dominant macrophyte communities in the Dongting Lake wetlands, China. Methods: We investigated seed-bank densities, vertical distributions, and species richness of two dominant macrophyte communities in the Dongting Lake wetlands during November 2017 (after flooding), January (winter), March (spring), and May 2018 (before flooding). Results: Carex and Miscanthus community seed-bank densities peaked in May (15,307 and 17,330 individuals/m(2), respectively), decreased from November to March, and were the lowest in January (440 and 627 individuals/m(2), respectively). Carex and Miscanthus community seed-bank densities declined rapidly with soil depth during May from 13,414 and 16,535 individuals/m(2) in the 0-5 cm soil layer to 254 and 42 individuals/m(2) in the 10-20 cm soil layer, respectively. The species richness of Carex and Miscanthus community seed banks peaked during May (7 and 8 species, respectively). However, species similarity with extant communities was low (0.23 and 0.27, respectively). Conclusions: The results of this study emphasize the significance of seasons and stratification in the utilization of soil seed banks for floodplain wetland restoration. Supplementary measures such as bud banks and introduced seedlings should be adopted for the successful restoration of macrophyte communities because of the low density and richness of perennial species in seed banks.

Spatial and Temporal Distribution and Habitat Selection of Native Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout and Nonnative Utah Chub	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Henrys Lake, Idaho, is a renowned trophy trout fishery that faces an uncertain future following the establishment of Utah Chub (UTC) Gila atraria. Utah Chub were first documented in the lake in 1993 and have become abundant over the past two decades. Little is known about the ecology of UTC, but they typically have negative effects on salmonids in systems where they have been introduced. We sought to fill knowledge gaps in UTC ecology and provide insight on potential interactions with Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout (YCT) Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri. Ninety-four YCT and 95 UTC were radio-tagged in spring 2019 and 2020 to better understand potential interactions between YCT and UTC in Henrys Lake. Fish were located via mobile tracking and fixed receivers from June to December 2019 and 2020. In June of both years, YCT and UTC were concentrated in nearshore habitats. As water temperatures increased, UTC were documented in deeper water (mean +/- SD = 3.6 +/- 1.4 m) and YCT became more concentrated in areas with cold water (e.g., mouths of tributaries, in-lake springs). In July and August, large congregations of UTC were observed. Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout were detected in tributaries from June to August, but no UTC were detected in the tributaries. By late fall (November-December), YCT were located along the shoreline and UTC were detected in the middle of the lake. Both YCT and UTC were observed in areas with dense vegetation. Macrophytes likely provided a food source for UTC and cover from predators for both species. Locations of YCT were negatively related to warm water temperatures, whereas UTC were positively associated with warm water temperatures. Results from this research fill knowledge gaps in UTC and YCT interactions as well as provide valuable insight on the ecology of UTC and adfluvial Cutthroat Trout populations. Furthermore, distribution patterns and habitat selectivity of YCT and UTC in Henrys Lake can be used to inform management decisions for fishery improvement and YCT conservation.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				AUG	2022	42	4					939	951		10.1002/nafm.10780	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10780		JUN 2022											WOS:000812897700001

Adaptive responses of energy storage and fish life histories to climatic gradients	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY												Energy storage is a common adaptation of fish living in seasonal environments. For some species, the energy accumulated during the growing season, and stored primarily as lipids, is crucial to preventing starvation mortality over winter. Thus, in order to understand the adaptive responses of fish life history to climate, it is important to determine how energy should be allocated to storage and how it trades off with the other body components that contribute to fitness. In this paper, we extend previous life history theory to include an explicit representation of how the seasonal allocation of energy to storage acts as a constraint on fish growth. We show that a strategy that privileges allocation to structural mass in the first part of the growing season and switches to storage allocation later on, as observed empirically in several fish species, is the strategy that maximizes growth efficiency and hence is expected to be favored by natural selection. Stochastic simulations within this theoretical framework demonstrate that the relative performance of this switching strategy is robust to a wide range of fluctuations in growing season length, and to moderate short-term (i.e., daily) fluctuations in energy intake and/or expenditure within the growing season. We then integrate this switching strategy with a biphasic growth modeling framework to predict typical growth rates of walleye Sander vitreus, a cool water species, and lake trout Salvelinus namaycush, a cold water specialist, across a climatic gradient in North America. As predicted, growth rates increased linearly with the duration of the growing season. Regression line intercepts were negative, indicating that growth can only occur when growing season length exceeds a threshold necessary to produce storage for winter survival. The model also reveals important differences between species, showing that observed growth rates of lake trout are systematically higher than those of walleye in relatively colder lakes. This systematic difference is consistent with both (i) the expected superior capacity of lake trout to withstand harsh winter conditions, and (ii) some degree of counter gradient adaptation of lake trout growth capacity to the climatic gradient covered by our data.

Around 9.6 Ma, changes in sediments are recorded from the red soil-dominated interval of the upper Aka Aiteputh Formation to the lacustrine and deltaic facies of the lower Namurungule Formation, containing open woodland/savanna mammalian fauna. These reveal a shift from a dry climate with seasonal precipitation to a climate with strong seasonality. In particular, an increase in precipitation was recorded by the predominance of lacustrine facies. This shift happened at around the same time as the intensification of the Indian summer monsoon that has been detected in the Himalayas and some of surrounding regions. There are two scenarios that could explain the increased precipitation at the beginning of the deposition of the Namurungule Formation: (1) enhanced moisture transport by the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), synchronized with Indian summer monsoon intensification, or (2) intensification of the Indian summer monsoon itself, permitting moisture to penetrate deep into East Africa if the altitude of the rifted area was lower than it is now. Presently, the former is considered to be the more plausible explanation for the climate shift detected in the Samburu Hills.

Scanning reflectance spectroscopy (380-730 nm): a novel method for quantitative high-resolution climate reconstructions from minerogenic lake sediments	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												High-resolution (annual to sub-decadal) quantitative reconstructions of climate variables are needed from a variety of paleoclimate archives across the world to place current climate change in the context of long-term natural climate variability. Rapid, high-resolution, non-destructive scanning techniques are required to produce such high-resolution records from lake sediments. In this study we explored the potential of scanning reflectance spectroscopy (VIS-RS; 380-730 nm) to produce quantitative summer temperature reconstructions from minerogenic sediments of proglacial, annually laminated Lake Silvaplana, in the eastern Swiss Alps. The scanning resolution was 2 mm, which corresponded to sediment deposition over 1-2 years. We found correlations up to r = 0.84 (p < 0.05) for the calibration period 1864-1950, between six reflectance-dependent variables and summer (JJAS) temperature. These reflectance-dependent variables (e.g. slope of the reflectance 570/630 nm, indicative of illite, biotite and chlorite; minimum reflectance at 690 nm indicative of chlorite) indicate the mineralogical composition of the clastic sediments, which is, in turn, related to climate in the catchment of this particular proglacial lake. We used multiple linear regression (MLR) to establish a calibration model that explains 84% of the variance of summer (JJAS) temperature during the calibration period 1864-1950. We then applied the calibration model downcore to develop a quantitative summer temperature reconstruction extending back to AD 1177. This temperature reconstruction is in good agreement with two independent temperature reconstructions based on documentary data that extend back to AD 1500 and tree ring data that extend back to AD 1177. This study confirms the great potential of in situ scanning reflectance spectroscopy as a novel non-destructive technique to rapidly acquire high-resolution quantitative paleoclimate information from minerogenic lake sediments.

The case of the spongy moth (Lymantria dispar dispar)	FOOD WEBS												Invasive species can achieve incredibly high densities in invaded ecosystems, introducing a novel resource base for willing consumers. Hyperabundant invaders in one ecosystem that spillover into adjacent ecosystems (e.g. terrestrial to aquatic) create new opportunities for multichannel omnivory, whereby generalist consumers feed on prey from different trophic levels and ecosystems. However, our understanding of how invasive organisms originating in one ecosystem are utilized by consumers in adjacent ecosystems remains poorly studied. The spongy moth (Lymantria dispar dispar; LDD) is an invasive invertebrate that exhibits cyclical hyperabundance, with larvae defoliating millions of hectares of deciduous forest during regular outbreaks in eastern North America. We sought to determine if larval LDD could represent an impactful spring and early summer resource for native fish species during years of high larval abundance. Here, we quantified the diets of pond-dwelling largemouth bass (Micropterus nigricans) and pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus) during 2020 and 2021 respectively, two historic outbreak years for LDD in Ontario, Canada. Both pumpkinseed and largemouth bass failed to exhibit meaningful exploitation of LDD larvae, regardless of their overwhelming abundance. Of 315 pumpkinseed sampled across four pond populations from April to August of 2021, only two contained individual LDD larvae. Of the 82 largemouth bass sampled in June 2020, only 1 individual contained a single LDD larvae. Serendipitously, we discovered one pumpkinseed population relied heavily on a different invasive terrestrial invertebrate, the earthworm (60% of all pumpkinseed stomach contents by mass in early spring). Though hyperabundant LDD larvae appeared to be largely avoided by fish predators, a less well-defended invasive invertebrate (earthworms) acted as a terrestrial subsidy for a native fish. Despite LDD larvae not being consumed by fish, the replacement of leaf litter with the carcasses and frass of LDD larvae could represent an important modification to detrital food webs in ponds and lakes. Thus, understanding how invasive species impact both resident consumers and nutrient cycling will be critical for the appropriate management of invasive species and their resident food webs moving forward.

J	MULLER, R; MENG, HJ				MULLER, R; MENG, HJ			PAST AND PRESENT STATE OF THE ICHTHYOFAUNA OF LAKE LUGANO	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The evolution of the ichthyofauna of Lake Lugano (Lago di Lugano) during the past 120 years is characterized by the introduction of eight new fish species and by the possibly natural addition of the blenny (Blennius fluviatilis) in recent years. Introduced Salmonids such as charr (Salvelinus alpinus) and whitefish (Coregonus sp.) have established strong populations during the first half of this century, but have declined drastically thereafter. Likewise, the population of the native shad (Alosa fallax lacustris) has diminished significantly. A hydroacoustic survey of the pelagic fish stock of Lake Lugano in 1989 revealed the presence of a dense bleak (Alburnus albidus) population at 0 to 14 m depth. No other fish were found to be present in the pelagic zone. Oxygen and temperature distributions seem to confine the bleak to the uppermost layer in summer. In winter, very few fish were located by echosounding. Growth of bleak and roach (Rutilus rubilio) was difficult to interpret since data for comparison are lacking. Growth of perch (Perca fluviatilis) in the littoral zone was found to be slower than in other eutrophic lakes, for no obvious reason. Possible ways of restructuring the pelagic fish community are discussed.																			1015-1621						1992	54	3-4					338	350		10.1007/BF00878146	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00878146													WOS:A1992KD90400012
J	Pothoven, SA; Vanderploeg, HA				Pothoven, Steven A.; Vanderploeg, Henry A.			Factors leading to coexistence of Bosmina longirostris and Daphnia galeata mendotae in offshore Lake Michigan	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Declining numbers of planktivorous fish and a shift toward oligotrophy in offshore Lake Michigan was expected to favor Daphnia over Bosmina. To evaluate this hypothesis, the seasonal and inter-annual demographics of co-existing populations of Bosmina longirostris and Daphnia galeata mendotae in offshore Lake Michigan were evaluated during 2008-2016. Overall, D. g. mendotae composed 69% of the herbivorous cladocerans, but seasonal abundance varied so that early in the growing season, B longirostris were usually the most abundant species, whereas D. g. mendotae abundance peaked in September or October. Egg ratios (for adults) and birth rates for both species peaked during July-August, with overall mean egg ratios of 2.76 and 0.82 and overall birth rates of 0.09 and 0.06 for D. g. mendotae and B. longirostris, respectively. Egg ratios peaked before epilimnetic chlorophyll concentrations, which peaked in October or November. Birth rates declined in late summer/early fall, coinciding with declining egg ratios, decreasing water temperatures, and the onset of resting egg production. Predation requirements of Bythotrephes on both cladocerans was relatively high at times each year, and generally coincided or followed the peak period of production for both species. Low vertebrate planktivore abundance, higher egg ratios, and higher birth rates appear to facilitate the dominance of D. g. mendotae over B. longirostris despite high predation requirements on both species by Bythotrephes. However, high abundance early in the season before D. g. mendotae became abundant provided a mechanism for B. longirostris to co-exist with D. g. mendotae in the offshore of Lake Michigan.

John B.; Boomer, Ian; Chen, Jianhui; An, Chengbang; Wuennemann, Bernd			Holocene moisture evolution in arid central Asia and its out-of-phase relationship with Asian monsoon history	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We synthesize palaeoclimate records from the mid-latitude arid Asian region dominated today by the Westerlies ("arid central Asia" (ACA)) to evaluate spatial and temporal patterns of moisture changes during the Holocene. Sediment records from I I takes with reliable chronologies and robust proxies were selected to reconstruct moisture histories based on a five-class ordinal wetness index with assigned scores from the driest to wettest periods at individual sites for 200-year time slices. The proxies used in these records include pollen and diatom assemblages, sediment lithology, lake levels, and geochemistry (mainly isotope) data. The results of our synthesis show that ACA as a whole experienced synchronous and coherent moisture changes during the Holocene, namely a dry early Holocene, a wetter (less dry) early to mid-Holocene, and a moderately wet late Holocene. During the early Holocene most of the lakes experienced very low water levels and even dried out before ca 8 ka (1 ka = 1000cal a BP). Hence the effective-moisture history in ACA is out-of-phase with that in monsoonal Asia as documented by numerous palaeoclimate records. In monsoonal Asia, a strong summer monsoon and humid climate characterized the early Holocene, and a weakened summer monsoon and drier climate prevailed during the late Holocene, which were mainly controlled by changes in low-latitude summer insolation. In contrast, we propose that the pattern of Holocene effective-moisture evolution in the westerly dominated ACA was mainly determined by North Atlantic sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) and high-latitude air temperatures that affect the availability, amount and transport of water vapor. Also, topography of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent Asian highlands could have contributed to the intensification of dry climate in ACA during the early Holocene, as a result of strengthening the subsidence of dry air masses, associated with stronger uplift motion on the plateau by intense heating under a stronger summer insolation. Summer insolation might have played a key role in directly controlling moisture conditions in ACA but only after the northern hemisphere ice-sheets had disappeared in the mid- and late Holocene.

J	McGregor, GB; Rasmussen, JP				McGregor, Glenn B.; Rasmussen, J. Paul			Cyanobacterial composition of microbial mats from an Australian thermal spring: a polyphasic evaluation	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Cyanobacterial composition of microbial mats from an alkaline thermal spring issuing at 43-71 degrees C from tropical north-eastern Australia are described using a polyphasic approach. Eight genera and 10 species from three cyanobacterial orders were identified based on morphological characters. These represented taxa previously known as thermophilic from other continents. Ultrastructural analysis of the tower mats revealed two filamentous morphotypes contributed the majority of the biomass. Both types had ultrastructural characteristics of the family Pseudanabaenaceae. DNA extracts were made from sections of the tentaculiform towers and the microbial community analysed by 16S cyanobacteria-specific PCR and denaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis. Five significant bands were identified and sequenced. Two bands clustered closely with Oscillatoria amphigranulata isolated from New Zealand hot springs; one unique phylotype had only moderate similarity to a range of Leptolyngbya species; and one phylotype was closely related to a number of Geitlerinema species. Generally the approaches yielded complementary information, however the results suggest that species designation based on morphological and ultrastructural criteria alone often fails to recognize their true phylogenetic position. Conversely some molecular techniques may fail to detect rare taxa suggesting that the widest possible suite of techniques be applied when conducting analyses of cyanobacterial diversity of natural populations. This is the first polyphasic evaluation of thermophilic cyanobacterial communities from the Australian continent.

However, the influence of such fluctuations on phosphorus cycling in sediments has rarely been investigated. We conducted a geochemical investigation on the phosphorus cycle in a shallow freshwater lake, Dongting Lake; under the influence of human activities and climate change, its water regime undergoes drastic changes. Irrespective of the permanent inundation zone (PIZ) or seasonal inundation zone (SIZ), the phosphorus cycle in sediments was found to be dominated by the reductive dissolution of iron (Fe) (oxyhydr)oxides, degradation of organic matters, and conversion between authigenic phosphorus (Ca-P) and detrital phosphorus in individual seasons. From winter to summer, with increasing water level, the content of Fe-bound phosphorus and organic phosphorus increase due to the deposition of suspended matter, thus increasing total phosphorus in PIZ. Moreover, the rising water level also reduces the dissolved oxygen content and promotes the reductive dissolution of Fe (oxyhydr)oxides. The mineralization of increased organic matter can release CO2 and reduce pH in the vicinity, which can further result in the acidic dissolution of detrital apatite. In turn, most of the released phosphorus can be adsorbed or co-precipitated with calcium minerals, resulting in the significant increase of Ca-P. The mechanisms of phosphorus transformation in SIZ are similar to those in PIZ, but most of the increased organic matter and total P in a core from SIZ are attributable to the decomposition of plant matter. Therefore, the water level rise not only changes the conservative speciation of phosphorus in sediments to active speciation, but also triggers the release of phosphorus adsorbed to oxides and further increases the risk of phosphorus release from sediments to overlying water. Thus, our findings have major implications for freshwater shallow lakes and their P driven productivity. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

This lake was aerated for 2 consecutive summers (1973 and 1974). Although reductions in hypolimnetic P concentrations appeared in the 1st summer, they failed to reappear during the 2nd summer. NH4-N and NO3-N concentrations are compared with those in an unaerated control lake, Lake Oscaleta (New York). Very slight changes in relative hypolimnetic NH4-N concentrations and corresponding increases in hypolimnetic NO3-N concentrations are seen. The aerated lake may be subjected to substantial external loading, which may mask aeration effects on the internal nutrient cycles.																			0043-1397	1944-7973					1977	13	2					343	347		10.1029/WR013i002p00343	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/WR013i002p00343													WOS:A1977DD92000017
J	Sun, L; Liang, XZ; Xia, M				Sun, Lei; Liang, Xin-Zhong; Xia, Meng			Developing the Coupled CWRF-FVCOM Modeling System to Understand and Predict Atmosphere-Watershed Interactions Over the Great Lakes Region	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS												Coupling 3-D hydrodynamics with climate models is necessary but difficult for resolving multiscale interactions and has been rarely implemented in predicting Great Lakes' water level fluctuations because of issues in treating net basin supply (NBS) components and connecting channel flows. This study developed an interactive lake-atmosphere-hydrology modeling system by coupling the regional Climate-Weather Research and Forecasting model (CWRF) with the 3-D unstructured-grid Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) in the Great Lakes region. The sensitivity of the coupled system, relative to the CWRF baseline using the 1-D Lake, Ice, Snow and Sediment Simulator (LISSS), was evaluated in representing lake-climate conditions during 1999-2015 against observations. As coupled with CWRF, FVCOM outperformed LISSS in simulating water surface temperature, ice cover, and vertical thermal structure at seasonal to interannual scales for all the five lakes and realistically reproduced the regional circulation patterns. In warm seasons, the improved lake conditions significantly corrected LISSS overestimates of surface air temperature together with larger-scale circulation changes. Consequently, precipitation was generally reduced over each lake basin, mainly because of decreased surface moisture and heat fluxes along with enhanced atmospheric stability. Through the dynamic coupling, FVCOM predicts the water level fluctuations in direct response to the CWRF NBS components and connecting channel flows based on a stage-fall-discharge formulation. This coupled CWRF-FVCOM reasonably captured the NBS variations and predicted the water level fluctuations for Lakes Superior and Michigan-Huron. It represents a major advance in interacting regional climate and watershed processes to dynamically predict Great Lakes' water level seasonal-interannual variations. Plain Language Summary Coupling 3-D hydrodynamics with climate models is necessary but difficult for resolving multiscale interactions and has been rarely implemented in predicting Great Lakes' water level fluctuations because of issues in treating net basin supply (NBS) components and connecting channel flows. We developed an interactive lake-atmosphere- hydrology modeling system by coupling the regional Climate-Weather Research and Forecasting model (CWRF) with the 3-D unstructured-grid Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) and compared it with the baseline CWRF configured with 1-D lake model to understand how 3-D hydrodynamic processes affect the prediction of the lake and regional climate conditions. The coupled CWRF-FVCOM system significantly improved the simulation of all the five lakes' conditions at seasonal to interannual scales and realistically reproduced the regional circulation patterns. Our analysis also explained the processes that are associated with such sensitivity. Furthermore, as a unique contribution to the literature, we constructed FVCOM to dynamically predict the water level fluctuations in direct response to the coupled CWRF NBS components and connecting channel flows based on a stage-fall-discharge formulation. This coupled CWRF-FVCOM system represents a major advance in interacting regional climate and watershed processes to dynamically predict Great Lakes' water level seasonal-interannual variations.					; Liang, Xin-Zhong/B-3561-2014	Sun, Lei/0000-0003-0328-2042; Liang, Xin-Zhong/0000-0002-5047-3135; 														1942-2466				DEC	2020	12	12							e2020MS002319	10.1029/2020MS002319	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020MS002319													WOS:000603662500023

Features of Temporal Variability of the Concentrations of Gaseous Trace Pollutants in the Air of the Urban and Rural Areas in the Southern Baikal Region (East Siberia, Russia)	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL												This article presents the results of the automatic monitoring of the concentrations of gaseous impurities of sulfur and nitrogen oxides in the ground-level atmosphere of the urban and rural areas in the Southern Baikal region (East Siberia, Russia). The study was conducted from 2020 to 2023 at the urban Irkutsk station and the rural Listvyanka station located at a distance of 70 km from each other. We calculated the main statistical characteristics of the variations in the concentrations of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide in the ground-level atmosphere and determined a nature of variability in their concentrations on various time scales: annual, weekly, and daily. Annual variabilities of gaseous pollutants in the ground-level atmosphere above the Irkutsk city and the Listvyanka settlement were similar and showed the highest values in winter and the lowest in summer. The daily and weekly dynamics of the nitrogen oxide concentrations in the urban area clearly depended on the increase in the road traffic during rush hours (morning and evening). In the rural area, there was no such dependence. In this area, the daily and weekly variability in the concentrations of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide mainly depended on natural meteorological processes. The work systematizes the meteorological parameters at which the largest amount of anthropogenic impurities enters the air basin of Lake Baikal. The maximum values of acid-forming gas concentrations were observed when the air masses were transferred from the northwest direction, which corresponds to the location of sources in the territory of the Irkutsk-Cheremkhovo industrial hub-the largest concentration of anthropogenic objects in the Irkutsk region.					obolkin, Vladimir/T-3884-2018; Molozhnikova, Yelena/AAD-4552-2022; Shikohvtsev, Maxim/AAD-4891-2022; Potemkin, Vladimir/GQH-5906-2022	Potemkin, Vladimir/0000-0002-5889-8517; Lutskin, Evgene/0009-0007-4078-2165														2076-3417				SEP	2024	14	18							8327	10.3390/app14188327	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app14188327													WOS:001323839100001

Chemical mixing in the bottom boundary layer of a eutrophic reservoir: The effects of internal seiching on nitrogen dynamics	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												In lakes and reservoirs, the bottom boundary layer (BBL) mediates chemical fluxes between sediments and the overlying water column. At the internal shoreline, where the thermocline contacts the lakebed, the motions of internal waves can create fluctuating redox conditions and dynamic physical forcing that may support ecologically important reactions such as denitrification. We characterized physical and chemical dynamics within the internal shoreline of a eutrophic reservoir during the spring and early summer of 2012 (18 May to 18 July). An internal seiche was found to generate quasi-periodic fluctuations (periods about 12-24 h) in BBL stratification, temperature, and redox conditions. To examine possible implications for chemical mixing and microbial processing, differences between vertically offset, simultaneous BBL measurements of velocity, temperature, N-2, and N2O were made over 23 h. Vertical differences in BBL temperature, N-2, and N2O formed and collapsed during the wave cycle, with the largest differences occurring following the arrival of an internal bore. Through much of the wave cycle, chemical differences were explained by physical advection and mixing. However, chemical differences measured after bore arrival were not explained by advection, possibly owing to local production of N-2 and N2O. These results highlight the dynamic physical environment within the internal shoreline, and the potential of this zone to contribute to system wide denitrification and nitrous oxide production.					; Harrison, John/F-2280-2011	Deemer, Bridget/0000-0002-5845-1002; Harrison, John/0000-0002-0677-5478													0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	2015	60	5					1642	1655		10.1002/lno.10125	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10125													WOS:000362227500013
J	Bégin, Y				Bégin, Y			Reconstruction of subarctic lake levees over past centuries using tree rings	JOURNAL OF COLD REGIONS ENGINEERING					International Workshop on River Environment Considering Hydraulic and Hydrologic Phenomena in Snowy and Cold Regions	MAR 20-24, 2000	QUEBEC CITY, CANADA	Sci & Technol Agcy, Japan Int Sci & Technol Exchange Ctr, Hydro-Quebec				This paper presents the dendrochronological markers used to date the erosive activity of ice and waves on the shores of two large lakes in Northern Quebec. Damages to trees are dated by detailed analysis of anomalous tree rings in response to the shore geomorphic activity associated with extreme water levels over the last 2 centuries. Spring floods are dated using ice scars on trees and shrubs. Lake ice breakup occurs 4-6 weeks after snowmelt. Marks on trees made by ice displaced by the wind indicate the flood levels. Once ice breakup is complete, waves erode forest edges. Tree tilting, dated by counting rings in compression wood, mark high lake levels at the beginning of summer. At submerged sites that are not subject to waves and ice, stress related to prolonged submersion results in narrow tree rings. Trees located in the immersion rone show narrow rings compared to wider rings in unsubmerged trees. However. tree response is not immediate; they can primarily respond to sequences of several consecutive years of stress, reducing the resolution of dating to 2-3 years. Rings of submerged trees are denser than average. These high water level markers, as well as population recruitment showed by the age structure of shoreline trees and shrubs, which establish during intercalary years of low water levels, were used to date the extreme levels of two large lakes at the interface between the upper boreal and subarctic regions in northeastern Canada. During the past 200 years, the annual extreme levels have been increasing, becoming even more pronounced in the 1930s, and may be due to a century-long increase in snow precipitation. The summers seem to be drier. The 1930s, 1950s, and 1970s were marked by a high frequency of high water levels. Intercalary periods of low water levels allowed regeneration of shoreline forests and recovery of trees damaged during these events. It appears that episodes similar to the recent period of low waters experienced in the American northeast since 1982 may have occurred in the past during the 1920s, 1940s, and 1960s.																			0887-381X	1943-5495				DEC	2000	14	4					192	212		10.1061/(ASCE)0887-381X(2000)14:4(192)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0887-381X(2000)14:4(192)													WOS:000165390800004

There was a clear interdecadal increase in summer precipitation over the Tianshan mountains during the time period 1961-2016, with lower precipitation from 1961 to 1990 and higher precipitation from 1993 to 2016. The sea surface temperature anomalies in the high-latitude northwest Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea are partly responsible for the interdecadal variability of precipitation in the Tianshan mountains. The warmer sea surface temperature anomalies in these two regions excite a positive anomaly of geopotential height over the northwest Atlantic and to the north of the Mediterranean Sea, respectively, synergistically modulating the downstream atmospheric circulation near Lake Baikal via the eastward dispersion of Rossby wave energy originating from the northwest Atlantic via the Black Sea. As a result, an interdecadal increase in geopotential height has occurred near Lake Baikal since the 1990s. Corresponding to this interdecadal increase in geopotential height, an anomalous anticyclone appeared near Lake Baikal during 1993-2016, inducing an anomalous easterly flow over the Tianshan mountains. This anomalous easterly flow caused an interdecadal decrease in the eastward export of water vapor on the eastern boundary of the Tianshan mountain region, resulting in an interdecadal increase in the total water vapor budget over the mountains. This has facilitated the interdecadal increase in summer precipitation over the Tianshan mountains since the 1990s.

The causes and features of the current warming and humidification and their impact on surface water resources are also discussed. This study found that since 1961, the average temperature in the Yellow River's upper reaches has increased at a rate of 0.37 degrees C/10a, which is more significant than the increases observed for the world, China, and even northwest China in the same period. At the beginning of this century, the rate of change in precipitation in the Yellow River's upper reaches reversed direction from decreasing to increasing, with a significant increase (35 mm/10a) since 2000. Therefore, climate change has shown a significant warming and humidification trend in the upper reaches of the Yellow River. From the dynamic change perspective, the Yellow River's upper reaches were warming and drying in each climatic period from 1961 to 2010; however, the tendency towards dryness slowed period by period. In contrast, the region showed consistent warming and humidification from 1991 to 2020. From the perspective of multiple time scales, the change in average temperature is mainly dominated by the multi-decadal scale. In contrast, precipitation is dominated by interannual change. The increase in the multi-decadal component in average temperature and precipitation explains the current warming and humidification. Precipitation changes in the upper reaches of the Yellow River Basin are mainly affected by the westerly circulation, the East Asian summer monsoon, and the South Asian summer monsoon circulation systems. However, precipitation was affected by different circulation factors on different time scales. On an interannual scale, it was mainly affected by the South Asian summer monsoon circulation. On an interdecadal scale, it was mainly affected by the westerly wind and the East Asian summer monsoon circulation. On a multi-decadal scale, it was jointly influenced by the westerly wind, the East Asian summer monsoon, and the South Asian summer monsoon circulation. Under the control of multi-decadal synergistic enhancement of the westerly, the East Asian summer monsoon, and the South Asian summer monsoon circulations, the vertical field shows an abnormal upward movement. There has been a significant abnormal easterly and southerly airflow that transports water vapour, and cold air is transported along the northwest airflow at the back of the Mongolian cyclone, which makes the climate in the upper reaches of the Yellow River more humid. The warming and humidifying of the upper reaches of the Yellow River has significantly increased runoff and lake area and significantly degraded the frozen soil. The surface water budget in the Yellow River's upper reaches has significantly responded to the current warming and humidification. The actual surface evapotranspiration and surface runoff increased significantly, but the net surface water budget still showed a decreasing trend. The increase in precipitation did not change the surface water deficit.					岳, 平/GWC-4881-2022; Liu, Zhipeng/IUM-2978-2023; Wang, Pengling/B-5991-2017	wang, haoyu/0009-0001-2467-5331													0899-8418	1097-0088				DEC 30	2023	43	16					7667	7681		10.1002/joc.8286	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.8286		NOV 2023											WOS:001108545400001

Puddle Valley, Utah,just west of the Great Salt Lake, typifies areas of extensive shrub loss in which density decreased from over 12,000 ha-1 to less than 200 ha-1. We analyzed vegetation along a radial transect established in the bottom of Puddle Valley in 1987. Mortality was greatest at the lowest elevations where shrubs were initially most dense. These sites occurred where soil moisture, fine-textured soils, and bulk density were greatest of all sites evaluated. Soil was most saline at the margins of the valley bottom. Higher densities of live shadscale occurred where slopes are greater, soil is more droughty, and soil moisture was lower during the 3 years of data collection. The die-off "front" continued about 5 km to the west of the valley center in 1989. Refugia of live shadscale populations were found where soil salinities were higher. Population dynamics of annuals, including summer-cypress (Kochia scoparia [L.] Schrader), cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.), and halogeton (Halogeton glomeratus [Bieb.] C.A.

A high-resolution (1 km) dust enhancement product was generated to produce maps of dust point sources (DPS), indicating geographical locations of the observed dust emissions, and gridded data sets of dust emission frequencies. About 13,500 DPS were detected over an area of similar to 5 x 10(6) km(2), however, their distribution was uneven. The highest frequency of DPS occurred in the northern and eastern Taklimakan, in the Aralkum, and in the regions, which were not widely reported in literature before, the Balkh delta in northern Afghanistan and the pre-Aral, from the northern Caspian coast to the Betpak-Dala desert in Kazakhstan. South of the Aral, DPS were mainly associated with fluvial features: drying lakes, dry river beds, alluvial deposits and agricultural activity which is closely linked to water availability in this arid region. In the pre-Aral and Balkhash-Junggar regions, land damaged by wildfire was the main source of dust. In China and eastern Kazakhstan dust emissions peaked in spring; in Central Asia and western Kazakhstan-in summer. The Aralkum was active throughout the year with a positive trend in emission frequency over the study period. Locations of DPS did not always correlate with high atmospheric optical depth (AOD) particularly west of the Aral and in the southern Taklimakan where few DPS were detected despite the high AOD values. This was attributed to dust transport from the upwind sources.					; Shahgedanova, Maria/D-3900-2011; Shahgedanova, Maria/AAU-6231-2020	White, Kevin/0000-0002-4328-8185; Shahgedanova, Maria/0000-0002-2320-3885; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				FEB 27	2021	126	4							e2020JD033382	10.1029/2020JD033382	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JD033382													WOS:000624348900051

How do data collection and processing methods impact the accuracy of long-term trend estimation in lake surface-water temperatures?	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												Identifying significant changes across lake ecosystems is important for understanding impacts of global environmental change. Synthesizing data on lake warming trends is challenging because individual lake datasets differ in the: (1) length of the time series available for analysis and (2) frequency of data collection (e.g., daily vs. monthly observations). This study aimed to address how dataset length, frequency of data collection, and strength of temperature trends could impact both the accuracy of summer surface-water temperature trends and their statistical significance. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we found that accuracy in trend estimates and the ability to recover statistically significant trends were both directly related to trend strength, dataset length, and sampling frequency. To consistently retrieve statistically significant trend estimates that deviated < 25% from the true values, 30-yr datasets with high warming rates (>= 0.75 degrees C decade(-1)) were required. These findings have important implications for efforts to analyze lake temperature trends, as the characteristics of many existing datasets fall within a range where our simulations predict low accuracy in trend estimates as well as a low probability of achieving statistical significance. Longer datasets are needed to accurately estimate warming trends and evaluate drivers of lake surface-temperature changes, highlighting the need to support existing long-term monitoring projects occurring across the globe, and to encourage updates to remotely sensed lake temperature datasets.

This shrub strip acted as an ecological corridor enhancing the movements of birds between the forest and the littoral reed zone. The number of individuals of non-littoral species that visited the reed zone was higher (p < .001) on the area with the connecting shrub strip in autumn but the number of species visiting the littoral zone was not significantly higher. Significantly more (p < .001) autumn movements by birds in the continuous area were oriented along paths between the forest and the littoral zone whereas movements in the discontinuous area paralleled the littoral and forest zones (p < .001). Movements of birds were concentrated along the edge of the shrub strip. The spatial configuration of the landscape facilitated access by some forest birds to the littoral habitat.																			0921-2973					JUL	1990	4	2-3					99	108		10.1007/BF00132854	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00132854													WOS:A1990EV85700003
J	Li, Y; Morrill, C				Li, Yu; Morrill, Carrie			Multiple factors causing Holocene lake-level change in monsoonal and arid central Asia as identified by model experiments	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Lake-level records provide a rich resource of information about past changes in effective moisture, but water-balance fluctuations can be driven by a number of different climate variables and it is often difficult to pinpoint their exact cause. This understanding is essential, however, for reconciling divergent paleo-records or for making predictions about future lake-level variations. This research uses a series of models, the NCAR CCSM3, a lake energy-balance and a lake water-balance model, to examine the reasons for lake-level changes in monsoonal Asia and arid central Asia between the early (8.5 ka), middle (6.0 ka) and late (ca. 1800 AD) Holocene. Our results indicate that the components of the lake water balance responsible for lake-level changes varied by region and through time. High lake levels at 8.5 and 6.0 ka in the monsoon region were caused by the combined effects of low lake evaporation and high precipitation. The low lake evaporation resulted from low winter solar radiation and high summer cloud cover. Precipitation associated with the mid-latitude westerlies increased from the early to middle Holocene and maintained high lake levels throughout most of arid central Asia ca. 6 ka. The modeled evolution of lake level in arid central Asia from the mid to late Holocene was spatially heterogeneous, due to different sensitivities of the northern and southern parts of the region to seasonally-changing insolation, particularly regarding the duration of lake ice cover. The model results do not suggest that precipitation and lake evaporation changes compete with one another in forcing lake-level change, as has been hypothesized.

The lake has no surface outlet, but despite high evaporation rates it maintains dilute waters by subsurface seepage through permeable sediments and faulted lavas. New geochemical analyses (major ions, trace elements) of the river, lake, and hot spring waters and the suspended sediments have been made to determine the main controls of lake water quality. The results show that evaporative concentration and the binary mixing between two end members (rivers and thermal waters) can explain the hydrochemistry of the lake waters. Two zones are recognized from water composition. The southern part of the lake near sites of perennial river inflow is weakly influenced by evaporation, has low total dissolved species (TDS), and has a seasonally variable load of mainly detrital suspended sediments. In contrast, waters of the northern part of the lake show evidence for strong evaporation (TDS of up to eight times inflow). Authigenic clay minerals and calcite may be precipitating from those more concentrated fluids. The subaerial hot-spring waters have a distinctive chemistry and are enriched in some elements that are also present in the lake water. Comparison of the chemical composition of the inflowing surface waters and lake water shows (1) an enrichment of some species (HCO3-, Cl, SO42-, F, Na, B, V, Cr, As, Mo, Ba and U) in the lake, (2) a depletion in SiO2 in the lake, and (3) a possible hydrothermal origin for most F. The rare earth element distribution and the F/Cl and Na/Cl ratios give valuable information on the rate of mixing of the river and hydrothermal fluids in the lake water. Calculations imply that thermal fluids may be seeping upward locally into the lake through grid-faulted lavas, particularly south of 01 Kokwe Island.

These lakes are permanently stratified with an oxygenated freshwater layer (mixolimnion) overlying a saline, anoxic water column (monimolimnion). The physical and chemical properties of the deepest known lake of this type in the circumpolar Arctic, Lake A, on the far northern coast of Ellesmere Island, Canada, have been studied over the last 15 years, but little is known about the lake's biological communities. We applied high-throughput sequencing of the V4 region of the 18S ribosomal RNA gene to investigate the protist communities down the water column at three sampling times: under the ice at the end of winter in 2008, during an unusual period of warming and ice-out the same year, and again under the ice in mid-summer 2009. Sequences of many protist taxa occurred throughout the water column at all sampling times, including in the deep anoxic layer where growth is highly unlikely. Furthermore, there were sequences for taxonomic groups including diatoms and marine taxa, which have never been observed in Lake A by microscopic analysis. However, the sequences of other taxa such as ciliates, chrysophytes, Cercozoa, and Telonema varied with depth, between years and during the transition to ice-free conditions. These seasonally active taxa in the surface waters of the lake are thus sensitive to depth and change with time. DNA from these taxa is superimposed upon background DNA from multiple internal and external sources that is preserved in the deep, cold, largely anoxic water column.

Stable isotope mass balance of the Laurentian Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We investigate the physical limnology of the Laurentian Great Lakes of North America using a new dataset of O-18/O-16 and H-2/H-1 ratios from over 500 water samples collected at multiple depths from 75 stations during spring and summer of 2007. 6(18)O and delta H-2 values of each lake plot in distinct clusters along a trend parallel to, but offset from, the Global Meteoric Water Line, reflecting the combined effects of evaporative enrichment and the addition of precipitation and runoff along the chain lake system. We apply our new dataset to a stable-isotope-based evaporation model that explicitly incorporates downwind lake effects, including humidity build-up and changes to the isotope composition of atmospheric vapor. Our evaporation estimates are consistent with previous mass transfer results for Michigan, Huron, Ontario and Erie, but not for Superior, which has a much longer residence time. Calculated evaporation from Superior is similar to 300 mm per year, less than previous estimates of similar to 500 mm per year, likely arising from integration of the 'isotopic memory' of lower evaporation rates under cooler climatic conditions with greater ice-cover than the present. Uncertainties in the estimates from the stable-isotope-based model are comparable to mass transfer results, offering an independent technique for evaluating evaporation fluxes.

Climate change drives coherent trends in physics and oxygen content in North American lakes	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Using a 25-year record of monitoring data, we show that recent climate change has affected the thermal properties and oxygen content of seven lakes in south-central Ontario, Canada, and five lakes in north-central Wisconsin, USA. Coherent patterns in autumnal lake warming were driven by increased autumn air temperature in both lake districts. Temperature increases were restricted to the epilimnion and metalimnion of the lakes, resulting in increased thermal stability of the water column. Mixing depths also decreased over the study period. Shallower mixing depths in the Ontario lakes were due to climate-driven increases in lake-water dissolved organic carbon concentrations. Collectively, changes in the thermal regime of the lakes suggest autumn mixing of the water column may be delayed. Metalimnetic oxygen also increased in the Wisconsin lakes, perhaps in response to increased algal production as lake thermal regimes changed. The response of individual lakes to climate change was modified by lake chemistry in the Ontario lake district and by lake chemistry and morphometry in the Wisconsin lake district. Our results demonstrate coherent lake response to climate change and highlight the importance of both regional and local factors in regulating individual lake response to global climate change.

Molybdenum geochemistry in a seasonally dysoxic Mo-limited lacustrine ecosystem	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Lakes are important for storage of the essential micronutrient molybdenum (Mo) during its transfer from the continents to the oceans, but little is known about the major sources and sinks for Mo in lacustrine ecosystems. We studied Mo cycling in Castle Lake, a small subalpine lake in the Klamath-Siskiyou Mountains of Northern California underlain primarily by mafic and ultramafic rocks where primary productivity is limited by Mo bioavailability. The deeper water of the lake becomes dysoxic (9-90 mu M dissolved oxygen) during the summer. This study was undertaken to identify the sources of Mo to Castle Lake and establish a Mo budget. We measured Mo concentrations in a suite of bulk solids (lake sediments, soils and bedrock) and aqueous samples (sediment porewaters, soil runoff, spring waters, snow and ice) from Castle Lake and its watershed. Lake sediments have elevated Mo (7-36 ppm) compared to soils and bedrock (0.2-2 ppm) and Mo/Al values were nearly two orders of magnitude higher than the crustal abundance. Sediment porewaters had higher Mo (4-15 nM) than lake water (2-4 nM), soil runoff (0.1-6.2 nM), snowmelt (<= 0.1 nM), lake ice (0.3-2.2 nM) and local spring waters (0.03-2.72 nM). Bulk lake sediments had negative delta(98/95) Mo values, ranging from -0.5 to -1.0 parts per thousand (+/- 0.1). We used the numerical model PROFILE to estimate the net reaction rate of Mo in the porewater. Model calculations ruled out diagenesis as a source of Mo to lake sediments; diagenetic Mo always represented <= 5% of the total Mo content in sediment. We also ruled out dissolved Mo inputs from groundwater and watershed inflow as important sources of Mo. Two whole-lake experimental Mo additions in the 1960's could have contributed a sizeable amount of Mo to the lake sediments, but only over a short period. Atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic Mo from extensive copper smelting that occurred south of Castle Lake from 1896 to 1919 and from major Californian urban centers today were negligible Mo sources. Mo flux from the sediments (0.40.5 nmol cm(-2)yr(-1)) was roughly equal to Mo fluxes from surface inflow and outflow, whereas Mo burial fluxes were significantly higher (11.5 nmol cm(-2)yr(-1)). Because dissolved Mo fluxes were minimal, and atmospheric Mo deposition was estimated to be a minor source of Mo (<1 nmol cm(-2)yr(-1)), the largest source of Mo is non-detrital particulate matter (similar to 12 nmol cm(-2)yr(-1)), likely a mixture of organic matter and Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides as supported by Mo isotopic data.

The Asthmatic Athlete: Inhaled Beta-2 Agonists, Sport Performance, and Doping	CLINICAL JOURNAL OF SPORT MEDICINE												The asthmatic athlete has a long history in competitive sport in terms of success in performance and issues related to doping. Well documented are detailed objective tests used to evaluate the athlete with symptoms of asthma or airway hyperresponsiveness and the medical management. Initiated at the 2002 Salt Lake City Games, the International Olympic Committee's Independent Asthma Panel required testing to justify the use of inhaled beta-2 agonists (IBAs) in Olympic athletes and has provided valuable guidelines to the practicing physician. This program was educational and documented the variability in prevalence of asthma and/or airway hyperresponsiveness and IBA use between different sports and different countries. It provided a standard of care for the athlete with respiratory symptoms and led to the discovery that asthmatic Olympic athletes outperformed their peers at both Summer and Winter Olympic Games from 2002 to 2010. Changes to the World Anti-Doping Agency's Prohibited List in 2010 permitted the use of 2 IBA produced by the same pharmaceutical company. All others remain prohibited. However, there is no pharmacological difference between the permitted and prohibited IBAs. As a result of these changes, asthmatic athletes are being managed differently based on a World Anti-Doping Agency directive that has no foundation in pharmacological science or in clinical practice.																			1050-642X	1536-3724				JAN	2011	21	1					46	50		10.1097/IAE.0b013e318203c0ef	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/IAE.0b013e318203c0ef								21200170					WOS:000285866300008

The Importance of Systematic Spatial Variability in the Surface Heat Flux of a Large Lake: A Multiannual Analysis for Lake Geneva	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The spatiotemporal surface heat flux (SurHF) distribution over Lake Geneva, the largest lake in Western Europe, was estimated for a 7-year period (2008-2014). Data sources included hourly maps of over-the-lake assimilated meteorological data from a validated numerical weather model and lake surface water temperature (LSWT) from satellite imagery. A set of bulk algorithms, previously optimized and calibrated at two locations in Lake Geneva, was used. Results indicate a systematic long-term average spatial range of >40 Wm(-2) between different parts of the lake and little year-to-year variability. This variability is mainly due to topographically induced wind sheltering over parts of the lake, which in turn produces spatial variability in the sensible and latent heat fluxes. These results are supported by a systematic spatial heat content variability obtained from long-term temperature profile measurements in the lake. During spring, a lower SurHF spatial range was evident. Unlike other seasons, the spring spatial variability of air-water temperature differences and, to a lesser extent, the global radiation variability resulting from sheltering by the mountainous topography were the main drivers of the SurHF spatial variability. Analysis of the atmospheric thermal boundary layer showed stable conditions from March to early June and unstable conditions for the rest of the year. This regime change can explain the low SurHF spatial variability observed during spring. The results emphasize that spatial variability in meteorological and LSWT patterns, and consequently in the spatiotemporal SurHF data, should be considered when assessing the time evolution of the heat budget of large lakes.

A total culturable virus assay revealed that 89 samples (26.3%) were positive for EVs, the average concentration being 5.8 most probable number (MPN)/100 L. The Han river basin exhibited the highest contamination by EVs (occurrence, 41.3%; average concentration, 24.0 MPN/100 L). EV contamination was found more frequently in river water (occurrence, 33.6%; concentration, 8.4 MPN/100 L) than in lake water or groundwater. The concentration of EVs was highest in spring (7.7 MPN/100 L), whereas it was found most frequently in winter (36.1%). The number of TCs ranged from 0 1.2 x 105 colony forming units (CFU)/100 mL and that of FCs from 06.2 x 103 CFU/100 mL per sample. Statistical analyses showed that the presence of EVs, TCs and FCs did not correlate significantly with temperature or turbidity. In addition, presence of TCs and FCs was not significantly correlated with presence of EVs. In conclusion, TCs and FCs may not be accurate microbial indicators of waterborne EVs in Korean aquatic environments.

Salmonellae were detected in semiselective enrichment cultures by end-point PCR during the entire sampling period of (11 sampling events during 2months). From the spring arm site, 73% of the biofilms and 41% of the water samples were positive for salmonellae, while only 9% of the biofilms and 23% of the water samples were positive from the slough arm site. Salmonellae could be isolated from all positive samples, with higher diversity in biofilms compared with water samples and more strains obtained from the spring arm than from the slough arm. Differences between sites were generally caused by less frequently detected isolates, while the majority of isolates that were present in both biofilms and water from both sites was represented by three strains only. Quantification attempts by quantitative PCR directly in samples without prior enrichment did not result in a reliable detection of salmonellae, suggesting that numbers in all samples were below the detection limit.																			0168-6496	1574-6941				MAR	2013	83	3					642	649		10.1111/1574-6941.12021	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1574-6941.12021								23025800					WOS:000314474100010

However, its prevalence of in wild rodents remains unexplored. Therefore, investigating the prevalence and molecular characteristics of P. hominis in wild rodents is essential.MethodsM.Replace the crossed out sentence above with the following version:This study assessed the prevalence of P. hominis in wild rodents by analyzing 510 fecal samples using nested PCR.

Statistical analysis of risk factors was performed with SAS (v9.0) and SPSS software.ResultsThe infection rates were 18.18% (16/88) in Yunnan, 0.94% (3/319) in Hunan, and 0% (0/103) in Guangxi. Among the species, Rattus rattus sladeni had the highest infection rate at 40% (2/5), followed by R. flavipectus at 23.08% (9/39), while Niviventer lotipes (0%, 0/23) and R. losea (0%, 0/41) showed no infection. Seasonally, the highest prevalence was observed in autumn (18.18%, 16/88) and the lowest in winter (0%, 0/103). Rodents from farmland had significantly higher infection rates than mountain areas (0%, 0/103) and lakeshores (0.32%, 1/312). Although female rodents had a higher infection rate (4.62%, 11/238) compared to males (2.94%, 8/272), the difference was not statistically significant. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all P. hominis strains identified belonged to the zoonotic CC1 genotype.ConclusionsThis study is the first to describe the distribution of P. hominis in wild rodents, paving the way for further epidemiological research on this parasite in wild animals. Such research is crucial for developing strategies to protect human health from zoonotic threats from wild rodents.

J	PARKER, M; WEST, B				PARKER, M; WEST, B			NATURAL-HISTORY OF NEOMYSIS-INTEGER (LEACH) IN LOUGH FURNACE, CO MAYO, A BRACKISH LOUGH IN THE WEST OF IRELAND	ESTUARINE AND COASTAL MARINE SCIENCE												N. integer is usually a dominant member of the epibenthic community in shallow waters in Lough Furnace, a brackish lake in County Mayo, Ireland, though the population undergoes both blooms and crashes. On average, the species there is smaller and less fecund than elsewhere in Europe. Overwintering mysids mature and breed in April and May producing a spring generation which breeds in Aug.; the subsequent summer generation appears later than elsewhere. Breeding females are present throughout the year, and for most of it females predominate over males in the population. Orientation and feeding behavior are governed by social or physical factors and appear to make the maximum use of available nutrients. On steep bouldery shores this species forms extensive shoals near to the water surface and feeds by a filtering mechanism and raptorially. On shallow weedy shores it is mainly epibenthic and feeds by disturbing and reworking the sediment. When starved in aquaria it re-ingests its own feces. In flowing water it forms pelagic shoals which take up position with relation to prominent structures such as large boulders. Exceptionally, it occurs pelagically in the open waters of the lake. The implications of eurytopy, flexible behavior and marsupial brooding for evolutionary strategy are discussed.																			0302-3524						1979	8	2					157	167		10.1016/0302-3524(79)90071-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0302-3524(79)90071-9													WOS:A1979GM64100006

Satellite-based observations from polar orbiting satellites like the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) offer an opportunity to characterize boreal forest seasonal cycles across longitudes with a spatially and temporally rich data set, but data quality controls and biases still require vetting at high latitudes. With the objective of improving data availability at northern, terrestrial high latitudes, this study evaluates quality control methods and biases of OCO-2 retrievals of atmospheric column-averaged dry air mole fractions of CO2 (X-CO2) in boreal forest regions. In addition to the standard quality control (QC) filters recommended for the Atmospheric Carbon Observations from Space (ACOS) B8 (B8 QC) and ACOS B9 (B9 QC) OCO-2 retrievals, a third set of quality control filters were specifically tailored to boreal forest observations (boreal QC) with the goal of increasing data availability at high latitudes without sacrificing data quality. Ground-based reference measurements of X-CO2 include observations from two sites in the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) at East Trout Lake, Saskatchewan, Canada, and Sodankyla, Finland. OCO-2 retrievals were also compared to ground-based observations from two Bruker EM27/SUN Fourier transform infrared spectrometers (FTSs) at Fairbanks, Alaska, USA. The EM27/SUN spectrometers that were deployed in Fairbanks were carefully monitored for instrument performance and were bias corrected to TCCON using observations at the Caltech TCCON site. The B9 QC were found to pass approximately twice as many OCO-2 retrievals over land north of 50 degrees N than the B8 QC, and the boreal QC were found to pass approximately twice as many retrievals in May, August, and September as the B9 QC. While boreal QC results in a substantial increase in passable retrievals, this is accompanied by increases in the standard deviations in biases at boreal forest sites from similar to 1.4 parts per million (ppm) with B9 QC to similar to 1.6 ppm with boreal QC. Total average biases for coincident OCO-2 retrievals at the three sites considered did not consistently increase or decrease with different QC methods, and instead, responses to changes in QC varied according to site and satellite viewing geometries. Regardless of the quality control method used, seasonal variability in biases was observed, and this variability was more pronounced at Sodankyla and East Trout Lake than at Fairbanks. Long-term coincident observations from TCCON, EM27/SUN, and satellites from multiple locations would be necessary to determine whether the reduced seasonal variability in bias at Fairbanks is due to geography or instrumentation. Monthly average biases generally varied between - 1 and +1 ppm at the three sites considered, with more negative biases in spring (March, April, and May - MAM) and autumn (September and October - SO) but more positive biases in the summer months (June, July, and August - JJA). Monthly standard deviations in biases ranged from approximately 1.0 to 2.0 ppm and did not exhibit strong seasonal dependence, apart from exceptionally high standard deviation observed with all three QC methods at Sodankyla in June. There was no evidence found to suggest that seasonal variability in bias is a direct result of air mass dependence in ground-based retrievals or of proximity bias from coincidence criteria, but there were a number of retrieval parameters used as quality control filters that exhibit seasonality and could contribute to seasonal dependence in OCO-2 bias. Furthermore, it was found that OCO-2 retrievals of X-CO2 without the standard OCO-2 bias correction exhibit almost no perceptible seasonal dependence in average monthly bias at these boreal forest sites, suggesting that seasonal variability in bias is introduced by the bias correction. Overall, we found that modified quality controls can allow for significant increases in passable OCO-2 retrievals with only marginal compromises in data quality, but seasonal dependence in biases still warrants further exploration.					; Dubey, Manvendra/E-3949-2010; Simpson, William/I-2859-2014; Jacobs, Nicole/HHN-7762-2022; Heikkinen, Pauli/G-3478-2014	Jacobs, Nicole/0000-0002-7524-2157; Simpson, William/0000-0002-8596-7290; Dubey, Manvendra/0000-0002-3492-790X; 													1867-1381	1867-8548				SEP 28	2020	13	9					5033	5063		10.5194/amt-13-5033-2020	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-5033-2020													WOS:000575863000001

Nearctic freshwater tardigrades: a review	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY					10th International Symposium on Tardigrada	JUN 18-23, 2006	Catania, ITALY					The distribution and ecology of limno-terrestrial Tardigrada in the Nearctic realm remain poorly known. This is especially true of freshwater tardigrades (i.e., species found in permanently submerged habitats), which have received much less attention than terrestrial species. We reviewed the literature on Nearctic freshwater tardigrades. Of 204 Nearctic limno-terrestrial tardigrade species, 44 have been collected from sediments and aquatic vegetation of streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, groundwater and cryoconite holes. Of these, 17 are hydrophilous species found exclusively or primarily in aquatic environments. Most of the remainder are probably washed in accidentally from terrestrial substrates. Among the hydrophilous species, five are endemic to the Nearctic realm and three cosmopolitan. Hypsibius dujardim is the most widely-distributed hydrophilous species. There are no regional collections Of Nearctic freshwater tardigrades comparable to those for terrestrial species. Aquatic tardigrades are benthic, and are found in sediments and on aquatic vegetation. Hypsibius dujardini and other widespread species are found in both substrates, and there is thus no evidence of substrate specificity. Numerically, tardigrades usually comprise a minor component of benthic invertebrate communities. Nothing is known of their trophic relationships or dispersal in these habitats. The density of Nearctic freshwater tardigrade species peaks in the spring and/or fall. Future research should increase the spatial and temporal scale of study, and employ adequate replication.																			1129-5767	1723-8633					2007	66			1			84	89		10.4081/jlimnol.2007.s1.84	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2007.s1.84													WOS:000250229400016

In the fall of 2004, the contents of the total DDXs in the water and SPM were 0.29 +/- 0.69 ng L-1 and 423.13 +/- 577.85 ng g(-1) dry wt., respectively. In the spring of 2005, the total DDXs were 0.36 +/- 0.91 ng L-1 for water and 35.93 +/- 62.65 ng g(-1) dry wt. for SPM. The average concentration of DDXs for sediments was 7.10 +/- 7.57 ng g(-1) dry wt. during the two seasons. The Eastern-Hebei-Province Coastland River System was the most polluted, which was mainly attributable to the extensive use of DDT pesticide and dicofol in that system. Recent DDT inputs still occur in some regions, as indicated by DDT/(DDD + DDE) > 1 at 29-36 % of the sites for water and 55-61 % of the sites for SPM. The potential ecological risks of DDT in the water were assessed using a species sensitivity distribution model. Only shrimp and crabs were found to have potentially affected fraction values of 1.63 x 10(-3) to 2.27 x 10(-4), with probabilities beyond the hazardous concentration for 5 % of species (HC5) values of 1.90-2.56 %, suggesting only slight risks. DDXs in the sediments of some sites were also of potential risk to benthic organism based on consensus-based sediment quality guidelines.					; He, Wei/C-7426-2015; Li, Qing/KCZ-1775-2024; Kong, Xiangzhen/JCD-7439-2023	He, Wei/0000-0002-3671-8650; Tao, Shu/0000-0002-7374-7063; 													0167-6369					FEB	2013	185	2					1777	1790		10.1007/s10661-012-2667-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-012-2667-0								22580748					WOS:000313359000057

Data from 1985 (untreated) and 1990 (treated) were used to compare and contrast APP community response to a whole-lake fertilization experiment. The APP communities of Chilko Lake were dominated by the coccoid cyanobacteria Synechococcus and its colonial morph which comprised about 99% of the APP community of Chilko Lake. Chlorella-like eukaryotic picoplankters and small cyanobacteria were rare, comprising < 1% of the APP community. In 1990 autotrophic picoplankters contributed an average of 73% to total chlorophyll, and 54% to total photosynthesis. Average APP abundance ran ed from lows of 4,000-5,000 cells ml-1 in winter and spring to highs of 50 000-150 000 cells ml-1 in early August with no apparent autumnal increase. APP populations were uniformly distributed in the epilimnion, but during calm periods in August often formed a peak near the metalimnion/hypolimnion boundary. Seasonal and vertical distribution patterns of APP showed little relation to temperature or to light. When nutrients were added to the lake in 1990, APP populations doubled within 3 wk of addition and average abundance (6.16 x 10(4) cells . ml-1) was twice 1985 APP numbers. Bottom-up control by scarce nutrient supplies is considered the primary factor regulating community composition and abundance during the initial population growth phase (June, July) with top-down control by grazing during nutrient co-limitation periods when the epilimnion is deplete of both nitrogen and phosphorus (August, September).																			0018-8158					FEB 4	1994	274	1-3					133	142		10.1007/BF00014636	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00014636													WOS:A1994MX84100017

The role of snow processes and hillslopes on runoff generation in present and future climates in a recently constructed watershed in the Athabasca oil sands region	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Mine reclamation in the Athabasca oil sands region Canada, is required by law where companies must reconstruct disturbed landscapes into functioning ecosystems such as forests, wetlands, and lakes that existed in the Boreal landscape prior to mining. Winter is a major hydrological factor in this region as snow covers the landscape for 5-6 months and is similar to 25% of the annual precipitation, yet few studies have explored the influence of winter processes on the hydrology of constructed watersheds. One year (2017-2018) of intensive snow hydrology measurements are supplemented with 6 years (2013-2018) of meteorological measurements from the constructed Sandhill Fen watershed to: (a) understand snow accumulation and redistribution, snowmelt timing, rate, and partitioning, (b) apply a physically based model for simulating winter processes on hillslopes, and (c) evaluate the impact of soil prescriptions and climate change projections on winter processes in reclaimed systems. The 2017-2018 snow season was between November and April and snow water equivalent (SWE) ranged between 40 and 140 mm. Snow distribution was primarily influenced by topography with little influence of snow trapping from developing vegetation. Snow accumulation was most variable on hillslopes and redistribution was driven by slope position, with SWE greatest at the base of slopes and decreased toward crests. Snowmelt on hillslopes was controlled by slope aspect, as snow declined rapidly on west and south-facing slopes, compared with east and north-facing slopes. Unlike results previously reported on constructed uplands, snowmelt runoff from uplands was much less (similar to 30%), highlighting the influence of different construction materials. Model simulations indicate that antecedent soil moisture and soil temperature have a large influence on partitioning snowmelt over a range of observed conditions. Under a warmer and wetter climate, average annual peak SWE, and snow season duration could decline up to 52% and up to 61 days, respectively, while snowmelt runoff ceases completely under the warmest scenarios. Results suggest considerable future variability in snowmelt runoff from hillslopes, yet soil properties can be used to enhance vertical or lateral flows.

Two lakes (Woods and Panther) were enough like those lakes of southern Sweden and Norway studied by Henriksen that they should constitute a valid test of his acidification indicator and predictor nomograph. Data from weekly samples taken near the surface of the lakes during unstratified summer and fall conditions over 3 yr was used. The acidification indicator and predictor nomograph were developed using data from lake samples taken under similar conditions in Scandinavia. With regard to the empirical line of the acidification indicator (that Henriksen found separated data from lakes receiving precipitation .gtoreq. pH 4.6) and with the precipitation pH axis of the predictor nomograph, these 2 methods of evaluation were not directly applicable as is to these lakes. The chemistry of precipitation in the Adirondacks was significantly different from (and for) which the acidification indicator and predictor nomograph were developed. In the Adirondacks, acids other than H2SO4 played a greater role in the overall acidity of the precipitation. This caused relationships between precipitation pH and lake chemistry in the 2 regions to be different.					; Galloway, James/C-2769-2013	Galloway, James/0000-0001-7676-8698; 													0049-6979	1573-2932					1984	22	2					111	120																WOS:A1984SE06500001

In 1999, a heavy waterbloom of M. ichthyoblabe occurred during May June with a maximal biomass of 298 mg/l. During this period, several bloom samples were collected. The toxicity assessment was done by mouse and brine shrimp (Artemia) bioassays. Apart from the sample collected on 15/06/1999, all the other samples were toxic by mouse bioassay. The LD50 determined by intraperitoneal injection to mice during active cyanobacterial growth and decline phases were 518 and 1924 mgDW/kg respectively. Using Artemia bioassay, the 24hLC(50) varied from 6.0 to 40.6 mg/ml and the 48hLC(50) ranged from 2.8 to 18.2 mg/ml. The separation and identification of microcystin variants was performed by high performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection. Eleven toxins were separated and preliminarily identified as microcystin variants as they exhibit a typical UV spectra like the microcystin-LR standard.

The results revealed that the species predominantly exhibited piscivorous feeding characteristics, with Tinca tinca (IRI% = 78.93) identified as the primary food source. The food items in the stomach showed a wide spectrum, ranging from benthic invertebrates, crustaceans, molluscs, amphibians, and mammals to fishes. The study not only assessed the general food composition of wels catfish but also delved into the seasonal variations in diet composition. It was found that the stomach fullness index (FI) varied significantly among the seasons, with Winter showing the highest values (0.827). On the other hand, the lowest value was detected in the Autumn season (0.480). Age and length groups were also considered, with notable differences in stomach FI and diet composition observed across different stages of growth. Food preference analysis highlighted the selective tendencies of wels catfish towards certain food types, with Atherina boyeri and T. tinca emerging as preferred choices in different size groups. For small, medium, and large length individuals, the most preferred prey fish were A. boyeri (Va = 0.39518, chi 2 = 31.2336), T. tinca (Va = 0.63564, chi 2 = 82.8073) and T. tinca (Va = 0.666495, chi 2 = 88.4307), respectively. The findings provide valuable insights into the feeding behaviour of wels catfish, underscoring the importance of understanding these patterns for effective management and conservation efforts. Further research should aim to explore the ecological implications of these feeding habits on the overall aquatic ecosystem.

This is the source of water for the upper reaches of Asia's main river systems, providing the livelihood for millions of people in the subregion. Climate change is therefore critical for the Himalaya snow and glacier hydrology, the dependent ecosystems, and the people. Whereas temperature and precipitation are common indicators for climate change, snow and glacier dynamics are reliable precursors of a warming or cooling climate. This study uses a simple empirical climate model (ECM) and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data to analyze water storage dynamics in the 5.072 x 10(6) km(2) Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau region. About 72 consecutive months (January 2003 through December 2008) of data are used in the study. The temperature and precipitation (snow plus rain) data are acquired from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) Noah land surface model and are validated with ground truth data from 205 meteorological stations. Total water storage change derived from the GRACE gravity data is fitted with a simple sinusoidal least squares regression model. A favorable agreement exists between the GRACE and sinusoidal curve (R-2 = 0.81 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 8.73 mm), suggesting that random errors in GRACE data are small. However, the sinusoidal fit does not quantify systematic errors in GRACE data. Agreements between the GRACE- and ECM-estimated storage changes are also favorable at both monthly (R-2 = 0.93, RMSE = 5.46 mm) and seasonal (R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 7.64 mm) cycles. The agreements (significant at p < 0.01) indicate not only GRACE's ability to detect storage signal but also that of the ECM model to characterize storage change in the snow and glacier hydrology. There is clear seasonality in the storage anomaly, with the highest in summer and lowest in winter. The corresponding storage change is delayed by a quarter of the year. The GRACE and ECM model indicate an overall negative storage trend of 0.36 +/- 0.03 mm/month or 21.91 +/- 1.95 km(3)/yr for the study area (significant at p < 0.1). Given that snow and glaciers are particularly sensitive to temperature change, the negative storage trend could be indicative of warming climate conditions in the region. Groundwater abstraction (mainly for irrigation) in the southern plains, coupled with dwindling snowfall in the northern massifs, is a critical storage loss factor in the region. Invariably, storage loss in the Himalayan-Tibetan Plateau region could have negative implications for the hydrology, dependent ecosystems, and livelihoods of millions of people.

J	MAKULLA, A; SOMMER, U				MAKULLA, A; SOMMER, U			RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN RESOURCE RATIOS AND PHYTOPLANKTON SPECIES COMPOSITION DURING SPRING IN 5 NORTH GERMAN LAKES	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Phytoplankton species composition and the availability of potentially limiting resources were investigated in five northern German lakes (Suhrer See, Kellersee, Behler See, Plusssee, and Krummsee) during spring 1988. Species composition was related to resource ratios to test Tilman's resource-ratio hypothesis. The clearest results were obtained for Aulacoseira spp. Both the time-courses within the lakes and the comparison among the lakes suggest a strong tendency of this genus to become dominant at high Si : light ratios. Fragilariaceae occupied the next position on the Si : light gradient. Such conditions permitted them to become important even when Si : P ratios were quite low. With the onset of stratification diatoms were replaced by flagellates.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JUN	1993	38	4					846	856		10.4319/lo.1993.38.4.0846	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1993.38.4.0846													WOS:A1993LP66200010
J	NICHOLLS, KH; TAYLOR, R; HAMDY, Y				NICHOLLS, KH; TAYLOR, R; HAMDY, Y			THE INFLUENCE OF THE GRAND RIVER ON PHYTOPLANKTON NEAR THE NORTHEASTERN SHORE OF LAKE ERIE DURING 1979	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The phytoplankton in the region of the Grand River and adjacent northeastern Lake Erie (Ontario, Canada) was investigated during April-Nov. of 1979 to determine the influence of the river on the phytoplankton of the lake. Average phytoplankton biomass ranged from 0.45 mm3/l in the lake to 7.6 mm3/l in the river mouth. The phytoplankton communities of the 2 river mouth stations were most similar, but were related to those at the Lake Erie stations at much lower percentage similar, but were related to those at the Lake Erie stations at much lower percentage similarities. Stations west of the Grand River were more similar to each other in phytoplankton community structure than to stations east of the Grand River. The influence of the Grand River on Lake Erie phytoplankton was greatest during spring. The distribution of 2 indicator species, Skeletonema potamos (Weber) Halse and Stephanodiscus hantzschii Grun., suggests that the major influence of the Grand River during the summer was confined to an area within only 5-10 km of the river mouth. The nutrient and phytoplankton data imply that further controls on P loading will achieve lower densities of algae and improved water clarity, especially in the river mouth area.																			0003-9136						1983	98	2					146	172																WOS:A1983RN59800002

Trend analysis for N rates (0, 50, 100, 150 and 200kg N ha1) and orthogonal contrasts for different application times (pre-plant, top-dressed in February and March) were performed. With increasing fertilizer N, wheat grain yield and protein content increased from 2110kg ha1 to 6783kg ha1 and from 8.96 to 17.19%, respectively. For grain yield, protein, and N use efficiency, split applications of N fertilizer were much more efficient than applying all N pre-plant. Large differences in grain yields were noted for different years at the same N rate (range exceeded 5.0 Mg ha1) and that illustrated the need for making within-year-specific N rate recommendations.

Isotopic characterization of nitrate sources and transformations in Lake Winnipeg and its contributing rivers, Manitoba, Canada	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake Winnipeg (Manitoba, Canada) is in a eutrophic state from a century of increased riverine loadings from agricultural and urban nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) sources. This study investigated seasonal patterns of the isotopic composition of nitrate (NO3-) in Lake Winnipeg and its contributing rivers to gain insight into current N nutrient sources and in-lake N dynamics. Elevated NO3- concentrations in Lake Winnipeg tributaries between 0.36 and 2.44 mg/L NO3--N were associated with high delta N-15 values between + 5.0 and + 13.9 parts per thousand, while delta O-18(NO3) values were <+ 15.0 parts per thousand. The three major riverine inputs had distinctive mean delta N-15(NO3) values of + 8.1 parts per thousand for the Red River, -0.6 parts per thousand for the Winnipeg River, and + 5.0 parts per thousand. for the Saskatchewan River. The isotopic composition of NO3- in lake Winnipeg was partly controlled by the isotopic composition of the riverine nitrate nitrate for instance via the predominant nitrate input to the South basin from the Red River. Nitrate assimilation and late season mineralization of phytoplankton and N-2 fixing cyanobacteria were identified as important additional processes affecting the isotopic composition of lake NO3- resulting in low delta N-15(NO3) values, especially in the North basin. In the South basin, elevated delta N-15(NO3) values in spring that changed to lower values by summer indicated a dynamic N cycle within the lake. Agreement between delta N-15 values of lake NO3-, PON and fish suggests that dissolved nitrate partially affects the flow of nitrogen in the aquatic food webs of Lake Winnipeg.

J	Bai, XL; Son, Y				Bai, Xuelian; Son, Yeongkwon			Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in surface water and sediments from two urban watersheds in Nevada, USA	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This study measured 17 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in surface water and sediments collected from six locations along the Las Vegas Wash and Lake Mead and eight locations along the Truckee River, Lake Tahoe, and Pyramid Lake in Nevada, United States. Of the 17 PFAS analyzed, 12 were detected in the surface water (n = 18) and 14 were detected in the sediments (n = 21) of the two watersheds. The total concentration of PFAS in the Truckee River water was 441.7 ng/L and the PFAS detected in the Las Vegas Wash water was 2234.3 ng/L. The predominant PFAS species found in the water were perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) (1.5-187.0 ng/L), followed by perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) (below detection limit [BDL] to 169.9 ng/L), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (BDL to 65.5 ng/L), and perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS) (BDL to 44.7 ng/L). The total PFAS in the sediments was 272.9 mu g/kg (dry weight) for the Truckee River and 345.7 mu g/kg for the Las Vegas Wash. The predominant species in the sediments were perfluorodecane sulfonic acid (PFDS) (BDL to 88.2 mu g/kg), PFHxA (BDL to 20.3 mu g/kg), PFBS (BDL to 29.1 mu g/Kg), and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUA) (BDL to 22.9 mu g/kg). The results demonstrated that short-chain PFAS (C <= 8) were more prevalent in water, whereas long-chain PFAS (C > 8) were more detectable in sediments. The Las Vegas Wash water had much higher PFAS levels compared with the Truckee River water. The PFAS concentrations and detection frequencies also significantly decreased in summer compared with winter along the Las Vegas Wash. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effect of Teleconnected Land-Atmosphere Coupling on Northeast China Persistent Drought in Spring-Summer of 2017	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Northeast China (NEC) suffered a severe drought that persisted from March to July of 2017 with profound impacts on agriculture and society, raising an urgent need to understand the mechanism for persistent droughts over midlatitudes. Previous drought mechanism studies focused on either large-scale teleconnections or local land-atmosphere coupling, while less attention was paid to their synergistic effects on drought persistence. Here we show that the 2017 NEC drought was triggered by a strong positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation in March, and maintained by the anticyclone over the area south to Lake Baikal (ASLB) through a quasi-stationary Rossby wave in April-July, accompanied by sinking motion and north wind anomaly. By using a land-atmosphere coupling index based on the persistence of positive feedbacks between the boundary layer and land surface, we find that the coupling states over NEC and ASLB shifted from a wet coupling in March to a persistently strengthened dry coupling in April-July. Over ASLB, the dry coupling and sinking motion increased surface sensible heat, decreased cloud cover, and weakened longwave absorption, resulting in a diabatic heating anomaly in the lower atmosphere and a diabatic cooling anomaly in the upper atmosphere. This anomalous vertical heating profile led to a negative anomaly of potential vorticity at low levels, indicating that the land-atmosphere coupling had a phase-lock effect on the Rossby wave train originating from upstream areas, and therefore maintained the NEC drought over downstream regions. Our study suggests that an upstream quasi-stationary wave pattern strengthened by land-atmosphere coupling should be considered in diagnosing persistent droughts, especially over northern midlatitudes.

In the present study, a novel sulfatereducing bacterial strain Desulfotomaculum TC-1 was isolated from a sulfidic hot spring in Tengchong geothermal area, Yunnan Province, China. The arxA gene, encoding anaerobic arsenite oxidase, was successfully amplified from the genome of strain TC-1, indicating it has a potential ability to oxidize arsenite under anaerobic condition. In anaerobic arsenite oxidation experiments inoculated with strain TC-1, a small amount of arsenate was detected in the beginning but became undetectable over longer time. Thioarsenates (AsO4-xSx2- with x D 1-4) formed with mono-, di-and trithioarsenates being dominant forms. Tetrathioarsenate was only detectable at the end of the experiment. These results suggest that thermophilic microbes might be involved in the formation of thioarsenates and provide a possible explanation for the widespread distribution of thioarsenates in terrestrial geothermal environments.

Urea and ureolytic activity in lakes of different trophic status	POLISH JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY												Urea and uraease (U-ase) activity were determined in water samples taken from the surface layers of 17 lakes of different trophic status. Urea concentrations were inversely correlated with the trophic status of the studied lakes and varied from below the detection limit to 25 mu mol l(-1). Maximal potential urcolytic activity (V-max) ranged from 0.2 to 7.0 mu mol l(-1) h(-1). The highest urea concentrations and the lowest U-ase activities were recorded in the spring, whereas the lowest urea concentrations and the highest rates of urea hydrolysis were observed late in summer, during heavy phytoplankton blooms. Since in the majority of the Great Mazurian Lakes microplankton growth was limited by nitrogen supply, urea was an important N source for both auto- and lieterotrophic planktonic microorganisms throughout the growth period. U-ase activity was mainly related to the seston. Only up to 25% of total activity could be attributed to free enzymes dissolved in lake water. In epilimnetic water samples the bulk of the ureolytic activity originated from seston-attached bacteria. However, a positive, statistically significant correlation between ureolytic activity and chlorophyll a (Chl(a)) concentrations suggests that phytoplankton may also be responsible for at least a some of the observed ureolytic activity in the highly eutrophic Great Mazurian Lakes.

Atmospheric fluxes averaged 0.83 dpm cm-2 yr-1 for Pb-210 and 16.0 dpm cm-2 yr-1 for Be-7 during 1984 to 1987. Vertical fluxes of Pb-210 and Be-7, associated with settling particles, were measured in sediment traps deployed at 50 m and 130 m depth at a station near the deepest part of Lake Zurich. Average fluxes of Pb-210 and Be-7 at 50 m depth were 0.94 and 4.90 dpm cm-2 yr-1, respectively, and 16.5 x 10(7) atoms m-2 d-1 for Be-10. Sediment traps at 50 m quantitatively collected atmospherically deposited Pb-210 falling through the water column. At 130 m depth, immediately above seasonally anoxic bottoms waters, Pb-210, Be-10, and Cs-137 fluxes were higher than at 50 m by up to 60% at times during the summer stagnation period. Sediment inventories of Pb-210 and Be-10 are in agreement with atmospheric nuclide fluxes, suggesting only moderate recycling of these nuclides in the bottom waters, whereas Cs-137 inventory in the sediments is lower than expected from sediment trap fluxes, indicating remobilization of this nuclide.

J	Chipps, SR; Bennett, DH				Chipps, SR; Bennett, DH			Zooplanktivory and nutrient regeneration by invertebrate (Mysis relicta) and vertebrate (Oncorhynchus nerka) planktivores: Implications for trophic interactions in oligotrophic lakes	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We investigated zooplanktivory and nutrient regeneration by the opossum shrimp Mysis relicta and kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka to assess the relative roles of these planktivores in oligotrophic food webs. Using bioenergetic models and clearance rate estimates, we quantified phosphorus (P) excretion rates and consumption of cladoceran prey by Mysis and kokanees in Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho, from 1995 to 1996. Consumption of cladoceran prey by Mysis was 186 kg.ha(-1).year(-1), whereas consumption by kokanees was less than one quarter as much, at 45 kg.ha(-1).year(-1). Similarly, Mysis excreted approximately 0.250 kg P.ha(-1).year(-1) during nighttime migrations into the upper water column, whereas P excretion by kokanees was less than one third as much, at approximately 0.070 kg P.ha(-1).year(-1). On a volumetric basis, nocturnal excretion by Mysis ranged from 0.002 to 0.007 mu g P.L-1.d(-1) and accounted for less than 1% of the soluble reactive P typically measured in the upper water column of the lake. Hence, nutrient recycling by Mysis may be limited in the upper water column because of the nocturnal feeding habitats that constrain Mysis to deeper strata for much of the day. In spring and autumn months, low abundance of cladoceran prey coincided with high seasonal energy requirements of the Mysis population that were linked to timing of annual Mysis brood release and abundance of age-0 Mysis. Predation by Mysis accounted for 5-70% of daily cladoceran standing stock, supporting the notion that seasonal availability of cladocerans may be regulated by Mysis predation. In lakes where Mysis experience little predation mortality, they likely play a dominant role in food web interactions (e.g., trophic cascades) relative to planktivorous fishes. Biotic mechanisms, such as successful predator-avoidance behavior, omnivorous feeding habits, and seasonal variation in Mysis biomass, enhance the ability of Mysis to influence food web interactions from an intermediate trophic level.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAR	2000	129	2					569	583		10.1577/1548-8659(2000)129<0569:ZANRBI>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(2000)129<0569:ZANRBI>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000088635900020

The lakes are located in the territory of the Sikhote-Alin Biosphere Reserve, with unique ecosystems that combine warm- and cold-climate vegetation and where rare animals live. These lakes are natural archives, allowing the reconstruction of the natural environment of this unique area with a temporal resolution of up to 30 years. Nizhnee Lake, which developed over a period of 2640 years, is the most sensitive to climate change. Ten stages of the lake's evolution, with periods of watering and swamping, were identified and controlled by precipitation. Our study demonstrates how the communities of swamp plants and diatom microflora responded to temperature fluctuations associated with solar activity and regional manifestations of global climatic events. The regional drivers were the intensity of summer and winter monsoons, and the change in the positions of the atmosphere action and cyclonic activity centers. The natural environment was especially unstable during the Little Ice Age (14th-19th centuries), which was wet with short-term dry episodes. There is little information about moisture changes in different altitudinal belts in mountainous regions of the southern Russian Far East. We present ecological and taxonomic compositions of the diatom flora and identify the botanical composition of peat in small mountain lake/mire complexes located in the Central Sikhote-Alin Mountains, within large landslides on the paleovolcanic slopes. Frequent changes in diatom assemblages and peat-forming plants indicate unstable hydroclimatic conditions with varying degrees of wet and dry conditions up to the overgrowth of the lakes. Frequent change in sphagnum mosses with different trophic preferences was identified. The chronology is based on 11 radiocarbon dates. Accumulation rates reached 1.7-1.9 mm/year, and the temporal resolution for the reconstructions was up to 30-40 yr. The tendencies of lake evolution depended on different scale hydroclimatic changes over the last 4400 yr. The most detailed data for the last 2600 yr were obtained from the Nizhnee Lake sequence, which is more sensitive to climatic changes. The main reason for the change in the hydrological regime of the lakes was variations in precipitation during short-term climatic changes. The sediment record of moisture fluctuations is relatively well correlated with regional patterns reflecting summer monsoon intensity and cyclogenesis activity.

Jannicke			Seasonal forecasting of lake water quality and algal bloom risk using a continuous Gaussian Bayesian network	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Freshwater management is challenging, and advance warning that poor water quality was likely, a season ahead, could allow for preventative measures to be put in place. To this end, we developed a Bayesian network (BN) for seasonal lake water quality prediction. BNs have become popular in recent years, but the vast majority are discrete. Here, we developed a Gaussian Bayesian network (GBN), a simple class of continuous BN. The aim was to forecast, in spring, mean total phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration, mean water colour, and maximum cyanobacteria biovolume for the upcoming growing season (May-October) in Vansjempty set, a shallow nutrient-rich lake in southeastern Norway. To develop the model, we first identified controls on interannual variability in seasonally aggregated water quality. These variables were then included in a GBN, and conditional probability densities were fit using observations (<= 39 years). GBN predictions had R-2 values of 0.37 (chl a) to 0.75 (colour) and classification errors of 32 % (TP) to 17 % (cyanobacteria). For all but lake colour, including weather variables did not improve the predictive performance (assessed through cross-validation). Overall, we found the GBN approach to be well suited to seasonal water quality forecasting. It was straightforward to produce probabilistic predictions, including the probability of exceeding management-relevant thresholds. The GBN could be sensibly parameterised using only the observed data, despite the small dataset. Developing a comparable discrete BN was much more subjective and time-consuming Although low interannual variability and high temporal autocorrelation in the study lake meant the GBN performed only slightly better than a seasonal naive forecast (where the forecasted value is simply the value observed the previous growing season), we believe that the forecasting approach presented here could be particularly useful in areas with higher sensitivity to catchment nutrient delivery and seasonal climate and for forecasting at shorter (daily or monthly) timescales. Despite the parametric constraints of GBNs, their simplicity, together with the relative accessibility of BN software with GBN handling, means they are a good first choice for BN development with continuous variables.					; Sample, Jane/E-2403-2019; Clayer, Francois/I-6670-2015; Moe, S./AAC-8121-2020; Clayer, François/I-6670-2015	Jackson-Blake, Leah/0000-0002-4915-8779; Moe, Jannicke/0000-0002-3681-3551; Clayer, Francois/0000-0001-6939-400X; Sample, James/0000-0002-0861-3982; 													1027-5606	1607-7938				JUN 20	2022	26	12					3103	3124		10.5194/hess-26-3103-2022	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3103-2022													WOS:000813038500001

We study the consequences of such common environmental gradients on the demography of quagga mussels, one of the world's most aggressive invasive species. Coupling a series of in situ experiments with a biophysical model of the pelagic community, we quantify mussel growth and recruitment in littoral vs. profundal benthic habitats of eastern Lake Erie. We found that both severe food depletion and cold temperatures in the hypolimnion during summer stratification cause mussels to grow twice as slowly and currently inhibit recruitment in profundal compared to littoral habitats. Together with the high biomass and large mean mussel size found in long-term monitoring surveys in the profundal habitats, our results imply that mussels successfully colonizing profundal habitats have relatively long lifespans with low growth rates, and therefore lower productivity, compared to mussels in shallow areas. Consequently, the bulk of dreissenid biomass in Lake Erie and other Great Lakes found in the vast but resource-poor profundal habitats may have very limited impacts on epilimnetic communities compared to mussels in littoral areas. By contrast, mussels in profundal habitats strongly reduce food availability to hypolimnetic communities throughout the year. Thus, our results explain how the ecosystem impacts of sessile freshwater invaders are likely to vary among habitats and lakes depending on the relative size of profundal populations and the extent of stratification.					; Karatayev, Vadim/NHQ-2178-2025	Mehler, Knut/0000-0003-1302-3343; Karatayev, Vadim/0000-0001-7112-8069; Rowe, Mark/0000-0002-0852-3346; Burlakova, Lyubov/0000-0002-2995-919X													0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	2018	63	5					2065	2079		10.1002/lno.10924	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10924													WOS:000449045600014

The water level of Poyang Lake decreases continuously in autumn. The distribution elevation of wetland beach vegetation is constantly moving down and the distribution range is constantly expanding. The Polygonum criopolitanum community expansion at 9-12 m elevation (Yellow Sea elevation, the same below) has resulted in a significant decline in areas of mudflat and shallow water, and a significant change in habitat structure for overwintering migratory birds. Combined with field investigation, controlled experiments and statistical modeling were conducted to simulate Polygonum criopolitanum growth at 9-12 m elevation to establish its growth curve, effective growth time, growth rate, and fast-slow turning point. Polygonum criopolitanum growth rate was fastest in the 12 m elevation zone, and reached a maximum in only 22 days. After that, growth rate slowed down and tended to stagnate. Maximum growth rate of Polygonum criopolitanum in 10 and 11 m elevation zones occurred on the 31st and 46th days, respectively. At the inflection point, the Polygonum criopolitanum biomass accumulation rate was fast, then it gradually slowed down until it stopped. Polygonum criopolitanum growth and development at 9-11 m elevation was highly consistent with the arrival of overwintering migratory geese. Polygonum criopolitanum expansion at 9-11 m elevation created fine habitat conditions and rich food resources for populations of Soybean Goose, White Goose, Swan Goose and Cygnet, which was the fundamental reason for the formation of the Duchang Migratory Bird Reserve after 2003. This study is of scientific significance for studies of wetland vegetation community distribution and the promotion of reserve management.

The main component of food was macrophytes constituting 65.7% of the total food mass. Among the food components of animal origin the weight share of the larvae of Chironomidae prevailed. Seasonal differences in feeding of carp mainly concerned autumn, when a higher share of the representatives of Entomostraca was observed.

Multiple sediment variables including organic matter (OM) content, the stable carbon isotope signature of OM, low-frequency magnetic susceptibility and degree of humification, indicate that the regional paleoclimate played an important role in determining the nature of peat that accumulated. Based on comparison with other climate proxies, the bulk peat delta C-13 record was interpreted as an indicator of variation in the East Asian (EA) summer monsoon, and to a lesser extent, the Indian summer monsoon, during the last glacial period between similar to 49 and 10 cal ka BP. More negative bulk delta C-13 values reflect wetter and warmer conditions, and thus a strong EA summer monsoon. More positive values indicate drier and cooler conditions. A warm and wet period occurred between similar to 46 and 28 cal ka BP, implying a strengthening of the EA summer monsoon. A climate shift occurred at similar to 22 cal ka BP and the driest and coldest period appeared between similar to 19 and 16 cal ka BP, suggesting weakening of the EA summer monsoon. After similar to 12 cal ka BP, climate shifted towards wetter and warmer conditions again. It has been suggested that variations in orbitally induced solar insolation played a role in the last glacial climate of the study region. Several millennial-scale arid and cold phases characterized by C4 plants, or by more positive delta C-13 values during periods when C3 plants dominated, show agreement with the Greenland GISP2 ice core and the Chinese stalagmite records. Interactions between high northern latitude cold air advection and summer moisture transported across the tropical ocean, and the migration of the mean position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) would have favored these millennial-scale phases. Additionally, changes in heat transport to the North Atlantic would also have influenced climate in the region.					; Xue, Jibin/KTI-2699-2024; YU, Xuefeng/B-9332-2009	Xue, Jibin/0000-0003-1319-3377; yu, xue feng/0000-0001-9732-7568; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				OCT	2010	44	3					777	788		10.1007/s10933-010-9451-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-010-9451-3													WOS:000281973500003

However, most existing climate models produce unrealistic surface temperatures on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) lakes, and few studies have focused on the influence of ice surface albedo on high-altitude lakes. Based on field albedo measurements, moderate resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS) albedo products and numerical simulation, this study evaluates the ice albedo parameterization schemes in existing lake models and investigates the characteristics of the ice surface albedo in six typical TP lakes, as well as the influence of ice albedo error in the FLake model. Compared with observations, several ice albedo schemes all clearly overestimate the lake ice albedo by 0.26 to 0.66, while the average bias of MODIS albedo products is only 0.07. The MODIS-observed albedo of a snow-covered lake varies with the snow proportion, and the lake surface albedo in a snow-free state is approximately 0.15 during the frozen period. The MODIS-observed ice surface (snow-free) albedos are concentrated within the ranges of 0.14-0.16, 0.08-0.10 and 0.10-0.12 in Aksai Chin Lake, Nam Co Lake and Ngoring Lake, respectively. The simulated lake surface temperature is sensitive to variations in lake ice albedo especially in the spring and winter.					; Li, Zhaoguo/HPC-2048-2023; Su, Dongsheng/AAI-1211-2019; Ma, Yaoming/AAA-3248-2021	Lang, Jiahe/0000-0003-1948-4992; Su, Dongsheng/0000-0002-1546-4524; 													2072-4292					FEB	2018	10	2							218	10.3390/rs10020218	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs10020218													WOS:000427542100064

This study assesses the activity of enzymes secreted in bottom sediments collected from two lakes, aiming to determine the interaction between bottom sediments and water based on samples collected from lake bottoms and overlying water. The study measured the production of secreted enzymes via alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and acidic phosphatase (ACP) in two distinct environments. Sample collection encompassed two lakes within two diverse catchment types (agroforestry and forest) during spring and summer. The findings revealed higher ACP values than ALP in both lake environments, with higher enzyme values recorded in the lake with a typical forest catchment area. High values of enzymes were related to the pollutant's input into the lakes, suggesting that anthropogenic activities may have a substantial influence on the studied lakes. Principal component analysis (PCA) allowed the identification of a negative correlation between the enzymatic activity of phosphorus in bottom sediments and the content of organic phosphorus (org-P) in overlying waters only within the forest catchment, where the angle between the vectors representing primary variables is close to 180 degrees. The conducted statistical analysis demonstrated significant distinctions among the lakes concerning most of the examined parameters.					; Janicka, Ewelina/AAA-3202-2021	Janicka-Kubiak, Ewelina/0000-0001-9616-6184; Kanclerz, Jolanta/0000-0001-5871-0097; 														2076-3417				JAN	2024	14	2							497	10.3390/app14020497	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app14020497													WOS:001148990800001

PHYTOPLANKTON ABUNDANCE IN STANDING STOCK OF ORGANIC-MATTER IN LAKE WATER	WATER RESEARCH												The rapid increase of phytoplankton biomass was the major process for the increase of particulate organic matter in Lake Kasumigaura in 1980. During the first phytoplankton pulse in the bloom, relative abundance of each component of organic matter in the lake water was: dissolved organic matter 100, phytoplankton 28, bacteria 27 and detrital particle 27. This relative abundance was maintained as a steady-state oscillation throughout the spring bloom similar to that usually observed in moderately eutrophic waters. Thus, phytoplankton abundance in the standing stock of organic matter of the hypereutrophic water during the spring bloom does not show any marked difference from that of moderately eutrophic waters.																			0043-1354	1879-2448					1983	17	4					453	457		10.1016/0043-1354(83)90144-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(83)90144-6													WOS:A1983QH14200015

Estimated annual winter angling harvest increased from 3 smelt in 1962 to a peak of 234,865 fish in 1973, but has since been lower. Spring spawning runs were 1st noted in 1965, with peak numbers being taken by sport fishermen from 1970-1974. The structure of the spawning population showed a change in dominance from age group I-III in 1965, to age groups II-IV in 1972, and almost exclusively to age groups II-III in later years. Mean total length for fish in age groups I-III declined from 1965-1970, but since that time growth rate has remained relatively constant. Fecundity, significantly related to total length (P < 0.01), ranged from 4000 to 58,100 eggs. Most spawning in each year normally took place at night in the gravel riffles of tributary streams (190 eggs cm-2) at water temperatures of 7.degree.-11.degree. C. Some spawning (1-2 eggs cm-2) also occurred along the lake shore at water temperatures of 5.degree.-7.degree. C. Growth of the smelt population was concurrent with increased eutrophication of Lake Simcoe and a decline in lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) and lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) fisheries.																			0008-3550						1983	97	2					161	169																WOS:A1983SD64200004

Three moribund carp were necropsied and had signs consistent with spring viremia of carp (SVC) disease, including petechiae and ecchymotic hemorrhages on the skin, ascites, and edematous kidney and spleen. A virus was isolated on fathead minnow cells and shown to be a rhabdovirus by electron microscopy. Immunoassay results indicated a close serological relationship with spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV). This was confirmed by a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay and subsequent analysis of a subsection glycoprotein gene. Immunocytochemistry and serum neutralization tests indicated that the Cedar Lake isolate did not share complete antigenic identity with the European reference SVCV. Also, the isolate showed an inhibition of cytopathic effect after repeated subculture in epithelioma papulosum cyprini and bluegill fibroblast cells when compared with other SVCV isolates. In virus transmission studies the isolate was shown to be of low virulence for juvenile carp. Sequence analysis showed that the Cedar Lake SVCV isolate was more closely related to a recently isolated North Carolina strain of SVCV (98.6% nucleotide identity) and to strains of Asian origin rather than the European reference strain of SVCV. This is the first report of an SVC epizootic in a wild common carp population in North America.																			0899-7659	1548-8667				DEC	2004	16	4					169	178		10.1577/H03-064.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/H03-064.1													WOS:000226271100001

Potential emissions of these gases to the atmosphere at ice melt were estimated from their concentration profiles in the water column under ice during winter. The concentrations of CH4, CO2 and N2O increased with the depth, but the year-to-year variations were low. Carbon dioxide contributed to 99% of the global warming potential (GWP) of the total springtime GHG emissions which ranged from 103 to 128 g CO2-equivalents m(-2). The results indicated that these kinds of northern mesotrophic lakes are not important sources of CH4 and N2O, but are probably significant sources of CO2.																			1239-6095					OCT 22	2004	9	5					421	427																WOS:000226806100008

In the present study, we examined the effect of temperature [ambient river temperature (ART) vs ART+2 degrees C], dissolved oxygen (DO; 100% vs 80%) and substrate (presence vs absence) on standard metabolic rate, forced maximum metabolic rate and metabolic scope with Fulton's condition factor (K), energy density (ED) and critical thermal maximum (CTmax) in age-0 Lake Sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, before and after a simulated overwintering event. We found that all the environmental variables strongly influenced survival, K, ED and CT max. Fish reared in elevated temperature showed higher mortality and reduced K pre-winter at 127 days post-hatch (dph). Interestingly, we did not find any significant difference in terms of metabolic rate between treatments at both sampling points of pre- and post-winter. Long-term exposure to 80% DO reduced ED in Lake Sturgeon post-winter at 272 dph. Our data suggest that substrate should be removed at the onset of exogenous feeding to enhance the survival rate of age-0 Lake Sturgeon in the first year of life. Effects of early rearing environment during larval development on survival over winter are discussed with respect to successful recruitment of stock enhanced Lake Sturgeon, a species that is at risk throughout its natural range.					; Yoon, Gwangseok/AAH-4714-2021	Yoon, Gwangseok/0000-0001-5557-8692; 													2051-1434					OCT 11	2019	7									10.1093/conphys/coz055	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/conphys/coz055								31620291					WOS:000582275300001

We used data from the iron-meromictic Waldsee, Germany, a lignite mine pit lake, to quantify the contribution of single solutes to water density and analyzed the density gradient. Iron meromictic lakes maintain their density gradient through chemical reactions. Hence, quantifying the contributions of separate solutes is essential for understanding the entire process. Based on solute concentrations and literature values of partial molal volumes, substance specific density contributions were quantitatively evaluated. Then, by direct measurements of the density of IHSS Waskish peat fulvic acid, we quantified the density contribution of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). While several solutes contributed to the density throughout the water column, only those substances that occurred at higher concentrations in the anoxic monimolimnion than in the oxic mixolimnion were crucial to sustaining the density difference between the two layers. In Waldsee, the density difference between monimolimnion and mixolimnion was attributed to dissolved Fe2+ (0.23 g/L, resulting in a 45 % of the density difference due to solutes) and to the carbonate system (HCO3 (-), about 0.16 g/L and CO2, 0.03 g/L) while Ca2+ and DOC delivered only a small contribution. In summer, total density differences were dominated by temperature differences; during winter, solutes sustained meromixis. Finally, we present a complete list of specific density fractions for basically all of the density-relevant substances in fresh waters.

This paper aims to quantify seasonal variations in the mobility of these elements in the Shibukuro and Tama rivers, which are fed by the thermal waters of the Obuki spring, caused by sorption onto hydrous ferric oxide (HFO). Seasonal observations revealed the following relationships with respect to As removal by HFO: (a) the oxidation of Fe2+ is predominantly controlled by both pH and water temperature, and progresses more quickly in less acidic and warmer conditions; (b) HFO formation was predominantly controlled by pH; and (c) the removal of dissolved arsenate is directly related to the amount of HFO present. Consequently, the oxidation to Fe3+ was slower during periods of cold and lower pH, and the amount of HFO was too small to remove the dissolved arsenate effectively. Consequently, considerable amounts of dissolved arsenate and Fe2+ remained in river water. In contrast, when HFO production from Fe3+ increased, and dissolved arsenate was removed during warmer and less acidic periods, only small amounts of dissolved arsenite and Fe2+ remained in the river water. The geochemical behavior of Ga and In was essentially controlled by pH; however, when HFO production was limited by a pH of less than 3.5, Ga behavior was controlled mainly by the amount of HFO. Gallium tended to be sorbed under more acidic conditions than was In. Due to differences in sorption behavior, Ga, As, and In were fractionated during sedimentation. In the upstream reaches, arsenate and dissolved Ga sorbed onto HFO, and were widely distributed across the watershed. Conversely, dissolved In was removed by HFO downstream. As a result, In is relatively concentrated on the downstream lakebed, unlike As and Ga, and In-rich mineral deposits are accumulating at present. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Taihu Lake is connected to many inflow rivers, which contribute to the water resource but also to its pollution. Investigating the correlation between water quality, bacterial community structure, and land-use types is essential for pollution control. Yet, few studies have been conducted on all the major inflow rivers of Taihu Lake. This study aimed to assess the bacterial community composition of major inflow rivers of the lake and determine the relationship between the bacterial community, water quality, and land-use. Water samples were collected from ten inflow rivers across four seasons in 2019-2020. DNA extracted from the samples was used for 16S rRNA gene-targeted next-generation sequencing to determine the bacterial community structures. Thirteen physicochemical and microbiological parameters were used to assess the water quality, and the land-use pattern surrounding each sampling location was also profiled. The bacterial community composition demonstrated significant seasonal variation. In summer, the community variation was correlated with chlorophyll a, pH, and phosphate-P, and electric conductivity, nitrate-N, and ammonium-N in winter. Rivers in the northwest were more nutrient-rich than those in the southwest. The industrial, residential, and agricultural land-use categories correlated strongly with the bacterial community composition and water nutrient parameters. Accordingly, farmland drainage, untreated domestic wastewater, and industrial pollution were identified as the major objectives for more effective water quality management in the region.

Although modern-day solar cycles arc well known, they have been less studied over geological time. High-resolution records such as varves have been previously used for reconstructing solar cycles from the Paleoproterozoic through Quaternary. In this paper, very fine (<1 mm) sedimentary laminations of the Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation in Xiushui Basin were studied in Northern Liaoning Province, North China. Two different microfacies of the striped shale in the Third Member of the Yixian Formation were identified. These include the light-gray to gray siltstone (Mf 1) and the gray to black organic-rich mudstone (Mf 2). Laminations of Mf 2 are mainly made of biofilms. Sub-millimeter scaled couplets of biofilm and siliciclasticrich sublamina record seasonal growth and withering of microbial mats during the warm season (summer) and cold season (winter), respectively. Evolutionary spectral analyses of three binary rank series (the binary boxcar series, triangle series, and midpoint-triangle series), varve couplet thickness and gray scale image data (gray data) show multiple periodicities consistent with solar cycles, including the robust Schwabe sunspot cycle (10.0-10.6 year) and solar Bruckner cycle (31.0-40.6 year), and relatively weaker signals for the solar Hale cycle (21.9 year) and 16.5-year solar cycles that have been linked to solar magnetic activity. Solar cycles recognized in this paper indicate the total solar irradiance (TSI) influenced microbial mat growth in the Early Cretaceous in North China. Further, we extend our new record with a compilation of varve-recorded sunspot cycles throughout geological time to show that the 11-year Schwabe sunspot cycle and the 22-year Hale cycle have persisted since the Paleoproterozoic.					; Ibarra, Daniel/E-6141-2013; Kukla, Tyler/AAQ-6967-2021	Huang, He/0000-0002-5744-4273; Tian, Xing/0000-0003-0063-433X; Ibarra, Daniel/0000-0002-9980-4599; 													0002-9599	1945-452X				NOV	2021	321	9					1285	1307		10.2475/09.2021.01	http://dx.doi.org/10.2475/09.2021.01													WOS:000729486800001

Evaluation of water quality in an urban park for environmental sensitization: A large scale simulation model	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT					International Conference on Water Science and Technology - Integrated Management of Water Resources	OCT 16-19, 2008	Athens, GREECE					Urban parks are important components of the urban environment since they are critical to improving livelihoods and the environment in densely populated cities, offering also shelter to several wildlife species and opportunities for outdoor educational activities. The park of Environmental Information and Sensitization "Antonis Tritsis" is the largest park of the Athens metropolitan area (similar to 1.15 km(2)) including an artificial system of six large reservoirs referred as lakes of total surface of approximately 6 hectares (5-6% of its total surface) constituting the largest surface of fresh water within the city structure. The aforementioned system is a "controlled" one since it is fed by two distinctly different, monitored water sources, namely the pumped local water and the occasional runoff from rains. The bottom of the "lakes" is covered by geomembrane allowing the system to be considered as a very large scale simulation experiment. The results obtained provide insight into the biochemical functioning of the water system which constitutes a useful tool as a model. Two seasonal samplings were carried out, the first during the dry summer period when water supply for the lakes is provided exclusively from a local drilling and the second in autumn of 2007 directly after an intense rainfall. The physicochemical parameters measured were temperature, conductivity, suspended particulate matter, dissolved oxygen and pH and those directly related to eutrophication were ammonium, nitrites, nitrates, phosphates, chlorophyll a and dissolved organic carbon. The microbial charge was also assessed through analyses of Enterococci, Coliforms and Escherichia coli. From the results obtained it became clear that water deriving from the drilling has high concentrations of nitrates and the microbiological parameters studied. Runoff, which washes out the nearby urban area, introduces significant quantities of nutrients, mostly phosphates, to the lake system. In the wetland in the northern part of the park, where lakeside vegetation is abundant, concentrations of both nitrates and phosphates are significantly reduced. Measurements of dissolved organic carbon and chlorophyll a indicate increased algal presence in the central lakes, linked to a certain extent to aesthetic deterioration.

In the core region of EASM, however, few terrestrial paleoclimate records have been utilized to examine EASM characteristics except for oxygen isotope (delta 18O) records from stalagmites since the last glacial period. Consequently, the driving mechanisms of EASM evolution have remained unresolved. Here, we present the longest and highest-resolution drilling core from Lake Chaohu, located in the Yangtze River Basin within the core region of the Asian monsoon, which uniquely records EASM variability since 36 ka (thousands of years before 1950 AD) on a millennial timescale. The sedimentary geochemistry, grain size, and magnetic susceptibility of the core are used to reconstruct East Asian summer monsoon index (EASMI). These records document a relatively weak EASM during the period of 35.7-13.5 ka, a high EASMI from 13.5 to 8.4 ka, and a gradually decreasing EASMI after 8.4 ka. Notably, the Heinrich and Younger Dryas events are well documented in the sediment, reflecting significant climate variability. These results are remarkably consistent with delta 18O records from Greenland ice cores and the Indian summer monsoon; however, some discrepancies are observed when compared with Chinese stalagmite records. By contrasting these findings with global hydroclimatic records, we demonstrate that changes in EASM on a millennial scale were driven by high- and low-latitude forcings on different periods. During the last glaciation, the influences of the ice sheet activity in northern high-latitude area and the westerlies dominated. In the last deglaciation, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) had an important effect on EASM by regulating the climate of low-latitude Indo-Pacific region. During the Holocene, low-latitude summer insolation emerged as the key driver of EASM, indicating a strong linkage of EASM to orbital forcings, which changed in concert with the modern EASM circulation. Our findings highlight the dynamic nature of the monsoon system throughout different climatic periods.

J	Kocovsky, PM; Carline, RF				Kocovsky, PM; Carline, RF			Dynamics of the unexploited walleye population of Pymatuning Sanctuary, Pennsylvania, 1997-1998	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Studies on the dynamics of unexploited fish populations are rare in the fisheries literature. The purpose of this research was to describe the dynamics of the unexploited population of walleyes Stizostedion vitreum of Pymatuning Sanctuary, a 530-ha eutrophic impoundment in northwestern Pennsylvania. We sampled walleyes with trap nets during the spring spawning runs in March and April 1997-1998. We estimated spawning adult abundance using the Schnabel multiple mark-recapture method and used walleye ages estimated from scales and otoliths for growth and mortality analyses. Population estimates of spawning adult walleyes were 29,693 and 23,298 fish in 1997 and 1998, respectively, or 56 and 44 fish/ha. The adult population was composed mostly of individuals greater than 500 turn total length. Compared with other populations, growth was excellent for juveniles but poor for adults. Average annual adult mortality was 32-41%, which is within the range of values reported for other exploited and unexploited populations but higher than we anticipated for an unexploited population. Recruitment of young walleyes to spawning age was low and dependent largely on first-winter mortality and possibly cannibalism. This population conforms to most predictions for unexploited populations: high density, high proportion of large individuals, slow growth, and relatively low mortality.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				FEB	2001	21	1					178	187		10.1577/1548-8675(2001)021<0178:DOTUWP>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8675(2001)021<0178:DOTUWP>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000174289000018
J	Tamminen, T; Andersen, T				Tamminen, Timo; Andersen, Tom			Seasonal phytoplankton nutrient limitation patterns as revealed by bioassays over Baltic Sea gradients of salinity and eutrophication	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The in situ P versus N limitation of northern Baltic Sea phytoplankton was studied over 3 seasonal cycles at 6 locations, encompassing the large-scale salinity and eutrophy gradients of the Baltic Sea. Limitation patterns were inferred from 170 time-series (3 d) experiments with a replicated factorial experimental design, analyzed using a novel model selection-based classification. Seven limitation classes describe exclusive and primary limitation by N, P, combined N and P, or none. Response parameters were chlorophyll a (chl a) and primary productivity. Although chl a responses reported more N-limited, and C-14 responses more P-limited cases, the responses of both parameters were highly similar. Distinct seasonal patterns of in situ P versus N limitation were evident, reproducible, and dissimilar even in closely related environments. The most pristine low-saline areas were dominantly P-limited, while more eutrophied areas showed predominant N limitation even at comparable salinities. The typical Baltic Sea surface salinity regions (5 to 6 PSU) were clearly N-limited either for summer months (e.g. the mildly eutrophied Bothnian Sea), or throughout the growth season (e.g. the eutrophied Gulf of Finland), although terrestrial loading ratios for the Baltic Sea exceed the Redfield ratio several-fold. The commonly vigorous N-2-fixing cyanobacterial blooms in the southern basins do not alleviate the basic N-limitation pattern, and do not appear in the summertime N-limited Bothanian Sea. Management strategies should include toning down the N-limited spring bloom in eutrophied areas, which fuels summertime P release from sediments, in turn favoring cyanobacteria. Terrestrial nutrient loading does not reach offshore areas without significant modification and loss, emphasizing the role of coastal zones in global nutrient cycles and stoichiometry.

The excavations expose a succession of sedimentary units, containing an artifact assemblage assigned to the Acheulean techno-complex. Unit VI, attributed to the Marine Isotope Stage 13, is rich in ostracod valves and was chosen for the present environmental study. From these sediments Heterocypris sauna, H. incongruens, Cyprideis torosa, Ilyocypris cf. bradyi, I. inermis, I. cf. gibba, Darwinula stevensoni, Plesiocypridopsis newtoni, Pseudocandona compressa, Candona cf. neglecta, Pseudocandona sp., Trajancypris sp., Physocypria sp. and Mixtacandona sp. are documented for the first time in the Middle Pleistocene of the arid environment of central Syria. Data from these microfossils as well as geochemical proxies implicate three phases, turning the wetland from a palustrine setting into a spring supplied pond with increasing salinity. The high mineralization of the spring waters enables a discussion about early hominin adaptability to brackish waters as drinking water resources, common within the steppe and desert environments along the 'but-of-Africa" corridor in the eastern Mediterranean.

The specimens were collected from Karapinar Spring (Bolu, Turkey) between October 2009 and November 2010. The species were observed throughout the year. Psychrodromus olivaceus showed relatively constant Mg/Ca ratios during the study period, whereas those of P. similis showed more variability. The ratio was also significantly different (P < 0.05) between the two species. We did not find significant correlation between water temperature and either of the species' Mg/Ca ratios. The stable isotope record for P. similis was very patchy, showing a small range of values consistent with the groundwater source, similar to the behavior of Sr/Ca. The Sr/Ca ratio displayed little variation throughout the year, suggesting hydrochemical stability over time, most likely in response to the groundwater source. The stable isotope data displayed pronounced variability for P. similis but little for P. olivaceus, suggesting that the former may be responding to seasonality, whereas the latter responds to groundwater.

The intervening interglacial stage is represented by well-preserved varves with calcitic (summer) and clastic (winter) laminae. There is a tight coupling between climate-driven lithologic changes and magnetic susceptibility variations, and stable paleomagnetic components were retrieved from all investigated lithologies including the largely diamagnetic calcite varves. These components were used to delineate a sequence of magnetic polarity reversals that was interpreted as a record of excursions of the Earth's magnetic field. Comparison of the magnetostratigraphic results with previously published data allows discussion of two possible models which have generated controversy regarding the age of the Pianico Formation. The data indicates that the Pianico Formation magnetostratigraphy correlates to geomagnetic field excursions across the Brunhes/ Matuyama transition, and consequently the Pianico interglacial correlates to marine isotope stage 19. This correlation option is substantially consistent with K-Ar radiometric age estimates recently obtained from a tephra layer interbedded in the Pianico Formation. The alternative option, considering the Pianico interglacial correlative to marine isotope stage 11 within the Brunhes Chron as supported by tephrochronological dating reported in the literature, is not supported by the magnetostratigraphic results.

Stable isotope analysis of consumer food webs indicates ecosystem recovery following prolonged drought in a subtropical estuarine lake	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Assessing changes in food-web structure provides a useful monitoring tool for gauging the resilience of ecosystems in the face of climatic impacts. We consider the ecological resilience of a large estuarine lake (St Lucia Estuary, South Africa) in the wake of an extreme climatic event (prolonged drought). Using carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes, food-web structure was assessed at five sites across the estuary during the winter and spring of 2013. Sampling occurred approximately three years after heavy rains flooded the system and returned it to a relatively diluted state following an almost decade-long drought that decimated food webs in the upper parts of the estuary due to hypersalinity effects. Comparisons of niche width and variance of consumer food webs among sites revealed a general homogenisation of food webs across the entire system, contrasting with the spatial differentiation of food webs documented during the drought phase. Our results indicate that the estuary is able to maintain ecological resilience at the whole-system level in the face of an extreme drought. This is likely facilitated by source pools of species residing in the relatively stable lower estuary, which are able to rapidly recolonise areas denuded by drought in the upper estuary.

Relationships among zooplankton groups and environmental factors at a nearshore site in Lake Michigan during 2007-2022	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Sampling was conducted in southeast Lake Michigan at a nearshore 17-m deep site off Muskegon, MI during 2007 -2022 to evaluate how the zooplankton assemblage responds to differing environmental conditions, including temperature, tributary flow, and chlorophyll concentration. Three small-bodied groups composed over 65 % of overall zooplankton assemblage: diaptomid copepodites (24 %), Dreissena veligers (21 %), and Bosmina spp. (21 %). Dreissena veligers have become one of the predominant groups in the nearshore, whereas cyclopoid copepodites have become less prevalent compared to historical data from the 1970s and 1990s. Zooplankton composition exhibited strong seasonal patterns that reflected the life cycles of the main groups, with Bosmina , other cladocerans and veligers most important in summer when overall abundance was highest and adult or immature diaptomid copepods dominating the assemblage the rest of the year. Ordination analysis revealed differences among years in zooplankton assemblages, in particular, the three major groups, diaptomid copepodites, Bosmina , Dreissena veligers, were well separated. Both diaptomids and Diacyclops were associated with years with higher potential resource availability (i.e., tributary flow, TP, chlorophyll) and cooler temperatures. On the other hand, Bosmina were associated with years with warm spring air temperatures and low resource availability and veligers were associated with high Secchi depths. Years with strong contributions of both diaptomid and Diacyclops copepodites and adults were separated from years with strong contributions of Cercopagis pengoi , the predominant predatory cladoceran, whereas there was overlap between Bosmina and Cercopagis . Multiple invasive species and environmental factors have complex interactions that affect the current zooplankton assemblage in the nearshore.

J	Cannaby, H; White, M; Bowyer, P				Cannaby, H.; White, M.; Bowyer, P.			Dynamical response to differential rates of temperature change over sloping topography: Lough Corrib, Ireland	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												An enclosed water body, subjected to a uniform surface heat flux, exhibits differential rates of temperature change between shallow peripheral waters and adjacent deeper waters. The result is the formation of horizontal temperature gradients in regions of sloping topography, referred to as topographic temperature gradients ( TTGs). An integrated observational and numerical study has been undertaken, considering the impact of TTGs on the basin-scale dynamics of Lough Corrib, Ireland. Temperature time series recorded during the winter of 2001 revealed sustained surface temperature gradients parallel to sloping boundaries. Cold, dense water formed in peripheral regions of the lake cascaded down slope under the influence of gravity, forming density plumes that extended over horizontal scales of kilometers. Plumes were typically 8-12 m thick and traveled down slope at speeds in the range 4-10 cm s(-1). Down-slope cascading of cool water was typically initiated when the daily mean surface heat flux fell below -55 W m(-2), meaning cascading occurred almost persistently throughout the period of seasonal cooling ( from early September until early January). While cascading plumes exhibited a diurnal periodicity, individual cascading events were linked to the passing of weather systems, persisting for between 5 hours and 3.6 days. The cascading of dense water formed an important mechanism for the transport of peripheral waters to depth, greatly increasing rates of lake overturning and preventing stagnation during cool, calm conditions. The offshore transport owing to cascading was balanced by a weaker and more diffuse onshore flow within the upper 5 m of the water column. Quasi-geostrophic alongshore currents, evident in the modeled velocity field, formed a basin-scale anticyclonic gyre during calm conditions.						white, martin/0000-0003-3271-1221													2169-9275	2169-9291				SEP 14	2007	112	C9							C09009	10.1029/2006JC003890	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2006JC003890													WOS:000249519600001

Drainage events from a glacier-dammed lake, Bear Glacier, Alaska: Remote sensing and field observations	GEOMORPHOLOGY												We investigated drainage events from a glacier-dammed lake on Bear Glacier, Alaska, and associated outburst floods and hazards. The glacier-dammed lake, which we call Ice Lake, is 17.5 km up-glacier from Bear Glacier's terminus at Bear Glacier Lake. We combine field observations and remote sensing to examine temporal changes in the size of Ice Lake, the frequency and timing of its drainage, and down-glacier propagation of its outburst floods. We found that in recent years, Ice Lake has likely drained every year or two, in late summer or fall (August-October), with outbursts generally following the damming of sufficient water to create a lake area of between 035 and 0.5 km(2). Ice Lake has migrated downvalley to the south since the 1990s, likely as a result of thinning of the glacier that dams it. In situ measurements of a drainage event in October 2010 showed that Ice Lake drained over a period of days, which manifested at Bear Glacier Lake as a gradual, multiday increase and then decrease in water levels. Glacial lake outburst flooding at Bear Glacier creates risks for sea kayakers in Bear Glacier Lake and may be relevant to understanding the effects of climate warming on glacier-dammed and proglacial lakes.

We performed a pan-European lake mesocosm experiment on periphyton colonization covering five countries along a north/south geographical/temperature gradient (Estonia, Germany, Czech Republic, Turkey, and Greece). Periphyton biomass on artificial polypropylene strips exposed at 50 cm water depth at low and high nutrient regimes (with mean total phosphorus concentration of 20 and 65 mu g L-1, respectively) was compared during mid-summer. No significant effect of nutrient loading on periphyton biomass was observed as nutrient concentrations in the mesocosms were generally above limiting values. Water temperature significantly enhanced summer periphyton biomass development. Additionally, direct and indirect top-down control of snails and fish emerged as a significant factor in periphyton biomass control.

Geospatial coherence of surface-atmosphere fluxes in the upper Great Lakes region	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Surface-atmosphere fluxes are known to vary at multiple time scales, but uncertainty is high as to how fluxes change spatially within regions. With an increase in the number of eddy covariance towers, we are now able to examine the geospatial coherence of ecosystem fluxes, using time-series correlation. Eighteen sites from Michigan and Wisconsin were used in this study, ranging from 100 m to 600 km apart. Surface-atmosphere fluxes from a six-month period were used to quantify spatial coherence on a pair-wise basis. Using geospatial statistics, carbon and sensible heat (H) fluxes were found to be 95% correlated directly outside of their flux footprint and 56% correlated up to a distance of similar to 35 km. Latent (LE) and momentum (tau) fluxes were less correlated, 83% directly outside of their flux footprint and 40% at a distance of similar to 130 km albeit, at a much larger spatial distance than for the carbon and sensible heat fluxes. All fluxes showed strong spectral resonance at diel and seasonal timescales, with 1-, 2- and 3-month periods being common modes of variability among H, LE, and tau fluxes. Results based on Empirical Orthogonal Function show distinct transitions of net ecosystem exchange from fall to winter before photosynthesis or respiration while H and tau do not exhibit coherent trends. This work demonstrates the potential of quantifying geospatial coherence of surface-atmosphere fluxes in the Midwestern United States, with the ability to predict fluxes beyond the spatial limit of a single flux tower footprint. Ultimately, expanding the flux measurements to larger scales would allow better spatial scaling of terrestrial surface-atmosphere fluxes between tower footprint and modeling or remote sensing scales.					; Gutmann, Ethan/I-5728-2012; Chen, Jiquan/D-1955-2009; Desai, Ankur/A-5899-2008	Dahlin, Kyla/0000-0002-6016-2605; Desai, Ankur/0000-0002-5226-6041; Chen, Jiquan/0000-0003-0761-9458													0168-1923	1873-2240				DEC 15	2020	295								108188	10.1016/j.agrformet.2020.108188	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2020.108188													WOS:000582305500020
J	Sherlock, RL				Sherlock, RL			The relationship between the McLaughlin gold-mercury deposit and active hydrothermal systems in the Geysers-Clear Lake area, northern Coast Ranges, California	ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS												The Geysers-Clear Lake area has a long history of research on its active hydrothermal systems. It is a unique area containing a number of hydrothermal systems which include: the Geysers steam field, one of the largest vapor-dominated geothermal systems yet recognized; the McLaughlin gold deposit, an extremely well preserved hot-spring style gold deposit; and the Sulphur Bank mercury deposit, one of the first locations where geothermal systems were recognized as modem analogues to epithermal deposits. There is also a variety of active hot- and mineral-springs, including Wilbur Springs, or the Sulphur Creek district, which has been considered one of the type localities for connate fluids. The McLaughlin gold-mercury deposit is a fossil hot-spring system dominated by meteoric waters that exchanged with sedimentary rocks of the Great Valley sequence. Mineralization was syntectonic, occurring contemporaneously with fault movement. The fluids circulated in syntectonic dilation zones that resulted in, and maintained, high permeability of the fluid conduits permitting large volumes of fluid flow. The fluids precipitated metals in response to physical and chemical changes associated with boiling. The hydrothermal fluids that formed the McLaughlin deposit have the highest reservoir temperature, salinity and are isotopically the most enriched, of the Coast Range hydrothermal systems. The McLaughlin deposit is considered an end-member "fluid-dominated" hydrothermal system. The Geysers steam field, in its earliest phase was likely similar to the McLaughlin deposit being fluid-dominated and forming, at least on a small scale, a vein system enriched in silver and anomalous in gold, base metals, antimony and mercury. The hydrothermal system evolved into a vapor-dominated system as a result of decreased permeability of the reservoir, decreased recharge and/or increased heat flow. The modem day reservoir is encapsulated in impermeable rocks and is a "vapor-dominated" end-member hydrothermal system. Active hot- and mineral-springs in the Coast Ranges of northern California are intermediate between the fluid- and vapor-dominated end-member systems. The chemical and isotopic compositions of these fluids are the result of thermal processes and are not explained by simple mixing models between connate fluids and meteoric groundwater. Their isotopic and chemical composition is best explained by meteoric-dominated systems with repeated non-equilibrium subsurface vapor loss (evaporation) in a near closed system, with the relative deuterium and O-18 enrichment proportional to the reservoir temperature.

Here, we present a 350,000-year record of past water table fluctuations in Devils Hole 2 cave that are driven by variations in recharge amount to the local groundwater flow system. Because of the unprecedented length and precision of our record, we can observe variations in regional moisture availability over the last three glacial-interglacial cycles at a millennial-scale resolution. The timing of past water table rises and falls (>9 m in amplitude) closely coincides with the expansion and reduction of Northern Hemisphere ice volume, which in turn influences the position and intensity of westerly winter storms on orbital time scales. Superimposed on this long-term trend are millennial-scale highstands recorded during the last glaciation that coincide with North Atlantic Heinrich events. Earlier millennial-scale highstands provide the first evidence of multiple short-lived wet periods in the SW United States linked to coeval cooling intervals in the North Atlantic during marine isotope stages 6 and 8. The Devils Hole 2 water table record is currently the longest independently dated paleomoisture record in the SW United States and thus provides a critical testbed to examine the controls on regional moisture availability over larger time scales.					; Edwards, R./I-3124-2014; Cheng, Hai/H-3413-2017; CHENG, HAI/H-3413-2017; Dublyansky, Yuri/AAM-6110-2020	Spotl, Christoph/0000-0001-7167-4940; Wendt, Kathleen/0000-0001-8905-5013; Cheng, Hai/0000-0002-5305-9458; Dublyansky, Yuri/0000-0003-1433-9999; Moseley, Gina/0000-0002-5618-5759; 													2375-2548					OCT	2018	4	10							eaau1375	10.1126/sciadv.aau1375	http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aau1375								30397648					WOS:000449221200056

However, the temporal characterization of SDS activity and its possible driving factors have yet to be thoroughly investigated. Here, we studied the temporal variations of the SDS activities in the Aral Sea during 2000-2020 based on the Enhanced Dust Index (EDI), then investigated the relative importance of different drivers of SDS activities during the different phases. The findings revealed that the SDS activities increased during the past 20 years (2000-2020). The spring season is the most active period of SDS, especially in April. Additionally, the peak date of SDS activities has arrived earlier in recent years (2019-2020). Both climate and terrestrial factors strongly influence the temporal characteristics of SDS. The main driving factors of SDS actives vary in different phases. From 2000 through 2005, wind speed is the primary driving factor (r = 0.867, p < 0.001). From 2006 to 2015, the SDS activities were dominated by soil characteristics and water area. Although SDS activity experienced a quiet period in 2016 due to lake recovery and changes in soil water content, the regional drought manifested by precipitation and relative humidity has played a vital role in the active SDS since 2016. The regional drought and continued falling water level will increase the SDS risk in 5-10 years. The Pre-Aral region-Amu Darya delta is the most vulnerable region to SDS because of its location downwind from the SDS source area. The study findings provide essential information for the prevention and mitigation of SDSs in the Aral Sea region. Given the growing uncertainty about the Aral Sea crisis, more attention should be paid to the SDS risk assessment, providing a scientific basis for regional sustainable development.

However, most studies focus on Quaternary records, and few focus on pre-Quaternary periods due to preservation condition and stratigraphic resolution limitations. Favorable conditions for the preservation of annual laminae are recorded during the Eocene in the Shahejie Formation in the Bohai Bay Basin (BBB), which is an ideal place for studying solar activity cycles. Here, the sedimentary petrology and cyclostratigraphy of 202-m-thick lacustrine finegrained sedimentary rocks during the Eocene from Well Niuye-1 were analyzed. Power spectrum analysis and evolutive harmonic analysis (EHA) of the gray values reveal prominent periodicities of 11.7-19.6 mm, 3.7-4.95 mm and 1.69-2.21 mm, interpreted as Gleissberg cycles, solar Hale cycles and Schwabe sunspot cycles, respectively. Laminar couplets of light and dark laminae have an average thickness of 189 mu m, and their annual origin has been interpreted on meter, centimeter and millimeter scales. The light laminae, composed of pure calcite, likely precipitated during summer. The dark laminae, which are mixtures of clay minerals, quartz debris and organic matter, likely precipitated during winter. The dark laminae are thin, contributing little to the overall thicknesses of the annual laminae except for the abruptly thicker laminae deposited every 10-11 years. The coherent periods at different scales match the solar activity cycles well. The obvious solar activity cycles during the Eocene of the Shahejie Formation in the BBB suggest that solar activity did not significantly change during the transitional period from a greenhouse to an icehouse climate.

J	Liu, JZX; Heller, V; Wang, Y; Yin, KL				Liu, Jizhixian; Heller, Valentin; Wang, Yang; Yin, Kunlong			Investigation of subaerial landslide-tsunamis generated by different mass movement types using smoothed particle hydrodynamics	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY												Subaerial landslide-tsunamis (SLTs) are generated by mass movements such as landslides, rockfalls, debris flows and iceberg calving impacting water bodies, posing significant hazards to humans and infrastructure. Events like the 2014 Lake Askja rockslide and the 2022 Capito<acute accent>lio toppling cases highlight their potential dangers. SLT characteristics depend on the mass movement type (MMT) such as sliding, falling or overturning (toppling). While most SLT studies have focused on sliding masses, the wave characteristics generated by other MMTs remain poorly understood. This study addresses this shortcoming, based on a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), by examining how falling and overturning MMTs affect SLT properties through 26 tests in a numerical basin involving square and round blocks. The overturning MMT generates up to 5.58 larger maximum wave amplitudes aM and 3.85 larger heights HM than the falling MMT, aligned with theoretical predictions. Wave decay ratios for the overturning versus falling MMTs exceed 2 near the mass impact area, however, they generally decrease with the propagation distance r, as the steeper waves generated by the overturning MMT decay more rapidly. Empirical equations for the wave generation and propagation characteristics were derived in function of the Froude number, block geometry, r and the wave propagation angle. The same numerical framework was applied to the deadly 2022 Capito<acute accent>lio toppling case involving the case-specific slide geometry, bathymetry and topography. The numerical aM and HM deviated by 35.38% and 12.45%, respectively, from 2.52 and 8.93 m predicted by the new equations in this study. Furthermore, wave properties generated by the falling and overturning MMTs were compared with existing empirical predictions for sliding MMTs. This shows that sliding MMTs typically produce larger waves, except for smaller relative masses, for which they may generate smaller waves than both falling and overturning MMTs. These findings are aimed at improving the reliability of preliminary landslide-tsunami hazard assessment based on empirical equations.

C.; Usman, Muhammad			Dynamics of Runoff Quantity in an Urbanizing Catchment: Implications for Runoff Management Using Nature-Based Retention Wetland	HYDROLOGY												Rapid suburbanization can alter catchment flow regime and increase stormwater runoff, posing threats to sensitive ecosystems. Applications of Nature-based Solutions (NbS) have increasingly been adopted as part of integrated water management efforts to tackle the hydrological impact of urbanization with co-benefits for improved urban resilience, sustainability, and community well-being. However, the implementation of NbS can be hindered by gaps in performance assessment. This paper introduces a physically based dynamic modeling approach to assess the performance of a nature-based storage facility designed to capture excess runoff from an urbanizing catchment (Armstrong Creek catchment) in Geelong, Australia. The study adopts a numerical modelling approach, supported by extensive field monitoring of water levels over a 2.5-year period. The model provides a decision support tool for Geelong local government in managing stormwater runoff to protect Lake Connewarre, a Ramsar-listed wetland under the Port Phillip Bay (Western Shoreline) and Bellarine Peninsula. Runoff is currently managed via a set of operating rules governing gate operations that prevents flows into the ecological sensitive downstream waterbody from December to April (drier periods in summer and most of autumn). Comparison with observed water level data at three monitoring stations for a continuous simulation period of May 2022 to October 2024 demonstrates satisfactory to excellent model performance (NSE: 0.55-0.79, R2: 0.80-0.89, ISE rating: excellent). Between 1670 x 103 m3 and 2770 x 103 m3 of runoff was intercepted by the nature-based storage facility, representing a 56-70% reduction in stormwater discharge into Lake Connewarre. Our model development underscores the importance of understanding and incorporating user interventions (gate operations and emergency pumping) from the standard operation plan to better manage catchment runoff. As revealed by the seasonal flow analysis for consecutive years, adaptive runoff management practices, capable of responding to rainfall variability, should be incorporated.

LIFE CYCLE OF THE COPEPOD, LIMNOCALANUS MACRURUS SARS 1863 (COPEPODA, CALANIFORMES, CENTROPAGIDAE) IN LAKE ONEGO	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												Limnocalanus macrurus Sars 1863 (Calaniformes, Centropagidae Giesbrecht 1892) is a glacial marine relict species. In the pelagic zone of Lake Onego, one of the European Great Lakes, this copepod is one the main dominant species of zooplankton during the whole year. Limnocalanus macrurus has been found to be a monocyclic species with one generation and winter reproduction. The main characteristics of the copepod life cycle have been studied based on long-term observations. The population of L. macrurus in the Petrozavodsk Bay and the central part of the lake shows some characteristic features. Thus, during the growing season the average values of abundance are 2 times lower in the bay compared to the central part of the lake (2.7 versus 5.5 th. ind./m(2), respectively). The same tendency was observed in relation to biomass (0.82 versus 1.36 g/m(2), respectively). A comparison of the average long-term maximal values of abundance and biomass in these parts of the lake also shows that the abundance values are 1.6 times (5.6 versus 9.0 g/m(2)), while the biomass values 2 times lower (1.41 versus 2.83 g/m(2)) in the Petrozavodsk Bay compared to the central part. A shift earlier by 2-3 dozen days in the timing of the spring development of L. macrurus in the Petrozavodsk Bay has been recorded due to the difference in the thermal regimes of the areas compsared. Despite the climatic changes noted in recent decades, no noticeable changes in the abundance of L. macrurus in the lake have been revealed.

Prevalence of parasitism increased from 1.7% in autumn 1979, to 6.5% and 7.7% in autumns 1980 and 1981 concomitant with experimental acidification of lake 223 to pH 5.1. By comparison, mean infection rates observed within three reference lakes were between 0.3 to 0.6%. Enhanced microsporidosis is believed to have contributed to a reduction in annual crayfish survival rates for the lake 223 population of 8% in 1979 and 18% in 1980 compared to averages calculated for the non-acidified lakes. Hypotheses to explain the ten-fold increase in Thelohania parasitism in lake 223 over background levels for the ELA region include increased probagative ability due to elevated rate of crayfish cannibalism or low pH-favored parasite life cycle, and decreased host resistance when under sublethal stress.						france, robert/0000-0002-9171-8426													0049-6979	1573-2932					1985	26	2					129	136		10.1007/BF00292063	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00292063													WOS:A1985AQE2600002
B	van Huissteden, J	vanHuissteden, J			van Huissteden, J.	vanHuissteden, J		The Role of Ground Ice	THAWING PERMAFROST: Permafrost Carbon in a Warming Arctic												The ice content of permafrost soils has a large impact on processes that occur when permafrost thaws; exposed ground ice is the primary cause of destructive abrupt thaw processes. This chapter presents the origin of common forms of ground ice: segregation ice, ice wedges and larger ground ice bodies. The presence of ground ice is expressed at the surface as geomorphological features such as ice wedge polygon networks, palsas and pingos. A processes that is important for transfer of carbon in permafrost soils is cryoturbation; it is also linked to micro-relief at the soil surface in the shape of various forms of patterned ground. The processes and landforms that result from thawing ground ice are discussed: erosional forms such as cryogenic landslides. Next, permafrost has a profound effect on the hydrology; a frozen subsurface acts as a barrier to groundwater movement. This affects also runoff and river discharge, which are further determined by water storage as snow in winter, and its sudden release in spring during snowmelt. Permafrost thaw results in hydrological changes: the development of thaw lakes and increased groundwater flow. The chapter concludes with a short presentation of geophysical methods to detect and map ground ice and permafrost in the subsurface.																					978-3-030-31379-1; 978-3-030-31378-4				2020							107	177		10.1007/978-3-030-31379-1_3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-31379-1_3	10.1007/978-3-030-31379-1												WOS:000632140700004

Temporal and spatial variability of frost-free seasons in the Great Lakes region of the United States	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												The frequency and timing of frost events and the length of the growing season are critical limiting factors in many human and natural ecosystems. This study investigates the temporal and spatial variability of the date of last spring frost (LSF), the date of first fall frost (FFF), and the length of the frost-free season (FFS) in the Great Lakes region of the United States using two gridded reanalysis datasets for the period of 1980-2010. Across most of the Great Lakes region, there has been a negative trend for the LSF and a positive trend for the FFF, leading to a lengthening of FFS. The three variables vary spatially across the region and exhibit large interannual variability. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analyses indicate that the first mode for the three variables, which accounts for about 30% of the total variance, is in phase across most of the Great Lakes region and that it appears to be related to Pacific North American (PNA) pattern in the case of LSF and to Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) in the case of FFF and FFS. The main reason for these connections is that the 200-hPa geopotential height anomaly over North America induced by a Rossby wave train influences the strength of the trough over North America, which in turn affects surface temperatures over the Great Lakes region. The second mode, explaining about 10% of the total variance, mainly shows the out-of-phase variability between the Great Lakes and the surrounding land and it appears to be related to the circumglobal teleconnection (CGT) in the case of LSF and again to PDO in the case of FFF and FFS.																			0899-8418	1097-0088				NOV 15	2014	34	13					3499	3514		10.1002/joc.3923	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.3923													WOS:000344177200002

Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha ) have established a much greater range in North America and Europe than quagga mussels (D. bugensis ), which occupy a very similar niche. 2. We hypothesised that quaggas are physiologically capable of sustaining populations in warmer rivers currently occupied only by zebra mussels and that unidentified, non-physiological factors account for their more limited distribution. 3. Growth and survival of individually tagged mussels (976 D. bugensis from Lake Erie; 2625 D. polymorpha from Lake Erie and the Ohio River) were recorded monthly for up to 15 months in an outdoor stream mesocosm receiving unfiltered water from the Ohio River. 4. Extreme temperatures stressed both species; but in contrast to several previous laboratory studies, quaggas survived high temperatures better than zebra mussels. We suspect this was the result of species-specific differences in their ability to obtain, assimilate and/or catabolise food at high, sublethal temperatures. 5. A unimodal growth pattern was observed in both species, with the highest growth rates from late spring to early autumn. 6. Our survival and growth data suggest that quaggas are not physiologically limited from expanding southward. 7. While lacking definitive proof that dreissenid populations in rivers are ecologically sustainable without upstream lentic ecosystems and/or unintended human intervention, we suggest that complex river currents and upstream retentive and highly productive slackwater habitats in rivers may help sustain downstream populations of these meroplanktonic, dreissenid mussels.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				SEP	2002	47	9					1779	1790		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00902.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00902.x													WOS:000177546100018

The toxic episodes were unusual in that algal toxicity occurred during the winter and this lake is considered to be only moderately productive. A year-long study was conducted to determine the environmental factors associated with toxic conditions. Toxic blue-green algal blooms in American Lake were associated with increased nutrient (especially phosphorus) availability following winter turnover. Phosphorus released from lake sediments under conditions of low oxygen during lake stratification fueled winter blooms of algae, including the toxic Anabaena flos-aquae strain. The lake's extremely low iron content was insufficient to completely remove this released phosphorus from the water column during lake turnover.																			0270-5060					SEP	1994	9	3					241	251		10.1080/02705060.1994.9664891	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1994.9664891													WOS:A1994PN08500009

The field measurement results showed that the average TGM concentration during the monitoring period was 3.17 +/- 1.17 ng/m(3), within the range of 1.17-8.63 ng/m(3), with the highest concentration being observed in spring, while the TGM concentration typically increased in the morning, reached its peak concentration, and then started to decrease at nightfall. Moreover, the lowest average TGM concentration of 1.81 +/- 0.15 ng/m(3) was observed in summer, and this figure is close to the background TGM concentration of the Northern Hemisphere (1.6-1.8 ng/m(3)). The correlation analysis indicated that TGM concentration correlated positively with SO2, NOx, CO, O-3, PM10, PM2.5 and negatively with ambient temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. In addition, the transportation route analysis showed that elevated TGM concentrations could be transported from either North China, East China, or South China to the Penghu Islands, while those originating from the South China Sea had the lowest contribution to the TGM levels at the Penghu Islands. Therefore, local sources and open burning might be mainly influenced by the long-range transportation of air masses, as the prevailing wind direction and air mass transportation routes potentially play critical roles in the variation of TGM concentration at the Penghu Islands.

J	Caron, S; Lucotte, M				Caron, Sebastien; Lucotte, Marc			Regional and seasonal inputs of mercury into Lake St. Pierre (St. Lawrence River), a major commercial and sports fisheries in Canada	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Lake St. Pierre (LSP), constituted of a 120 km(2) stretching of the St. Lawrence River (Southern Quebec), hosts the largest freshwater fishery industry in Canada. The lake drains, through its main tributaries, an important area of agrarian land and was subjected to intense industrial activities in the past century. In this paper, we present (1) an estimation of the seasonal aquatic mercury (Hg) inputs to LSP from the St-Lawrence River and two major tributaries; (2) a reconstruction, by the analysis of sediment cores, of the historic inputs of Hg into LSP and in a large riparian wetland, Bay St. Francois. Our results indicate that the aquatic Hg inputs to LSP (290 kg Hg between April 2003 and April 2004) are moderately elevated with most of the inputs occurring from the St. Lawrence River, either in spring or early winter, during high flow episodes. The sediment profiles suggest a recent decrease in Hg inputs, likely attributable to improvements of industrial practices. The observed perturbation of the surface sediments give evidence of an active hydrodynamic regime, suggesting that LSP could only act as a transitory system for suspended sediment and Hg, with seasonal accumulation and recurrent re-suspension resulting from changes in the hydrodynamic regime. Finally, we observed positive MeHg fluxes from the sediment to the water at different seasons in Bay St. Francois. However, Hg levels in fish like walleyes of LSP are reported to be low, which could be explained by faster fish growth rates following in part intense fishing pressure in LSP.

Concentrations of labile Cr(VI) and dissolved Cr were assessed using cliffusivc gradients in thin films (DGT) and high-resolution dialysis passive sampling devices, respectively. Results indicated that in pore water the dissolved Cr concentrations and in sediments total Cr and Cr fractions concentrations (dissolved, exchangeable and carbonate fraction (F1), Fe-Mn oxide fraction (F2), organic sulfide fraction (F3)) were lower in MDET than in CDMB. However, the highly toxic DGT-labile Cr(VI) concentrations were higher in MDET sediments than in CDMB sediments. In the two lake zones, the seasonal variations in concentrations of dissolved Cr and DGT-labile Cr(VI) were significant, while total Cr and Cr fractions showed negligible changes (except Fl fraction). In summer, the high mobility of dissolved Cr (MDET: 103.42 +/- 10.82 mu g,L; CDMB: 108.99 +/- 424 mu g/t) were mainly caused by dissolved organic matter complexing with Cr(III). In winter the high mobility of dissolved Cr (MDET: 10027 +/- 22.04 mu g/L; CDMB: 102.01 +/- 8.81 mu g/L) and DGT-labile Cr (VI) (MDET: 2826 +/- 3.73 mu g. L; CDLZ: 25.82 +/- 2.26 mu g/L) were primarily caused by the oxidization of Cr (III) by Mn(III/IV) oxides. This study establishes the mechanisms for seasonal variation of Cr mobilization in different lake ecological zones, highlighting the urgent need for remediation of Cr pollution, especially in macrophyte-dominated lake zones.

Calving Seasonality Associated With Melt-Undercutting and Lake Ice Cover	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												A detailed understanding of calving processes at the lacustrine margins of the Greenland ice sheet is necessary for accurately forecasting its dynamic response to ongoing climate change. However, existing data sets of lacustrine calving are limited to summer seasons and to alpine glaciers. Here, we use an integrated time-lapse and structure-from-motion approach to generate the first continuous year-round volumetric record of calving processes at a lacustrine ice sheet margin. We identify two distinct calving regimes that are associated with melt-undercutting and lake ice cover. We also find that calving rates respond rapidly to sudden lake drainage. Given that lake temperature, lake ice cover, and sudden lake drainages are controlled by air temperature and ice-margin thinning, we suggest that climate change, manifested in lengthening summer seasons, will accelerate rates of mass loss and terminus recession at lacustrine ice-margins in Greenland.					; Mallalieu, Joseph/JQJ-5133-2023	Quincey, Duncan/0000-0002-7602-7926; Mallalieu, Joseph/0000-0002-1988-8594; Carrivick, Jonathan/0000-0002-9286-5348													0094-8276	1944-8007				APR 28	2020	47	8							e2019GL086561	10.1029/2019GL086561	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019GL086561													WOS:000530332600015

Cold and wet: Diatoms dominate the phytoplankton community during a year of anomalous weather in a Great Lakes estuary	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												As sentinels of climate change and other anthropogenic forces, freshwater lakes are experiencing ecosystem disruptions at every level of the food web, beginning with the phytoplankton, a highly respon-sive group of organisms. Most studies regarding the effects of climate change on phytoplankton focus on a potential scenario in which temperatures continuously increase and droughts intersperse heavy precip-itation events. Like much of the conterminous United States in 2019, the Muskegon River watershed (Michigan, USA) experienced record-breaking rainfall accompanied by unusually cool temperatures, affording an opportunity to explore how an alternate potential climate scenario may affect phytoplank-ton. We conducted biweekly sampling of environmental variables and phytoplankton in Muskegon Lake, a Great Lakes Area of Concern that connects to Lake Michigan. We compared environmental variables in 2019 to the previous eight years using long-term data from the Muskegon Lake Observatory buoy, and annual monitoring excursions provided historical phytoplankton data. Under cold and wet conditions, diatoms were the single dominant division throughout the entire growth season - an unprecedented sce-nario in Muskegon Lake. In 10 of the 13 biweekly sampling days in 2019, diatoms comprised over 75% of the phytoplankton community in the lake by count, indicating that the spring diatom bloom persisted through the fall. Additionally, phytoplankton seasonal succession and abundance patterns typically seen in this lake were absent. In a world experiencing reduced predictability, increased variability, and regio-nal climate anomalies, studying periods of extreme weather events may offer insight into how natural systems will be affected and respond under future climate scenarios.

J	Qiu, S; McComb, AJ; Bell, RW; Davis, JA				Qiu, S; McComb, AJ; Bell, RW; Davis, JA			Phosphorus dynamics from vegetated catchment to lakebed during seasonal refilling	WETLANDS												Seasonal wetlands of the Swan Coastal Plain in southwestern Australia often dry in summer, refill during heavy winter rains, and are commonly surrounded by vegetated catchments. However, the linkage between catchment litter turnover and lake P dynamics is poorly understood. A transect from catchment uplands to the dry lakebed of Thomsons Lake was studied with the progression of the wet season. Attention was given to 1) levels of litter-P release at various sites; 2) spatial patterns of soil P along a wet to dry transect; and 3) dynamic changes in soil P availability in response to changing hydrologic conditions. Phosphorus detained in situ by anion exchange membranes and changes in AEM-extractable P (AEM-P) in surface soils indicated that the first heavy rainfall of the wet season generated significant P loads from catchment litter. In contrast, there was little P released in bare soils without litter. Before rain, soil AEM-P in the lakebed and fringing areas was low, but this increased by 3.4-56 times in the wet season. There was a net decrease in AEM-extractable P, total P, and organic C in the upland catchment but an increase in the wetland during the wet season. The results suggest that heavy rains after six months of drying may generate significant P flux from catchment litter. This would be followed by further leaching and an inferred stimulation of microbial activity during the progress of the wet season. The large increase in AEM-P in lake sites appears related to the input of P from catchment sites through hydrologic processes during the rains and an internal process associated with a 'drying-rewetting' effect.					; Davis, Jenny/C-4045-2009	Bell, Richard/0000-0002-7756-3755; 													0277-5212	1943-6246				DEC	2004	24	4					828	836		10.1672/0277-5212(2004)024[0828:PDFVCT]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1672/0277-5212(2004)024[0828:PDFVCT]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000226264700012

Jeli district in the state of Kelantan, Malaysia, is rich in water resources with attractive natural and geological/geomorphological features such as lake, river, waterfall, and hot spring. This study discusses the geological assessment of potential water-based tourism sites in the district, by selecting four (4) destinations i.e. Pergau Lake, Jeli Hot Spring, Rual River, and Lata Renyok Waterfall as case studies. Geological mapping and characterisation of these sites have been conducted in 2014. These sites contain some interesting geological/geomorphological features such as granitic mountainous and hilly areas (in Pergau Lake), exotic hot water spring in a small valley (in Jeli Hot Spring), beautiful landscape and features of a river valley (in Rual River), and wonderful cascading waterfall in the alternating bright and dark-coloured rocks (in Lata Renyok Waterfall). The geological assessment of these sites was carried out through qualitative and quantitative approaches based on some geodiversity values: scientific, educational, aesthetic, recreational, and some other values. To support the assessment, the in situ water quality analysis was conducted in mid of 2014 (June-July 2014) to show that these sites have different water quality classes based on Malaysia's Interim National Water Quality Standard (INWQS) i.e. Class I for Lata Renyok Waterfall, Class III for Rual River, and Class IV for Pergau Lake and Jeli Hot Spring. All localities are potential water-based tourism attractions in the district which have some specific tourism and recreational activities e.g. swimming and bathing (in Lata Renyok Waterfall and Rual River), fishing (in Lata Renyok Waterfall, Rual River, and Pergau Lake), rafting, boating, and kayaking/canoeing (in Pergau Lake), and hot water therapy and skin treatment (in Jeli Hot Spring). It is recommended that all these localities should be conserved and developed properly as models of sustainable water-based tourism destinations in Malaysia.

Winter air temperature in the early and middle Holocene on the eastern coast of Daurkin Peninsula, Chukotka, reconstructed from stable isotopes of ice wedges	LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW												The object of research is the Holocene massive ice veins on the Eastern coast of the Daurkin Peninsula, the easternmost part of the Chukotka. Peat bogs with ice veins occur on the surface of marine terraces (near Uelen and Lorino settlements) and on flood plain of the Koolen Lake; the thickness of peat varies from 0.7 to 2.5 m. Radio-carbon dating of the peat enclosing the investigated ice veins near Uelen and Lorino indicated that the beginning of peat accumulation began at the end of Late Pleistocene - early Holocene, about 11 cal ka BR On the flood plain of the Koolen Lake peat bogs began to accumulate in the middle Holocene, i.e. around 6 cal ka BR At the initial stage of peat bogs formation the rate of peat accumulation was high and could reach 1 cm/10 years. Ice veins occur at a depth of 0.5-1 m, and their lower parts are located in the underlying peat sandy loams and loams. In the upper levels of the peat bogs, narrow present-day ice veins are found, which are sometimes embedded in the upper parts of Holocene veins. A clear sign of syngenetic growth of veins is the upward bending of the layers of the host peat at the lateral contacts with the veins. The main source of water for the formation of ice veins is snow, as evidenced by the ratio of stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen and the values of deuterium excesses in the ice. A slight admixture of saline water (probably from a seasonally thawed layer) was noted in the veins near the Lorino settlement. Reconstructions of winter air paleotemperatures, performed on the basis of data of isotope-oxygen composition of ice from the veins, did show that at the period between 11 and 6 cal Ka BR the mean winter air temperature on the Daurkin Peninsula was by 2-5 degrees C lower than today, but the air temperature of the coldest month (January or February) was still lower (by 4-8 degrees C) than today. The noticeable trend of increase of stable isotope values in the ice veins from early Holocene to the present time is indicative of a steady positive trend of mean winter air temperatures in the Holocene.

In large shallow Lake Vortsjarv, sporadic fish kills have been registered mainly in cold winters, yet in 2013, an unexpected fish kill occurred beginning mid-June. At the time of the fish kill, an investigation was conducted to determine species composition, number, and sizes of dead fish along the lake shore. To determine possible causes of the fish kill, we analysed the dynamics of key physical and chemical parameters of lake water, including diurnal fluctuations of water temperature (WT), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), ammonium ion concentrations (NH4-N), and the development of water stratification, during the growing season of 2013 using high-frequency water quality monitoring buoy and monthly manual monitoring data. Environmental data between 2010 and 2012 were used as a reference because no fish kill occurred. The results suggest that the fish kill was induced by a combination of successive and co-occurring extreme water parameters such as high WT (up to 24.5 degrees C), pH (up to 9.2), and NH4-N (up to 0.13 mg L-1), short-term stratification, and low DO concentration in the bottom water (0.49 mg L-1, saturation 5.4%) induced by quick warming of this shallow lake after a long ice-covered period and leading to a likely ammonia poisoning and hypoxia. The main target species was the bottom-dwelling ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus), indicating that the summer kill started at the bottom of the lake. The event highlights the significance of short-term disturbances on fish populations, which can be detected only using high-frequency monitoring data.

This region hosts several lentic ecosystems used for irrigation and drinking water supply. The present study was conducted to analyze the temporal distributions of water quality parameters (WQPs) of lentic ecosystems (lacustrine habitats), including lakes (L1-L2), reservoirs (R1-R12), and ponds (P1-P19) of the Thrace Region. Thirty-three lacustrine habitats were identified in the region. Freshwaters were collected in the wet (end of winter) and dry (end of summer) seasons of 2021-2022 and tested for 12 WQPs. Data was evaluated for the water quality index (WQI) and nutrient pollution index (NPI) and their overall quality level. For the evaluation of non-carcinogenic health risk indices of WQPs, the chronic daily index (CDI), hazard quotient (HQ), and hazard index (HI) were applied. Cluster analysis (CA), Pearson correlation index (PCI), and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to classify the lacustrine habitats and identify the source of WQPs. The average values were as follows: 9.28 mg/L for dissolved oxygen (DO), 94.6% for oxygen (O2) saturation, 9.29 for pH, 613 mu S/cm for electrical conductivity (EC), 3.96 NTU for turbidity, 358 mg/L for total dissolved solids (TDS), 3.17 mg/L for nitrate (NO3), 0.05 mg/L for nitrite (NO2), 1.01 mg/L for phosphate (PO4), 78.5 mg/L for sulfate (SO4), and 102 mg/L for chloride (Cl). Results showed a significant increase in WQPs, including NO3, NO2, and PO4, in the wet season, while the salinity decreased from the dry to wet season. Results revealed that HI values of water contaminants in lacustrine habitats were noted to be less than one. Based on determined WQPs, the present study recommends using lacustrine water habitats for irrigation, drinking, and other domestic and industrial purposes.					Islam, Abu Reza Md.

J	Rellstab, C; Spaak, P				Rellstab, Christian; Spaak, Piet			Lake origin determines Daphnia population growth under winter conditions	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												In large oligotrophic lakes, growth rates of zooplankton populations decline to low or negative values in winter as a result of low food concentration and water temperature. Daphnia, a key species in the aquatic food web, has two strategies to overwinter: either by sexual reproduction resulting in diapause or as asexual clones in the open water. We investigated how asexually overwintering Daphnia clones, originating from different taxa and lakes with different trophic state, survive under winter conditions. We performed a laboratory experiment exposing D. hyalina and D. hyalinaxgaleata clones to low water temperature (5 degrees C) and either no or low food (< 0.1 mg C L-1) conditions. We used clones from three pre-alpine lakes in Switzerland with contrasting trophic state: ultra-oligotrophic Lake Brienz, mesotrophic Lake Constance and eutrophic Greifensee. Our results show that Daphnia clones can withstand starvation for an average of 6 weeks under low food concentration and for almost 2 weeks under complete absence of food. Besides strong clonal variation, we found a significant effect of food concentration and its interaction with lake origin on population growth rate. Our study indicates that adaptation to local winter conditions is a key factor in defining the clonal, but not necessarily the taxonomic composition of a Daphnia population in unproductive lakes.

J	Denoël, M				Denoël, M			Terrestrial versus aquatic foraging in juvenile Alpine newts (Ttiturus alpestris)	ECOSCIENCE												Many species of newts and salamanders forage in both terrestrial and aquatic environments during their life. However, the relative benefits of the two foraging patterns remain unknown because all previous studies have focused on only one habitat. The aim of this study was to find out which foraging tactic is the most successful in terms of energy intake. To this end, I analyzed trophic habits in metamorphosed juveniles in the Alpine newt, Triturus alpestris veluchiensis, inhabiting an alpine lake (Drakolimni) and the surrounding lands (Tymphi Mountains, northern Greece). The diet of the newts reflected the range of prey available in the two habitats, but aquatic newts also foraged on invertebrates that fell on the water surface. The two lifestyles have different energy outcomes. Terrestrial invertebrates provided high energy gains mainly to terrestrial juveniles because of the low number of this prey type in the lake. However, terrestrial juveniles are expected to suffer higher mortality (freezing on land is more probable than in deep waters) and a lower energy intake when air temperature is low, i.e., the main pattern in high-elevation sites, except during mid-summer. Persistence of the aquatic foraging tactics in the population may depend on a trade-off between costs and benefits.

Recurrent spring-fed rivers in a Middle to Late Pleistocene semi-arid grassland: Implications for environments of early humans in the Lake Victoria Basin, Kenya	SEDIMENTOLOGY												The effect of changing palaeoclimate and palaeoenvironment on human evolution during the Pleistocene is debated, but hampered by few East African records directly associated with archaeological sites prior to the Last Glacial Maximum. Middle to Late Pleistocene deposits on the shoreline of eastern Lake Victoria preserve abundant vertebrate fossils and Middle Stone Age arte-facts associated with riverine tufas at the base of the deposits, which are ideal for palaeoenvironmental reconstructions. New data from tufas identified on Rusinga Island and on the mainland near Karungu, Kenya are provided from outcrop, thin sections, mineralogical, stable isotopic and U-series dating analyses. Tufa is identified in four sites: Nyamita (940 +/- 33 and 1114 +/- 42ka); Kisaaka, Aringo (455 +/- 45ka); and Obware. The age ranges of these tufa deposits demonstrate that spring-fed rivers were a recurrent, variably preserved feature on the Pleistocene landscape for ca 360kyr. Poor sorting of clastic facies from all sites indicates flashy, ephemeral discharge, but these facies are commonly associated with barrage tufas, paludal environments with C-13 values of ca 10 parts per thousand indicative of C-3 plants and fossil Hippopotamus, all of which indicate a perennial water source. Other tufa deposits from Nyamita, Obware and Aringo have a mixed C-3/C-4 signature consistent with a semi-arid C-4 grassland surrounding these spring-fed rivers. The O-18 values of tufa from Nyamita are on average ca 1 parts per thousand more negative than calcite precipitated from modern rainfall in the region, suggesting greater contribution of depleted monsoonal input, similar to the Last Glacial Maximum. Microdebitage and surface-collected artefacts indicate that early modern humans were utilizing these spring-fed rivers. The presence of spring-fed rivers would have afforded animals a reliable water source, sustaining a diverse plant and animal community in an otherwise arid environment.					; Tryon, Christian/B-1172-2010; Faith, J./E-7146-2015; Sharp, Warren/IQT-1487-2023; Peppe, Daniel/O-5010-2019	Michel, Lauren/0000-0002-5391-6819; Faith, J.

J	Josephson, DC; Krueger, CC; Sullivan, PJ				Josephson, DC; Krueger, CC; Sullivan, PJ			Use of outlet barriers to prevent fall emigration of brook trout stocked in Adirondack lakes	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Outlet barriers in stocked lakes of the Adirondack Mountains were used to test the hypothesis that preventing fall emigration by adult brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis would increase trap-net and angling catch rates as well as the number of large trophy fish. Outlet barriers were maintained during the fall spawning season for 6 years on one lake and 10 years on another lake. We compared prebarrier and postbarrier trap-net and angler catches (1978-1998) in two blocked and two unblocked lakes. Postbarrier availability of brook trout to anglers and trap nets increased significantly in Rock Lake (blocked) but not in Lower Sylvan Pond (blocked) or the two unblocked lakes. However, highly significant increases in angler catches of trophy fish occurred from both blocked lakes. Variables other than emigration, such as number of fish stocked and angling mortality, influenced our ability to detect significant increases in the availability of age-2 and older brook trout in Lower Sylvan Pond. The outlet barriers elicited a population response by stocked brook trout consistent with the hypothesis that emigration losses of mature adults depleted older-aged fish from unblocked lakes. Outlet barriers are a potential management tool; however, managers must consider their specific management goals and the problems associated with seasonally interrupting migratory corridors.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				NOV	2001	21	4					843	854		10.1577/1548-8675(2001)021<0843:UOOBTP>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8675(2001)021<0843:UOOBTP>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000174289300015

The eutrophication of lakes in this area is becoming increasingly serious with consequent negative impacts on the water supply of the surrounding cities. But the spatial-temporal characteristics and driving factors of the trophic state of the lake in this region are still not clearly addressed. In this study, a semi-analytical algorithm for estimating the trophic index (TSI) using particle absorption at 645 nm based on MODIS images is proposed to monitor and evaluate the trophic state of 41 large lakes (larger than 10 km(2)) in the YRD from 2002 to 2020. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using an independent dataset. Results showed that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the algorithm is less than 6 and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) does not exceed 8%, indicating that it can be applied for remotely deriving the TSI in the YRD. The spatial-temporal patterns revealed that there were significantly more lakes with moderate eutrophication in the Lower Yangtze River (LYR) than in the Lower Huaihe River (LHR). The overall average value of the TSI reaches a maximum in summer and a minimum in winter. The TSI value in the YRD over the period 2002-2020 showed a downward trend, especially after 2013. Individually, 33 lakes showed a downward trend and 8 lakes showed an upward trend. Furthermore, marked seasonal and interannual temporal variations can be clearly observed in the LYR and LHR and the sum of the variance contributions of seasonal and interannual components is more than 50%. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that human activities can explain 65% of the variation in the lake TSI in the YRD.					; Lyu, Heng/F-3335-2017	Guo, Fei/0000-0002-5115-7249; 														2072-4292				NOV	2021	13	21							4322	10.3390/rs13214322	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13214322													WOS:000718304800001

Interannual changes in benthic biomass under climate-induced variations in productivity of a small northern lake	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY					11th Symposium for European Freshwater Sciences (SEFS)	JUN 30-JUL 05, 2019	Zagreb, CROATIA	Croatian Assoc Freshwater Ecologists				Long-term (2002-2017) monitoring data were analyzed to highlight the interannual variations of macrozoobenthos in a small oligotrophic lake (area 0.5 km(2), maximal depth 32 m, mean depth 12 m) located in northwestern Russia. Samples were taken at three sites situated in littoral (depth 0.5 m), sublittoral (8 m) and profundal (30 m) mainly during an ice-free period (as a rule five times a season). An attempt was made to relate the annual macrobenthic biomass with pelagic productivity (chlorophyll-a, Secchi depth) and changes in climatic variables (North Atlantic Oscillation and Arctic Oscillation indexes, air temperature and atmospheric precipitations). The results suggest that the interannual dynamic of biological communities in the lake is appreciably controlled by winter meteorological conditions. The concentration of chlorophyll-a correlated positively with wintertime air temperature and climatic indexes with a two-year lag. Benthic communities inhabiting different depths differed in their response to climatic variations. Climate-induced changes in primary production seem to be the main factor influencing the biomass of macrozoobenthos in the littoral zone. Intra- and interspecific biotic interactions may be more important in regulating sublittoral and profundal communities. Also, at the deepest site, late-winter oxygen depletion affected the biomass of macrozoobenthos. The potential mechanisms of the impact of climate variations on lake productivity in northern regions are discussed.

Occurrence and Distribution of the Freshwater Amphipods Gammarus pseudolimnaeus and Gammarus fasciatus in Southeastern Virginia	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												The freshwater amphipod, Gammarus fasciatus, and a population that keys to Gammarus pseudolimnaeus are broadly sympatric in southeastern Virginia. By documenting the successful formation of pre-copulatory mate-guarding pairs between individuals collected from Virginia and New York, we confirmed the occurrence of a G. pseudolimnaeus population strongly disjunct from the previously described range in the Mississippi and St. Lawrence River drainage basins. Gammarus pseudolimnaeus appears restricted to high-quality, spring-fed streams that occur at low density across an increasingly fragmented natural landscape in Virginia. Gammarus fasciatus, however, occurs in lakes and streams of developed landscapes that typically are more degraded, and this species does not co-occur with G. pseudolimnaeus in high-quality habitat. Gammarus pseudolimnaeus reproduces year-round, with adults and juveniles of all size classes continuously present. Gammarus fasciatus reproduces primarily from February through June, at which point the adults die, and by late summer the population consists solely of immature individuals. If the two species overlapped in distribution, the smaller Gammarus fasciatus amphipods would have to compete with adult G. pseudolimnaeus for resources. We hypothesize that this competitively disadvantageous life cycle could account, in part, for the absence of G. fasciatus in high-quality streams occupied by G. pseudolimnaeus.																			1092-6194	1938-5307				DEC	2013	20	4					609	623		10.1656/045.020.0408	http://dx.doi.org/10.1656/045.020.0408													WOS:000329227100011

We have studied the concentration and oxidation states of iron at the sediment-water interface to reveal the relation of the eutrophication of the lake to the oxidation potential in the lake water. We found that the Fe3+ fraction gave a high value, 64%, at the surface of sediment 48 m deep in water in the northern part of Lake Biwa in spring, the lake water mixing period. The fraction decreased to 58% during the long thermal stratification. The vertical profiles of iron content indicated that iron was enriched at the sediment surface. The results show that insoluble ferric hydroxide was deposited on the top of sediment under the oxic conditions, and reduced ferrous iron was released into the pore water in the deeper sediment under the anoxic conditions. The vertical profiles of iron in the pore water supports such conclusions. The highest Fe3+, 75%, was observed where the sediment was mixed by bioturbation. The reduction reaction Fe3+ to Fe2+ has a lower reduction potential than that of MnO2 to Mn2+. By theoretical estimation, iron is reduced under more anoxic conditions than Mn. We found the phenomenon that reduced soluble Mn2+ was already released from the pore water to the lake water, but Fe(OH)(3) was being reduced, and Fe2+ was being released to the pore water in the northern part of Lake Biwa in autumn, 1997.																			0260-6291		0-85404-734-4				1999		234					394	404																WOS:000166187500040

A bottom boundary layer is identified, characterized by rapid increases in both temperature and salt concentration and having a thickness of similar to 1 dm with respect to temperature and 2-4 cm with respect to salt content. A simple analytical model of the temperature distribution in the near-bottom layer and the associated downslope flow of the heavier water is proposed. The model describes satisfactorily the temperature field in the near bottom layer. The corresponding modeled advective velocities are near 1 mm s(-1) in early winter and 1 order of magnitude lower in late winter, the latter values agreeing well with observations in other lakes.

Although various geographical and environmental patterns affect algal communities during river-lake transit, a thorough understanding of what patterns shape the algal communities is still rarely researched, particularly in complex interconnected river-lake systems. In this study, focusing on the most typical interconnected river-lake system in China, the Dongting Lake, we collected paired water and sediment samples in summer, when algal biomass and growth rate are at high levels. Based on 23S rRNA gene sequencing, we investigated the heterogeneity and the differences in assembly mechanisms of planktonic and benthic algae in Dongting Lake. Planktonic algae contained more Cyanobacteria and Crypto-phyta, while sediment harbored higher proportions of Bacillariophyta and Chlorophyta. For planktonic algae, stochastic dispersal dominated the assembly of the communities. Upstream rivers and confluences were important sources of planktonic algae in lakes. Meanwhile, for benthic algae, deterministic environmental filtering shaped the communities, and the proportion of benthic algae exploded with increasing N:P ratio and Cu concentration until reaching thresholds of 1.5 and 0.013 g/kg respectively, and then started falling, showing non-linear responses. This study revealed the variability of different aspects of algal communities in different habitats, traced the main sources of planktonic algae, and identified the thresholds for benthic algal shifts in response to environmental filters. Hence, upstream and downstream monitoring as well as thresholds of envi-ronmental factors should be considered in further aquatic ecological monitoring or regulatory programs of harmful algal blooms in these complex systems.

Snow removal cools a small dystrophic lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS												Limnological understanding of the role snow plays in under-ice thermal dynamics is mainly based on studies of clear-water lakes. Very little is known about the role snow plays in the thermal dynamics of dystrophic lakes. We conducted a whole lake experiment on a small, 8 m deep dystrophic bog lake in northern Wisconsin, where we removed all snowfall over two consecutive winters. Due to weather variability, only 1 year had predominantly black ice. Under these conditions, the lake rapidly cooled in early and mid-winter, compared to snow covered conditions that insulated the lake from heat loss. The lake also rapidly gained heat in late winter resulting in isothermal conditions well in advance of ice-off. These results show how water clarity modulates the influence of snow on under-ice thermal dynamics, which is relevant to futures with snow droughts.					; Lottig, Noah/AAE-4650-2020	Lottig, Noah/0000-0003-1599-8144; Ladwig, Robert/0000-0001-8443-1999; Schramm, Paul/0000-0002-4155-0004; 														2378-2242				FEB	2025	10	1					122	129		10.1002/lol2.10444	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lol2.10444		OCT 2024											WOS:001341010300001

No evidence of significant periodicity was found for any variable in the Experimental Lakes Area records. The longer (67-year) record from nearby Kenora, Ontario, revealed a 31-year cycle in precipitation but not temperature. Significant increasing long-term trends at the Experimental Lakes Area were found for annual and winter temperature and summer precipitation and deposition of ammonium, total nitrogen (TN), and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN). Large (80%) increases in ammonium deposition appear to be related to higher emissions in the central United States. A significant negative trend for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in precipitation cannot be explained. In runoff, significant positive trends were found for TDN and DOC in the northeast catchment and TN, TDN, ammonium, and DOC in the northwest. Significant negative trends were found for TDP and nitrate in the northeast. Significant increases were found for retention of ammonium in all catchments and DOC in the northeast and northwest. There was no apparent relationship between forest succession and retention of nutrients. Results are compared with those from three other long-term monitoring sites in eastern North America.

Divergent life histories among smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu inhabiting a connected river-lake system	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Annual reproductive surveys monitored nesting location, reproductive Success and the age and size of individually tagged male smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu that reproduced in Millers Lake, a 45 ha widening of the Mississippi River, Ontario, and in a 1.5 kin pool and riffle section of the river directly upstream. The vast majority of males displayed fidelity to either the river or the lake as reproductive habitat throughout their lifetimes. Nearly, half of the males that reproduced in successive years exhibited strong nest-site fidelity by nesting within 20 m of their previous year's nest site. In most years, when compared to those in the lake, reproductive males in the river differed significantly in reproductive characteristics including age and size at Maturation and nesting success rates. A 3 year telemetry project identified two distinct habitat use patterns: lake-resident fish remained in the lake throughout the year and potamodromous individuals migrated from the lake to upriver spawning habitat in the spring and then returned to the lake prior to the onset of winter. Integration of habitat use and reproductive data suggests that there are significant differences in the life-history strategies of fish that reproduce in the river v the lake.

The transport and accumulation of aerosol and small gas impurities over water area of Lake Baikal is observed every summer due to forest fires occurring in the boreal forests of Siberia. The atmosphere above the lake covers a huge area (31,500 km(2)) and is still a little-studied object. This article presents the results of experimental studies of ground-level ozone, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides in the atmosphere over Lake Baikal, carried out on a research vessel during the boreal forest fires in Siberia in the summer of 2019.

However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood due to inadequate availability of reliable, long-term observations. This study uses two state-of-the-art data assimilation-based reconstructions of last millennium climate to examine changes in the ENSO-ASM teleconnection; we investigate how modes of (multi-)decadal climate variability (namely, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, PDO, and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, AMO) modulate the ENSO-ASM relationship. Our analyses reveal that the PDO exerts a more pronounced impact on ASM variability than the AMO. By comparing different linear regression models, we find that including the PDO in addition to ENSO cycles can improve prediction of the ASM, especially for the Indian summer monsoon. In particular, dry (wet) anomalies caused by El Nino (La Nina) over India become enhanced during the positive (negative) PDO phases due to a compounding effect. However, composite differences in the ENSO-ASM relationship between positive and negative phases of the PDO and AMO are not statistically significant. A significant influence of the PDO/AMO on the ENSO-ASM relationship occurred only over a limited period within the last millennium. By leveraging the long-term paleoclimate reconstructions, we document and interrogate the non-stationary nature of the PDO and AMO in modulating the ENSO-ASM relationship. Sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific oscillate between warmer and cooler conditions every 2-7 years. These oscillations are called "The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)" and have been shown to affect weather and climate in remote locations. For example, ENSO has been shown to alter rainfall of the Asian summer monsoon (ASM). However, the connection between ENSO and the ASM is not dependable, making accurate ASM prediction a challenge, especially in a changing climate. Here, we use a new technique that combines geological archives of past climates like ice cores, corals, or lake sediments with climate models to examine alterations in the ENSO-ASM relationship over the past thousand years. In particular, we focus on how other oscillatory ocean temperature patterns, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), might affect the ENSO-ASM relationship. In the context of the last millennium, we find the differences in the ENSO-ASM relationship between all positive and negative PDO/AMO phases are not statistically significant, as the PDO/AMO modulation on the ENSO-ASM relationship evolves over long time scales. Nevertheless, the PDO itself strongly regulates the Indian summer monsoon, and the consideration of PDO in addition to ENSO enhances monsoon prediction. This information is useful for anticipating decadal-scale changes in the ASM in our changing climate. We investigate how the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) modulate the relationship between El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) using paleo-data assimilation productsWe find that the PDO impacts ASM variability more than the AMO, and its consideration yields improved Indian summer monsoon predictionsNotably, the influence of the PDO and AMO on the ENSO-ASM relationship is highly non-stationary across the last millennium					; Hu, Jun/LLM-2082-2024; Na, Wang/GRY-1478-2022; Wang, Na/GRY-1478-2022; Thirumalai, Kaustubh/N-2511-2014; Steiger, Nathan/T-3152-2019	Hu, Jun/0000-0002-0458-5996; Dee, Sylvia/0000-0002-2140-785X; Wang, Na/0000-0001-6935-1202; Thirumalai, Kaustubh/0000-0002-7875-4182; Steiger, Nathan/0000-0003-3817-9168													2169-897X	2169-8996				JAN 16	2024	129	1							e2023JD039638	10.1029/2023JD039638	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023JD039638													WOS:001132889000001

In the first campaign during the spring to summer of 2003, over 40 pesticides were detected. The spatial and temporal distribution of pesticides in the Canadian atmosphere was shown to reflect the pesticide usage in each region. Several herbicides including triallate, bromoxynil, MCPA, 2,4-D, dicamba, trifluralin and ethalfluralin were detected at highest levels at Bratt's Lake, SK in the prairie region. Strong relationships between air concentrations and dry depositions were observed at this site. Although no application occurred in the Canadian Prairies in 2003, high air concentrations of lindane (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane) were still observed at Bratt's Lake and Hafford, SK. Two fungicides (chlorothalonil and metalaxyl) and two insecticides (endosulfan and carbofuran) were measured at highest levels at Kensington, PEI. Maximum concentrations of Chlorpyrifos and metolachlor were found at St. Anicet, QC. The southern Ontario site, Egbert showed highest concentration of alachlor. Malathion was detected at the highest level at the west coast site, Abbotsford, BC. In case of legacy chlorinated insecticides, high concentrations of DDT, DDE and dieldrin were detected in British Columbia while alpha-HCH and HCB were found to be fairly uniform across the country. Chlordane was detected in Ontario, Quebec and Prince Edward Island. This study demonstrates that the sources for the observed atmospheric occurrence of pesticides include local current pesticide application, volatilization of pesticide residues from soil and atmospheric transport. In many instances, these data represent the first measurements for certain pesticides in a given part of Canada. Crown Copyright (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Winter Habitat Selection and Efficacy of Telemetry to Aid Grass Carp Removal Efforts in a Large Reservoir	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Grass Carp Ctenopharyngodon idella were introduced in North America to control aquatic vegetation in small, closed systems. However, when they escape into larger systems in which they can reproduce, they have the potential to cause significant declines and alterations in aquatic vegetation communities. These alterations can in turn affect native species that are dependent on aquatic vegetation. Increased captures and observations of spawning have elevated concerns about Grass Carp establishment in new locations, with particular concern for establishment in Lake Erie and its tributaries. Recent efforts using telemetered fish that co-locate with wild conspecifics, sometimes in aggregations that are susceptible to harvest, have been used successfully to control invasive Common Carp Cyprinus carpio populations. If Grass Carp aggregate in winter similarly to Common Carp, they might be susceptible to similar control or harvest methods. During the winters (December-March) of 2017-2019, we tracked 86 Grass Carp tagged with acoustic transmitters in Truman Reservoir, Missouri, to evaluate winter habitat selection and to determine the effectiveness of using tagged fish in locating and removing wild fish by comparing harvest at locations of tagged fish to harvest at control sites that we believed were suitable Grass Carp habitat. Discrete-choice models showed that Grass Carp exhibited strong selection for shallow water, as 75% of locations were in littoral habitats with depths of 3 m or less. On average, we harvested more fish at sites where tagged fish were located (3.6 fish/attempt) than at control sites (1.2 fish/attempt). Full guts in individuals that were harvested may indicate that fish were using shallow-water habitats to feed. Our results suggested that Grass Carp did not usually form large winter aggregations, and although targeting locations with tagged fish slightly increased harvest success compared to efforts without them, efforts to reduce populations via harvest may be difficult in large systems when fish are widely dispersed.					; Hessler, Tyler/JRW-2434-2023; Chapman, Duane/JOK-2415-2023	Byrne, Michael/0000-0002-9464-9534; Paukert, Craig/0000-0002-9369-8545; Hessler, Tyler/0000-0001-5062-2340; Chapman, Duane/0000-0002-1086-8853													0275-5947	1548-8675				FEB	2023	43	1					189	202		10.1002/nafm.10693	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10693		OCT 2021											WOS:000716205000001

In spring 1992 and 1993 all the yolk-sac fry of 52 % and 75 % of the females, sampled in autumns 1991 and 1992 respectively, died due to the M74 syndrome, i.e., heavy mortality of yolk-sac fry (YSM). The TEQs of the most frequently detected polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs: 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDF, 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF and 2,3,7,8-TeCDF) and those of coplanar PCBs (CB77, CB126 and CB169) were about twice as high in 1991 and 1992 than before; these substances either showed a significantly increasing time trend or then none at all. The principal component analysis (PCA) showed a strong connection between YSM and the contents of these toxic congeners. PCA also indicated a strong negative connection with YSM and the orange colour intensity of eggs and a weak positive connection with YSM and oxychlordane, hexachlorobenzene and 2,3',4,4'5-pentachlorodiphenyl ether. The PCA results were supported by the observed significant negative Pearson correlations between egg colour and the contents of toxic PCBs and PCDFs as well as between egg colour and YSM. These compounds seemed not to have any connection to early embryonal mortality, whereas total PCB and DDT concentrations did show an association to that.

Interspecific competition between the round goby, Neogobius melanostomus, and the logperch, Percina caprodes, in the Duluth-Superior Harbour	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												The Laurentian Great Lakes have been the site of numerous aquatic invasive species such as the sea lamprey, zebra mussel and round goby. To further understand interactions between invasive and native species in situ, competitive interactions between native logperch (Percina caprodes) and invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) were examined using submerged enclosures in the Duluth-Superior Harbour. Experiments were conducted on rocky or sandy substrate throughout the spring and summer months. Trials consisted of single fish, paired conspecifics or round goby/logperch pairs with weight change determined after 28 days. The round gobies were able to outcompete and/or negatively affect logperch on rocky substrates as a direct result of round goby/logperch interactions, as logperch fared well when round gobies were excluded from the enclosures. Although there is evidence that round gobies exclude logperch from rocky substrates, the logperch population remains close to pre-invasion levels in the predominantly soft-bottomed harbour. The continued coexistence of the logperch with the round goby is attributed to the vastly greater area of soft-bottom vs. rocky substrate in the harbour, with the round gobies in the soft bottom younger and smaller than those in the rocky substrate. Recent evidence suggests that the round goby population is declining on the soft substrates indicating that the two populations will continue to coexist in the harbour.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				JAN	2017	26	1					34	41		10.1111/eff.12247	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12247													WOS:000390137700003
J	Carbognani, A; Di Martino, M; Stirpe, G				Carbognani, Albino; Di Martino, Mario; Stirpe, Giovanna			Computation of a possible Tunguska's strewn field	ICARUS												On June 30, 1908, at about 0h 14.5 m UTC, the Tunguska Event occurred, most likely caused by the fall of a small stony asteroid of about 50-80 m in diameter over the basin of the Tunguska River (Central Siberia). The first expedition was made by the geologist Leonid Kulik 19 years after the event, and macroscopic meteorites have never been found around epicenter. In this paper, we want to establish whether stony macroscopic fragments could have survived the TCB's airburst (Tunguska Cosmic Body) and where they might have fallen. For this purpose, we have implemented a fall model to describe the mass ablation, pancake expansion, airburst and fragments's dark flight. In our scenario, the fragments have a higher mean strength than the main body due to Weibull's law. The results, for a TCB with a kinetic energy of 15 Mt, atmospheric entry speed in the range of 11-20 km/s, trajectory inclination of 35 degrees and average strength in the range of 3-70 MPa, tell us that for a macroscopic fragment with a mean strength between 14-85 MPa would be possible to survive the high pressure and temperature airburst to reach the ground. The falling speed of the fragments is in the range of 0.8-0.5 km/s, which favored their burial in the permafrost. The range of mean strength values for the TCB's macroscopic fragment appears physically plausible if we consider the fall of Carancas in 2007, with an estimated strength of 20-40 MPa. So our possible strewn field, computed for a typical fragment's speed of 10 +/- 3 km/s, is located about 11 km North-West from the epicenter, with an area of about 140 km2. Finally, Cheko Lake, which by some authors is considered an impact crater, falls about 3.5 km outside the strewn fields at 3 sigma level and it is unlikely that it could be a real impact crater: only if the TCB's trajectory had an azimuth in the range 150 degrees -180 degrees would be in the strewn field area, but this is not consistent with the most likely trajectory azimuth.

The pattern and mechanisms of EASM change during the Holocene are intensely debated. In this study, we produce a high-quality age-depth model for a 11.7 m lacustrine record (CG18B core) from central Chagan Nur (a closed-basin lake located on the southern Mongolia plateau at the fringe of the modern EASM region) using 27 radiocarbon dates on organic materials and 10 quartz optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages on the lake sediments. Multiple-proxy analyses of pollen, grain size, total organic content, and CaCO3 content are used to reconstruct Holocene monsoonal precipitation change in the region. Reconstructed Chagan Nur level changes during the Holocene are based on 18 quartz OSL ages from well-preserved paleolake shorelines at different elevations on the northwestern basin margin. A combination of the lacustrine pollen records and a paleohydrology lake level change model is used to define quantitative precipitation change at the fringe of the EASM dominated region during the Holocene. Our results show that a lake highstand of 15-12 m higher than present occurred at 11-5 ka, followed by a decrease in lake levels to 8-7 m higher than present at 4-3 ka, and a general lake lowering during the late Holocene. EASM dominated annual precipitation varied between 420 mm and 280 mm during the Holocene period in the basin, indicating a generally semi-arid environment on the southern Mongolian Plateau, and corresponding to prevailing open steppe vegetation in the basin throughout the Holocene. EASM precipitation intensity increased from the early Holocene to the beginning of the mid-Holocene, with a maximum precipitation 30-50% higher than present at 8-6 ka, followed by a decrease in precipitation during the late Holocene. EASM precipitation shown in these records lags northern Hemisphere solar insolation shifts by similar to 3 ka, indicating that variation in EASM intensity did not respond directly to northern Hemisphere summer insolation, but rather was likely modulated by high latitude forcing of ice volume and greenhouse gases.

To what extent this will also affect the stream water CO2 concentrations is poorly understood. In this study we examined the spatiotemporal variation in partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) and in stable isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic carbon (delta C-13-DIC) in subarctic streams in northern Sweden. The selected watersheds are characterized by large variations in high-latitude boreal forest and tundra and differences in bedrock. We found that all streams generally were supersaturated in pCO(2) with an average concentration of 850 mu atm. The variability in pCO(2) across streams was poorly related to vegetation cover, and carbonaceous bedrock influence was manifested in high DIC concentrations but not reflected in either stream pCO(2) or delta C-13-DIC. Stream water pCO(2) values were highest during winter base flow when we also observed the lowest delta C-13-DIC values, and this pattern is interpreted as a high contribution from CO2 from soil respiration. Summer base flow delta C-13-DIC values probably are more affected by in situ stream processes such as aquatic production/respiration and degassing. A challenge for further studies will be to disentangle the origin of stream water CO2 and quantify their relative importance.

Yet, there is growing evidence that seasonal enrichment-depletion cycles also occur in the isotope signatures of larger invertebrate consumers, taxa used to define reference points in isotope-based trophic models (e.g., trophic baselines). To evaluate the general assumption of temporal stability in non-zooplankton aquatic invertebrates, delta C-13 and delta N-15 time series data from the literature were analyzed for seasonality and the influence of biotic (feeding group) and abiotic (trophic state, climate regime) factors on isotope temporal patterns. The amplitude of delta C-13 and delta N-15 enrichment-depletion cycles was negatively related to body size, although all size-classes of invertebrates displayed a winter-to-summer enrichment in delta C-13 and depletion in delta N-15. Among feeding groups, periphytic grazers were more variable and displayed larger temporal changes in delta C-13 than detritivores. For nitrogen, temporal variability and magnitude of directional change of delta N-15 was most strongly related to ecosystem trophic state (eutrophic > mesotrophic, oligotrophic). This study provides evidence of seasonality in the isotopic composition of aquatic invertebrates across very broad geographical and ecological gradients as well as identifying factors that are likely to modulate the strength and variability of seasonality. These results emphasize the need for researchers to recognize the likelihood of temporal changes in non-zooplankton aquatic invertebrate consumers at time scales relevant to seasonal studies and, if present, to account for temporal dynamics in isotope trophic models.

However, the altered flow caused by anthropogenic activities and climate change complicates the transition process. Identifying critical nutrient loadings for state transitions and their relationship with flow change has become an increasingly crucial scientific issue for managing lake ecosystems. Lake Dianchi, a shallow plateau lake that suffers from long-term eutrophication and extensive water regulation, was used as a case study to explore the critical nutrient loading under changing flow regimes. To this end, we established the PCLake+ + model for Lake Dianchi using the parameters from native submerged macrophytes and long-term observational data. The results showed the following. (1) From 2001 to 2018, the lake's trophic status was moderately eutrophic with slight inter-annual fluctuations, and the most severe period occurred in the summer and autumn. (2) The critical total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) loadings of the lake from the clear-water state dominated by submerged macrophytes to the turbid-water state dominated by algae were 45.89 mg N m-2 d-1 and 3.53 mg P m-2 d-1 , respectively. Those from the turbid to the clear state were 26.78 mg N m-2 d-1 and 2.06 mg P m-2 d-1 , respectively, which were close to the actual external inputs of TN and TP loadings, indicating that the lake entered a critical period for restoration. (3) The water level and inflow significantly changed the critical TN and TP loadings and impacted the restoration threshold more than degradation. Decreasing water level or increasing water inflow can effectively rise the critical TN and TP loadings of both degradation and restoration, which is conducive to accelerating the evolution of aquatic ecosystems towards a clear-water state dominated by submerged macrophytes.

Previously published research by Metcalfe et al. highlighted questions relating to conditions at the last glacial maximum (LGM), the nature of the transition from glacial to interglacial conditions, and change over the Holocene, including the role of phenomena such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Here, data from the Sonoran Desert, the Chihuahuan Desert, and the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB) (and adjacent oceans) are reviewed. In the desert regions, the mid-Pleistocene may have been drier than the late Pleistocene, which was significantly cooler than present and saw more winter precipitation derived from midlatitude frontal systems. There was a significant expansion southward of woodland taxa, although many fossil vegetation assemblages apparently have no modern analogues. Extensive paleolakes existed in the modern desert. Conditions wetter than present persisted into the Holocene, but the modern summer rainfall regime may not have become established until after 9000 uncalibrated radiocarbon-dated years before present (C-14 yr. BP). Fully modern conditions started about 4000 C-14 yr. BP. In the TMVB, sparse lake sediment records indicate that the mid-Pleistocene may have been wetter than the late Pleistocene. Further data are still required to confirm whether the proposed pattern of a wet west and a dry east around the LGM holds true. Most lake sediment records show major anthropogenic influence from the mid-Holocene on, although there is evidence for increasing climatic variability in the late Holocene. New deep sea core records indicate the glacial meltwater was re-routed into the Gulf of Mexico after the Younger Dryas cool event, helping to explain the delayed onset of the modern summer rainfall pattern in relation to general warming. High-resolution records are still confined to deep sea cores and tree rings, but highlight the region's vulnerability to climatic change.

J	Wang, W; Zhang, DL				Wang, Wei; Zhang, Dongliang			Holocene vegetation evolution and climatic dynamics inferred from an ombrotrophic peat sequence in the southern Altai Mountains within China	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Based on pollen data of 274 samples from a 550-cm core at Kelashazi Peat in the southern Altai Mountains within China, we reconstructed the Holocene vegetation dynamics and climatic change. The pollen assemblages and the associated biome scores indicate that the vegetation in Kelashazi valley was dominated by alpine meadows during the early Holocene (before similar to 8.2 cal. kyr BP) and by taiga forests in the middle Holocene (similar to 8.2-similar to 5.6 cal. kyr BP) that was followed by an expansion of alpine meadows (similar to 5.6-similar to 3.2 cal. kyr BP). The pollen based temperature index-indicated thermal maximum lasting from similar to 8.0 to similar to 5.6 cal. kyr BP was consistent with temperature stack for 60-30 degrees N and the later onset warming at Kelashazi Peat was associated with the cooling influence of remnant ice sheets in the early Holocene. The pollen-based increasing moisture index curve from Kelashazi Peat is in a good agreement with the synthesized decreasing aridity index curve in low-elevation regions of the Altai Mountains and the surrounding areas during the data-overlapping period between similar to 12.0 and similar to 3.2 cal. kyr BP. The Holocene wetting trend at Kelashazi Peat might have resulted not only from the increasing trend of NAO-related winter precipitation but also from the increasing trend of AMO-modulated summer precipitation.																			0921-8181	1872-6364				AUG	2019	179						10	22		10.1016/j.gloplacha.2019.05.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2019.05.003													WOS:000472691900002
J	Soranno, PA				Soranno, PA			Factors affecting the timing of surface scums and epilimnetic blooms of blue-green algae in a eutrophic lake	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Blue-green algal blooms, which can occur mixed throughout the epilimnion or as scums at the lake surface, develop in response to a variety of factors. However, it is still unclear what conditions suggest that blooms are imminent or how far in advance blooms can be forecast. I assessed the predictability of surface scums and epilimnetic blooms from limnological, physical, and meteorological variables using data sampled daily during summer and fall 1993 in Lake Mendota, Wisconsin. Daily chlorophyll a (a measure of blue-green algal biomass) was correlated to some weather, physical, and grazing variables at lags ranging from 0 to 9 days. Conditions immediately preceding surface scums were variable, making predictions difficult. However, during surface scums, Secchi disk depth, wind velocity, atmospheric pressure, and precipitation were significantly different than when the scums were absent. Based on predictors examined in this study, I developed criteria that identify the conditions sufficient for scums to form. In Lake Mendota, conditions sufficient for surface scum formation (proper weather and water column conditions and a pre-existing algal population) occur much more often than scums are observed. This study shows the importance of weather in determining both epilimnetic blue-green algal biomass and surface scum formation.

J	Clulow, FV; Dave, NK; Lim, TP; Avadhanula, R				Clulow, FV; Dave, NK; Lim, TP; Avadhanula, R			Radium-226 in water, sediments, and fish from lakes near the city of Elliot Lake, Ontario, Canada	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Ra-226 was measured by alpha-emission spectroscopy in water, sediments, and fish (tissues and gut contents), from five lakes in a watershed containing U mining and milling operations at Elliot Lake, Ontario, and from control lakes in an adjacent non-industrialized watershed. Ra-226 transfer parameters from lake water and sediments to fish tissues, and annual intakes by humans consuming fish, were estimated. Mean dissolved Ra-226 levels ranged from similar to 76 mBq litre(-1) in water of the most affected lake, to < 10 mBq litre(-1) in control lakes. Levels in summer were consistently higher than in fall or winter; no consistent variation with depth was noted. Sediment levels ranged from similar to 3000 mBq g(-1) dry wt in one study lake to < 100 mBq g(-1) dry wt of sediment in control lakes. Bone 226Ra concentrations were higher than in muscle. The lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), a predatory secondary consumer, had bone 226Ra levels (< 20 mBq g(-1) dry wt) that did not show significant site variation. In contrast, bottom feeding whitefish had significantly more Ra-226 in bone tissue (to 38 mBq g(-1) dry wt in the lake whitefish, Coregonus clupeaformis, and 76 mBq g(-1) in round whitefish, Prosopium cylindraceum) in study lakes than in controls (< 20 mBq g(-1) dry wt). Ra-226 levels in lake trout muscle were low and showed erratic variation among lakes whereas levels in whitefish muscle did not vary significantly among study and control sites. Lake herring (= cisco, Coregonus artedii), a planktivorous fish taken only from Quirke Lake, had mean Ra-226 levels of 18 and 1.4 mBq g(-1) dry wt in bone and muscle, respectively. Gut Ra-226 levels, highest in lake trout from McCabe and Quirke Lakes (126+/-53, 64+/-44 mBq g(-1) dry wt, respectively), and just detectable in McCabe and Elliot Lake whitefish (24+/-2, 36+/-14 mBq g(-1) dry wt, respectively), were below detection in lake trout and whitefish from other lakes. Concentration ratios (CRs) of Ra-226 from water to muscle ranged from 8 to 14 in lake trout, 7 to 14 in whitefish, and 4 to 6 in lake herring. The water to bone CRs varied from 81 to 142, 314 to 548, and 126 to 272 in the same species. CRs were always < 1 between sediments and fish tissues. Annual intake of Ra-226 by human consumers of these fish was estimated to provide an effective dose of 0.003 mSv year(-1). This represents a small fraction of both natural background (> 2 mSv year(-1)) and the public dose limit (5 mSv year(-1)). (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Changes in fire regime explain the Holocene rise and fall of Abies balsamea in the coniferous forests of western Quebec, Canada	HOLOCENE												The coniferous boreal forest of northeastern North America is characterized by large and severe fire events and dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana), with scattered patches of balsam fir (Abies balsamea), a species otherwise predominant in the more southern mixedwood boreal forests, characterized by smaller and less severe fire events. Because balsam fir is a late-successional species ill-adapted to fire, this study aimed at determining if the scattered balsam-fir patches found in the coniferous forest were relics of a former fire regime characterized by less frequent and/or severe conflagrations. Fire and vegetation history were assessed for a coniferous forest site through analyses of charcoal, pollen and plant macroremains preserved in lake sediments, peat and hydromorphic forest soil. Pollen and macroremains analyses show that black spruce dominated the local vegetation since deglaciation (c. 8000 cal. yr BP). Balsam fir was abundant around the site during the warm and humid summers of the Hypsithermal (between c. 7000 and 3500 cal. yr BP), before gradually declining during the cool and dry Neoglacial, which was characterized by increased fire frequency and severity. Scattered balsam fir patches in the coniferous forest result from the fragmentation of formerly larger populations and are presently in disequilibrium with climate.					; Asselin, Hugo/H-9980-2013; Carcaillet, Christopher/G-1218-2011	Carcaillet, Christopher/0000-0002-6632-1507; Asselin, Hugo/0000-0002-9542-4994; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				AUG	2008	18	5					693	703		10.1177/0959683608091780	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683608091780													WOS:000258277200003

Hydrologic pathways and nutrient loading in the headwaters of the Western Lake Erie Basin	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: Western Lake Erie Basin (WLEB). The WLEB is a flat, artificially drained, and intensively managed agricultural region typical of the U.S. Midwest. Study focus: The study objective was to quantify hydrologic pathways using tracer-based hydrograph separation in a headwater watershed (19 km2) of the WLEB and assess relationships between water sources and fluxes and nutrient delivery. High-frequency measurement of two tracers (oxygen-18, 518O; electrical conductivity, EC) along with discharge and nutrient concentration (nitrogen, N; phosphorus, P) was conducted at the watershed outlet (2017-2020). New hydrological insights for the region: Results provide new insights into hydrologic and nutrient transport processes in artificially drained agricultural watersheds. Findings showed that 76 % discharge occurred during the winter and spring due to a threshold relationship with precipitation and soil moisture deficit. Hydrograph separation using 518O and EC provided similar estimates of event water (26 +/- 13 % and 26 +/- 11 %, respectively), but substantial differences (up to 21 %) were observed between tracers for individual storms. Annually, event water comprised 13-27 % of discharge. Nutrient loads during storm events were strongly correlated to discharge, as flowweighted mean concentrations (FWMCs) were consistent among storms and seasons. Both dissolved reactive P and ammonium-N FWMC were correlated to water sources. Findings suggest that decreasing discharge, decreasing the nutrient supply, and enhancing nutrient removal within ditch networks are needed to decrease nutrient loading drained watersheds in the WLEB.																				2214-5818				APR	2025	58								102275	10.1016/j.ejrh.2025.102275	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2025.102275		MAR 2025											WOS:001443103500001

Evidence of summer thermal stratification in extreme northern lakes	ARCTIC SCIENCE												Rapid warming in the High Arctic has induced changes in terrestrial environments that have included major recent shifts in lakes and ponds. Numerous studies exist of spatial trends in water chemistry, bioindicator groups, and paleoenvironmental change from High Arctic lakes; however, little is known about lake thermal stratification regimes at high latitudes beyond assumptions based on generalized classification schemes. Here, we report on the presence in late July 2022 of positive thermal stratification during open-water conditions in two freshwater lakes near Clements Markham Inlet, on northern Ellesmere Island. These lakes are situated in the polar desert at 82.6(degrees)N, >1000 km north of the generally accepted northern limit of summer thermal stratification. Given their location approaching the northernmost land on Earth, the thermal profiles of these lakes suggest that the occurrence of summer stratification may no longer be discounted anywhere in the Northern Hemisphere.					; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019; Oliva, Marc/K-5423-2014	Garcia-Oteyza Ciria, Julia Nieves/0000-0002-0187-2922; Antoniades, Dermot/0000-0001-6629-4839; Klanten, Yohanna/0000-0002-0026-2428; Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; Cameron, Emma/0000-0002-2325-2927; Oliva, Marc/0000-0001-6521-6388														2368-7460				MAR	2024	10	1					225	232		10.1139/AS-2023-0037	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/AS-2023-0037		DEC 2023											WOS:001115604800001

The Patagonian basaltic plateaus, located in one of the most arid regions of South America, hold thousands of shallow lakes and ponds and some large lakes, where vegetated lakes are the prime habitat for waterbirds, including endemic threatened species. We studied 31-different lakes at the two main Patagonian plateaus (Strobel and Buenos Aires) during successive spring-summer field trips from 2007 to 2016. We focused on the differences between fishless and stocked lakes under contrasting hydrologic regimes (relatively stable waters and decreasing water level. Our survey evidenced the effect of fish introduction and water level decrease on the limnological features of the lakes and their phyto and zooplankton communities. Arheic shallow lakes showed a decreased water level accompanied by an increased conductivity, and several shifted from a clear-vegetated state to a more turbid condition, with increased algal biomass and demise in submerged macrophytes. Fishless lakes presented higher total zooplankton and macrozooplankton biomass and lower phytoplankton biomass than fish stocked lakes. Our findings provide evidence that under a scenario of climate change, the effect of the decrease in water level may enhance the adverse effects of fish introduction. (C) 2018 The Authors.

J	Dunalska, JA				Dunalska, J. A.			Impact of morphometric and catchment variables on summer organic carbon richness in deep temperate lakes	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												The study lakes are located in north-eastern Poland, in the same physiographic system. These lakes were formed during the last glacial period. The lakes differed in morphometry, catchment size and environmental conditions. The study included deep, clear water lakes that stratify in summer. The results from multiple linear regression equations indicate that the morphometric and catchment variables may influence mainly the particulate fraction of OC during summer stratification. No significant correlation was found between the examined parameters and the quantity (DOC) or the carbon-specific absorbance (SUVA(260)) of the dissolved fraction. The most important factors which determine POC abundance in lakes are the maximum depth (z(max)), length and development of shoreline (L, D(L)), catchment area to lake volume (C(A)/V), and stratification percentage ("% strat."), as well as epilimnion bottom area to epilimnion volume (A(E)/V(E)). Thus, in the summer the quantity of OC in lakes, especially of POC, will be determined by the in-lake production and consumption processes. Low productivity can be easily maintained in deep, strongly stratified lakes, and therefore should be protected and high water quality should be preserved.					; Dunalska, Julita/I-3290-2018	Dunalska, Julita/0000-0001-6089-9140; 													1961-9502						2011		403							03	10.1051/kmae/2011043	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/kmae/2011043													WOS:000299310800004

Differences between lakes and seas result because the sea has a much higher salinity and much larger size. Thus the frozen sea has a lower temperature, a macroscopic porous ice structure at the water interface, higher current velocities, and discontinuous ice cover compared with frozen lakes. Both systems exhibit complex differential movements of water masses with differing solute content resulting from freezeout distillation. The biological differences resulting from the physical differences include the absence of ice communities, shorter food chains, lower diversity, lower benthic and higher fish biomass, and lack of mammals and birds in lakes compared with seas in winter.																			0004-0851					FEB	1991	23	1					11	23		10.2307/1551432	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1551432													WOS:A1991FB01900003

Size-dependent overwinter mortality imposes a time constraint on behavioral programs of juvenile fishes: individuals must achieve a sufficient size by the end of the growing season to survive. I developed a dynamic optimization model to evaluate how severity of size-dependent overwinter mortality alters habitat use by minnows. The littoral zone was the safest habitat with respect to predation. In lakes where zooplankton exhibit diel vertical migration, fish migrate to the pelagic at night and return to the littoral during the day to maximize foraging rates. Model results demonstrated that size-dependent overwinter mortality should lead to development of more pronounced predation risk-taking by fishes in lakes with severe winters. Individuals are predicted to initiate diel littoral-pelagic migrations at smaller sizes as winter severity increases or as hatch date within a season increases. This analysis suggests that the time constraint imposed by size-selective overwinter mortality has important consequences for life history strategies of juvenile fishes. The effects of time constraints on behavior are expected to be especially important near the high latitudinal limits of a species' geographic distribution.																			0706-652X						1999	56			1			61	70		10.1139/cjfas-56-S1-61	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-56-S1-61													WOS:000085591600007

In lit:oral areas where groundwater inflow occurs, sulfate supply from groundwater creates profiles of electron accepters (sulfate) and donors (methane, sulfide) that are reversed from those found in sediments whose sulfate supply is delivered from overlying water. The highest MeHg concentrations in porewaters and the maximal advective MeHg flux rates (4.5-61.7 ng.m(-2.)day(-1)) were observed in the spring, while highest bulk phase concentrations occur later in the summer. These estimated MeHg fluxes are greater than the mean areal production rates estimated previously for the water column and are similar to the atmospheric flux. Gross MeHg production was measured using the addition of Hg-203 as a tracer to sediments. The depth at which maximal Hg-203 methylation occurred coincided with the observed maximums in solid-phase and porewater MeHg concentrations. Because input, advection, and accumulation of MeHg in these sediments were measured directly, an independent estimate of MeHg production could be made and compared with Hg-203-derived rates. This comparison suggests that that the Hg-203 tracer method provides reasonable estimates of gross methylation rates and that a substantial fraction of solid-phase Hg is available for methylation.

In two of the lakes the introduction was a complete failure: the whitefish did not survive, evidently due to high acidity and high aluminium concentrations of the lake waters. In one of the most acidified lakes (pH 4.3-4.8, Al(lab) 29-125 mug l-1) and in two less acidic lakes (pH 5.0-5.2 and 5.4-6.4), introduction was successful. Three years after the introduction, the mean weights of the fish in those three lakes were 580, 250 and 360 g respectively, with the weight and also the condition factor of stocked whitefish being highest in the most acidified lake. In that lake there were few or no fish present during the introduction, whereas in the less acid lakes there were dense populations of perch and therefore a potential interspecific competition for food. Different availability of food in the lakes was presumed to be the main reason for the growth differences. Plasma Na+ and Cl- concentrations of whitefish were lower in the acidic lakes than in the lake with pH around 6 three years after stocking. This suggests that, despite the good growth and highest condition factor of whitefish in the most acid lake, the fish still experienced some acid stress.

Spatial differences in dissolved silicon utilization in Lake Baikal, Siberia: Examining the impact of high diatom biomass events and eutrophication	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Recent research has highlighted how Lake Baikal, Siberia, has responded to the direct and indirect effects of climate change (e.g., ice-cover duration), nutrient loading, and pollution, manifesting as changes in phytoplankton/zooplankton populations, community structure, and seasonal succession. Here, we combine and compare analyses of chlorophyll a (an estimate of total algal biomass), carotenoid pigments (biomarkers of algal groups), and lake water silicon isotope geochemistry (delta Si-30(DSi)) to differentiate spatial patterns in dissolved silicon (DSi) uptake at Lake Baikal. A total of 15 sites across the three basins (south, central, and north) of Lake Baikal were sampled in August 2013 along a depth gradient of 0-180 m. Strong, significant correlations were found between vertical profiles of photic zone DSi concentrations and delta Si-30(DSi) compositions (r = -0.81, p < 0.001), although these are strongest in the central basin aphotic zone (r = -0.98, p < 0.001). Data refute the hypothesis of DSi uptake by picocyanobacteria. Algal biomass profiles and high surface delta Si-30(DSi) compositions suggest greater productivity in the south basin and more oligotrophic conditions in the north basin. delta Si-30(DSi) signatures are highest at depth (20 m) in central basin sites, indicating greater (10-40%) DSi utilization at deep chlorophyll maxima. DSi limitation occurs in the pelagic central basin, probably reflecting a high diatom biomass bloom event (Aulacoseira baicalensis).

Wetlands in Changed Landscapes: The Influence of Habitat Transformation on the Physico-Chemistry of Temporary Depression Wetlands	PLOS ONE												Temporary wetlands dominate the wet season landscape of temperate, semi-arid and arid regions, yet, other than their direct loss to development and agriculture, little information exists on how remaining wetlands have been altered by anthropogenic conversion of surrounding landscapes. This study investigates relationships between the extent and type of habitat transformation around temporary wetlands and their water column physico-chemical characteristics. A set of 90 isolated depression wetlands (seasonally inundated) occurring on coastal plains of the south-western Cape mediterranean-climate region of South Africa was sampled during the winter/spring wet season of 2007. Wetlands were sampled across habitat transformation gradients according to the areal cover of agriculture, urban development and alien invasive vegetation within 100 and 500 m radii of each wetland edge. We hypothesized that the principal drivers of physico-chemical conditions in these wetlands (e.g. soil properties, basin morphology) are altered by habitat transformation. Multivariate multiple regression analyses (distance-based Redundancy Analysis) indicated significant associations between wetland physico-chemistry and habitat transformation (overall transformation within 100 and 500 m, alien vegetation cover within 100 and 500 m, urban cover within 100 m); although for significant regressions the amount of variation explained was very low (range: similar to 2 to similar to 5.5%), relative to that explained by purely spatio-temporal factors (range: similar to 35.5 to similar to 43%). The nature of the relationships between each type of transformation in the landscape and individual physico-chemical variables in wetlands were further explored with univariate multiple regressions. Results suggest that conservation of relatively narrow (similar to 100 m) buffer strips around temporary wetlands is likely to be effective in the maintenance of natural conditions in terms of physico-chemical water quality.					; Bird, Matthew/AAB-5127-2020	Bird, Matthew/0000-0001-9163-1008; 													1932-6203					FEB 12	2014	9	2							e88935	10.1371/journal.pone.0088935	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0088935								24533161					WOS:000331262600119

A total of 271 kt/yr of solid particles entered the Grimsel reservoirs on average in the last 71 years, mostly by turbiditic underflows that focused sedimentation in depocenters upstream of obstacles such as bedrock ridges, submerged moraines, or dams. This is equivalent to a sediment yield of 2430 t/(km(2)yr) in the catchment (111.5 km(2)) or a denudation rate of 0.94 mm/yr. A total of 39 kt/yr of the fine fraction (<similar to 4 mu m) leave the reservoirs and are transported to downstream Lake Brienz, while 232 kt/yr of mostly coarse particles are retained, reducing total sediment input of the River Aare into Lake Brienz by two thirds. Modeling the particle budgets in the Aare with and without dams indicates that the fine fraction budgets are only slightly affected by damming, but that the reservoirs cause a shift in seasonal runoff timing resulting in increasing and decreasing particle transport in winter and summer, respectively. Thus, hydrodamming alters mostly deltaic sedimentation in Lake Brienz, where the coarse fraction is deposited, whereas fine grained distal sedimentation and varve formation on lateral slopes are less affected. All varved records of the reservoirs and Lake Brienz that provide sediment rates and grain size records on an annual basis indicate that climate is the main control on these proxies, while, for instance, the onset of pump storage activity in the reservoirs did not impose any significant change in lacustrine sedimentation pattern.

Spatial and Seasonal Variations in Condition, Somatic Index and Length-Weight Relationship of Capoeta banarescui (Cyprinidae) from The coruh River, Northeastern Anatolia, Turkey	JOURNAL OF ICHTHYOLOGY												The spatial and seasonal variations in some growth parameters of Capoeta banarescui have been studied by considering environmental factors. A total of 1993 fish was caught by electro fishing monthly from March 2001 to February 2002 at five different stations through the upper coruh River. Condition factor did not significantly differ among males, females, and juveniles but it was affected by study sites. Somatic index, varied spatially with lowest value recorded in Nihak (1.254) and highest value in Maden (1.342). Condition factor and somatic index had similar monthly pattern, with some minor exceptions depending on the study sites and the sampling periods. b value of length-weight relationship varied between 2.729 and 3.288. While fish from Kirik and Nihak showed negative allometric growth those from the other 3 sites had isometric growth. The highest b values for both sexes were observed in early spring while the lowest values generally occurred in fall. While, pH, phosphate and silicate did not significantly change between the stations, significantly higher temperature values were observed in Nihak and Kirazli. Significantly higher nitrate concentration, with a value of 3.61mg/L was observed in Nihak. Ammonium concentrations in Bayburt, Kirazli and Nihak stations showed significant increase comparing Kirik and Maden stations. Turbidity was significantly influenced by the study sites; the highest value observed in Nihak (31.79 +/- 42.12 FAU).

Zooplankton dynamics in a Great Lakes connecting channel: Exploring the seasonal composition within the St. Clair-Detroit River System	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The connecting channels linking the Laurentian Great Lakes provide important migration routes, spawning grounds, and nursery habitat for fish, but their role as conduits between lakes for zooplankton is less understood. To address this knowledge gap in the St. Clair-Detroit River System (SCDRS), a comprehensive survey of crustacean zooplankton was performed in both riverine and lacustrine habitats from spring to fall 2014, providing the first system-wide assessment of zooplankton in the SCDRS. Zooplankton density and biomass were greatest in northern reaches of the system (southern Lake Huron and the St. Clair River) and decreased downstream towards Lake Erie. The composition of zooplankton also changed moving downstream, transitioning from a community dominated by calanoid copepods, to more cyclopoids and cladocerans in the Detroit River, and to cladocerans dominant in western Lake Erie. Coincidentally, species richness increased as sampling progressed downstream, and we estimated that our single-year sampling regime identified similar to 88% of potential taxa. Other species assemblages have responded positively to recent water quality and habitat restoration efforts in the SCDRS, and this survey of the zooplankton community provides benchmark information necessary to assess its response to continued recovery. In addition, information regarding the lower trophic levels of the system is integral to understanding recruitment of ecologically and economically valuable fish species targeted for recovery in the SCDRS.

Seasonal changes in optical properties of two contrasting tropical freshwater systems	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												We investigated how allochthonous and autochthonous sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM) affected the optical conditions and chemical characteristics of two contrasting tropical freshwater systems (Dom Helvecio-DH and Pampulha Reservoir) in a dry and rainy period in 2013. We analyzed PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) and UV (ultraviolet) attenuation coefficients, nutrients, chlorophylla (Chl-a), dissolved organic matter (DOC) and spectral characteristics of CDOM (colored dissolved organic matter). Significant differences in CDOM sources and quantity were observed, with a dominantly terrestrial input in DH during the rainy period with approximately 50% higher DOC and Chl-a levels, and a doubling in total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) compared to the dry winter period. The eutrophic Pampulha had several fold higher levels of DOC, Chl-a, TN and TP, with organic matter of mostly originating from phytoplankton in both seasons. Differences in source and quantity had strong implications on water transparency, DOC concentrations, CDOM quality and its susceptibility to photo-and biodegradation. DH was several fold clearer in both the UV and PAR spectrum. In DH transparency to both UV and PAR radiation was highest during the summer, suggesting elevated photo-and biodegradation during stratification. Pampulha was most transparent in the dry period even during period of algal bloom. In both systems we observed seasonal variations in concentrations of nutrients and Chl-a, and in DH differences were also found in DOC concentrations as well as the specific UV absorbance (SUVA(254)) and molecular size (M). Our results documents that different sources of DOM and seasonal inputs reflect in the seasonality of apparent and inherent optical properties and nutrients availability with implications for water quality and aquatic community.

Direct evidence for shifts in monsoonal wind strength is often limited to marine proxy records, while terrestrial reconstructions (e.g. lake levels and spleothems) focus on precipitation. Here, we present the first evidence of terrestrial summer monsoon wind strength changes from Lake Rara, western Nepal, based on Mn/Ti ratios, a proxy for lake stratification. These data indicate a link between the Arabian Sea and the Himalayas, suggesting that centennial- to millennial-scale changes in wind strength occurred synchronously. Distinct similarity is also observed between Lake Rara and the southern part of China, which may support previous suggestions that the southern part of China is influenced by Indian summer monsoon.

Local hydrodynamics are important in determining the degree to which fluvial sediments are removed from the water column and retained on the delta complex. During 2014, we measured hydrodynamics and sediment transport characteristics at one of the world's most rapidly prograding deltas, the Wax Lake delta in Louisiana, USA. We observed waves to be the dominant source of bottom stress for 70% of our observations. Sediment concentration tended to increase with shear stress, but only after stresses exceeded 0.01-0.02 Pa. Significant wave height and bottom stress were substantially reduced after June, when the emergence of American lotus (Nelumbo lutea) formed a dense canopy over the intertidal regions of the island splay. Hydrodynamics during these summer vegetated conditions were much more favorable to floc formation, and by extension particle settling, as shown by trends in the Kolmogorov microscale parameter over the course of the measurement campaign. Together, these findings suggest that the timing between peak river discharge and the emergence of vegetation may have a strong influence on rates of progradation in seasonally vegetated delta splays, whereby sediments delivered by flood events that extend late into summer may be governed by hydrodynamics that favor particle deposition, whereas those delivered prior to the summer may be more prone to remain in suspension and bypass the delta complex.

S. A.) during a period of high mysid shrimp abundance and after a major decline in mysid abundance caused by the invasion of the overbite clam Potamocorbula amurensis. Prior to the invasion, high dietary overlap, high stomach fullness, and low niche breadth occurred among the fishes in spring when mysid populations were high. Dietary overlaps decreased and niche breadth increased for all species but the endemic splittail Pogonichthys macrolepidotus in fall when mysid populations were low. Eight native species exhibited lower overall collective overlaps and fuller stomachs than five alien species, suggesting more efficient resource partitioning. After mysid abundance declined, only alien striped bass Morone saxatilis preyed upon mysids in greater than trace amounts. An alien mysid became an important prey for small striped bass, but striped bass also switched to piscivory at a smaller size than when mysids were abundant. Eight of 13 species exhibited significant declines in abundance during the study period, which were concordant with the original importance of mysids in their diets. Our results suggest that altered lower food web dynamics in the San Francisco Estuary caused by the invasion of the overbite clam changed fish diets and have contributed to declines in fish abundance.																			0378-1909					JUL	2003	67	3					277	288		10.1023/A:1025839132274	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1025839132274													WOS:000185463400007
J	[Anonymous]				[Anonymous]			Do females really outnumber males in ruff Philomachus pugnax wintering in Africa?	JOURNAL FUR ORNITHOLOGIE												Four ringing expeditions were carried out in Senegal in the winter periods from 1984 to 1988. Another expedition visited the Lake Chad basin in January/February 1991. Totally 1,989 Ruffs were caught in Senegal and 105 at Lake Chad in northern Cameroon. Age proportions varied only between different ringing sites in the same year. But sex ratios of adult birds could vary both between different sites and at the same site in different nights. Possible reasons for the changing results are discussed. Totally in the Senegal 35.1 % of all birds were males, in adult birds 37.7 % and in first-year birds 27.6 %. The proportion of males was about 46 % at Lake Chad. The wintering population in the Senegal delta was estimated at about 80-200,000 birds and at Lake Chad in Cameroon at somewhere between 250-350,000 birds. In these two very important winter areas males are much more numerous than reported from Last and South Africa. So the sex ratio seems to be more balanced than supposed up to now. But because there is a lack of information from other important areas, like the innundation zone of the river Niger in Mali or southern Sudan, sex ratio of the total African wintering population cannot be investigated finally. Proportion of first-year birds varied in the Senegal between 24 and 31 % and was about 40 % at Lake Chad.																			0021-8375					JAN	1996	137	1					91	100																WOS:A1996TY36000005

Abrupt deglaciation on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau: evidence from Lake Qinghai	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												We inferred the climate history for Central Asia over the past 20,000 years, using sediments from core QH07, taken in the southeastern basin of Lake Qinghai, which lies at the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. Results from multiple environmental indicators are internally consistent and yield a clear late Pleistocene and Holocene climate record. Carbonate content and total organic carbon (TOC) in Lake Qinghai sediments are interpreted as indicators of the strength of the Asian summer monsoon. Warm and wet intervals, associated with increased monsoon strength, are indicated by increased carbonate and TOC content. During the glacial period (similar to 20,000 to similar to 14,600 cal year BP), summer monsoon intensity remained low and relatively constant at Lake Qinghai, suggesting cool, dry, and relatively stable climate conditions. The inferred stable, cold, arid environment of the glacial maximum seems to persist through the Younger Dryas time period, and little or no evidence of a warm interval correlative with the Bolling-Allerod is found in the QH07 record. The transition between the late Pleistocene and the Holocene, about 11,500 cal year BP, was abrupt, more so than indicated by speleothems in eastern China. The Holocene (similar to 11,500 cal year BP to present) was a time of enhanced summer monsoon strength and greater variability, indicating relatively wetter but more unstable climatic conditions than those of the late Pleistocene. The warmest, wettest part of the Holocene, marked by increased organic matter and carbonate contents, occurred from similar to 11,500 to similar to 9,000 cal year BP, consistent with maximum summer insolation contrast between 30A degrees N and 15A degrees N. A gradual reduction in precipitation (weakened summer monsoon) is inferred from decreased carbonate content through the course of the Holocene. We propose that changes in the contrast of summer insolation between 30A degrees N and 15A degrees N are the primary control on the Asian monsoon system over glacial/interglacial time scales. Secondary influences may include regional and global albedo changes attributable to ice-cover and vegetation shifts and sea level changes (distance from moisture source in Pacific Ocean). The abruptness of the change at the beginning of the Holocene, combined with an increase in variability, suggest a threshold for the arrival of monsoonal rainfall at the northeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau.

Eutrophic lakes also exhibit a unique role in global carbon, yet, data on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from these eutrophic lakes are too scarce to accurately upscale CO2 emissions for large scale or global estimation. This study presented the results of a partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) survey covering 43 eutrophic lakes in China in the same season across diverse ecosystem types and climate zones. The first estimation of CO2 flux from Chinese eutrophic lakes was reported as - 0.7 to 1.0 Tg C a(-1) based on the surveyed pCO(2) values, indicating some lakes act as CO2 sinks while others are sources. The results showed that pCO(2) in Chinese eutrophic lakes ranged from 0.9 to 1366.4 mu atm with the mean of 356.9 +/- 310.3 mu atm, almost 69.3 % of the sampling sites in eutrophic lakes were undersaturated with CO2 to the atmosphere. The mean pCO(2) variations in eutrophic lakes were consistent with the amount of precipitation across different climate zones, with the trend of semiarid > semihumid > humid regions, and all lower than that for atmosphere. Meanwhile, both the mean and median values of pCO(2) went down with the decrease of the lake mean depth and the increasing lake area, and the highest value in deep lakes (mean depth > 10 m, 548.3 +/- 353.7 mu atm) and small lakes (376.6 +/- 329.8 mu atm). In all the studied eutrophic lakes, pCO(2) values showed significant seasonal variations, and in summer and autumn showed an under-saturated seasonal mean value. This study proved that CO2 undersaturation was prevalent in the eutrophic conditions. Due to the CO2 source-sink conversion role of eutrophic lakes, it is recommended to focus on CO2 fluxs from eutrophic lakes in the first place during the research of inland waters carbon emissions.					liu, shiwei/HRC-8862-2023														1470-160X	1872-7034				SEP	2024	166								112529	10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.112529	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.112529		AUG 2024											WOS:001302407700001

Fecundity and reproductive life history of anadromous rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) in coastal waters of Massachusetts	FISHERY BULLETIN												Abundance and harvest of rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) in the northwest Atlantic Ocean have declined sharply in recent decades, with a concurrent reduction in the historic geographic range of this species. These declines have occurred while management responses have been limited by information gaps on the life history of this species. We assessed reproductive attributes of rainbow smelt caught in marine waters during winter and compared their size and age characteristics to those of fish sampled from spring spawning runs in 4 coastal rivers in Massachusetts. Total fecundity of rainbow smelt was 4880-51,651 oocytes. Fecundity was positively related with total length (TL), total weight, ovarian weight, and age. Immature rainbow smelt were rarely caught during spawning runs but composed 10% of the marine samples. This observation, a maturity ogive for rainbow smelt from marine waters, and differences in TL of age-1 fish between marine and river samples confirm that age-1 rainbow smelt are not fully recruited to spawning runs. Samples from spawning runs had a higher proportion of age-1 rainbow smelt, a lower proportion of those age 3 or older, a higher instantaneous rate of total mortality, and a lower number of eggs produced per recruit than have been previously documented for rainbow smelt-all indications of declining population health.

Ecology of an estuarine mysid shrimp in the Columbia River (USA)	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												The estuarine mysid, Neomysis mercedis, has colonized John Day and other run-of-the-river Reservoirs of the Columbia River, over 400 km from the estuary. In John Day Reservoir N. mercedis numbers peaked (2 m(-3)) in August in areas near the dam in association with lower water velocity and softer bottom than at the upstream sampling sites. Neomysis broods were primarily released in late spring and early fall. Gut content analysis showed that Neomysis feeds mostly on cladoceran zooplankton and rotifers in John Day Reservoir. Diel vertical migration was documented, with daytime distribution restricted to the bottom and preferentially to the soft-textured sediments in the deepest areas. Common pelagic fishes in the reservoir, especially juvenile American shad (Alosa sapidissima) and chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), are daytime zooplankton feeders that cannot prey on Neomysis owing to mysid diel vertical migration. Thus, Neomysis has become an important food web component in John Day Reservoir.

Matthew; Gallion, Garret; Carroll, Rachel; Baker, Wade; Connor, Jessie; Smith, Sadie			Shorebird abundance, migration phenology, and invertebrate prey availability at a mid-continental stopover site in Kentucky, USA	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												While often overlooked, permanent wetlands (e.g., lakes, rivers) can provide consistent stopover habitat for interior migrating shorebirds. We studied shorebird use and forage abundance during autumn migration on mudflats associated with Kentucky Lake (Kentucky, USA), a major reservoir situated in a mid-continental agroecosystem landscape. We focused our work on seasonally exposed Kentucky Lake mudflats, which are the result of lake drawdowns (i.e. incremental reduction of water levels from July to November) conducted by the Tennessee Valley Authority for power production and water level control. Our objectives were to: (1) assess shorebird abundance and migration phenology via census counts, (2) estimate the effects of shorebird foraging activity on benthic macroinvertebrate (hereafter, invertebrate) resources using exclosures, and (3) determine factors influencing variation in invertebrate abundance along transects perpendicular to the waterline. We found that shorebirds routinely used mudflats (n = 2,121 detections) and individuals were observed within as little as 1 day after initial mudflat exposure in late summer, suggesting that earlier lake drawdown would provide additional foraging habitat, especially for early long-distance migrants. Foraging was the most commonly observed shorebird behavior ( >73% in both years), yet we found no difference in invertebrate abundance or size class inside versus outside of foraging exclosures (n = 343 core samples; P > 0.05), suggesting that shorebirds did not deplete prey resources. Invertebrate abundance declined from 342 +/- 47 individuals per m(2) in the first half of the season to 150 +/- 7 individuals per m(2) in the second half, and also declined with increasing vegetation cover upslope of the waterline (n = 249 core samples; P < 0.05). Future research should examine whether shorebirds deplete prey during periods of extreme drought when shorebirds may concentrate on mudflats due to reduced availability of other wetland habitats.																			1559-4491	1938-5447				2025 SEP 29	2025										10.1080/15594491.2025.2556507	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15594491.2025.2556507		SEP 2025											WOS:001585742900001

Hazardous freezing rain often affects the same region in winter. Conventional observations and numerical models generally are resolved too coarsely to allow detection or accurate prediction of these mesoscale severe weather phenomena. The Lake Ontario Winter Storms (LOWS) project was conducted to demonstrate and evaluate the potential for real-time mesoscale monitoring and location-specific prediction of lake-effect storms and freezing rain, using the newest of available technologies. LOWS employed an array of specialized atmospheric remote sensors (a dual-polarization short wavelength radar, microwave radiometer, radio acoustic sounding system, and three wind profilers) with supporting observing systems and mesoscale numerical models. An overview of LOWS and its initial accomplishments is presented.																			0003-0007					OCT	1993	74	10					1828	1849		10.1175/1520-0477-74-10-1828	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0477-74-10-1828													WOS:A1993MD25600001

IGF is a complex hydrogeological process and hidden from direct observation, thus identifying and characterizing it is difficult. This study investigated IGF in the case of the contact between the Tana and Beles basins, located at the northwestern margin of the Ethiopian Highlands, using a multimethod approach: (1) morphotectonic analysis; (2) lithostratigraphy and geological structure analysis; (3) regional groundwater potentiometric-surface map; (4) presence of large-volume springs; (5) hydrochemistry and isotope tracing; and (6) water budget imbalances. Primary data (geological investigation, water point inventory, and water sampling), satellite images and gravity data, and other secondary data, were collected and analyzed. The results illustrate the extension of the fractured basaltic aquifer, high topographic contrast, and high lineament density along the boundary between the Tana and Beles basins. The connection of the hydro-stratigraphic units, fracture distribution and orientation, high hydraulic gradient, spatial distribution of high-flux springs, and water budget imbalance of Tana Basin revealed that there is IGF from Tana Basin to Beles Basin, despite poor indications from results for hydrochemistry and stable isotopes. These findings will have practical implications for groundwater and water balance studies of the two basins. The study demonstrates the importance of a multimethod approach to investigate IGF where a single approach is imprecise.

J	Sundh, I; Bastviken, D; Tranvik, LJ				Sundh, I; Bastviken, D; Tranvik, LJ			Abundance, activity, and community structure of pelagic methane-oxidizing bacteria in temperate lakes	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The abundance and activity of methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) in the water column were investigated in three lakes with different contents of nutrients and humic substances. The abundance of MOB was determined by analysis of group-specific phospholipid fatty acids from type I and type 11 MOB, and in situ activity was measured with a 14 CH, transformation method. The fatty acid analyses indicated that type I MOB most similar to species of Methylomonas, Methylomicrobium, and Methylosarcina made a substantial contribution (up to 41%) to the total bacterial biomass, whereas fatty acids from type 11 MOB generally had very low concentrations. The MOB biomass and oxidation activity were positively correlated and were highest in the hypo- and metalimnion during summer stratification, whereas under ice during winter, maxima occurred close to the sediments. The methanotroph biomass-specific oxidation rate (V) ranged from 0.001 to 2.77 mg CH4-C mg(-1) C day(-1) and was positively correlated with methane concentration, suggesting that methane supply largely determined the activity and biomass distribution of MOB. Our results demonstrate that type I MOB often are a large component of pelagic bacterial communities in temperate lakes. They represent a potentially important pathway for reentry of carbon and energy into pelagic food webs that would otherwise be lost as evasion of CH,.					; Tranvik, Lars/H-2222-2011	Tranvik, Lars J./0000-0003-3509-8266; Bastviken, David/0000-0003-0038-2152													0099-2240	1098-5336				NOV	2005	71	11					6746	6752		10.1128/AEM.71.11.6746-6752.2005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.71.11.6746-6752.2005								16269705					WOS:000233225000036

The MODIS instrument covers the entire study period and acts as the benchmark for intercomparing the surface reflectances obtained with the other three sensors. The classification of OWTs is based on differences in reflectance spectra, facilitating a qualitative assessment of water quality. This approach identified four distinct clusters, with two OWTs representing water with higher turbidity, facilitating the differentiation of reflectances associated with microalgae blooms and other phenomena such as runoff. However, when using MODIS, which covers only the central area of the reservoir, only three clusters were identified as the ideal number. Using 300 or 1000 m of spatial resolution, the Alqueva reservoir mostly exhibits high water transparency, associated with low surface reflectances for the majority of the time. Seasonal analysis revealed periods with the presence of microalgae in summer and autumn (SON), with a noticeable increase in the intensity and duration of these blooms in the SON period over the last ten years. This methodology enables the identification of advantages and disadvantages associated with the utilization of each sensor in large reservoirs and across extensive datasets.					; Costa, Maria Joao/M-4119-2013; Costa, Maria João/M-4119-2013	Rodrigues, Goncalo/0000-0003-2273-7647; Costa, Maria Joao/0000-0003-2981-2232; 													1939-1404	2151-1535					2025	18						2942	2958		10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3515998	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3515998													WOS:001396520800014

It is derived from the name of the Chloris, the goddess of vegetation, in Greek mythology, reasonably so, if we consider the great number of mythological tales linked to flowers of the Greek flora. The name of the flower known as 'iris' is derived from Iris, messenger of the gods. Her role was to accompany souls to places of eternal peace, via the road' marked by the rainbow - which is comprised of Iris's colours. Narcissus, son of the river god Cephisus and a forest nymph, was exceptionally handsome. However, even though all the nymphs desired him (for obvious reasons) he loved only himself. One day, as he was - yet again - admiring his own image in a pool formed by the River Elikon, the gods decided to punish him for his impudence. He 'fell' in the pool and drowned. There remained only a flower - the narcissus or daffodil - bearing a golden crown, which to this day bows over the waters of lakes and rivers. There are countless myths linked to the name Adonis. According to one such, Zeus had decreed that Adonis must spend two thirds of the year on earth with Aphrodite (Venus) and one third with Persephone in the Underworld. Then, it came to pass that a boar killed Adonis. Upon learning the news, Aphrodite shed as many tears as the blood drops that had fallen from Adonis's body. A rose bush grew from each one of Aphrodite's tears, and a plant of that name from each drop of blood. The use of flowers was widespread in Greece from time immemorial, since flowers are so important to us from the moment we are born. Today, we know a lot about the significance of flowers in the everyday life of the Ancient Greeks, who had established special festivals, such as the Anthestiria, a flower festival held in early spring in honour of Dionysus and reminiscent of our modern May Day Festivities. They also held the Anthesforia, to commemorate Persephone's abduction by Pluto.																			0567-7572		90-6605-933-8				2000		541					23	29		10.17660/ActaHortic.2000.541.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2000.541.1													WOS:000166401400001

In situ fluorometry reveals a persistent, perennial hypolimnetic cyanobacterial bloom in a seasonally anoxic reservoir	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Cyanobacterial blooms are increasing in waterbodies worldwide because of anthropogenic forcing. Most blooms occur at the water's surface, but some cyanobacterial taxa, such as Planktothrix, are able to modify their buoyancy to access more favorable growing conditions in deeper waters. Here, we used in situ fluorometry to examine the vertical distribution and biomass of Planktothrix in a seasonally anoxic reservoir for 3 consecutive summers. We also collected depth profiles of photosynthetically active radiation, temperature, and nutrients to evaluate which environmental drivers were most important for predicting Planktothrix biomass. In all 3 summers, Planktothrix dominated the phytoplankton community, exhibiting a large (concentrations similar to 100 mu g/L), persistent (lasting similar to 100 d) bloom below the thermocline. The bloom consistently exhibited maximum biomass at or below the depth reached by 1% of surface light. Light availability probably was the most important factor driving the vertical distribution of the stratified Planktothrix bloom, and light, temperature, and nutrients together were strong predictors of cyanobacterial biomass in the hypolimnion, explaining 71 to 93% of the variation in biomass. Our data suggest that Planktothrix remained in the hypolimnion where nutrient availability was maximized, while progressing slightly upward in the water column through each summer in response to light limitation. Our findings demonstrate that Planktothrix can dominate in low light and anoxic conditions and can form persistent blooms that last for multiple months. As cyanobacterial blooms become more prevalent, monitoring cyanobacteria at the surface and at depth will become critically important in freshwater ecosystems.

Tropical high-altitude Andean lakes located above the tree line attenuate UV-A radiation more strongly than typical temperate alpine lakes	PHOTOCHEMICAL & PHOTOBIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Tropical high-altitude Andean lakes are physically harsh ecosystems. Located above the treeline (>= 4000 m a.s.l.), they share common features with temperate alpine lakes, which impose extreme conditions on their aquatic organisms: e. g., strong winds, broad diel variations in water temperature, and intense solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR). However, because of their latitude, they differ in two major ecological characteristics: they lack ice cover during the winter and they do not present summer water column stratification. We sampled 26 tropical high-altitude Andean lakes from three regions of the Bolivian Eastern Andes Cordillera during the wet period (austral summer). We performed an ordination to better describe the typology of Andean lakes in relation to the environmental variables, and we assessed the relationships among them, focussing on the UV-A transparency (360 nm) throughout the water column. We found a positive correlation between UV-A transparency calculated as Z(1%) (the depth which reaches 1% of the surface UV-A), the lake maximum depth and Secchi transparency (r = 0.61). Z(1%) of UV-A was smaller in shallow lakes than in deep lakes, indicating that shallow lakes are less transparent to UV-A than deep lakes. We hypothesize that, compared to shallow lakes, deep lakes (maximum depth > 10 m) may have lower dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations (that absorb UV radiation) due to lower temperature and reduced macrophyte cover. Based on our data, tropical high-altitude Andean lakes are less transparent to UV-A (K-d range = 1.4-11.0 m (1); Z(1%) depth range = 0.4-3.2 m) than typical temperate alpine lakes (1-6 m (1), 3-45 m, respectively). Moreover, they differ in vertical profiles of UV-A, chlorophyll-a, and temperature, suggesting that they may have a distinct ecological functioning. Such peculiarities justify treating tropical high-altitude Andean lakes as a separate category of alpine lakes. Tropical high-altitude Andean lakes have been poorly studied. Thus they deserve more in-depth studies in the face of global changes regarding the use of their UV transparency as a sentinel proxy of climate changes, particularly global warming.

J	McMinn, A; Martin, A				McMinn, A.; Martin, A.			Dark survival in a warming world	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Most algae regularly experience periods of darkness ranging from a few hours to a few days. During this time, they are unable to photosynthesize, and so must consume stored energy products. However, some organisms such as polar algae and some microalgal cysts and spores are exposed to darkness for months to years, and these must use alternative strategies to survive. Some taxa, such as dinoflagellates, form cysts and become dormant. Others use physiological methods or adopt mixotrophy. The longest documented survival of more than a century was for dinoflagellates buried in sediments in a Norwegian fjord. Seasonal changes in daylight hours are naturally unaffected by climate change. This means that polar microalgae will in the future need to survive the same period of seasonal darkness but at higher temperatures, and this will require a greater drawdown of stored energy. Recent experimental work has shown that both Arctic and Antarctic phytoplankton are able to survive increases of up to 6 degrees C in the dark.

Distribution and biodiversity of macro-benthic fauna in relation to some heavy metals at the Great Bitter Lakes, Suez Canal, Egypt	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC RESEARCH												The present study aims to document the diversity and density of benthic fauna in Great Bitter Lakes through their spatial and temporal changes in this important area from spring 2016 to winter 2017. Eleven sampling stations representing most of the area of the Great Bitter Lakes were selected. The results showed that there was 41 species and an annual density of 104,680 organisms/m(2) of macro-benthic fauna belonging to five phyla in the studied area. Eighteen species from polychaetes, 12 molluscs, 7 species from crustaceans, 3 echinoderms and one species belonging to cephalochordate were recorded. With the exception of the most dominant species of the lakes, Modiolus auriculatus, which was represented by an annual average of 6822.91 organisms/m(2), the onshore stations were the highest in density and diversity than offshore stations (35 and 28 species with an annual density of 18,873 and 10,755 organisms/m(2), respectively). The value of heavy metals in surface water was within the following sequence; Fe > Zn > Cu > Pb > Mn > Cd. While in the sediments were arranged as follows: Fe > Mn > Zn > Cu > Ni > Pb > Cd.

All water samples show a Ca2+-HCO3- water facies with low contents of K+, Na+, Cl-, NO3- and SO42-. Water-rock interaction and carbonate weathering are the significant contributors to water geochemistry. Analysis of the water chemistry indicates that waters drain a monolithological terrain and non-anthropogenically influenced watershed. The delta H-2 and delta O-18 values are seasonally dependent on the snowmelt, precipitation and evaporation. The average recharge altitudes for all sampling locations are between 1120 and 2130 m. The average residence time for the stream water is 2.4 years and for karst springs 1.2 years. The delta C-13(DIC) values in all samples are influenced by dissolution of carbonates, degradation of organic matter and by equilibrium with atmospheric CO2. All geochemical and isotope analyses show changes in stream water in the downstream direction and are highly dependent on the inflow of karstic spring. Based on hydrogeological mapping, geochemical and stable isotope results, a conceptual hydrogeological model of the Radovna system, in which karstic and alluvial aquifers are in contact, was determined.

J	Donath, U; Robinson, CT				Donath, U; Robinson, CT			Ecological characteristics of lake outlets in Alpine environments of the Swiss Alps	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												We examined the physical, chemical, and biological attributes of temporary and permanent lake outlets situated above treeline in the Swiss Alps. Surface now in the temporary outlet streams ceased by mid-September. High discharge in spring associated with snowmelt was an order of magnitude greater in the temporary outlets than in the permanent outlets. Periphyton biomass attained 5-9x higher levels in the temporary sites than in the permanent sites by mid-summer. Although macroinvertebrate densities were similar between temporary and permanent sites, taxon richness was 2x greater in the permanent outlets. Macroinvertebrate groups absent from temporary out lets included Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera, and long-lived dipterans such as Limoniidae and Tipulidae. The semi-terrestrial gastropod Galba truncatula colonized the temporary lake outlets via the lake. Chironomidae, Oligochaeta and Simuliidae also were common and able to complete development in the temporary lake outlets. Cladocera and Copepoda originating from the lakes attained high abundances in some outlets regardless of being temporary or permanent. The harsh Alpine environment in concert with intermittency were strong determinants of ecosystem properties in the temporary outlets. Regardless of flow permanency, the lakes directly affected community dynamics of outlets by influencing physical and chemical properties, and providing colonists to outlet streams.																			0003-9136					JAN	2001	150	2					207	225																WOS:000166735300003

Detection of Coccidioides immitis in Kern County, California, by multiplex PCR	MYCOLOGIA												Coccidioides immitis is a fungal human pathogen endemic to semiarid soils in southern California and Baja California (Mexico). Results of culture-dependent detection of C. immitis in the past indicated a spotty distribution and unreliable prediction of C. immitis growth sites and accumulation sites. In this project we investigated bulk soil samples for the presence of the pathogen in nonagricultural loamy soils at nine different locations around Bakers-field, Kern County, California, for almost 2 y (2008-2009). To detect the pathogen we used a multiplex PCR method with optimized soil handling and storage, DNA extraction procedure and PCR protocol. With this method we were able to detect C. immitis in 8.42% of our samples in 2008 (n = 285), mostly from early spring to early summer. In 2009 however the percentage of samples positive for C. immitis from the same sites declined to 2.68% (n = 261). We also were able to distinguish C. immitis growth sites from accumulation sites. One site close to a recreation area (Lake Webb, Buena Vista Lake Basin), not previously known to support the growth of C. immitis, was identified as a strong growth site of the fungus. The cultivation-independent method in this study together with soil parameters can be used to predict and confirm C. immitis growth sites and might be a valuable tool for public health institutions.																			0027-5514	1557-2536				JAN-FEB	2012	104	1					62	69		10.3852/11-127	http://dx.doi.org/10.3852/11-127								21933931					WOS:000299352000007

Stable and clumped isotopes in desert carbonate spring and lake deposits reveal palaeohydrology: A case study of the Lower Jurassic Navajo Sandstone, south-western USA	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Carbon, oxygen and clumped isotope ((47)) values were measured from lacustrine and tufa (spring)-mound carbonate deposits in the Lower Jurassic Navajo Sandstone of southern Utah and northern Arizona in order to understand the palaeohydrology. These carbonate deposits are enriched in both O-18 and C-13 across the basin from east to west; neither isotope is strongly sensitive to the carbonate facies. However, O-18 is enriched in lake carbonate deposits compared to the associated spring mounds. This is consistent with evaporation of the spring waters as they exited the mounds and were retained in interdune lakes. Clumped isotopes ((47)) exhibit minor systematic differences between lake and tufa-mound temperatures, suggesting that the rate of carbonate formation under ambient conditions was moderate. These clumped isotope values imply palaeotemperature elevated beyond reasonable surface temperatures (54 to 86 degrees C), which indicates limited bond reordering at estimated burial depths of ca 4 to 5km, consistent with independent estimates of sediment thickness and burial depth gradients across the basin. Although clumped isotopes do not provide surface temperature information in this case, they still provide useful burial information and support interpretations of the evolution of groundwater locally. The findings of this study significantly extend the utility of combining stable isotope and clumped isotope methods into aeolian environments.

Isotope geochemistry of mercury in source rocks, mineral deposits and spring deposits of the California Coast Ranges, USA	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												We present here the first study of the isotopic composition of mercury in rocks, ore deposits, and active spring deposits from the California Coast Ranges, a part of Earth's crust with unusually extensive evidence of mercury mobility and enrichment. The Franciscan Complex and Great Valley Sequence, which form the bedrock in the California Coast Ranges, are intruded and overlain by Tertiary volcanic rocks including the Clear Lake Volcanic Sequence. These rocks contain two types of mercury deposits, hot-spring deposits that form at shallow depths (<300 m) and silica-carbonate deposits that extend to depths of 1000 m. Active springs and geothermal areas continue to precipitate Hg and Au and are modern analogues to the fossil hydrothermal systems preserved in the ore deposits. The Franciscan Complex and Great Valley Sequence contain clastic sedimentary rocks with higher concentrations of mercury than volcanic rocks of the Clear Lake Volcanic Field. Mean mercury isotopic compositions (delta Hg-202) for all three rock units are similar, although the range of values in Franciscan Complex rocks is greater than in either Great Valley OF Clear Lake rocks. Hot spring and silica-carbonate mercury deposits have similar average mercury isotopic compositions that are indistinguishable from averages for the three rock units, although delta Hg-202 values for the mercury deposits have a greater variance than the country rocks. Precipitates from spring and geothermal waters in the area have similarly large variance and a mean delta Hg-202 value that is significantly lower than the ore deposits and rocks. These observations indicate that there is little or no isotopic fractionation (< +/- 0.5%.) during release of mercury from its source rocks into hydrothermal solutions. Isotopic fractionation does appear to take place during transport and concentration of mercury in deposits, however, especially in their uppermost parts. Boiling of hydrothermal fluids, separation of a mercury-bearing CO2 vapor or reduction and volatilization of Hg-(0) in the near-surface environment are likely the most important processes causing the observed Hg isotope fractionation. This should result in the release of mercury with low 6202 Hg values into the atmosphere from the top of these hydrothermal systems. Estimates of mass balance suggest that residual Hg reservoirs are not measurably enriched in heavy Hg isotopes as a result of this process because only a small amount of Hg (<4%) leaves actively ore-forming systems.

Double trouble: Paired ignimbrite eruptions and collateral subsidence in the Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Large explosive eruptions are generally rare, random events in the history of any particular volcano, volcanic area, or worldwide. In the Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand, temporal clustering of eruptions occurs on a < 1 yr to similar to 300 k.y. basis, which implies that some controls lead to nonrandom eruption timing. We describe two closely paired large Taupo Volcanic Zone eruptions dated at ca. 240 ka that terminated a large-scale cluster of 7 caldera-forming and > 15 smaller eruptions over a total similar to 100 k.y. period. After a precursor eruption from a nearby source (and a break of years to decades), these paired eruptions in turn generated a wet ash-fall deposit and a dry pumice-fall deposit; the Mamaku ignimbrite (> 145 km(3) magma); a fine-grained vitric ash-fall deposit; then the Ohakuri ignimbrite (> 100 km(3) magma). Rotorua and Ohakuri, spaced similar to 30 km apart, are the inferred collapse calderas associated with the Mamaku and Ohakuri ignimbrites, respectively. The early wet and dry fall deposits came from southerly sources, close to or within the subsequent Ohakuri caldera, while the fine-grained vitric ash is inferred to represent a co-ignimbrite ash from the Mamaku ignimbrite. At its southwest margin, the Mamaku ignimbrite overlies, but is also intercalated within and then overlain by, the pumice fall deposit, demonstrating that at least two widely spaced vents were active simultaneously for part of the eruption sequence. The post-Mamaku vitric ash-fall deposit underwent only trivial reworking prior to emplacement of the Ohakuri ignimbrite. This and other field evidence imply continuity, or time gaps of only days to months, in the whole paired sequence. Syneruptive volcanotectonic faulting may have permitted accumulation of > 400 m of nonwelded Ohakuri ignimbrite through graben subsidence. Posteruptive faulting within years to decades of the eruption produced an similar to 300 m extra-caldera offset of the Mamaku ignimbrite and collateral subsidence of a > 40 km(2) area immediately south of Rotorua caldera. Temporal linkages between ignimbrite eruptions and graben subsidence, the NNE-SSW alignment of associated faulting between the Rotorua and Ohakuri calderas, and the eruption-related subsidence indicate a tectonic control on volcanism associated with Taupo Volcanic Zone rifting processes. Statistical forecasts of the frequency of large-volume explosive events based on averages may be inaccurate because of tectonic triggering effects.

Two major fault directions (N40 and N130) are evidenced in the basement (granite and gneiss essentially), which is often covered and hidden by volcanic rocks and alluvial deposits. Craters (maars) contain the Male Lake and the Female Lake in the Eboga caldeira. Numerous springs (Bare, Ngol, Ndibsi, a.s.o.) are modified by late volcanic manifestations. The waters of the two lakes contain calcium, magnesium and sodium (Ca>Mg>Na), and bicarbonates (13.42 +/- 0.02 mg/l of HCO3- for the Female Lake and 31.72 +/- 0.02 mg/l for the Male Lake). They are soft (15.00 +/- 0.02 mg/l and 80.00 +/- 0.1 mg/l of CaCO3 respectively), slightly mineralized (50.09 +/- 0.02 mg/l and 120.85 +/- 0.2 mg/l) and poor conductive (52.86 and 127.53 S/cm). The waters of the Bare springs, quite different, contain Na, Mg, Ca (Na>Mg and Ca), also bicarbonates (683 +/- 2 mg/l for Si and 1128 +/- 2 mg/l for S-2); they are thermal (26 degrees C), hard (230 +/- 1 mg/l of CaCO3 for Si and 306 +/- 1 mg/l of CaCO3 for S-2), relatively mineralized (961.31 2 mg/l and 1325.84 +/- 2 mg/l) and conductive (1267 and 1748 HS/cm). The relative high content in cations (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+) and in anions (HCO3-, SO42-), confers therapeutic properties to the Bare springs. Springs and lakes waters are potable after being chemically treated. Water volume of the lakes has been estimated at 40 millions m(3) and springs discharge at about 6000 litres/day. These hydrologic resources offer a real socio-economic interest (agriculture, fishery, irrigation, road construction, etc.), for the Bangem and Bare population which is estimated more than 50 000 inhabitants. Some of these waters are of medicinal interest.					Laminsi, Samuel/W-7982-2019														0007-3938						2005	66		1-3				107	114																WOS:000440345000009

The triple oxygen-isotope anomaly of dissolved O-2 [(17)Delta = ln(1+delta O-17) - 0.518 x ln(1+delta O-18)] offers a new, in situ, perspective on primary production, yet little is known about (17)Delta from freshwater systems. We investigated the (17)Delta together with the oxygen : argon ratio [Delta(O-2 = Ar)] in the subtropical Feitsui Reservoir in Taiwan from June 2014 to July 2015. Here, we present the seasonal variations in (17)Delta, GP (gross production), NP (net production) and the NP = GP (net to gross ratio) in association with environmental parameters. The (17)Delta varied with depth and season, with values ranging between 26 and 205 per meg. The GP rates were observed to be higher (702 +/- 107 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) in winter than those (303 +/- 66 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) recorded during the summer. The overall averaged GP was 220 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and NP was -3 g C m(-2) yr(-1), implying the reservoir was net heterotrophic on an annual basis. This is due to negative NP rates from October to February (-198 +/- 78 mg C m(-2) d(-1)). Comparisons between GP rates obtained from the isotope mass balance approach and C-14 bottle incubation method (C-14-GP) showed consistent values on the same order of magnitude with a GP / C-14-GP ratio of 1.2 +/- 1.1. Finally we noted that, although typhoon occurrences were scarce, higher than average (17)Delta values and GP rates were recorded after typhoon events.

J	Goodwin, KB; Hutchinson, JD; Gompert, Z				Goodwin, Kenen B.; Hutchinson, Jaren D.; Gompert, Zachariah			Spatiotemporal and ontogenetic variation, microbial selection, and predicted Bd-inhibitory function in the skin-associated microbiome of a Rocky Mountain amphibian	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Host-associated microbiomes play important roles in host health and pathogen defense. In amphibians, the skin-associated microbiota can contribute to innate immunity with potential implications for disease management. Few studies have examined season-long temporal variation in the amphibian skin-associated microbiome, and the interactions between bacteria and fungi on amphibian skin remain poorly understood. We characterize season-long temporal variation in the skin-associated microbiome of the western tiger salamander (Ambystoma mavortium) for both bacteria and fungi between sites and across salamander life stages. Two hundred seven skin-associated microbiome samples were collected from salamanders at two Rocky Mountain lakes throughout the summer and fall of 2018, and 127 additional microbiome samples were collected from lake water and lake substrate. We used 16S rRNA and ITS amplicon sequencing with Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial regression to estimate the relative abundances of bacterial and fungal taxa, test for differential abundance, examine microbial selection, and derive alpha diversity. We predicted the ability of bacterial communities to inhibit the amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a cutaneous fungal pathogen, using stochastic character mapping and a database of Bd-inhibitory bacterial isolates. For both bacteria and fungi, we observed variation in community composition through time, between sites, and with salamander age and life stage. We further found that temporal trends in community composition were specific to each combination of salamander age, life stage, and lake. We found salamander skin to be selective for microbes, with many taxa disproportionately represented relative to the environment. Salamander skin appeared to select for predicted Bd-inhibitory bacteria, and we found a negative relationship between the relative abundances of predicted Bd-inhibitory bacteria and Bd. We hope these findings will assist in the conservation of amphibian species threatened by chytridiomycosis and other emerging diseases.																				1664-302X				DEC 13	2022	13								1020329	10.3389/fmicb.2022.1020329	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.1020329								36583053					WOS:000904087800001
J	Huusko, A; Sutela, T				Huusko, A; Sutela, T			Minnow predation on vendace larvae: Intersection of alternative prey phenologies and size-based vulnerability	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Time-intensive sampling was used to study minnow Phoxinus phoximus density and foraging activity in the littoral area of Lake Lentua at a time of high vendace Coregonus albula larval abundance. Minnow activity and foraging during the late spring-early summer period at low temperatures was found to be mainly nocturnal and quite consistent with features reported in the literature, with the exception of feeding on vendace larvae. The absence of the latter finding from previous studies may be due to previous seasonally limited daytime samplings. The temporal or spatial scale of sampling is decisive when studying foraging on food animals with a brief period of vulnerability and seasonal phenology. However, minnows in Lake Lentua seemed to prefer Bosmina longispina whenever available and low B. longispina density during the first weeks after the break-up of ice directed minnow predation towards the vendace larvae. Estimated gross predation values showed that the minnow has the potential to become a remarkable predator on fish larvae. Slight variations in the vernal timing of the vendace hatching and larval development with respect to minnow activity, both of which are obviously temperature related, may be critical to vendace larval survival in the nearshore zone. However, the predation on the larvae is probably a strong factor only for a short period and the survival of the vendace larvae may be more related to the availability of suitably sized food resources than to predation by the minnow.

Winter activity of common bream (Abramis brama L.) in a European reservoir	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												As temperatures drop and fish metabolism slows, cyprinids are generally assumed to form dense, static shoals or migrate to suitable sites up tributaries to reduce predation risk. Using telemetry, common bream Abramis brama (L.) were observed to remain active and (presumably) foraged throughout winter in an area in the middle of an 8-m-deep valley reservoir coinciding with a 3-5 m zone of warmer, oxygenated water below an inverse thermocline. Tagged bream appeared to avoid cold, shallow zones (<1.5 m) at the inlet and banks and the deepest zone (5-8 m) near the dam/outlet, possibly due to poor food availability. Under certain conditions, bream populations showed higher levels of winter activity (and feeding) than previously assumed, with implications for both reservoir fisheries management and future studies assessing cyprinid behaviour, energy budgets and diet in lakes and reservoirs.

J	Belardi, JB; Rindel, D				Belardi, Juan Bautista; Rindel, Diego			Taphonomic and archeological aspects of massive mortality processes in guanaco (Lama guanicoe) caused by winter stress in Southern Patagonia	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The taphonomic and archeological implications of massive mortality patterns of guanaco (Lama guanicoe) populations due to winter stress are discussed, considering both local and regional scales. The presentation has its focus in the Lake Cardiel basin, Southern Patagonia. Argentina. Winter stress is not an unusual event in Patagonian ecosystems and it produces a seasonal and predictable output: a huge number of dead guanacos in certain loci. Five faunal assemblages formed in 2000 are discussed, three in rock shelters and two at open-air settings, considering guanaco individuals/bone preservation, age and sex structure, death positions, degree of interment, carnivore damages, trampling marks, and the association between guanaco individuals/bones and archeological material (mainly lithic artifacts). Conditions exist for the commingling of naturally formed guanaco bone assemblages and archeological materials. The taphonomic signature of this mortality pattern is analysed. and criteria developed that allow identification of the potential mixture between archeological material and modern guanaco bones. From an archeological point of view, the potential scavenging opportunities brought by these guanaco mortality events to hunter-gatherer populations are explored. In sum, the results of this study are twofold. First, it brings new data on the regional taphonomy of guanacos and its implications for the archeological record. Second, it invites consideration of these mass mortality events in the context of strategies employed by hunter-gatherer populations to cope with their environment. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton in acidic and humic environment in thaw ponds of discontinuous permafrost zone	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Despite the high importance of shallow thaw ponds (thermokarst lakes) of Western Siberia in both surface coverage and carbon dioxide and methane emission to the atmosphere, their planktonic component remains poorly characterized. This work reports the first results of phytoplankton analysis of thaw lakes and ponds sampled during spring flood, open water season and ice formation. The lakes, located within the discontinuous/sporadic permafrost (66 degrees N), are shallow (0.5-1.5 m depth), acidic (4.0 <= pH <= 6.1) and highly organic (10-40 mg. L-1 of DOC) with low concentrations of total dissolved solid (10-30 mg. L-1). In the plankton community of 20 lakes of variable size (from 700 m(2) to 1.8 km(2)), we identified 134 taxa of algae with the dominance of green algae (33-60% of total), cyanobacteria (11-14%) and dinoflagellates (7-14%). The total cell number (N) ranged from 20 to 83 million cell. L-1 and the biomass (B) ranged from 0.1 to 37 mg(wet). L-1 with the dominance of green algae, Dinophyta and Charophyta Ulothrix spp., Bambusina brebissonii. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed two possible factors responsible for phytoplankton variation: dissolved inorganic carbon, positively acting on cell number and the biomass of cyanobacteria, and DOC, Si and Fe, controlling the number of diatoms and green algae. In August, there was a general increase of both N and B as pH increased. Colony-forming cyanobacteria and green algae with thick capsules were highly abundant during all seasons. The specific acidic and organic-rich context of the shallow thermokarst waters subjected to full freezing in winter is one of the major factors limiting both the biodiversity and the biomass of the phytoplankton in these water objects.

Analyses of three biotic proxies (plant macrofossils, pollen, molluscs) were supplemented with sedimentological, geochemical, oxygen and carbon stable isotopes analyses and radiocarbon dating and used for reconstruction of environmental changes in Late Glacial and Holocene. The obtained results enable us to (1) reconstruct main phases of mire development and (2) determine environmental factors influencing changes of water supply. The object started to develop in Allerod. The Late Glacial and Early Holocene deposit sequence is relatively thick (about 1.0 m), with good palaeoecological record. The boundary between Younger Dryas and Preboreal is especially well confirmed by palynological and malacological analyses as well as radiocarbon dating. The Mesoholocene deposits are considerably worse preserved. Mire development was evaluated in terms of general mire ecology.					; Urban, Danuta/U-4290-2018; Dobrowolski, Radoslaw/V-5086-2018; Piotrowska, Natalia/S-4528-2018; Dobrowolski, Radosław/V-5086-2018	Pidek, Irena/0000-0002-1979-4897; Urban, Danuta/0000-0002-3541-1753; Dobrowolski, Radoslaw/0000-0002-6504-5643; Piotrowska, Natalia/0000-0002-8194-6767; Pazdur, Anna/0000-0002-6078-798X; 													1733-8387					MAR	2012	39	1					10	29		10.2478/s13386-011-0052-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s13386-011-0052-3													WOS:000298392600002

Both species occur in numerous habitats in Florida, USA, including rivers, lakes, ponds, freshwater springs, and spring runs. We sampled Peninsula Cooter and Florida Red-bellied Cooter populations from 1999 through 2015 as a component of a long-term freshwater turtle assemblage monitoring study in a protected central Florida spring-run complex that experiences high levels of human recreation. For each species, we: (1) generated relative abundance and population estimates; (2) quantified survivorship and recruitment; and (3) calculated sex ratios, density, and biomass. Population estimates were similar for both species, and sex ratios were approximately 1:1 for both species, whereas density and biomass estimates were higher than previous studies. Recapture rates were moderate for each sex of both species. Apparent survivorship was higher in males than females for both species but lower than from comparable studies. Sensitivities for both species suggest adult female mortality followed by the percentage of females breeding had the greatest influence on population growth. Stable populations of common species are important in maintaining overall community integrity. Therefore, it is prudent to promote the conservation of common species to protect ecosystem structures and services.

Both pelagic methods (hydroacoustics and trawling) revealed significantly higher fish abundance and biomass during the day than at night, especially in deeper zones (below 3 m). Roach (Rutilus rutilus) and Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) dominated the trawl catches during the day, while roach and ruffe dominated at night. Fish smaller than 14 cm strongly dominated in both the trawl catches and hydroacoustic observations. Our hydroacoustic sampling found inhomogeneous pelagic distributions of fish aggregated in big shoals during the day. In the littoral zone, which was sampled by beach seining, both the abundance and biomass were significantly higher at night than during the day. Roach, bleak, and European perch usually dominated in beach seine catches during the day and at night. The daytime pelagic biomass found by hydroacoustics was 62 kg/ha and it decreased to approximately 11 kg/ha at night. The littoral biomass found by beach seining was diurnally opposite, 4 kg/ha during the day and 37 kg/ha at night. It is obvious that diurnal horizontal migrations between pelagic and littoral zones, and shoaling behavior during the daytime are common patterns in the shallow Lake Sauka during the autumn. The study of the spatial distribution of fish is extremely important for the establishment of an appropriate monitoring plan for the purposes of the Water Framework Directive with regard to the morphometry of the lake, the geographical location, and the sampling period of the year. This study also shows that the combination of completely non-invasive hydroacoustic and other methods that are invasive (trawls, beach seines) but not as destructive as gillnets, which are normally used for scientific fish monitoring in Europe, could be a future way forward for fish monitoring.

Evacuation of multiple magma bodies and the onset of caldera collapse in a supereruption, captured in glass and mineral compositions	CONTRIBUTIONS TO MINERALOGY AND PETROLOGY												Complexities in the nature of large-scale silicic eruptions and their magmatic systems can be discerned through microanalytical geochemical studies. We present high-resolution, stratigraphically constrained compositional data on glassy matrix material and feldspar crystals from the initial fall deposits and earliest ignimbrite (base of member A) of the 2.08 Ma, similar to 2500 km(3) Huckleberry Ridge Tuff (HRT), Yellowstone. We use these data to document the nature of the magmatic system and compositional changes related to the transition from fall to widespread ignimbrite deposition, inferred to mark the onset of caldera collapse. Although major element glass compositions are relatively uniform, trace elements span a large range (e.g. Ba 10-900 ppm, Sr/Rb = 0.005-0.09), with highly evolved glasses dominating in the fall deposits. Several trace elements (e.g. Ba and light rare earth elements) in the glass samples serve to define statistically significant compositional clustering in the fall deposits and basal ignimbrite. These clusters are inferred to reflect melt compositions controlled by fractional crystallisation processes and are interpreted to represent multiple, discrete melt-dominant domains that were tapped by multiple vents. The onset of widespread ignimbrite deposition is marked by an increase in the number of erupted melt compositional clusters from four in the fall deposits to eight, representing nine melt-dominant domains. There is an absence of geographical variation of glass compositions within the basal ignimbrite, with samples from proximal to distal localities north, west and south of the HRT caldera exhibiting similar variability. Pairing of glass analyses with sanidine major and minor element compositional data suggests that the nine melt compositional domains converged at depth into two compositionally distinct upper-crustal magmatic lineages that were both active during these early stages of the eruption. Our data collectively indicate the evacuation of an exceptionally complex and heterogeneous magma system. The onset of widespread ignimbrite deposition, inferred to relate to caldera collapse, occurred after similar to 50 km(3) of magma had been discharged. Although external controls were important as an eruption trigger, depressurisation of the system led to caldera collapse with the eruption of numerous discrete melt-ominant domains.

Thus, photosynthetic properties of bloom-forming cyano-bacteria (mainly Anabaena flos-aquae) were investigated in a large shallow lake (Chaohu Lake, China) on January 12, 2013. Chlorophyll fluorescence parameter (F/Fm') was measured by a pulse amplitude modulation fluoro-meter (Phyto-PAM) in order to estimate algal photosynthetic activity. In situ measurement showed that there was no obvious relationship between F/Fm' and light intensity at 10:30, while F/Fm' changed with irradiation at 12:30 and 14:30. However, this change disappeared after dark adaptation for three hours. In the experiment, when samples from different depths were exposed to the same solar radiation, there was no variation in F/F'm' of samples from different depths at 10:30, 12:30, and 14:30. These results showed that bloom-forming cyano-bacteria maintain feeble photosynthetic activity under low light intensity in winter, while they were exposed to sufficient light intensity, and seasonal changes may be triggered and grow gradually with elevated light intensity. Phyto-PAM measurement helps us to better understand over-wintering cyano-bacteria and recruitment process in the cold seasons.

Effects of morphology in controlling propagation of density currents in a reservoir using uncalibrated three-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												In this study, effects of basin morphology are shown to affect density current hydrodynamics of a large reservoir using a three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic model that is validated (but not calibrated) with in situ observational data. The AEM3D hydrodynamic model was applied for 5-month simulations during winter and spring flooding for the Maroon reservoir in southwest Iran, where available observations indicated that large-scale density currents had previously occurred. The model results were validated with near-bottom water temperature measurements that were previously collected at five locations in the reservoir. The Maroon reservoir consists of upper and lower basins that are connected by a deep and narrow canyon. Analyses of simulations show that the canyon strongly affects density current propagation and the resulting differing limnological characteristics of the two basins. The evolution of the Wedderbum Number, Lake Number. and Schmidt stability number are shown to be different in the two basins, and the difference is attributable to the morphological separation by the canyon. Investigation of the background potential energy (BPE) changes along the length of the canyon indicated that a density front passes through the upper section of the canyon but is smoothed into simple filling of the lower basin. The separable dynamics of the basins has implications for the complexity of models needed for representing both water quality and sedimentation.																			1129-5767	1723-8633					2020	79	3					238	253		10.4081/jlimnol.2020.1942	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2020.1942													WOS:000600514700004
J	Heresztyn, T; Nicholson, BC				Heresztyn, T; Nicholson, BC			Nodularin concentrations in Lakes Alexandrina and Albert, South Australia, during a bloom of the cyanobacterium (blue-green alga) Nodularia spumigena and degradation of the toxin	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND WATER QUALITY												Nodularin together with cell numbers of Nodularia spumigena were monitored during a toxic bloom of this cyanobacterium during the summer/autumn of 1994-1995 in Lakes Alexandrina and Albert, South Australia. There was a good correlation between cell numbers and toxin concentration over the course of the bloom at a number of locations. The correlation was poorer toward the end of the bloom, and may have reflected cell lysis and release of toxin to the surrounding water where it was rapidly degraded. The results suggested that the suitability of the lake water for drinking could be better determined by monitoring toxin content rather than cell numbers. Degradation of nodularin was studied and found to be more rapid in lake water that was supporting a bloom compared with water collected that had not experienced a bloom for several months. Half-lives were 24 and 54 h, respectively. There was no lag phase in water that was supporting a bloom, suggesting a relatively high population of microorganisms capable of degrading the toxin to be present. Toxin released to the lake water from lysing cells would therefore disappear very quickly. Toxin degradation was inhibited in the presence of copper ions. Copper sulphate treatment of blooms may therefore be doubly disadvantageous. Not only are cells lysed by copper sulphate addition, thereby releasing toxin to the surrounding water, but the natural microbial population capable of degrading the toxin may be destroyed, or the enzymes capable of toxin degradation inhibited.

However, the long-term spatiotemporal variation of atmospheric PAHs and the lung cancer risk caused by PAH exposure in the YRD remain unclear. Herein, we simulated the daily atmospheric concentration of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP, the most carcinogenic PAH) from 2001 to 2016 using an atmospheric transport model. During this period, the atmospheric BaP concentration showed a general trend of first increasing and then decreasing (average BaP concentration =0.50+0.12 ng/m(3)) and was highest in 2005 (0.72 ng/m(3)). Moreover, the BaP concentration in Jiangsu and Shanghai was 5.17- and 4.98-fold higher than that in Zhejiang. BaP pollution was severe in Jiangsu during the winter. The average area proportion of BaP exceeding the national standard in winter in Jiangsu was 69.09%. The population-weighted incremental lifetime cancer risk from 2001 to 2016 ranged 6.67 x 10(-6) -1.50 x10(-5), and the excess lung cancer cases ranged 1054-2130. Compared with 2005, excess lung cancer cases in the YRD decreased by 49.49% in 2016. Reducing BaP pollution in winter in Jiangsu is crucial for reducing lung cancer risk in the YRD.

J	Baker, PA; Fritz, SC				Baker, Paul A.; Fritz, Sherilyn C.			Nature and causes of Quaternary climate variation of tropical South America	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												This selective review of the Quaternary paleoclimate of the South American summer monsoon (SASM) domain presents viewpoints regarding a range of key issues in the field, many of which are unresolved and some of which are controversial. (1) El Nino-Southern Oscillation variability, while the most important global-scale mode of interannual climate variation, is insufficient to explain most of the variation of tropical South American climate observed in both the instrumental and the paleoclimate records. (2) Significant climate variation in tropical South America occurs on seasonal to orbital (i.e. multi-millennial) time scales as a result of sea-surface temperature (SST) variation and ocean -atmosphere interactions of the tropical Atlantic. (3) Decadal-scale climate variability, linked with this tropical Atlantic variability, has been a persistent characteristic of climate in tropical South America for at least the past half millennium, and likely, far beyond. (4) Centennial-to-millennial climate events in tropical South America were of longer duration and, perhaps, larger amplitude than any observed in the instrumental period, which is little more than a century long in tropical South America. These were superimposed upon both precession-paced insolation changes that caused significant variation in SASM precipitation and eccentricity-paced global glacial boundary conditions that caused significant changes in the tropical South American moisture balance. As a result, river sediment and water discharge increased and decreased across tropical South America, lake levels rose and fell, paleolakes arose and disappeared on the Altiplano, glaciers waxed and waned in the tropical Andes, and the tropical rainforest underwent significant changes in composition and extent. To further evaluate climate forcing over the last glacial cycle (similar to 125 ka), we developed a climate forcing model that combines summer insolation forcing and a proxy for North Atlantic SST forcing to reconstruct long-term precipitation variation in the SASM domain. The success of this model reinforces our confidence in assigning causation to observed reconstructions of precipitation. In addition, we propose a critical correction for speleothem stable oxygen isotopic ratios, which are among the most significant of paleoclimate proxies in tropical South America for reconstruction of variation of paleo-precipitation (or SASM intensity). However, it is already well known that any particular delta O-18 value observed in speleothem carbonate is affected by two processes that have nothing to do with changes in precipitation amount-the influence of temperature on carbonate-water isotopic fractionation in the cave and the influence of changing delta O-18 of seawater. Quantitatively accounting for both "artifacts" can significantly alter the interpretations of speleothem records. In tropical South America, both adjustments act in the same direction and have the tendency to increase the true amplitude of the paleo-hydrologic signal (but by different amounts in glacial and inter-glacial stages). These corrections have even graver implications for the interpretation of tropical Northern Hemisphere speleothem records (e.g. Chinese speleothems) where the combined adjustments tend to decrease or even eliminate the "true" signal amplitude.

J	Song, N; He, YH; Jiang, HL				Song, Na; He, Yu-Hong; Jiang, He-Long			Inferior adaptation of bay sediments in a eutrophic shallow lake to winter season for organic matter decomposition	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Sediments in lake bays receive the greatest external pollutants mainly including terrestrial plants and river macrophyte detritus. This work investigated response and adaptation of bay sediments to organic matter (OM) decomposition under cold and hot seasons. After three month and incubated at 5 degrees C, it was found that the total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiencies ranged from 15.4 to 13.1% in bay sediments to 22.6-25.7% in pelagic zone. These results determined that poorer OM decomposition occurred in the bay zone during the winter months compared to pelagic zone in a eutrophic shallow lake. High throughput sequencing and network interactions revealed that the reactions were mainly due to the changing microbial community structure and species interaction at selected areas during different seasons. The bay zone communities are poorly adapted to utilizing the more recalcitrant carbon pool than the pelagic communities. Also, even though more taxa reside in bay communities, less co-occurrences interaction between taxa occurs, which mean that less inter taxa competition for the same resource. In consideration of our study, the potential harm, such as the terrestrialization process speeding up and water quality worsening will be happened, we need to exploit ways to enhance litter biodegradation in the bay zone in winter.

Sixty-nine percent of the cases occurred from swimming at the same beach. This location was the one where the only population of snails in the lake was identified. Shoreline residents were informed that they should not feed waterfowl, and a clean-up of the snail population was done at the start of the following summer.

PM2.5 was sampled at Dongting Lake during September 2017 to August 2018 to probe the chemical characteristics of background PM2.5 in Central China. We sampled aerosols at an urban site simultaneously. Annual mean PM2.5 level reached 43.4 mu g m(-3), and SO42-, NO3-, and NH4+ (sulfate-nitrate-ammonium, simplified as SNA) accounted for 22.8%, 26.8%, and 15.0%, respectively. PM2.5 and most ions levels were highest during winter and lowest during summer. PM2.5 mass was driven by NO3- during cold months (October-March) or SO42- during warm months (September, April-August), suggesting that different emission control measures should be applied in different seasons in future air quality policy of this region. Both SO42- and NO3- were almost completely neutralized by NH4+. Low temperature increased the SO42- concentration and sulfur oxidation ratio. Low temperature also facilitated the partition of NO3- from gas phase into particle phase. Severe particulate pollutions occurred in cold months when the diffusion and wet scavenging of aerosols and volatilization of NH4NO3 were weak, and the NO2 concentration was high. An interesting finding was the highest NO3- concentration and conversion ratios for SNA as well as lowest SO42- concentration in Dongting Lake among major background sites, despite low levels of local gaseous precursors. Industry, secondary SO42-, and NO3- were indentified as main sources of PM2.5 mass based on PMF analysis. Concurrent occurrences of PM2.5 and SNA pollution at Dongting Lake and Wuhan sites as well as back trajectories verified the regional effect. The results will be helpful for investigating water-soluble ions and the major sources as well as geographical origins for PM2.5 at Central China.

J	Liu, F; You, ZP; Yang, X; Wang, HNA				Liu, Fang; You, Zhanping; Yang, Xu; Wang, Hainian			Macro-micro degradation process of fly ash concrete under alternation of freeze-thaw cycles subjected to sulfate and carbonation	CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS												Concrete is one of the most extensively used building materials. In the cold salty lake region, concrete structures generally undergo freeze-thaw cycles subjected to sulfate in the winter and early spring, and experience carbonation during the rest of the year. It is necessary to study the degradation process of concrete during the alternation of freeze-thaw cycles subjected to sulfate and carbonation. In this article, two types of experiments were implemented: freeze-thaw cycles subjected to sulfate (SF), and the alteration of freeze-thaw cycles subjected to sulfate and carbonation (SFC). Computed tomography (CT), as a non-destructive testing technology, was adopted to reveal the rules of pore changes and show generated cracks after the alternation of freeze-thaw cycles subjected to sulfate and carbonation. CT scanning results showed that pore numbers, pore areas, and porosity of each cross-section changed to some extent. Due to the different distances from the top, the changes of each cross-section were found to be dissimilar. From the 2D images, SFC specimens were identified to have corner erosion and internal cracks, and were damaged more severely than SF specimens. The compressive strength loss of SF specimens was very limited in the early state; after a certain period of erosion, the compressive strength decreased rapidly. The compressive strength loss of specimens under SFC was larger than the specimens under SF. Carbonation constantly consumed calcium ions, which negatively affected the stability of porosity system. Freeze-thaw cycles caused aperture degradation, coarsened the pore structure, and with the additional interaction of sulfate erosion, aggravated the deterioration of concrete.

J	Lieschke, JA; Closs, GP				Lieschke, JA; Closs, GP			Regulation of zooplankton composition and distribution by a zooplanktivorous fish in a shallow, eutrophic floodplain lake in south east Australia	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The diet of Australian smelt (Retropinna semoni) and the patterns of vertical distribution and diel vertical migration of fish and zooplankton were studied over a single Austral spring/summer in a shallow, eutrophic, floodplain lake. The diet of smelt was dominated by cladocera despite the frequently low abundances of such prey in the water column. Calanoid copepods were abundant in the zooplankton community at all times yet formed only a minor component of smelt diet. Patterns of vertical distribution and diel vertical migration exhibited by the various zooplankton taxa appeared to be related to the intensity of predation by smelt. The most heavily predated cladoceran taxa tended to remain in deeper water, whilst lightly predated calanoid copepods were abundant throughout the water column at all times. Neither taxon exhibited marked diel vertical migration. In contrast, cladoceran taxa suffering intermediate levels of predation exhibited marked diel vertical migration tending to avoid surface waters during the day. Smelt also appeared to exhibit diel vertical migration with few fish being caught in the water column during the day. The patterns of predation on zooplankton and the distribution and abundance of zooplankton suggest that smelt may play a significant role in regulating zooplankton community structure in the lowland habitats of south east Australia.					; Closs, Gerard/AAE-5883-2019	Closs, Gerard/0000-0003-4550-6024; 													0003-9136					NOV	1999	146	4					397	412																WOS:000084130300002

After removing herbivorous and plankti-benthivorous fish, submerged macrophyte restoration was utilized at the entire lake (82.7 km(2)) to combat eutrophication and improve water quality in the shallow subtropical aquaculture of Lake Datong. We conducted two years of monitoring, from March 2018 to February 2020. During the first year of restoration, 80% of the area of Lake Datong (approximately 60 km(2)) was successfully recovered by submerged vegetation, and the water quality was improved. For example, the phosphorous (P) content (including total P (TP), dissolved reactive P (DRP) and total dissolved P (TDP)) and turbidity decreased, and the Secchi depth (SD) increased. However, the submerged vegetation disappeared from autumn 2019 in the intermittent recovery area (MN), while the continuous recovery area (DX) continued to recover with an abundance of submerged vegetation. During the second year, the water quality continued to improve significantly in the DX area, with high biomass and coverage of submerged vegetation. In the MN area, although turbidity and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) increased significantly and SD decreased significantly, the P content (TP, TDP, and DRP) still continued to decrease. The restoration of submerged macrophytes could significantly decrease the density of phytoplankton. Over time, there was a regime shift in Lake Datong. The structural equation model (SEM) results illustrated that the water level and submerged plant coverage were the primary drivers that triggered changes in the state of the lake ecosystem. Our results highlight the potential of restoring submerged vegetation to control water eutrophication at the whole-lake scale. However, the water level in spring was the primary driver that triggered changes in the state of the lake ecosystem. Water level management should be emphasized during the early stages of recovery of submerged plants.

J	Shi, K; Zhang, YL; Liu, XH; Wang, MZ; Qin, BQ				Shi, Kun; Zhang, Yunlin; Liu, Xiaohan; Wang, Mingzhu; Qin, Boqiang			Remote sensing of diffuse attenuation coefficient of photosynthetically active radiation in Lake Taihu using MERIS data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Especially for a shallow and extremely turbid lake, light availability in the water column can determine the euphotic zone, and the horizontal and vertical distribution of algae species. Light attenuation is traditionally quantified as the diffuse attenuation coefficient of the photosynthetically available radiation (K-d(PAR)). Global coverage of K-d(PAR) at high spatial and temporal resolution can be provided by satellite measurements, and these data can be used to improve our understanding of the physical, chemical and biological processes in Lake Taihu, a large shallow lake in China, of considerable importance as a source of drinking water for several large cities. The primary dominated contributor to K-d(PAR) was determined firstly using linear regression. There was a significant positive correlation between K-d(PAR) and concentrations of total suspended matter (TSM). The determination coefficient between K-d(PAR) and TSM (R-2 = 0.91) was significantly higher than that between K-d(PAR) and chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl-a) (R-2 = 0.11), and between K-d(PAR) and absorption of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) (R-2 = 0.01). Our results therefore could demonstrate that TSM usually plays a dominant role in the attenuation of light in Lake Taihu. A retrieval model of K-d(PAR) values for Lake Taihu was subsequently developed using top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance of Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) image data at band 10, which was strongly correlated with in situ K-d(PAR) (R-2 = 0.74, p < 0.005, N = 48). In contrast, the atmospheric corrected reflectance of MERIS image data was not strongly correlated with in situ K-d(PAR). Thus, atmospheric correction was not a prerequisite for estimations of K(PAR) in this highly turbid and hyper-eutrophic lake, and a simple empirical model of the K-d(PAR) estimation for Lake Taihu was effective. With the simple model, the seasonal and spatial distributions of K-d(PAR) in Lake Taihu were studied using the MERIS measurements from 2003 to 2010. Our results show distinct seasonal, spatial, and wind driven, K-d(PAR) values in Lake Taihu. The highest and the lowest K-d(PAR) values were found in summer and in winter, respectively. The increase of K-d(PAR) in summer can be attributed to the phytoplankton blooms, and wind-driven sediment resuspension. Spatially, the K-d(PAR) values were high in the southern part and the lake center, and low K-d(PAR) in East Lake Taihu. Based on the MERIS derived K-d(PAR) values, a significant correlation was found between K(PAR) and wind speeds, suggesting a critical role of wind speeds in the K-d(PAR) variations in Lake Taihu.

Climate-driven alterations of lake thermal regimes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Temperate lakes are undergoing climate-driven alterations in their thermal regimes, changing their ecology. Previous efforts to understand temperature changes have overlooked multi-dimensional temperature dynamics, missing complex shifts at high spatiotemporal resolutions across landscapes. Here, we use simulated daily water temperature profiles from > 11,000 temperate lakes throughout the Midwestern United States to (1) quantify multivariate, landscape-scale patterns in contemporary thermal regimes and (2) contextualize forecasted shifts and identify novel regimes that may emerge with climatic change. Hierarchical clustering and principal component analyses identified six lake clusters with distinct thermal regimes driven by differences in annual warming rates and spring-summer dynamics, with secondary influences from extreme heat events and seasonal variability. Annual temperature variations were influenced by lake-specific physical characteristics, emphasizing distinct thermal profiles and seasonal variability patterns. Projected climate-driven alterations in thermal regimes suggest a homogenization toward warmer and more variable conditions, with the majority of lakes characterized by higher temperatures and increased variability. Few lakes (n = 310), particularly in the southern and southeastern Midwest, may experience novel, non-analog conditions by the late 21(st) century, while others will undergo shifts between clusters but remain within analogous regime frameworks. Projected changes in lake thermal regimes highlight concerns about ecological impacts on aquatic species and habitats, especially as extreme and variable growing season temperatures intensify and periods of stratification become prolonged. Furthermore, we identify thermal regimes that are likely to dominate the region by the late 21st century while identifying those likely to be lost. The ecological consequences of such changes remain unknown.

J	Toivonen, P; Toivola, M; Selonen, V				Toivonen, Pyry; Toivola, Mikko; Selonen, Vesa			Ice cover and partner removal increase movements of invasive mesopredator in the coastal island mosaic	ECOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS AND EVIDENCE												The invasion of new areas is influenced by landscape structure, seasonal conditions and social interactions. Coastal and lake landscapes pose unique challenges for land animals due to water barriers, while the ice cover in northern latitudes can facilitate movement. For invasive alien species, information on movement capabilities provides data for management. This study examines the movement patterns of an invasive mesopredator, raccoon dog, in a fragmented coastal environment in southwestern Finland to better understand its movement capabilities and potential expansion. Using GPS tracking, we investigated individual movements between islands, considering the role of ice cover, island connectivity and social interactions (partner removal by management). The raccoon dog has low winter activity levels, but our findings demonstrate that the individuals remain active during the cold season and use ice cover to reach islands perhaps otherwise unreachable. The number and connectivity of islands also play a crucial role in movement distances. Moreover, the partner removal increases movement between islands during the summer. We conclude that the raccoon dog is highly mobile in the coastal landscape, with ice cover facilitating movements between islands. Practical implication. To effectively manage this invasive species, creating single individuals should be avoided before avian breeding season. This strategy can help prevent solitary raccoon dogs from wandering and potentially colonizing new areas. Melting ice due to climate change is often mentioned as a benefit to invasive species, but our results provide an example of where the ice cover potentially enhances movement of an invasive species and thus requires consideration.

J	Mouthon, J				Mouthon, Jacques			Response of bivalve populations to drying disturbance and life history traits of two Pisidium species (Bivalvia: Sphaeriidae) in a reservoir of the French Upper Rhone river	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The dam reservoirs of the Upper Rhone were drained every three years until 2003, and the water level of the Villebois reservoir was lowered by 1.5 m. This resulted in considerable drying of its littoral habitats and the disappearance of the abundant macro-invertebrates that live in them. This study investigates the response to this drying disturbance of bivalve populations and especially of the life history traits of the two potamic species, Pisidium moitessierianum and Pisidium supinum. The low density of these bivalves observed during the months following the drying of May 2003 until spring 2004 shows that the contribution of drift in population recovery was very limited during this period. Due to the faster turnover of its cohorts and a higher increase in litter size in 2004, P. moitessierianum once again dominated bivalve communities from 2005 onwards. In the Villebois reservoir recovery of bivalve communities in terms of structure and density was total three years after the drying of 2003. Observations suggest an increase in litter size and continuous recruitment: the reproductive strategy adopted by these bivalves represent response to the fall in numbers on the one hand, and to considerable magnitudes of temperature and flow rates on the other hand, enabling the rapid adjustment of populations to drying disturbance and variations in environmental conditions. Taking into account the response of bivalve populations to this event, its effects are comparable to those of a supra-seasonal drought (Lake, 2003, Freshw. Biol., 48, 1161-1172).																			0003-4088	2100-000X				JAN	2011	47	2					175	184		10.1051/limn/2011007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2011007													WOS:000292876800008
J	He, Y; Wang, QM; He, W; Xu, FL				He, Yong; Wang, Qingmei; He, Wei; Xu, Fuliu			Phthalate esters (PAEs) in atmospheric particles around a large shallow natural lake (Lake Chaohu, China)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The pollution of phthalate esters (PAEs) remains an important issue in the world. Current studies mainly focused on atmospheric PAEs in urban area with strong anthropogenic activities, but there were no studies on PAEs in the ambient air around large natural lake. This paper focused on two sites around take Chaohu to investigate the monthly occurrence, composition and source of PAEs in the atmospheric particles around large shallow natural lake. New insights into atmospheric PAEs in large shallow natural lake and the overall fate of PAEs in lake ecosystem were given. The concentrations of the Sigma(13)PAEs in atmospheric particles were at a significantly low level ranging from 2740 to 11,890 pg.m(-3) and 2622 to 15,331 pg.m(-3) in ZM (the lakeshore site) and HB (the downtown site), respectively. There were no statistically significant differences of PAEs between ZM and HB. The highest atmospheric PAE concentrations in August were likely related to the long-range transport from Guangdong Province. Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) were the main PAE congeners. Temporally, DIBP and DBP had the highest fractions in winter and the lowest fractions in summer. It might be justified by the condensation of DIBP and DBP from gas phase to particulate phase at low temperature. Multimedia comparison of PAE profiles in Lake Choahu revealed that low molecular weight (LMW) congeners were transported mainly through water while high molecular weight (HMW) congeners were transported mainly through atmosphere.

In May, the TN: TP mass ratio was above 30, but it decreased to below 10 in July-August. In October, the ratio increased again. Water quality was regulated by external loading in spring, but the sharp decrease in the TN: TP ratio in July-August resulted mainly from the elevated sediment resuspension rate. In May and October, the resuspension rate was below 20 g dry weight (wt) m(-2) d(-1), while in July-August it exceeded 60 g dry wt m(-2) d(-1). Sediment resuspension decreases the TN: TP ratio in the water because the ratio in the surface sediment is low. The high resuspension rate in July-August could not be explained by wind effects, water level fluctuations, or bioturbation, but was instead attributed to the seasonal change in the sediment quality. During the summer, fresh material having low critical shear stress settled on the bottom until the critical shear stress was lower than the actual shear stress, and the resuspension rate increased steeply, although no increment in wave effects occurred. For a shallow lake, a single representative TN: TP ratio is misleading, because the seasonally fluctuating resuspension rate substantially affects the ratio and may induce switches between N and P limitation. Seasonal fluctuations in the resuspension rate may have important effects on algal communities, because low N to P ratios can favor N-fixing cyanobacteria over other algal groups. In Kirkkojarvi, cyanobacteria became the dominant algal group during the period of intensive resuspension.

J	Wang, JQ; Song, YZ; Wang, GX				Wang, Jinqi; Song, Yuzhi; Wang, Guoxiang			Causes of large Potamogeton crispus L. population increase in Xuanwu Lake	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												In July 2005, the first outbreak of cyanobacterial blooms, dominated by Microcystis, occurred in Xuanwu Lake, Nanjing, upon which clay flocculation was adopted to control algal blooms. The cyanobacterial blooms were restrained, after which Potamogeton crispus appeared in November 2005 and spread rapidly in the whole lake. Since then, large populations of P. crispus have occurred in Xuanwu Lake annually in winter for the last 10 years. To determine the reasons for the occurrence of P. crispus populations in Xuanwu Lake during 2005-2006, water quality indices were monitored regularly. The data collected included dissolved oxygen, transparency, pH, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus content. Data analysis indicated that the transparency was improved by 179.5 % after clay flocculation, dissolved oxygen content increased by 24.1 %; total nitrogen and total phosphorus content decreased by 54.1 and 74.5 %, respectively, and pH fell from 9.1 to 8.7, all of which can be attributed to the emergency control measures for the cyanobacterial bloom. Data analysis also indicated that the improved water transparency after clay flocculation was the key factor in turion sprouting and seedling propagation of P. crispus. The ameliorative light intensity and favorable nutrient level all promoted the growth of seedlings of P. crispus and later quick colonization. It is suggested that ecological restoration of macrophytic and algal lakes be conducted by some physical or chemical means to improve transparency, reduce nutrient concentration, and adjust water pH, with the purpose of improving water quality for germination and growth of aquatic plants.

The former 2 species breed in living trees, whereas the latter 2 species breed in dead or crying trees or stumps. This study develops an ecological and physiological context for the diversity of responses to a common chemical signal among closely related species exploiting common hosts. All 4 species respond to a mixture of terpenes and ethanol but show different temporal and behavioral patterns. H. radicis and H, assimilis have a spring peak and midsummer decline in attraction to turpentine- and ethanol-baited pitfall traps,;rnd females are the predominant gender captured. The period of attraction of H. pales and P picivorus to baited traps extends somewhat later into the summer, and males and females are captured in equal numbers. For all species, capture rates in passive screen traps decline later than those in pitfall traps. Dissections of captured female weevils show that volatile-emitting pitfall traps are selective for reproductively mature individuals of all species, whereas the passive screen traps catch nonreproductive and reproductive females in equal numbers. Ninety-seven percent of the males captured were reproductively mature, so their decline in attraction to pitfall traps is not directly related to reproductive status. Niche differences among the 4 species can explain some of the differences in the attraction of the weevils to baited pitfall traps.

Improvement in fisheries, hydropower, and drought management with costs of installation and operation in Camanche Reservoir, California, United States	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Horne AJ, Faisst WK. 2022. Hypolimnetic oxygenation 6. Improvement in fisheries, hydropower, and drought management with costs of installation and operation in Camanche Reservoir, California, United States. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XXX-XXX. A hypolimnetic oxygenation system (HOS) was installed in Camanche Reservoir, California, in 1993 to eliminate hatchery fish kills caused by hydrogen sulfide in dam tailwaters. It operates from about June through October each year. Algae, nutrients, heavy metals, and turbidity also declined. Fall run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) increased by 3550/yr or 265%. Threatened steelhead trout (O. mykiss), which spend more time in the river than Chinook, benefited more (625%). A 3 yr delay in elevated adult returns indicated that the HOS's main effect was improved in-river water quality for juvenile fish, rather than better adult attraction flows. Using the California State economist's value of $1172 for an adult Chinook to freshwater anglers, the increase due to HOS added $6.5 million/yr to California's recreation. The in-reservoir coldwater fishery improved because dissolved oxygen in the hypolimnion increased from <1 mg/L to similar to 5 mg/L. Oxygenation allowed summer operation of a 10.7 MW hydropower plant, making HOS carbon neutral. During droughts, improved water quality at lower reservoir levels reduced dependence on alternative supplies and supported full hatchery operation and in-river spawning. Oxygen addition ($0.64/kg) was much cheaper than nitrate addition ($104/kg). Averaged over 20 yr, HOS reduced phosphorus ($19.3/kg vs. alum addition at $16/kg) and ammonia/nitrate ($2/kg). Iron ($0.0005/kg) and manganese were reduced at lower cost than for conventional methods ($9/kg). Copper ($4441/kg) and zinc ($2169/kg) fell below chronic toxicity levels. Capital cost for HOS was $1.87 million in 1993 or $30,390/km(2) ($1248/acre). Operation and management averaged $191,288/yr (1993-2000).																			1040-2381	2151-5530				SEP 6	2022	38	3					268	285		10.1080/10402381.2022.2049404	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2022.2049404		MAR 2022											WOS:000801189200001

In this paper, we analyse globally-distributed, high-resolution climate proxy records from 58 sites to develop a comprehensive understanding of climate change around 7.2 ka BP. Analysis of the data compilation, which comprises records from lake sediments, one loess section, speleothems, marine sediments, and ice cores, show that the climate event is manifested as a weakening of the Asian summer monsoon and a strengthening of the South American summer monsoon. Climate change also involves dramatic cooling and wetter conditions in north-central Europe, widespread aridity across the Africa and west-south North America, contrasting patterns of precipitation variability throughout the Mediterranean, and notable cooling over the polar regions, suggesting that this is a global climate event. A close correspondence between the 7.2 ka event and the timing of solar irradiance minima, strong volcanic eruptions, meltwater flux into the North Atlantic Ocean, and an orbitallyinduced decrease in summer solar insolation suggests a possible causal link with these phenomena. We suggest that climate anomalies around 7.2 ka BP may be specifically explained as a response to southward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, onset of an increasingly El Nin & SIM;o-like state, reinforcement of the westerlies, and slowing of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC).					; Cohen, David/A-7526-2015; Zheng, Hongbo/LNP-2343-2024	Hou, Mei/0000-0003-2486-907X; Cohen, David/0000-0002-5973-8566; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				MAY 15	2023	618								111525	10.1016/j.palaeo.2023.111525	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2023.111525		MAR 2023											WOS:001030145200001

Combining field observations and satellite remote -sensed data, factors that influence algal bloom intensity in Lake Taihu over an eight -year period, from 2016 to 2023, are examined, and changes in phytoplankton community composition, climate, water quality, economic activities, and food web dynamics are reported. Sentinel -2 MSI data analysis reveals a dramatic decrease in Cyanobacterial blooms in 2023, with a reduction in the annual maximum bloom area of 76.90 % from 2016 values. From 2016 to 2022, the ratio of Cyanobacteria to other phytoplankton ranged 82.09 % -98.29 %, but in 2023, this dropped to 60.98 %. Concurrently, Cyanobacteria density dropped to an historic low of 2.29 x 10 7 cells/L (16.4 % of 2021 peak values). Redundancy and random forest analyses indicated that nitrogen has a greater influence on phytoplankton than phosphorus, with temperature and permanganate index being the important parameters to affect phytoplankton community structure. We attribute the decrease in Cyanobacterial blooms in Lake Taihu in 2023 to be largely caused by shifts in phytoplankton community structure, particularly the sharp decline in Microcystis sp. density, a genus often linked to bloom formation. Meteorological conditions such as reduced rainfall and wind speed during the winter and spring of 2023 also contributed to diminishing Cyanobacterial blooms. Ongoing improvements in water quality, reduced economic activities because of pandemic restrictions, and implementation of a fishing ban since 2020 have likely further contributed to reductions in bloom frequency. These results improve our understanding of the processes that affect algal blooms in Lake Taihu, and potentially other eutrophic inland lakes.

J	Zhu, JY; Mingram, J; Brauer, A				Zhu, Jiayun; Mingram, Jens; Brauer, Achim			Early Holocene aeolian dust accumulation in northeast China recorded in varved sediments from Lake Sihailongwan	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Annually laminated sediments of Lake Sihailongwan (SHL) in northeast China preserve a high resolution record of past climatic and environmental changes. Thin sections of varved early Holocene sediments were analyzed using light optical and scanning electron microscopic methods. Sediment micro-fades and geochemical analyses reveal two different seasonal clastic layer types: spring snow melt and dust layers. Dust layers distinctly differ from snow melt layers through their finer grain size, better sorting, higher Al and lower Mg and Ca contents. In contrast to recent lake SHL sediments, during the early Holocene silt-sized dust has been deposited after spring snow melt and after pronounced spring diatom blooms. For the time interval between 11,580 and 7060 varve years BP dust layers were quantified at annual resolution. Highest intensities and frequencies of dust accumulation are observed in the period from 11,100 to 8200 varve years BP, in good agreement with dry conditions in this time interval documented by palaeoclimatic records derived from lake sediments and loess in central Asia and northern China. Based on modern meteorological observation of dust storms in China, the dust accumulation record mirrors mainly the variation in climatic conditions governing generation of cyclone and cold air surges in the arid and semi-arid mid-latitude regions of China and Mongolia. On multidecadal and centennial time scales, solar activity might have been an additional forcing factor for dust accumulation frequency in the early Holocene. Spectral analyses reveal 205-years and 88-years periodicities in variations of dust accumulation frequency that likely reflect the de Vries (Suess) and the Gleissberg solar cycles.

Thermal habitat characteristics for warmwater fishes in coastal embayments of Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Along 40 km of the Lake Ontario shoreline near Toronto, Ontario, small coastal embayments (4.38-848 x 10(3) m(2)) have been constructed or modified by lake-infilling to restore warmwater fish habitat. We describe how the thermal regimes of these embayments differ from those of small inland lakes, how embayment bathymetry alters the degree of exchange with Lake Ontario, and predict how embayment thermal regimes affect warmwater fish growth. The accumulated growing-degree days, calculated from a 14 degrees C baseline (Sigma GDD(14)), of seven South-Central Ontario inland lakes and an embayment disconnected from Lake Ontario ranged from 844 to 1157 GDD. Compared to the inland lakes and disconnected embayment, the coastal embayments connected to Lake Ontario achieved fewer Sigma GDD(14) and had a greater range, 390-1047, reflecting differences in their degree of exchange with and the cooling effect of Lake Ontario. The thermal regime of coastal embayments differs most from inland lakes during May-late-July. During early summer, mean embayment depth explains over 50% of the variability in Sigma GDD(14), with deeper embayments cooling more from lake exchange than shallow embayments. After mid-summer, the cooling embayments are warmed by exchanges with Lake Ontario. This late-summer warming is insufficient to compensate for the cooling effect of the Lake earlier in the summer. Bioenergetic simulations of bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus, growth indicate that most of these embayments are too cool for adequate summer growth of YOY sunfish. Nevertheless, small coastal embayments that are shallow with suitable controls on exchange with the Lake can provide acceptable warmwater fish habitat.

Twentieth century human and climate impacts on a large mountain lake in southwest China	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Subfossil chironomid and sediment geochemistry data from Lugu Lake, a large high-elevation lake in southwest China, were used to assess the influences of climate warming and direct human impacts on the lake through time. A 95-year-long sediment record was recovered from the lake. Principal components analysis (PCA) and redundancy analysis of fossil chironomid data were performed to determine the controlling factors on the chironomid community. The four prominent environmental controls were summer air temperature, organic matter C:N ratio (C-org:N), dry mass accumulation rate (DMAR), and total nitrogen. C-org:N proved to be the most important controlling factor through time. However, C-org:N and summer air temperature were highly co-linear, possibly due to temperature directly impacting lake productivity (and thus C:N ratios) through increased stratification and a longer growing season. PCA Axis 1 scores were a strong predictor of summer temperatures even after DMAR was factored out to account for direct human influences. The strong temperature-chironomid relationship over the last 50 years could be due to the lake becoming more responsive to climate warming after cultural eutrophication of the 1950s, as lakes with higher nutrient loads are shown to be more responsive to the effects of climate warming.

J	WINDBERG, LA; KEITH, LB				WINDBERG, LA; KEITH, LB			SNOWSHOE HARE POPULATION RESPONSE TO ARTIFICIAL HIGH-DENSITIES	JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY												The demographic response of snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) populations to artificial high densities was studied during summer and autumn near Rochester, Alberta [Canada]. Experimental populations were established by transplanting hares onto islands in lakes in May and June. High-density populations on Dapp Island (15.4 ha) in 1970 and Birch Island (3.6 ha) in 1971 were adversely affected by food shortages. Rates of pregnancy and adult survival rates in these high-density populations did not differ from unmanipulated natural populations near Rochester, but juvenile survival was markedly lower. In 1972, a fence was constructed across Birch Island to separate 2 introduced high-density populations. One was supplementally fed commerical rabbit pellets ad lib and the other was forced to subsist on an insufficient quantity of native vegetation. Again, survival among adults was comparable in the fed and unfed high-density island populations and unmanipulated populations at lower densities. Pregnancy rates were lower and no young were found in the unfed island population. In comparisons with low-density Rochester populations, no adverse demographic responses such as reduced pregnancy or higher juvenile mortality was recorded in the fed high-density population. The high disappearance rate of juveniles from all high-density populations with limited food appeared to have been directly linked to food scarcity which affected young more severely than adults. No evidence was found that either parasitic or viral diseases, or social stresses, as indexed by incidence of scarring and adrenal weights, were acting as direct mortality factors in the food-limited high-density experimental populations.																			0022-2372	1545-1542					1976	57	3					523	553		10.2307/1379300	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1379300													WOS:A1976CD43600007
J	Desloges, JR				Desloges, JR			Geomorphic and climatic interpretations of abrupt changes in glaciolacustrine deposition at Moose Lake, British Columbia, Canada	GFF												Sediments deposited in Moose Lake, British Columbia exhibit three abrupt transitions during the Holocene. Basal diamicts are unconformably overlain by coarse sand and silt deposited as turbidity currents in an ice-dammed lake during final retreat of Wisconsinan ice. Rapid withdrawal of the valley glacier resulted in a fully developed Moose Lake followed by low rates of sediment input for much of the early and middle Holocene until approximately 4,100 years BP. At that time, sediment input doubled and then tripled by 3,120 years BP in response to cooling and several phases of regionally documented glacier expansions. The transition from the Altithermal dry/warm period to the Neoglacial cooling is coincident with the formation of varves at Moose Lake which provide a chronology of changing Neoglacial sediment inputs. The glacier-climate signal recorded in Moose Lake sediments suggests distinct thresholds for changes in sedimentation style that are dependent on both climatic and geomorphic conditions affecting the watershed. Early in the record, direct connection to glaciogenic sediment production produced highly variable sedimentation rates that ended abruptly as the ice-front retreated. In the middle record, climate conditions that led to greatly reduced ice extent and lower sediment production in the upper Fraser and Moose river watersheds, changed abruptly resulting in varve formation. The change in style and increased sedimentation was caused directly by greater seasonal variations in sediment input due to climate-controlled glacier advances beyond modern limits. While sediment supply is a factor, comparison of the sediment record with tree-ring responses to climate change suggest both summer temperature and winter precipitation are important controls of Holocene variations in sediment yield.																			1103-5897					SEP	1999	121		3				202	207		10.1080/11035899901213202	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11035899901213202													WOS:000083427800010

However, the response mechanism of arsenic (As) dynamics in sediments to these changes remains unclear. In this study, we employed high-resolution techniques to investigate the seasonal dynamics of As at the SWI in aquaculture-impacted lake zones, systematically analyzing its mobilization pathways and associated driving mechanisms. Our findings revealed that seasonal variability significantly influenced both dissolved As concentrations in sediment porewater (ranging from 3.54 to 88.14 mu g/L) and As diffusive fluxes (ranging from 1.22 to 95.58 mu g center dot m-2 center dot d-1). Dissolved As were consistently higher in the aquaculture zones than non-aquaculture areas during both spring and summer. Sedimentary As fractionations differed markedly between aquaculture and non-aquaculture zones, with aquaculture sediments exhibiting higher proportions of both non-specifically adsorbed As (F1) and specifically adsorbed As (F2). Correlation analysis indicated that F1 and poorly crystalline oxyhydroxide-bound As (F3) were major contributors to As mobilization into porewater in aquaculture zones. Partial least squares path modeling revealed distinctive key mechanisms: in non-aquaculture zones, Fe/Mn (oxyhydr) oxides dominated As dissolution processes, whereas in aquaculture zones, elevated nutrient levels modified dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition, thereby altering As speciation and enhancing its dissolution. Collectively, our study advances the understanding of As biogeochemistry at the SWI in aquaculture environments and underscores the potential amplification of As mobilization due to seasonal variability, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring and management.																			0043-1354	1879-2448				DEC 1	2025	287		A						124307	10.1016/j.watres.2025.124307	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2025.124307								40749594					WOS:001544709500001

Tributary use and large-scale movements of grass carp in Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Infrequent captures of invasive, non-native grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) have occurred in Lake Erie over the last 30+ years, with recent evidence suggesting wild reproduction in the lake's western basin (WB) is occurring. Information on grass carp movements in the Laurentian Great Lakes is lacking, but an improved understanding of large-scale movements and potential areas of aggregation will help inform control strategies and risk assessment if grass carp spread to other parts of Lake Erie and other Great Lakes. Twenty-three grass carp captured in Lake Erie's WB were implanted with acoustic transmitters and released. Movements were monitored with acoustic receivers deployed throughout Lake Erie and elsewhere in the Great Lakes. Grass carp dispersed up to 236 km, with approximately 25% of fish dispersing greater than 100 km from their release location. Mean daily movements ranged from <0.01 to 2.49 km/day, with the highest daily averages occurring in the spring and summer. The Sandusky, Detroit, and Maumee Rivers, and Plum Creek were the most heavily used WB tributaries. Seventeen percent of grass carp moved into Lake Erie's central or eastern basins, although all fish eventually returned to the WB. One fish emigrated from Lake Erie through the Huron-Erie Corridor and into Lake Huron. Based on our results, past assessments may have underestimated the potential for grass carp to spread in the Great Lakes. We recommend focusing grass carp control efforts on Sandusky River and Plum Creek given their high use by tagged fish, and secondarily on Maumee and Detroit Rivers.

The oligochaete community in the Lake comprised 52% of the total benthic fauna and Potamothrix hammoniensis (Michaelsen, 1901) (Tubificidae, Oligochaeta) represented more than 90% of the oligochaetes sampled. During September 1991 - August 1994, the proportion of ovigerous individuals of P. hammoniensis represented less than 20% of the total population, with localised differences in the Lake occurring over time. Breeding and cocoon production in the study period started in March of the year, when the water temperature was about 7 C, and lasted until May 1992 and June 1993, respectively. The newly hatched individuals reached the highest proportion in May. Although large individuals were found again by the end of September (1991) and the beginning of October (1993), no spermatozeugmata in their spermathecae or cocoons were observed during November and October, respectively. Member of this cohort bred and started cocoon deposition during the following spring, after about 11 months of maturation (from April to March). A second, less intensive period of breeding was recorded during August 1992 and this lasted until the beginning of September 1993. However, cocoons from this latter period did not show embryonic growth and hatching until the autumn floods bring oxygenated water to the bottom level. This resulted in a period of rapid development followed by the mass hatching of cocoons. These specimens needed a maximum of 9 month (from October to July) to reach sexual maturity.					geta, risnoveanu/Q-3790-2019; Risnoveanu, Geta/Q-3790-2019	geta, risnoveanu/0000-0002-5194-5448; 													0018-8158					JUL	2002	479	1					23	30		10.1023/A:1021012111295	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1021012111295													WOS:000179168700003

The mortality rate of starving YOY roach (total length 38 +/- 2 mm) from small (ca. 0.5 km(2)), eutrophic Lake Isojarvi was 50%, whilst roach (total length 32 +/- 3 mm) from large Lake Paijanne (1106 km(2)) suffered 42% mortality. Mortality was size-dependent among roach from Lake Isojairvi, smaller individuals being more vulnerable. There was not strict size limit for survival as proposed previously. However, it seems that within populations approximately the same proportion of smallest roach died independent of the absolute lengths of the fish. Mortality of fed roach from both lakes was always < 5 %.This good survival indicates indirectly the importance of energy reserves in wintering. Lipid and protein content of fasting roach from lake Isojarvi decreased during the winter. In the group of fasting roach from Lake Paijanne the amount of lipids stored increased between November and March and decreased thereafter. No change in protein content of fasting fish from Lake Paijanne was observed.																			0378-1909					DEC	1997	50	4					451	456		10.1023/A:1007302931943	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1007302931943													WOS:000070978100010

Evaluating the influence of snow and ice conditions on under-ice light regimes, dissolved oxygen, and primary production in shallow lakes using controlled manipulative systems	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Shifts in hydroclimatic regimes associated with global climate change are affecting the timing and duration of winter ice-cover in temperate and high-latitude lakes. Less is known on how associated changes in ice quality potentially affect under-ice ecological processes and related biogeochemistry, particularly in shallow lake systems. This experimental study examined how differing surface ice-cover types (slushed white ice, unmanipulated ice formation [black], snow-on-ice) affected under-ice light and oxygen regimes and associated chlorophyll a concentrations, and water quality parameters using a combination of aboveground mesocosms and natural ponds over two consecutive winter seasons. In both systems, light transmission under white ice did not differ significantly from black but was significantly greater than snow-on-ice. Measures of light extinction coefficients taken at the ice-water interface in the experimental ponds increased for black, white, and snow-on-ice, respectively, with all values being above thresholds for autotrophic activity. Under-ice dissolved oxygen levels in all mesocosm ice treatments increased continually over time with increasing day length, peaking prior to ice off. Accumulated DO levels were aligned with observed chlorophyll a concentrations, with peaks early after ice onset, and decreases as winter progressed though patterns differed between years. No significant differences were observed in mean chlorophyll a levels in snow-removed treatment ponds, regardless of whether white or black ice was present while the snow-on-ice ponds displayed consistently lower levels. This study highlights the complexities and importance of using manipulative experimental approaches to advance our understanding of how alterations in surface ice-cover quality affect under-ice hydro-ecological processes.

The ecological history of Lake Ontario according to phytoplankton	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake Ontario's condition has fluctuated since European settlement, and our understanding of the linkages between observed ecosystem shifts and stressors is improving. Changes in the physical and chemical environment of the lake due to non-indigenous species, pollution, sedimentation, turbidity, and climate change altered the pelagic primary producers, so algal assessments have been valuable for tracking long-term conditions. We present a chronological account of algal assessments to summarize past and present environmental conditions in Lake Ontario. This review particularly focuses on pelagic, diatom-based assessments as their fossils in sediments have revealed the combined effects of environmental insults and recovery. This review recaps the long-term trends according to three unique regions: Hamilton Harbour, the main lake basin, and the Bay of Quinte. We summarize pre-European impact settlement; eutrophication throughout most of the 20th century; subsequent water quality changes due to nutrient reductions; and filter-feeding dreissenid colonization and contemporary pelagic, shoreline, and embayment impairments. Recent data suggest that although phytoplankton biovolume is stable, species composition has shifted to an increase in densities of spring eutrophic diatoms and summer cyanobacteria. Continued monitoring and evaluation of historical data will assist in understanding and responding to the natural and anthropogenic drivers of lake Ontario's environmental conditions.

A recent study showed that the Upper Truckee River is the single largest contributor of sediment to Lake Tahoe, with a large proportion of the sediment load emanating from streambanks. This study combines field data with numerical modeling to identity the critical conditions for bank stability along an unstable reach of the Upper Truckee River, California. Bank failures occur during winter and spring months, brought on by repeated basal melting of snow packs and rain-on-snow events. Field studies of young lodgepole pines and Lemmon's willow were used to quantity the mechanical, hydrologic, and net effects of riparian vegetation on streambank stability. Lemmon's willow provided an order of magnitude more root reinforcement (5.5 kPa) than the lodgepole pines (0.5 kPa); the hydrologic effects of the species varied spatially and temporally and generally were of a smaller magnitude than the mechanical effects. Overall, Lemmon's willow provided a significant increase in bank strength, reducing the frequency of bank failures and delivery of fine grained sediment to the study reach of the Upper Truckee River.

A model of salt mound development was constructed for this study. It suggests that wind-blown sand supply and upward recharge of underground springs are two important factors in salt mound construction. Furthermore, it proposes that salt mound height is mainly controlled by the vertical transport range of underground springs and the thickness of the capillary fringe. A 1.5 m representative profile dug from the center of salt mound LP1 in the Lop Nor playa revealed a fairly complicated mineral assemblage including halite, gypsum, anhydrite, glauberite, epsomite, anhydrite, calcite, bischofite, polyhalite, schoenite, kieserite and carnallite. This matches closely with the assemblage predicted by the EQL/EVP model. The groundwater in the area is highly concentrated brine rich in Cl- and Na+ and poor in Ca2+, displaying low alkalinity, and containing considerable amounts of SO4(2-), Mg2+ and ICE. Chemical analysis of groundwater revealed considerable variation in the salinity and chemical composition of groundwater over time. The Cs-137 technique was used to measure the accumulated ages of the salt mounds. This method may prove useful in the research of relatively young playa environments where carbon dating techniques are unworkable because of an absence of carbon-rich materials in recent saline sediments.

J	Quinn, GP; Lake, PS; Schreiber, ESG				Quinn, GP; Lake, PS; Schreiber, ESG			Littoral benthos of a Victorian lake and its outlet stream: Spatial and temporal variation	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												There have been few comparative studies of the fauna in the two major types of freshwater systems, lakes and streams, in the one locality. This study compared the faunal assemblages at two times of the year (summer and winter) on stones in three locations: the littoral zone of two shores in Lake Purrumbete (one wave-exposed and one sheltered) and riffles in the Curdles River, which flows out of the lake. The lake fauna was dominated by crustaceans, gastropods and planarians, whereas the stream fauna was dominated by insects. The most abundant lake taxa were also present, but much less abundant, in the stream. The total number of species and individuals and densities of some common species varied between the three locations and between seasons. However, no consistent pattern reflecting a difference between the two lake shores was evident. Interpretation of MDS ordinations of the lake fauna was dependent on the data standardizations applied, with increased separation of the season-location combinations when species were standardized to equal total abundances; the seasonal difference was always greatest for the exposed (cliff) shore. In contrast, MDS on the stream fauna showed seasonal differences under all standardizations. This was consistent with the high seasonal turnover of species in the stream compared with the lake. These results demonstrate that, even within a local area with similar geology and connected water bodies, lake and stream fauna from the same substratum (stones) can be markedly different. Taxa that occurred in both were more abundant in the lake, whereas seasonal differences in abundance were much greater in the stream.																			0307-692X					SEP	1996	21	3					292	301		10.1111/j.1442-9993.1996.tb00611.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.1996.tb00611.x													WOS:A1996VF02400006

Nitrogen inputs promote N2O production and emission, but the microbial pathways controlling N2O have been seldom studied in reservoir water columns. We determined N2O concentration in the water column of 12 reservoirs during the summer stratification and winter mixing. We explored the potential microbial sources and sinks of N2O by quantifying key genes involved in ammonia oxidation (bacterial and archaeal amoA) and denitrification (nirS and nosZ). Dissolved N2O varied up to three orders of magnitude (4.7-2441.2 nmol L-1) across systems, from undersaturated to supersaturated values (37%-24,174%) depending on reservoirs and depths. N2O concentration depended on nitrogen and oxygen availabilities, with the lowest and highest N2O values at suboxic conditions. Ammonia-oxidizing archaea dominated over ammonia-oxidizing bacteria but were not related to the dissolved N2O. In contrast, the abundance of the nirS gene was significantly related to N2O concentration, and three orders of magnitude higher than amoA abundance. Denitrifying bacteria appeared consistently in the water column of all reservoirs. The nirS and nosZ genes appeared in oxic and suboxic waters, but they were more abundant in suboxic waters. The nitrate concentration, and nirS and nosZ relative abundances explained the dissolved N2O. Besides, nirS abundance was related positively with total phosphorus and cumulative chlorophyll a, a proxy for fresh organic matter. Therefore, P inputs, not just N inputs, promoted N2O production by denitrification in the water column of reservoirs.					; León-Palmero, Elizabeth/AFS-0701-2022; Reche, Isabel/K-7120-2014	Leon-Palmero, Elizabeth/0000-0001-8220-1188; Morales Baquero, Rafael/0000-0002-7075-7899; Reche, Isabel/0000-0003-2908-1724													0024-3590	1939-5590				2023 JUN 16	2023										10.1002/lno.12381	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.12381		JUN 2023											WOS:001009665200001

Overcoming barriers to conservation of species complexes: integrating ecology with affordable whole genome methods to define conservation units in imperiled fishes	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Conservation units are a necessary discretization of biological variation, but species complexes with uncertain boundaries often hinder conservation of important ecological, biological, and genetic diversity. New genomic methods can resolve uncertainties for these species. Here, we resolve conservation units by combining ecological field studies with whole genome methods in a species complex of fishes, White Suckers (Catostomus commersonii) and Summer Suckers (C. utawana), in the Adirondack region of New York State. Like many complexes, the White-Summer Sucker complex has been reevaluated many times with no clear guidance on defining conservation units to date. We paired spawning dates, length, age, and fecundity in two lakes where these species co-occur, with whole genomes of 297 individuals to compare divergence between species and between lakes. With this data, we evaluated trait overlap, genetic distinctiveness using hierarchical PCAs and Admixture, and genotype-trait relationships. Though we find extensive overlap in established diagnostic traits among putative Summer and White suckers within the same lake and no consistent genetic groupings of Summer versus White Suckers, we do find evidence of divergence between Summer and White Suckers within lakes. This suggests that they represent multiple, convergent life history ecotypes with independent origins. We propose that, the Summer Sucker ecotype represents intraspecific diversity that should be protected based on its ecologically important traits, the risk of losing genetic variation underlying those traits, and its declining distribution. Our approach integrating genomic and ecological profiles is readily applicable to other species complexes where taxonomic uncertainty impedes conservation.																			0960-3115	1572-9710				SEP	2025	34	11					3909	3932		10.1007/s10531-025-03139-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-025-03139-1		SEP 2025											WOS:001578706700001

Gastric evacuation rate, index of fullness, and daily ration of Lake Michigan slimy (Cottus cognatus) and deepwater sculpin (Myoxocephalus thompsonii)	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Accurate estimates of fish consumption are required to understand trophic interactions and facilitate ecosystem-based fishery management. Despite their importance within the food-web, no method currently exists to estimate daily consumption for Great Lakes slimy (Cottus cognatus) and deepwater sculpin (Myoxocephalus thompsonii). We conducted experiments to estimate gastric evacuation (GEVAC) and collected field data from Lake Michigan to estimate index of fullness [(g prey/g fish weight)100%) to determine daily ration for water temperatures ranging 2-5 degrees C, coinciding with the winter and early spring season. Exponential GEVAC rates equaled 0.0115/h for slimy sculpin and 0.0147/h for deepwater sculpin, and did not vary between 2.7 degrees C and 5.1 degrees C for either species or between prey types (Mysis relicta and fish eggs) for slimy sculpin. Index of fullness varied with fish size, and averaged 1.93% and 1.85% for slimy and deepwater sculpins, respectively. Maximum index of fullness was generally higher (except for the smallest sizes) for both species in 2009-2010 than in 1976 despite reductions in a primary prey, Diporeia spp. Predictive daily ration equations were derived as a function of fish dry weight. Estimates of daily consumption ranged from 0.2 to 0.8% of their body weight, which was within the low range of estimates from other species at comparably low water temperatures. These results provide a tool to estimate the consumptive demand of sculpins which will improve our understanding of benthic offshore food webs and aid in management and restoration of these native species in the Great Lakes.

The longest sub-freezing period of winter averaged 20-30 days in the southern portion of the region, 30-40 days around Lake Superior, and 90-100 days in extreme northwestern Ontario. These are twice as long as sub-freezing periods at similar latitudes in eastern Canada. The sub-freezing period is shortened by about one week along the shores of the Great Lakes. There is annual spatial correlation of the longest sub-freezing period, indicating regional synoptic-scale control. The late 1970s had the longest sub-freezing periods but no significant linear trend was found in lengths of sub-freezing periods. The average date of the first significant thaw (> 10-degrees-C) ranged from early March in the south to late April in the north and is delayed 1-2 weeks along the shores of the Great Lakes.																			0004-0843					DEC	1993	46	4					359	364																WOS:A1993MQ45000011

Water Quality and Microbiological Assessment of Burullus Lake and Its Surrounding Drains	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Burullus Lake, which is the second-largest coastal lagoon in Egypt, is deteriorating due to nutrient enrichment and pollutant loading. The study aims to assess the lake's water quality using water quality indices and microbiological assessment. Surface water samples were collected from Burullus Lake in winter and summer, as well as samples from drains that discharge waste into the lake. Most lake stations are classified in the marginal category based on the water quality index (WQI). Dissolved oxygen, ammonia, copper, and cadmium have the greatest impact on WQI, reflecting pollution loads. Based on the contamination index, heavy metal classification results ranged from "lowly polluted" to "highly polluted." According to the Nemerow Index, human activity has significantly impaired the ecology of the lake and surrounding drains through copper and cadmium pollution. The fecal coliform/fecal streptococci ratio was less than 0.6 in lake water samples, suggesting fecal contamination from domesticated animal wastes. Drain water contaminated with fecal streptococci indicated frequent contamination. Several drains allow a significant amount of effluent, including high amounts of pesticides and fertilizers, to enter the lake, causing serious metal and microbiological pollution Dredging and deepening the inlet link between the lake and Mediterranean Sea have had a positive impact on water quality. However, there are still other options for improving the lake's health. Therefore, it is recommended to routinely check Burullus Lake's water quality and its surrounding drains to keep track of its condition and assess any improvement efforts' effectiveness.

Characteristics of a Naturalized Kokanee Salmon Oncorhynchus nerka Population in Atypical Habitat	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Kokanee salmon arc a dwarf freshwater form of the anadromous sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) native to the Pacific coast of North America and Asia and widely introduced in western North America as a sport and prey fish. Few kokanee salmon introductions have succeeded in eastern North America. A naturalized population of kokanee salmon has persisted for over 50 yr in Florence Lake, Wisconsin, an unlikely location given its relatively small size (21.4 ha), shallow maximum depth (7.6 m), low elevation (381 m), and southerly latitude (45.12 degrees N). Kokanee salmon completed their entire life cycle within the lake and rarely entered an accessible coldwater inlet stream. Spawning occurred during late October and early November along the lake shoreline. Spawning redds with defending males were observed in 1-2 m of water on sand/gravel/cobble substrate. Kokanee salmon growth in the lake was relatively rapid, and fish had a mean total length of 117 mm after their first growing season (age 0+), 212 mm after their second (age 1+), begin to mature and spawn after their third (age 2+) at 317 nun for females and 324 mm for males, and were at 344 mm for females and 354 mm for males after their fourth (age 3+). Few fish reproduced at age 4+. Despite limited oxy-thermal habitat during summer, kokanee salmon appear to thrive in Florence Lake, perhaps because of cold inflows from the inlet and springs within the lake.																			0003-0031	1938-4238				JAN	2019	181	1					123	132		10.1674/0003-0031-181.1.123	http://dx.doi.org/10.1674/0003-0031-181.1.123													WOS:000457245700012

The zooplankton community was dominated by small cladocerans, whose biomass and production became highest in summer, when Microcystis bloomed. The high cladoceran production is considered to depend on the production of colonial Microcystis, because the production of nannoplankton was apparently too low to ensure the cladoceran production. Microcystis cells were unsuitable as food for the cladocerans inhabiting Lake Kasumigaura, but became utilizable when decomposed. Decomposed Microcystis may be the main food for Cladocera in the lake in summer. High water temperatures occurring in summer probably promoted decomposition of the Microcystis, leading to increased production of the small cladocerans.																			0020-9309						1991	76	1					21	36		10.1002/iroh.19910760104	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19910760104													WOS:A1991GB67400003

Thus, phreatic eruptions are likely to reoccur in the future, and hydrothermal systems should be understood to mitigate the risks of potential future hazards. Here, we reveal the results of longterm geochemical monitoring of hot spring waters and fumarolic gases since 1986 and discuss the chemical and temperature changes in hot spring waters, discharging at the foot, related to volcanic unrest. In Nakamachineshiri, related to the increase in seismic and fumarolic activity since 2019, the HCl concentration of the fumarolic gas has increased, and 8D and 818O values have also increased to approach those of the andesitic water. Simultaneously, with the increase in fumarolic and hydrothermal activity, the temperature and Cl concentration of the Meakan Onsen (MO) hot spring water discharged at the western foot of Nakamachineshiri have increased. The chemical characteristics of the fumarolic gas and MO water indicate that they were derived from a hydrothermal system in the shallow subsurface of Nakamachineshiri. Thus, we can consider that the temperature and chemical increases in the MO water represent activation of the system, and monitoring the MO water provides important information for understanding the present state of Nakamachineshiri. At Ponmachineshiri, phreatic eruptions occurred in 1988, 1996, 1998, 2006, and 2008, and seismic and fumarolic activity has sometimes increased since 1986 when we began our monitoring program. At the western foot of Ponmachineshiri, hot spring water is discharged at Yunotaki (YNT_U and YNT_L) and Lake Onneto (ONT). The results of our monitoring suggest that the YNT_U water is formed by mixing thermal water with a high HCO3 molar ratio (HCO3-type) and thermal water containing Cl and SO4 (Cl-SO4-type), which causes temperature and chemical changes related to the mixing ratio of these thermal waters related to volcanic unrest, especially increases in seismic activity. The Cl and SO4 concentrations in the ONT water began to increase approximately two years before the phreatic eruptions and increase in fumarolic activity. Such chemical increases can be explained by the increase in the supply of Cl-SO4-type thermal water and are likely to indicate precursor changes in volcanic unrest. Therefore, we expect to utilize these hot spring waters to understand the present state of Ponmachineshiri and detect precursor changes to future volcanic unrest.

Winter weather and lake-watershed physical configuration drive phosphorus, iron, and manganese dynamics in water and sediment of ice-covered lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												While decreasing occurrence and duration of lake ice cover is well-documented, biogeochemical dynamics in frozen lakes remain poorly understood. Here, we interpret winter physical and biogeochemical time series from eutrophic Missisquoi Bay (MB) and hyper-eutrophic Shelburne Pond (SP) to describe variable drivers of under ice biogeochemistry in systems of fundamentally different lake-watershed physical configurations (lake area, lake:watershed area). The continuous cold of the 2015 winter drove the MB sediment-water interface to the most severe and persistent suboxic state ever documented at this site, promoting the depletion of redox-sensitive phases in sediments, and an expanding zone of bottom water enriched in reactive species of Mn, Fe, and P. In this context, lake sediment and water column inventories of reactive chemical species were sensitive to the severity and persistence of subfreezing temperatures. During thaws, event provenance and severity impact lake thermal structure and mixing, water column enrichment in P and Fe, and thaw capability to suppress redox front position and internal chemical loading. Nearly identical winter weather manifest differently in nearby SP, where the small surface and watershed areas promoted a warmer, less stratified water column and active phytoplankton populations, impacting biogeochemical dynamics. In SP, Fe and P behavior under ice were decoupled due to active biological cycling, and thaw impacts were different in distribution and composition due to SP's physical structure and related antecedent conditions. We find that under ice biogeochemistry is highly dynamic in both time and space and sensitive to a variety of drivers impacted by climate change.					; XU, Yaoyang/J-9809-2012; Stockwell, Jason/HSC-4786-2023	Schroth, Andrew/0000-0001-5553-3208; Ramcharitar, Benjamin/0000-0002-6172-6580; Isles, Peter/0000-0003-4446-6788													0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	2017	62	4					1620	1635		10.1002/lno.10521	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10521													WOS:000404993100021

We present high-resolution multiproxy records from the coastal shelf off eastern Hainan Island in China to investigate abrupt climate change and regional human-environment interaction over the last 7,000 years. A prominent climatic anomaly occurred during 5,400-4,900 cal yr BP. This abrupt monsoon failure has been detected in various paleoclimatic records from monsoonal regions. Anomalous summer monsoon intensity during 5,400-4,900 cal yr BP is probably driven by solar variability, ENSO activity and ice-rafting events in the North Atlantic. Over the past 1,500 years, with the growing population and progress in production technology, human activity has increasingly become the dominant factor controlling the natural environment of Hainan Island.

Influence of the Hyporheic Zone on Supersaturated Gas Exposure to Incubating Chum Salmon	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Hydroelectric dam operation causes total dissolved gas (TDG) to be seasonally elevated in the lower Columbia River, as surface water concentrations approach 120%. Federally protected chum salmon Oncorhynchus keta embryos incubating in nearby spawning areas could be affected if depth-compensated TDG concentrations within the hyporheic zone exceed 103%. The objective of this study was to determine whether TDG of the hyporheic zone in two chum salmon spawning areas-one in a side channel near Ives Island, Washington, and another on the main-stem Columbia River near Multnomah Falls, Oregon-was affected by the elevated TDG of the surface water. Depth-compensated hyporheic TDG did not exceed 103% at the Multnomah Falls site. However, in the Ives Island area, chum salmon redds were exposed to TDG greater than 103% for more than 300 h. In response to river depth fluctuations, TDG varied significantly in the Ives Island area, suggesting increased interaction between the hyporheic zone and surface water at that site. We conclude from this study that the interaction between surface water and the hyporheic zone affects the concentration of TDG within the hyporheic zone directly via physical mixing and indirectly by altering water chemistry and thus dissolved gas solubility. Consideration of these interactions is important when estimating TDG exposure within egg pocket environments and will enable resource managers to optimize recovery strategies.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				DEC	2009	29	6					1714	1727		10.1577/M08-212.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M08-212.1													WOS:000277113800019

Here we analyzed the overwintering behavior of the European catfish, Silurus glanis Linnaeus, 1758, the largest freshwater fish in Europe. By tracking 47 subadults and adults in a shallow lake in southeastern France, we reported a consistent aggregative behavior across four successive winters. By implementing time series analysis and Cox proportional hazard models, we investigated the dynamics of these aggregations (formation, stability, dislocation), and the factors that govern it, whether external (temperature, time of the day) or specific to the fish (size, key individuals). These aggregations lasted 1.5-2 months and mainly took place in a single small 4 m-deep area whose environmental conditions (temperature, oxygen, substrate) did not differ from other parts of the lake. In some periods during winter, all tagged fish were aggregated, which suggests that a large proportion of the lake population gathered there. Low temperatures (below 9 degrees C) triggered the formation of aggregations. They became more stable with decreasing temperatures, while individuals more frequently left the aggregation, preferentially at dusk and at night, when temperatures increased. The largest individuals swam more frequently back and forth to the aggregation. Irrespective of their size, some individuals consistently arrived earlier in the aggregation in winter and left later. This predictable seasonal grouping of individuals and, more generally, the knowledge provided by such studies on how species use space have important operational value and are useful for species conservation as well as for species control.					; Fourcassié, Vincent/AAJ-9016-2020; westrelin, samuel/JEO-8076-2023	Fourcassie, Vincent/0000-0002-3605-6351; 													2051-3933					FEB 7	2023	11	1							9	10.1186/s40462-023-00373-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40462-023-00373-6								36750882					WOS:000929026700001
J	STAHL, JB				STAHL, JB			A 6-YEAR STUDY OF ABUNDANCE AND VOLTINISM OF CHIRONOMIDAE (DIPTERA) IN AN ILLINOIS COOLING RESERVOIR	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The chironomid fauna of Bladwin Lake, an off-stream closed-cycle cooling reservoir for an 1800-megawatt coal-fired power plant, was sampled semi-monthly at four stations for six yeas, beginning five months after the reservoir was filled and ending 23 months after the third unit of the power plant went into operation. In the main basin three species dominated: Coelotanypus concinnus (Coquillett), Procladius bellus (Loew), and Tanypus stellatus Coquillett. The last did not become established until the lake was two years old, probably because temperatures were too low the first winter. Populations of all three species were initially large and sharply fluctuating, but later became smaller and less fluctuant in C. concinnus and P. bellus, due, probably, to more intense predation on them. Only in T. stellatus were changes in voltinism clearly evident: it changed from bivoltine to tri- and quatrivoltine as degree-days of heat increased. Photoperiod also affected its life cycle, as evidenced by synchronous development of summer generations each year. Temperature and perhaps food supply affected development time of its overwintering generation. All three species tolerated a temperature of 38.degree. C; their populations were kept low in the discharge channel by the current, not the temperature. Six species of Chironominae were sporadically abundant in the discharge channel.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR 10	1986	134	1					67	79		10.1007/BF00008700	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008700													WOS:A1986C072700007
J	Rouse, WR; Lafleur, PM; Griffis, TJ				Rouse, WR; Lafleur, PM; Griffis, TJ			Controls on energy and carbon fluxes from select high-latitude terrestrial surfaces	PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												While the physical processes driving energy fluxes in the high latitudes are universal, some of the controlling factors such as permafrost, temperature, and vegetation play a special role. Annual net radiation at Arctic treeline is larger over subarctic forest than over tundra as a result of smaller albedo during the snow-cover period. The absorbed solar radiation is notably larger in late winter. During the snow-free period, in well-watered areas, there is a hierarchy in potential evaporation from very high rates for shallow tundra lakes and ponds to low rates for well-drained upland heath terrain. With abundant moisture and warm conditions, open coniferous forests, dwarf deciduous forests, and sedge fens have similar energy and water balances. During the growing season when moisture is limiting, a sedge fen, more so than a coniferous forest, curtails its evaporation rate. Under cold conditions, however, coniferous forest has the smaller evaporation. Soil heat fluxes in summer comprise from 10% to 15% of the net radiation and are fairly uniform both temporally and spatially. The carbon budget of peatlands, which are major global repositories of carbon, responds strongly to air and soil temperatures and to the water balance. Warm and wet conditions support strong photosynthesis and a substantial methane flux. Warm and dry conditions favor strong respiration carbon losses from plants and soil. In a 2 x CO(2) world, substantial changes in temperature, precipitation, and energy and water balances are anticipated and these will drive substantial changes in the high-latitude carbon budget.					; Griffis, Timothy/A-5707-2011	Griffis, Timothy/0000-0002-2111-5144; 													0272-3646					JUL-AUG	2000	21	4					345	367		10.1080/02723646.2000.10642714	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02723646.2000.10642714													WOS:000166731000005
J	MADENJIAN, CP; JOHNSON, BM; CARPENTER, SR				MADENJIAN, CP; JOHNSON, BM; CARPENTER, SR			STOCKING STRATEGIES FOR FINGERLING WALLEYES - AN INDIVIDUAL-BASED MODEL APPROACH	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												The success of any program for stocking walleye (Stizostedion vitreum vitreum) fingerlings is strongly dependent on growth of the stocked fish during the summer and early fall months immediately following their release into lakes, reservoirs, or rivers. An individual-based model (IBM) was developed to describe growth of young-of-the-year (YOY) walleyes in Lake Mendota (Wisconsin, USA). The IBM was used to evaluate stocking strategies for walleye fingerlings. According to the rules of this simulation model, predation by a walleye would occur only if the walleye was sufficiently large relative to the prey individual. The length-frequency distribution of the YOY walleye population at the end of the 1989 growing season was predicted accurately by the model. During 1989, walleye fingerlings with a mean total length of 50 mm were stocked into Lake Mendota on 28 June. Simulations were performed to investigate the effects of the size of stocked fingerlings and the timing of stocking on subsequent YOY walleye growth. These simulations revealed that if walleye fingerlings were stocked on 28 June, at an average total length of 60 mm rather than 50 mm, then the proportion of large (total length of greater-than-or-equal-to 175 mm) fish in the YOY walleye population at the end of the growing season would have increased threefold over the observed proportion. Economic cost per large walleye was minimized when average total length at stocking was 62 mm. Stocking 50-mm walleye fingerlings on 14 June instead of 28 June resulted in a tripling of the percentage of large walleyes at the end of the growing season.

J	POSAMENTIER, HW; ALLEN, GP; JAMES, DP				POSAMENTIER, HW; ALLEN, GP; JAMES, DP			HIGH-RESOLUTION SEQUENCE STRATIGRAPHY - THE EAST COULEE DELTA, ALBERTA	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY PETROLOGY												The fundamental concept on which sequence stratigraphy is based is that stratal architectures develop in response to the interaction between base-level change and sediment flux. A small lacustrine fan-delta at East Coulee, Alberta, illustrates these principles and demonstrates that sequence stratigraphic concepts are scale- and time-independent. This fan-delta formed in a matter of days in a roadside drainage ditch as water level rose and then fell. Changes in the subaqueous space available for sediment to fill (i.e., accommodation) resulted in the development of a succession of systems tracts analogous to those formed within sedimentary basins over much longer time frames. Deposition began during lake-level rise with progradation of a fan-deltaic wedge. Accelerating lake-level rise resulted in a back-stepping of the shoreline and deposition of a transgressive systems tract. Subsequent lake-level fall resulted in subaerial exposure of the relatively steep delta front and caused incised valley formation and deposition of a lowstand delta. This stratigraphic response to base-level fall is typical of lowstand systems tract development on basin margins characterized by high-relief slopes (e.g., passive margins). Further lake-level fall resulted in minor additional valley incision and development of a second lowstand delta on a surface characterized by lower relief as lowering water level exposed a flatter physiography. This development of lowstand deltas and coastlines during base-level fall constitutes a forced regression of Posamentier et al. (1990) and is typical of lowstand systems tracts on basin margins characterized by gentle slopes. In spite of its small size, this example clearly illustrates that sequence stratigraphic principles apply to lacustrine as well as marine settings and at all spatial and temporal scales.																			0022-4472					MAR	1992	62	2					310	317																WOS:A1992HT10800012

An initial step toward global spaceborne falling snow algorithms for current and future missions includes determining the thresholds of detection for various active and passive sensor channel configurations and falling snow events over land surfaces and lakes. In this paper, cloud resolving model simulations of lake effect and synoptic snow events were used to determine the minimum amount of snow (threshold) that could be detected by the following instruments: the W-band radar of CloudSat, Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) Ku- and Ka-bands, and the GPM Microwave Imager. Eleven different nonspherical snowflake shapes were used in the analysis. Notable results include the following: 1) The W-band radar has detection thresholds more than an order of magnitude lower than the future GPM radars; 2) the cloud structure macrophysics influences the thresholds of detection for passive channels (e.g., snow events with larger ice water paths and thicker clouds are easier to detect); 3) the snowflake microphysics (mainly shape and density) plays a large role in the detection threshold for active and passive instruments; 4) with reasonable assumptions, the passive 166-GHz channel has detection threshold values comparable to those of the GPM DPR Ku- and Ka-band radars with similar to 0.05 g . m(-3) detected at the surface, or an similar to 0.5-1.0-mm . h(-1) melted snow rate. This paper provides information on the light snowfall events missed by the sensors and not captured in global estimates.

Feeding strategies of Atherina boyeri (Risso 1810) in a freshwater ecosystem	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												This study investigates the adaptation of certain feeding strategies by a population of Atherina boyeri inhabiting a freshwater ecosystem (Lake Trichonis, Greece) and links feeding habits with ecosystem interactions, using stomach content analysis and food availability. The use of Ivlev's electivity index (E) revealed the selection of different prey categories in respect to size, species and even gender. A. boyeri showed positive selection for larger zooplankters such as adult copepods and the egg-bearing females of Eudiaptomus drieschi (0.53 <E <0.92 and 0.24 < E <0.99, respectively) or the cladocerans Diaphanosoma orghidani and Daphnia cucullata (0.25 < E < 0.53 and 0.23 < E < 0.37, respectively) in spring and/or summer. In contrast, the fish totally avoided rotifers and copepod nauplii, while showing negative selection for smaller prey items like copepodites (-1.00 E < -0.14). A shift to larger prey was recorded as age increased. Larger specimens showed cannibalistic behaviour by consuming larvae of A. boyeri and the endemic, threatened, fish Economidichthys trichonis. The results provide certain indications that, through selective predation, A. boyeri is able to affect zooplankton abundance and community composition, the vertical distribution and migration of crustaceans and the abundance of other fish species, However, more research on the dynamics and feeding ecology of A. boyeri and other fish species is necessary.

This study is an attempt to estimate the daily patterns of nutrients transport in the catchment reservoir systems through the application of the ensemble of complementary models SWAT-SALMO. SWAT quantifies flow, nitrate and phosphate loadings originating in catchments before entering downstream reservoirs meanwhile SALMO determines phosphate, nitrate, and chlorophyll-a concentrations within the reservoirs. The study applies to the semi-arid Millbrook catchment-reservoir system that supplies drinking water to north-eastern suburbs of Adelaide, South Australia. The catchment hosts viti-and horticultural land uses. The warm-monomictic, mesotrophic reservoir is artificially aerated in summer. After validating the simulation results for both Millbrook catchment and reservoir, a comprehensive scenario analysis has been conducted to reveal cascading effects of altered management practices, land uses and climate conditions on water quality in the reservoir. Results suggest that the effect on reservoir condition in summer would be severe, most likely resulting in chlorophyll-a concentrations of greater than 40 mu g/l if the artificial destratification was not applied from early summer. A 50% curbing of water diversion from an external pipeline to the catchment will slightly limit chlorophyll-a concentrations by 1.22% as an effect of reduced inflow phosphate loads. The simulation of prospective land use scenarios converting 50% of present pasture in the Millbrook catchment into residential and orchards areas indicates an increase of summer chlorophyll-a concentrations by 9.5-107.9%, respectively in the reservoir. Global warming scenarios based on the high emission simulated by SWAT-SALMO did result in earlier growth of chlorophyll-a but overall the effects on water quality in the Millbrook reservoir was not significant. However scenarios combining global warming and land use changes resulted in significant eutrophication effects in the reservoir, especially in the unmanaged condition with stratification in summer. This study has demonstrated that complementary model ensembles like SWAT SALMO allow to comprehend more realistically cascading effects of distinct catchment processes on internal reservoir's processes, and facilitate integrated management scenarios.

In a second-order partially shaded stream and in a fourth-order unshaded river, C-13/C-12 ratios of autochthonous and allochthonous food sources were distinct, allowing the use of isotopic mixing equations to calculate the relative contribution of both sources to consumer biomasses. In a small shaded lake outlet, isotopic compositions of autochthonous and allochthonous carbon were similar but distinct from that of lake seston which was relatively C-13 depleted. The mixing model for the lake outlet thus discriminated between feeding on lake-derived food and on combined autochthonous and allochthonous food sources. Percent food utilization calculated for each invertebrate taxon by a site-specific mixing equation was weighted by biomass data to define the food bases of primary consumer communities. The food base was clearly dominated by lacustrine inputs (which represented >80% of the total food base) in the lake outlet, by allochthonous inputs (almost-equal-to 75%) in the second-order site, and by autochthonous production (almost-equal-to 60%) in the fourth-order site.

Salim			Bioaccumulation of heavy metals in water and mollusks in the Karnafully estuary: Potential human health risk and environmental contamination	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												This study investigates the bioaccumulation of heavy metals lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), and chromium (Cr) in water and mollusks across the Karnafully River estuaryof Bangladesh. Samples were collected from six different sites encompassing diverse ecological conditions over three seasons: monsoon, post-monsoon, and winter. Six mollusk species were analyzed using atomic absorption spectrophotometry to quantify metal concentrations in both tissues and shells. These species are Neritina violocea, Neritina sulculosa, Telescopium telescopium, Cerithida ecingulata, Corbicula fluminea, and Bellamya bengalesis. . The Chaktai canal site had the highest concentration of Cu (13.99+0.92 +0.92 mg/kg) from the mussel species B. Bengalesis during monsoon season, which was higher than the tolerable limit for human. The the lowest concentration of Cu (1.13+0.76 +0.76 mg/kg) from the composite mussel species N. sulculosa were fround from the 15 No. Jetty site in winter.. . The highest concentration of Cr was found at the Marine Academy site (0.54+0.24 +0.24 mg/kg) during the post-monsoon period from the mussel species N. violocea, , while the lowest concentration was found near the Karnafully Bridge (0.05+0.02 +0.02 mg/ kg) during the monsoon from the mussel species Cerithidea cingulata. . The highest concentration of Cd was observed in the Chaktai canal site (0.77+0.04 +0.04 mg/kg) during the winter from the B. bengalesis, and the lowest concentration was recorded in the Karnafully Bridge (0.33+0.06 +0.06 mg/kg) site during the winter season from the Cerithidae cingulata species. The highest amount of Pb was found in Chaktai canal site (0.32+0.06 +0.06 mg/kg) during the monsoon season in B. . bengalesis fuana. The lowest amount was found in Karnafully Bridge (0.09+0.02 +0.02 mg/ kg) in the Cerithidae cingulate species at the same time. The results suggested that the possibility of the occurrence of acute toxicities of Cu, Cr, Cd and Pb was unlikely except for the mussel of T. telescopium in the Marine Academy that indicates heavy metals presence at the Marine Academy site. The study revealed that the average concentrations of the heavy metals were in the order of Cu>Cd>Cr>Pb in the monsoon, postmonsoon, and winter seasons. The principal Component Analysis (PCA) highlighted distinct seasonal patterns in metal accumulation, underscoring the need for seasonal-specific monitoring and management strategies in estuarine ecosystems.

Brook trout were associated closely with the lake bottom. Small fish were most abundant in shallow waters, larger ones tended to be in deep water. Kokanee were found in all depths except in midsummer when they were largely associated with the bottom. Through-out the summer, kokanee were most abundant in deeper waters of the lake. Food studies suggest that kokanee and brook trout may have extensively used foods in common. There was evidence that higher fishing mortalities occurred among kokanee than brook trout.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1967	96	3					308	+		10.1577/1548-8659(1967)96[308:SDAFOK]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1967)96[308:SDAFOK]2.0.CO;2													WOS:A19679674800009

Chemical Composition of Waters and the Phytoplankton of the Lakes Within the Delta of the Selenga River	GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES												Field observations showed that the characteristics of chemical composition of waters and the development of plankton algae in the lakes within the delta of the Selenga river are determined by their flowage. The most open Lake Nekipelovskoe communicates with the Selenga outlets throughout a year, and Lake Zavernyaikha only at the period of an open channel. Lake Semenovskoe and Lake Khlystov Zaton are located in the islands and are isolated from the outlets. According to composition of main ions, the lakes under investigation refer to the hydrocarbonate class, the calcium group. The sum of ions in the water of Lake Nekipelovskoe approaches the one in the Selenga (86-221 mg/dm(3)), and the highest sums of ions were recorded in the wintertime in the lakes isolated from the outlets (446-743 mg/dm(3)). The lakes of the delta are characterized by a high trophicity. The maximum concentrations of total phosphorus in Lake Nekipelovskoe and Lake Zavernyaikha were 68 and 122 mu g P/dm(3), and in Lake Semenovskoe and Lake Khlystov Zaton -0.8 and -0.63 mu g P/dm(3), respectively. The most intense development of algae is observed in Lake Zavernyaikha, which is due to the high population of Baikal endemics. Lake Zavernyaikha showed a close negative correlation between the concentration of NO3-, mineral phosphorus and phytoplankton biomass; the correlation coefficient was -0.8 and -0.63, respectively. The lakes exhibited increased contents readily hydrolysable organic matter, and a decrease in dissolved oxygen concentration in winter; hydrogen sulfide was repeatedly recorded in Lake Khlystov Zaton. The water quality in the lakes during the springtime varies from "quite clean" to "weakly polluted"; at low-water periods, especially in winters, it can drop to the category of "exceedingly dirty". The water quality of the Selenga can be influenced by the lakes during spring floods when material accumulated during the wintertime is transported to the river outlets and further to Lake Baikal.

Unravelling the microbial role in ooid formation -: results of an in situ experiment in modern freshwater Lake Geneva in Switzerland	GEOBIOLOGY												The microbial role in the formation of the cortex of low-Mg calcite freshwater ooids in western part of Lake Geneva in Switzerland has been suggested previously, but not demonstrated conclusively. Early work mostly concentrated in hypersaline milieus, and hence little is known about their genesis in freshwater environments. We designed an in situ experiment to mimic the natural process of low-Mg calcite precipitation. A special device was placed in the ooid-rich bank of the lake. It contained frosted glass (SiO2) slides, while quartz (SiO2) is the most abundant mineral composition of ooid nuclei that acted as artificial substrates to favour microbial colonization. Microscopic inspection of the slides revealed a clear seasonal pattern of carbonate precipitates, which were always closely associated with biofilms that developed on the surface of the frosted slides containing extracellular polymeric substance, coccoid and filamentous cyanobacteria, diatoms and heterotrophic bacteria. Carbonate precipitation peaks during early spring and late summer, and low-Mg calcite crystals mostly occur in close association with filamentous and coccoid cyanobacteria (e.g. Tolypothrix, Oscillatoria and Synechococcus, Anacystis, respectively). Further scanning electron microscope inspection of the samples revealed low-Mg calcite with crystal forms varying from anhedral to euhedral rhombohedra, depending on the seasons. Liquid cultures corroborate the in situ observations and demonstrate that under the same physicochemical conditions the absence of biofilms prevents the precipitation of low-Mg calcite crystals. These results illustrate that biofilms play a substantial role in low-Mg calcite ooid cortex formation. It further demonstrates the involvement of microbes in the early stages of ooid development. Combined with ongoing microbial cultures under laboratory-controlled conditions, the outcome of our investigation favoured the hypothesis of external microbial precipitation of low-Mg calcite as the main mechanism involved in the early stage of ooid formation in freshwater Lake Geneva.					; Ariztegui, Daniel/AFU-2302-2022	Ariztegui, Daniel/0000-0001-7775-5127; Rossana, Martini/0000-0002-0674-863X													1472-4677	1472-4669				SEP	2008	6	4					341	350		10.1111/j.1472-4669.2007.00140.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-4669.2007.00140.x													WOS:000258256700002

J	Elo, AR				Elo, Aija-Riitta			Long-term modelling of winter ice periods for morphologically different lakes	NORDIC HYDROLOGY												Winter ice cover can be related to the temperature of air, but morphological and meteorological differences cause large variations. Physically based modelling help their study, as results can be controlled and verified. A lot of data is needed, and in the process liability and interpretation of data are important. In this study long series of data are used to study winter ice coverage of morphologically different lakes in Southern Finland. Physical factors in the vertically resolving lake model, the Probe model, were considered. The ice model is based on the use of the temperature of air and it is successful in describing regular ice formation and break-up. Suitability for individual lakes could be improved by changing the factors for melting, the wind limit for breaking the ice and the temperature limit for determining ice coverage. Depth delays and mixing increases cooling of water. For freezing date, the differences between lakes are about one month. Ice break-up is strongly determined by air temperature, but the model can help to relate differences to morphology. During warmer winters horizontal variations have more importance; there can also be periods of partial ice-cover. For further study of those the model should be developed; modelling over years in succession is then a necessity.																			0029-1277						2006	37	2					107	119		10.2166/nh.2006.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/nh.2006.002													WOS:000237656300002

Estimating sampling effort for early detection of non-indigenous benthic species in the Toledo Harbor Region of Lake Erie	MANAGEMENT OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Toledo Harbor (Maumee River and Maumee Bay) is a "port of concern" for introduction of non-indigenous species into the Great Lakes due to the large amounts of ballast water from outside the Great Lakes discharged at the port, the amenable habitat for many potential invasives, and the large amount of ballast water transported from Toledo to other Great Lakes ports, making Toledo a potential source of invasives throughout the entire region. To estimate sampling intensity needed to detect rare or new non-indigenous species, 27 benthic grab samples from 13 locations near Toledo Harbor were collected during autumn, 2010. Benthic organisms were identified, and sampling intensity needed to detect rare or new non-indigenous species was evaluated via a Chao asymptotic richness estimator. Morphological taxonomic criteria and cytochrome oxidase I (COI) sequence barcodes identified 29 different taxa (20 to species level) in the samples, including six non-indigenous taxa (Branchiura sowerbyi, Bithynia tentaculata, Corbicula fluminea, Dreissena polymorpha, Dreissena bugensis, Lipiniella sp.). While all the non-indigenous species had previously been reported in Lake Erie or nearby Ohio waters, several North American species are not previously listed in Ohio. Richness estimates indicate that > 75% of the benthic species in the area were encountered and that 90% of the species could be detected with less than a doubling of collecting effort. Since sampling for this study occurred only in the autumn and detectable life stages of benthic organisms may vary seasonally, additional species may be observed with more extensive sampling over a broader seasonal range.

We selected 55 lakes in the Eastern Alps along an altitudinal gradient [214-2,532 m above sea level (a.s.l.)] to model the isotopic signal of surface water dependent on intrinsic (lake geomorphometry) and extrinsic (air temperature, precipitation) factors. Ordinary and generalised least squared regression were used for statistical analysis. The isotope signal of lake water was lower in spring than in summer and decreased with altitude (-0.21 delta O-18 aEuro degrees/100 m; -1.5 delta H-2 aEuro degrees/100 m). This pattern largely depended on temperature and a pseudo-latitude effect. The isotopic signal in monthly precipitation (12 stations; altitudinal gradient 90-2,730 m a.s.l.) generally showed the expected pattern of less enriched values with altitude; however, unusual values were related to weather anomalies. The local meteoric water line was similar to the global meteoric water line as shown by overlapping confidence intervals. By discriminating different elevational bands, we could show that high elevation lakes (> 1,500 m a.s.l.) experience different patterns of evaporation with respect to low elevation lakes (< 1,500 m a.s.l.). Our study showed that lakes have a unique isotopic fingerprint along an altitudinal gradient, potentially useful for tracing ecological processes and for paleoclimatic studies.

Three formulations of malathion were evaluated in the field tests: 1)Fyfanon(R) ULV (95% malathion); 2) Mix (95% malathion + 0.5% natural pyrethrum + 2.5% piperonyl butoxide); and 3) Ready To Use (RTU) 4606 (95% malathion + 1.0% unsynergized natural pyrethrum). Significantly greater mortality (p<0.05) was observed in the Denham Springs strain at 1, 12, and 24 hr post-treatment for all formulations as compared with the Lake Charles strain. With the exception of the 24 hrs posttreatment for the Denham Springs strain, the Mix formulation provided significantly greater (p<0.05) adult control at all post-treatment evaluation periods for both mosquito strains. At 24 hrs post-treatment for the Denham Springs strain, Fyfanon provided as effective control as the Mix formulation (93% and 95%, respectively). No test formulation provided effective control beyond 30.5 m from the spray route. Although initial knockdown was poor, malathion and the Mix formulations did provide excellent control at 24 hrs post-treatment.																			0147-1724	2162-2647				DEC	1997	22	4					449	452																WOS:000073960900008
J	Welc, F; Milecka, K; Marks, L				Welc, Fabian; Milecka, Krystyna; Marks, Leszek			Earliest cereal cultivation in Egypt recorded in the Faiyum Oasis lake deposits and its palaeoclimatic context	GEOLOGICAL QUARTERLY												We determine the beginning of the Neolithic farming in northern Egypt, based on analysis of core FA-1 of lake deposits in the Faiyum Oasis in north ern Egypt. Regular lamination of the early Middle Holocene lake deposits, supported by radiocarbon dating and pollen analysis, indicates the earliest occurrence of domesticated cereals at similar to 7.8 cal ka BP in this region. The appearance of cereals in the Faiyum region was possible due to fundamental restructuring of regional climatic conditions caused by the changing atmospheric circulation in the eastern Mediterranean region. Stronger northwestern winds were accompanied by in creased precipitation in winter and enabled 3 farming phases in the Faiyum Oasis at 7.8-7.6, 7.4-7.2 and 7.0-6.8 cal ka BP, separated by arid episodes with predominant southern winds. Most probably, cereal cultivation concentrated inside local wadis to the north of the lake and was rain fall-dependent. Therefore, early Egyptian farming did not develop based on irrigation systems as commonly thought, but was rain-fed, this being possible due to marked climate change at the beginning of the Middle Holocene.

One day after treatment, bacterioplankton numbers in the enclosures treated with the microbial product, Aqua-5(TM) were significantly augmented relative to the non-treated control, 9,300 and 2,200 cells ml(-1), respectively. Three days after treatment, bacterioplankton numbers increased in the diquat treatments to 78,000 cells ml(-1) and submersed macrophytes appeared necrotic and showed signs of decomposition. Copper sulfate and diquat treatments significantly affected phytoplankton, macroalgae, submersed macrophytes and zooplankton, but applications of the microbial products Aqua-5(TM), BactaPur(TM), LakePak(TM) WSP(R) at recommended rates did not significantly affect those water quality variables. Sediment bacteria were not significantly affected by any of the treatments. Under these experimental conditions, bacterial augmentation with the products Aqua-5(TM), BactaPur(TM) and LakePak(TM) WSP(R) did not significantly reduce planktonic algae growth. These results provide no indication that inoculations of lakes and ponds with commercial preparations of the bacteria tested reduce algal growth.																			0146-6623					JUL	2001	39						99	106																WOS:000175863800002

This effect is a result of the natural land cover being replaced with impermeable surfaces like buildings, roads, and pavements, which absorb and hold onto heat more. As a result, metropolitan regions frequently experience substantially hotter temperatures than their nearby rural counterparts, especially during heat waves. This arises partly due to reduction in Actual Evapotranspiration (AET). AET and LST have a close relationship. AET rates are greatly influenced by the amount of vegetation and their transpiration capacity, which in turn can have an influence on LST in urban regions. The type of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) has a significant impact on how LST affects the interchange of energy between the earth's surface and the atmosphere. Vegetation AET has a huge potential to reduce both temperatures. The temperature of a water body is lower than that of the nearby urban. The objective of this research is to determine the variation in AET and LST with regards to varying types of land cover by finding correlation between them. The spatio-temporal analysis is done for the summer and winter season of 2020. The correlation is studied between LST and AET for each land cover class and for both seasons for 2020 and results are plotted. The green areas and lakes of the city showed a higher AET and lower LST, whereas the built environment behaved in just the opposite manner. It can be inferred that it is essential to comprehend the local context to effectively determine the relationship between LST and AET in a particular scenario.					; Jain, Kamal/ABH-4318-2020; Kushwaha, sunni kanta prasad/ABE-1414-2021; Singh, Srashti/ABA-3556-2022	Singh, Srashti/0000-0003-0667-245X; 													1682-1750	2194-9034					2023							1569	1574		10.5194/isprs-archives-XLVIII-1-W2-2023-1569-2023	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-XLVIII-1-W2-2023-1569-2023													WOS:001185682000216

They are also sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances and are globally threatened. Understanding how flow regime drives the spatiotemporal dynamics of wetland habitats is fundamental to effective conservation practices. In this study, using Landsat imagery and the random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm, we mapped the winter distribution of four wetland habitats (i.e., Carex meadow, reedbed, mudflat, and shallow water) in East Dongting Lake, a Ramsar wetland in the middle to lower Yangtze Basin of China, for 34 years (1988-2021). The dynamics of wetland habitats were explored through pixel-by-pixel comparisons. Further, the response of wetland habitats to flow regime variations was investigated using generalized additive mixed models (GAMM). Our results demonstrated the constant expansion of reedbeds and shrinkage of mudflats, and that there were three processes contributing to the reduction in mudflat: (1) permanent replacement by reedbed; (2) irreversible loss to water; and (3) transitional swapping with Carex meadow. These changes in the relative extent of wetland habitats may degrade the conservation function of the Ramsar wetland. Moreover, the duration of the dry season and the date of water level withdrawal were identified as the key flow regime parameters shaping the size of wetland habitats. However, different wetland vegetation showed distinct responses to variations in flow regime: while Carex meadow increased with earlier water withdrawal and a longer dry season, reedbed continuously expanded independent of the flow regime corresponding to the increase in winter rainfall. Our findings suggested that flow regime acts in concert with other factors, such as climate change and sand mining in river channels, driving wetland habitat transition in a floodplain landscape. Therefore, effective conservation can only be achieved through diverse restoration strategies addressing all drivers.					; ZENG, Qing/V-9563-2019; Liu, Peizhong/IQS-0884-2023; Guangchun, Lei/ABC-8081-2021	Fan, Rong/0000-0002-9497-8274; WEN, LI/0000-0003-3783-3826; 														2072-4292				MAY 17	2023	15	10							2614	10.3390/rs15102614	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15102614													WOS:000996653000001

Sensitivity of the Simulated Kingston Basin-Lake Ontario Summer Temperature Profile using FVCOM	ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN												Using an unstructured grid finite volume model (Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM)), numerical model simulations were generated and compared for the 2006 summer hydrography of the Lake Ontario-Kingston Basin system. Simulations are forced with surface forcing from two different sources: observations collected by Environment Canada and output generated by the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR). Simulated temperatures are compared with observations collected during the same time period to assess the viability of the NARR dataset as a source of long-term surface forcing fluxes. Root mean square errors for vertical temperature profiles, comparisons to lake surface temperatures, and Kingston Basin current observations, indicate that using NARR data to force an FVCOM model simulates the hydrography as well as simulations forced with in situ observations.																			0705-5900						2013	51	3					319	331		10.1080/07055900.2013.800017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07055900.2013.800017													WOS:000320925700007

Determination of microcystins in reservoirs of different basins in a semiarid area	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYCOLOGY												Intracellular benthic microcystins and microcystins dissolved in water were detected in seven reservoirs in the Segura and JA(0)car basins located in a semiarid area in the province of Alicante (SE, Spain). Three varieties of intracellular benthic microcystins were identified: Mc-LR, Mc-RR and Mc-YR. Generally, all the microcystin varieties were present in the same reservoir and Mc-LR, considered the most powerful carcinogen known, predominated in most of them. Total microcystins absolute values per dry weight varied from 0.055 mu g g(-1) in the Elx reservoir in summer to 1.032 mu g g(-1) in the Crevillent reservoir in spring. Microcystins dissolved in water were not frequent in the reservoirs and were detected in Guadalest throughout the year, with values of between 0.041 and 0.069 ppb. In the Crevillent reservoir, dissolved microcystins were recorded only in summer with 0.163 ppb and were not recorded in the other reservoirs in any season. The cyanobacterial presence varied throughout the year, but no significant difference was seen for interseasonal microcystins production (ANOVA, p > 0.1). The principal component analysis (PCA) and Pearson's correlation coefficient results showed that physico-chemical parameters did not significantly account for both intracellular and dissolved microcystins occurrence. Moreover, the PCA indicated that the evolution of the concentrations of dissolved and intracellular microcystins followed different patterns. The fact that benthic organisms could release intracellular toxins into water may be due to stress caused by changes in water levels and by colonies' senescence. However, they may also perform antigrazing and/or allelopatic functions. A significant difference was found for conductivity, phosphates and the presence of microcystins Mc-LR and Mc-Tot in the oligo- and eutrophic reservoirs (t test, p < 0.1 for all tests). In the reservoirs under study, microcystins production did not correlate with the high level of nutrients (t test, p > 0.1). In fact, microcystins were never detected in the more eutrophic reservoirs, e.g. Tibi and Beniarr,s, both of which correspond to the River JA(0)car basin. This fact indicates a significant difference for conductivity and the presence of microcystins Mc-RR (t test, p < 0.1) between the River Segura basin and that of the River JA(0)car. The identification of microcystins in benthic cyanobacteria from the less eutrophic semiarid studied reservoirs showed that hepatotoxin production was restricted to neither planktonic species nor the physico-chemical parameters considered typical for the occurrence of cyanobacterial toxins.

Climate-Driven Increases in Source Water Natural Organic Matter: Implications for the Sustainability of Drinking Water Treatment	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												This study presents an updated analysis spanning over two decades (1999-2023) of climate, water quality, and operational data from two drinking water facilities in Atlantic Canada that previously experienced gradual increases in the natural organic matter (NOM) concentration and brownification. The goal was to assess the impact of recent extreme weather events on acute NOM concentration increases and drinking water treatment processes. In 2023, a dry spring combined with a warm and wet summer caused NOM in the water supplies to increase by >67% (as measured by color). To mitigate increased NOM concentration, the alum dose nearly doubled in 2023 compared to that in 2022. Disinfection byproducts were elevated following the event but remained within the compliance levels. From 1999 to 2023, the two plants responded to gradual climate change impacts and brownification, with alum dose increases of between 4.1 and 8.3 times. Equivalent CO2 emissions were estimated for alum usage, which increased by 3 to 7-fold in 2023 compared to when the plants were commissioned decades prior. The plants were not only adversely impacted by climate change but also contributed to the global CO2 burden. Thus, a paradigm shift toward sustainable alternatives for NOM removal is required in the water sector, and climate change adaptation and mitigation principles are urgently needed.

J	Cao, JT; Rao, ZG; Shi, FX; Jia, GD				Cao, Jiantao; Rao, Zhiguo; Shi, Fuxi; Jia, Guodong			Ice formation on lake surfaces in winter causes warm-season bias of lacustrine brGDGT temperature estimates	BIOGEOSCIENCES												It has been frequently found that lacustrine branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGT)-derived temperatures are warm-season-biased relative to measured mean annual air temperature (AT) in the middle to high latitudes, the mechanism of which, however, is not very clear. Here, we investigated the brGDGTs from catchment soils, suspended particulate matter (SPM) and surface sediments in different water depths in Gonghai Lake in northern China to explore this question. Our results showed that the brGDGT distribution in sediments resembled that in the SPM but differed from the surrounding soils, suggesting a substantial aquatic origin of the brGDGTs in the lake. Moreover, the increase in brGDGT content and decrease in methylation index with water depth in sediments suggested more contribution of aquatic brGDGTs produced from deep or bottom waters. Therefore, established lake-specific calibrations were applied to estimate local mean annual AT. As usual, the estimates were significantly higher than the measured mean annual AT. However, they were similar to (and thus actually reflected) the mean annual lake water temperature (LWT). Interestingly, the mean annual LWT is close to the measured mean warm-season AT, thus suggesting that the apparent warm-season bias of lacustrine brGDGT-derived temperatures could be caused by the discrepancy between AT and LWT. In our study region, ice forms at the lake surface during winter, leading to isolation of the underlying lake water from air and hence higher LWT than AT, while LWT basically follows AT during warm seasons when ice disappears. Therefore, we think that lacustrine brGDGTs actually reflected the mean annual LWT, which is higher than the mean annual AT in our study location. Since the decoupling between LWT and AT in winter due to ice formation is a universal physical phenomenon in the middle to high latitudes, we propose this phenomenon could be also the reason for the widely observed warm-season bias of brGDGT-derived temperatures in other seasonally surface ice-forming lakes, especially in shallow lakes.

Our main findings were following: The river gorges, high mountain ranges bearing extensive dense vegetation, and stronger solar insolation characteristic of the lowest-latitude region may have functioned for an extended period as the essential geological settings for strongly drawing significant amounts of moisture from the Indian Ocean toward the region without passing through the Yarlung Zangbo basin. The combination of such geological settings specific to this region may have caused its earlier response to the climate amelioration after a cold/dry event, such as the Younger Dryas and Heinrich-1, compared to other regions on the Plateau. Furthermore, gorge-derived monsoon air masses that blew through the lowest-latitude region are highly likely to have more significantly influenced the onset of the climate amelioration after a cold/dry event even in the southwestern, south-central, and southeastern regions, rather than the Yarlung Zangbo-derived monsoon air masses. Therefore, this caused the subsequent expansion of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) over the Plateau. Thus, with its unique geological setting, the lowest-latitude region has presumably played a critical role as the key region, i.e. the initiator, for the early evolution of the ISM on the Tibetan Plateau by responding to climate amelioration after cold/dry events more rapidly than any other region and drawing gorge-derived monsoon air masses strongly toward the region.

Long-term discharge data from 28 unregulated catchments in western China were analysed, and the findings showed that winter discharge/minimum monthly discharge significantly increased (p <= 0.1) in 82/82%, 55/64%, and 0/0% of the catchments in the higher-latitude mountain permafrost regions (Tienshan Mountains), mid-latitude mountain permafrost regions (Qilian Mountains), and mid- to low-latitude plateau permafrost regions (the source regions of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers), respectively. The differences in permafrost type and the distribution of permafrost and alpine cold desert (which is similar to tundra) were found to be the main causes for the different responses in the low flows. The rate of change of low flows (winter discharge and minimum monthly discharge) was negatively and linearly correlated with permafrost coverage when coverage was less than 40% of the catchment area, whereas the low flows changed only slightly when the permafrost coverage exceeded 40%. A significant thickening of the active layer increased the low flows in the lower permafrost-covered catchments, which are dominated by warm permafrost. However, in the higher permafrost-covered catchments with cold permafrost and a cold climate, only an increase in permafrost temperature (without a notable thickening of the active layer) occurred, resulting in non-significant changes in low flows.					; Wang, Lei/A-7836-2018; Liu, Xiaojiao/LFK-3527-2024; Liu, Betty231#/L-7374-2019; Liu, JunFeng/HGD-7777-2022; Chen, Rensheng/AHE-0550-2022	Liu, Zhangwen/0000-0002-2791-9653; Yang, Yong/0000-0002-6124-6165; 													0885-6087	1099-1085				JAN 1	2019	33	1					66	75		10.1002/hyp.13311	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.13311													WOS:000453677200005

Qualitatively, these facilities are known to have impacts on the aquatic environment, and they can be inferred to have effects on Lake Sturgeon; however, few studies quantifying these effects are available. Our objectives were to (1) determine and compare the magnitude of effect (d) of hydroelectric facility operating regimes on Lake Sturgeon abundance; (2) compare Lake Sturgeon biological responses among river systems with different operating regimes in order to understand the potential limiting factors within these systems; and (3) assess the effectiveness of mitigation efforts where they have been employed. A standardized index netting program targeting juveniles and adults was conducted over two field seasons at 23 river sites across Ontario. The magnitude of effect on abundance (as indicated by d) was lowest in run-of-the-river systems and was considered large in peaking systems and winter reservoir systems. Relative abundance was significantly greater in unregulated rivers than in regulated rivers. Juvenile abundance was significantly greater in run-of-the-river systems than in peaking systems and winter reservoirs and was significantly greater in peaking systems than in winter reservoirs. Adult abundance did not significantly differ among operating regimes. Growth was faster and condition was significantly greater in unregulated systems than in regulated systems. Recruitment of Lake Sturgeon was highly variable in both regulated and unregulated systems, whereas recruitment failure was more evident in regulated systems, particularly in peaking systems.

J	Nüsslein, B; Conrad, R				Nüsslein, B; Conrad, R			Methane production in eutrophic Lake Plusssee: seasonal change, temperature effect and metabolic processes in the profundal sediment	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Rates of CH4 production in the profundal sediment of Lake PluBsee were higher during the summer than during fall, and fairly well explained the CH4 concentration that accumulated in the hypolymnion during summer stratification. Oxidation of CH4 at the oxycline played only a marginal role in the seasonal CH4 cycle. Although the sediment temperature (4 degreesC) did not change with season, CH4 production rates could be stimulated by incubation at increased temperature (25 degreesC). At both 4 degreesC and 25 degreesC, thermodynamic conditions in the sediment allowed exergonic production of CH4 from either acetate, H-2/CO2 or methanol. Inhibition of methanogenesis by 2-bromoethane sulfonic acid (BES) resulted in the accumulation of acetate, but was only detectable at 25 degreesC. Inhibition of acetoclastic methanogenesis by methyl fluoride resulted in partial inhibition of CH4 and was only detectable at 25 degreesC. Incorporation of radioactive bicarbonate into CH4 was also only detectable at 25 degreesC and then accounted for about 25-42% of total CH4 production. [2-C-14]acetate was converted to (CH4)-C-14 with turnover times of about 24 and 97h at 25 degreesC and 4 degreesC, respectively, but accounted for only 4-9% of total CH4 production. The turnover times of radioactive methanol were even larger (about 96 at 25 degreesC and 153 h at 4 degreesC) and accounted for <1% of total CH4 production. Hence, these processes could account for a larger percentage of CH4 production only if taking place in sediment microniches that did not fully equilibrate with the pore water. Production of CH4 at 25<degrees>C was stimulated by addition of pectin, acetate, methanol or H-2, but at 4 degreesC, it was only stimulated by H-2 The stable carbon isotopic composition of CH4 and CO2 in the water column and in incubated sediment slurries indicated that CH4 production was dominated by acetoclastic methanogenesis, with H-2/CO2-dependent methanogenesis contributing more at 25 degreesC than 4 degreesC. In conclusion, the data are consistent with the assumption that CH4 production at in-situ temperature (4 degreesC) was due to acetoclastic methanogenesis tightly coupled to acetate production, whereas it, was due to both acetoclastic and H-2/CO2-dependent methanogenesis at 25 degreesC. This assumption is also consistent with the observation that the sediment fermented added glucose or pectin to acetate as a major product.																			0003-9136					NOV	2000	149	4					597	623																WOS:000165691300005
J	Read, JL				Read, JL			Stranded on desert islands? Factors shaping animal populations in Lake Eyre South	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY LETTERS												Comparisons are made between the faunal communities of the Lake Lyre South islands and the mainland. The low species diversity on the islands is unlikely to result from lack of dispersal opportunities. Rather, a response to a series of ecological factors is implicated. The nature and size of the island habitats preclude some species, and the temporal dynamism of mound spring habitats limits the endemic spring biota. Competition or predation may have prohibited the establishment of other species. Suppression of predation upon painted dragons and house mice may have allowed these species to exist at very high densities. This supports other work which suggests that maintenance of high densities of the principal predator in an ecosystem may favour species which are preferentially hunted by secondary predators.

The lake includes two major basins that have similar area and volume, but different biological community structure, plankton assemblages, watershed area, and watershed development. Analyses were based on total phosphorus, particulate phosphorus, dissolved organic phosphorus, dissolved inorganic phosphorus, nitrate, calcium, chlorophyll a, silica, chloride, and pH, individually or in combinations. Total phosphorus, chlorophyll a, chloride, and particulate phosphorus were included in the first linear component indicating that these are probably the most important analytes in explaining the total variance of the data. In spring or summer, three or four components explained 86 or 84% of the total variance, respectively. Cluster analysis based on the major components or on the original variables indicated that there are distinct differences in water chemistry between the two major basins of the lake. The only long-term temporal pattern that could be detected by cluster analysis was an increase in chloride concentrations.

J	Loizeau, JL; Arpagaus, P; Mathieu, D; Dominik, J				Loizeau, JL; Arpagaus, P; Mathieu, D; Dominik, J			Recent and present sedimentary fluxes of heavy metals and radionuclides in oligotrophic Lake Annecy, France	JOURNAL DE PHYSIQUE IV					12th International Conference on Heavy Metals in the Environment	MAY 26-30, 2003	GRENOBLE, FRANCE	ISERE, Vill Grenoble, Grenoble Alpes, SHF Hydrotech, Alpexpo, AMSE, SUG, LGGE, Minist Affaires Etrangeres, Minist L Ecologie Dev Durable				The present study focuses on two aspects of heavy metals and radionuclide fluxes to lake Annecy: a long term. secular evolution by analysing dated sediment cores, and a short term, seasonal evolution through the analysis of settling particles collected by sediment traps. Compared to background values prior to 1900, sediment cores reveal a two-fold (Cd, Cu, Zn) to a four-fold (Pb) increase in heavy metal concentration after the 40s, and a smaller decrease after the 70s except for Cu, which does not decrease. Sediment traps moored from April 1998 to November 2000 record strong variations of particles (range: 0.5 - 6.1 g m(-2) d(-1)), organic matter (range 0.03 - 0.27 g m(-2) d(-1)) and carbonate fluxes (range: 0.2 - 4.9 g m(-2) d(-1)). The maximum fluxes are observed at the end of spring and summer, related to increased phytoplankton production. Mean annual heavy metal fluxes (0.014 mug.cm(-2).y(-1) for Cd, 1 mug.cm(-2). y(-1) for Ph and Cu and 2.8 mug.cm(-2).y(-1) for Zn) are lower than those recorded in the surface layers of the sediment cores. No relation has been observed between fluxes of heavy metal and of particles. Comparison of heavy metal fluxes in Lake Annecy with two other peri-alpine lakes show that this lake receive more Cu and Ph of anthropogenic origin, in spite of the sewage collector built around the lake.					; Loizeau, Jean-Luc/AAA-1165-2022; Dominik, Janusz/G-3707-2018	Loizeau, Jean-Luc/0000-0002-0611-0388; 													1155-4339					MAY	2003	107		2				789	792		10.1051/jp4:20030419	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/jp4:20030419													WOS:000183782500017

As these anthropogenic modifications have induced intensive algal blooms, the prediction of algal abundances has become an important issue for securing a source of drinking water and ecosystem stability. This study aimed to assess the changed river system in terms of chlorophyll a concentrations using artificial neural network (ANN) models trained for the pre-FMRRP period and tested for the post-FMRRP period in the middle reaches of such a river-reservoir system, and identify the descriptors that consistently affect algal dynamics. A total of 19 variables representing biweekly water-quality and meteo-hydrological data over 10 years were used to develop models based on different ANN algorithms. To identify the major descriptor to the algal dynamics, sensitivity analyses were performed. The best and most feasible model incorporating five parameters (wind velocity, conductivity, alkalinity, total nitrogen, and dam discharge) based on the topology of a probabilistic neural network with a smoothing parameter of 0.028 showed satisfactory results (R = 0.752, p < 0.01). Some mismatches were found in the post-FMRRP period, which may be due to a discrete event with a newly adapted over-wintering species and different causes of the summer growth of cyanobacteria owing to the river alteration. Based on the lowest sensitivity of dam discharge and the combination results of environmental management with total nitrogen, ANN modelling indicated that short-term water quality variables are persistent factors shaping algal dynamics.					정, 광석/ITT-0455-2023; Kim, Dong-Kyun/O-3813-2016; Jeong, Kwang-Seuk/O-6355-2014; Hong, Sungwon/K-2809-2019	Hong, Sungwon/0000-0002-2838-2464; Jeong, Kwang-Seuk/0000-0001-7721-4937; 													0304-3800	1872-7026				APR 24	2019	398						67	76		10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.02.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.02.003													WOS:000463124200006

The latter induces changes in the structure and availability of littoral habitats, thereby affecting fish that reproduce in the littoral zone. Recent increased water level fluctuations in Lake Kinneret, Israel, provided an opportunity to evaluate the impacts of those fluctuations on reproduction of fishes that spawn in the littoral zone. We assessed the use of inundated shore vegetation for reproduction by the common native cichlids, Sarotherodon galilaeus and Oreochromis aureus, in a series of field surveys of reproduction activity in littoral areas with and without inundated vegetation. The cichlids spawned in spring and early summer, when water levels are at their annual maximum and part of the shore vegetation is inundated. Spawning was always in water <2 m depth. Lagoon habitats constituted nesting "hotspots," with nest densities 3-fold higher than open-shore sites. At open-shore sites, significantly higher nest densities were found in areas with inundated vegetation than in plant-free areas. Juvenile cichlids were significantly more abundant in littoral zone habitats with inundated vegetation. These findings highlight the important role of inundated vegetation, particularly at low lake levels when lagoon habitats are dry. We recommend maintaining water levels that support the existence of lagoons and vegetated littoral habitats. When development of lakeshore vegetation is massive, we recommend selectively removing part of the vegetation to form narrow vegetation-free corridors. In addition, wherever possible the vegetation should be removed to form lagoon-type habitats. Our insights and recommendations are probably applicable to similar situations of seasonal destabilization of lake water levels elsewhere.

J	Tan, DB; Luo, TF; Zhao, DZ; Li, C				Tan De-bao; Luo Teng-fei; Zhao Deng-zhong; Li Chong			Carbon dioxide emissions from the Geheyan Reservoir over the Qingjiang River Basin, China	ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY												In recent years, researchers have given an increasing amount of attention to carbon matter interception and greenhouse gas emissions from large hydropower reservoirs. The Geheyan Reservoir was selected as a typical canyon case to carry out continuous measurements of greenhouse gas fluxes from March 2015 to February 2016. Carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes from the interface between the water and atmosphere were identified at the following sites: above the dam, upstream, in a tributary, in the drawdown area, and in a bay within the reservoir. Results indicated that average CO2 fluxes in Geheyan Reservoir were 55.69 + 66.33 mg m(-2) h(-1). Carbon dioxide emissions were lower in spring and summer when the water level frequently varied for flood control. In addition, CO2 fluxes were higher when water flowed slowly with relatively high water levels that remained stable continuously. On a spatial scale, CO2 emissions were lower in the drawdown area of the tributary and below the dam, while higher CO2 emissions occurred in the typical bay area where water velocity was very slow. Therefore, it can be concluded that a longer residence time and slower water velocity caused generally higher CO2 emissions from Geheyan Reservoir. The seasonal change of CO2 fluxes in the Yuxiakou backwater-area monitoring point was very stable no matter how the water level changed, but was higher than below the dam and in the drawdown area in most months. Temporal and spatial patterns of CO2 fluxes were significantly controlled by water temperature among all environmental variables for Geheyan Reservoir.

Sinninghe			Seasonal variability of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) in a temperate lake system	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Quantitative climate reconstructions are crucial for understanding the magnitude of and mechanisms behind natural and anthropogenic climate change, yet there are few proxies that can reliably reconstruct terrestrial temperature. Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) are bacterial membrane lipids that are increasingly used to reconstruct paleotemperature from lake sediments, but despite their potential, we have a poor understanding of (1) autochthonous vs. allochthonous sources of brGDGTs in lakes and (2) the seasonality of and environmental controls on brGDGT production within lakes. To investigate these factors, we examined water column suspended particulate matter (SPM) and settling particles from a sediment trap collected on a biweekly to monthly basis over a period of three years at Lower King Pond, a small kettle lake in northern Vermont, USA. We also compared the concentration and fractional abundances of brGDGTs in SPM and settling particles with those of catchment soils, river sediments, and lake surface sediments to constrain the relative importance of brGDGTs derived from the landscape versus brGDGTs produced within the lake itself. We find significant differences in concentrations and fractional abundances of brGDGTs between soil and river sediment samples from the catchment and lake sediments, indicating a mostly autochthonous source for lacustrine brGDGTs. BrGDGT concentrations, fluxes, and fractional abundances in SPM vary over the annual cycle, indicating that brGDGTs are produced throughout the year and respond to changes within the water column. The total annual flux of brGDGTs settling through the water column is comparable to the brGDGT accumulation rates in surface sediments, indicating that in this lake brGDGTs are mostly produced within the water column, not in the sediment itself. While brGDGTs are produced in all seasons within the water column, the flux to the sediments is highest during periods of spring and fall isothermal mixing, potentially biasing paleotemperature reconstructions towards mixing season temperature. Because the seasonal timing and frequency of lake mixing varies as a function of regional climate, lacustrine brGDGT calibrations should be regional in nature and comprise lakes with similar mixing regimes.

J	MacLennan, MM; Arnott, SE; Strecker, AL				MacLennan, Megan M.; Arnott, Shelley E.; Strecker, Angela L.			Differential sensitivity of planktonic trophic levels to extreme summer temperatures in boreal lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The stress-size hypothesis predicts that smaller organisms will be less sensitive to stress. Consequently, climate warming is expected to favour smaller taxa from lower trophic levels and smaller individuals within populations. To test these hypotheses, we surveyed zooplankton communities in 20 boreal lakes in Killarney Provincial Park, Canada during 2005 (an anomalously warm summer) and 2006 (a normal summer). Higher trophic levels had larger responses to warm temperatures supporting the stress-size hypothesis; however, rather than imposing negative effects, higher density and biomass were observed under warmer temperatures. As a result, larger taxa from higher trophic levels were disproportionately favoured with warming, precluding an expected shift towards smaller species. Proportionately greater increases in metabolic rates of larger organisms or altered biotic interactions (e. g. predation and competition) are possible explanations for shifts in biomass distribution. Warmer temperatures also favoured smaller individuals of the two most common species, in agreement with the stress-size hypothesis. Despite this, these populations had higher biomass in the warm summer. Therefore, reduced adult survivorship may have triggered these species to invest in reproduction over growth. Hence, warmer epilimnions, higher zooplankton biomass and smaller individuals within zooplankton populations may function as sensitive indicators of climate warming in boreal lakes.

J	Willén, E				Willén, E			Dominance patterns of planktonic algae in Swedish forest lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Dominance patterns of phytoplankton during a late phase ( August) in the seasonal sequence of species are presented from 15 Swedish forest lakes with little or no local anthropogenic impact. The main question to elucidate is if predominance of a small number of species (1 - 3) occurs during a mature phase of the annual succession i.e. if there is an evident competitive exclusion of species in favour of a few dominants. Ten August months per lake are used to illustrate interannual variations caused mainly by differences in weather conditions. In general, 1 - 3 dominant taxa do not reach more than 60% of the total phytoplankton volume. Only lakes exposed to some stress factors exhibit a more pronounced dominance pattern with 1 - 3 species occupying > 80% of the phytoplankton biomass. Stress factors are harsh climate ( arctic lake), light deficiency ( very brown water), acidification and occurrence of the invasive raphidophycean species Gonyostomum semen. The variation in phytoplankton assemblages in relation to environmental variables and years was tested by classification and ordination methods (TWINSPAN, CCA). The consistency of the species/lake groupings and the set of explanatory environmental variables was checked in a discriminant function analysis. Species associations during investigated years and environmental variables show a very good consistency and 75% of the lakes was classified in the same species group irrespective of year, indicating stable species assemblages from summer to summer.																			0018-8158					JUL	2003	502	1-3					315	324		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000004289.92343.39	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000004289.92343.39													WOS:000186636900024
